<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The Bible describes the sequence of events.<br><br>When we die, our soul departs our "sleeping" bodies and goes to be with<br>the Lord:<br><br>> So we are always of good courage. We know that while we are at home in<br>> the body we are away from the Lord, for we walk by faith, not by<br>> sight. Yes, we are of good courage, and we would rather be away from<br>> the body and at home with the Lord. \-- 2 Cor 5:6--8 ESV<br>><br>> I am hard pressed between the two. My desire is to depart and be with<br>> Christ, for that is far better. \-- Phil 1:23 ESV<br><br>But we are also told that, at the resurrection, we will receive<br>glorified bodies, our souls will be reunited with our new, perfected<br>bodies, and that will be our existence for eternity in the new heavens<br>and the new earth (cf Revelation 21--22).<br><br>But that's after the resurrection. What happens in the meantime?<br><br>When the soul departs the body, the Bible describes a sort of<br>"temporary" heaven and a "temporary" hell. The Bible describes the rich<br>man being tormented immediately after death:<br><br>> The poor man died and was carried by the angels to Abraham's side. The<br>> rich man also died and was buried, and in Hades, being in torment, he<br>> lifted up his eyes and saw Abraham far off and Lazarus at his side.<br>> And he called out, 'Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus<br>> to dip the end of his finger in water and cool my tongue, for I am in<br>> anguish in this flame.' \-- Luke 16:22--24 ESV<br><br>So the soul will go to that temporary place, a place of comfort or a<br>place of torment, until the resurrection. After the resurrection occurs<br>the judgement.<br><br>> And the sea gave up the dead who were in it, Death and Hades gave up<br>> the dead who were in them, and they were judged, each one of them,<br>> according to what they had done. \-- Revelation 20:13 ESV<br><br>The person will be judged, and in their new glorified bodies will either<br>go to the new earth, or the lake of fire. These two destinations are<br>final and eternal. People go to one or the other, based entirely on<br>whether they have trusted Jesus Christ for salvation:<br><br>> And these will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into<br>> eternal life." \-- Matthew 25:46 ESV<br>><br>> Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life; whoever does not obey<br>> the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God remains on him. \--<br>> John 3:36 ESV<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
