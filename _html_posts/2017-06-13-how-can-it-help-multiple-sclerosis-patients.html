<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>This is a fantastic question! I think that IT can help MS patients<br>immensely, and I think that IT as an industry has largely overlooked the<br>MS community.<br><br>The way to properly address how IT should do anything is to look at the<br>problem itself, and see if there is an IT solution that can improve it.<br><br>So what problems do MS patients face? There are quite a lot of them, but<br>some of the most common are:<br><br>- Fatigue<br>- Walking issues<br>- Numbness or tingling<br>- Spasticity<br>- Weakness<br>- Vision issues<br>- Dizziness or Vertigo<br>- Bladder/Bowel Problems<br>- Sexual dysfunction<br>- Pain<br>- Cognitive Changes<br>- Emotional Changes<br>- Depression<br><br>How would you use IT to help combat any of these issues? For example,<br>fatigue can be addressed using occupational therapy to simplify tasks at<br>home or at work. IT can most definitely be used in occupational therapy<br>to assist with simplification of tasks. Plenty of other items on this<br>list, like vision issues, cognitive changes, and walking (gait) issues<br>can also be aided through the appropriate use of technology. It's just a<br>matter of a developer believing that a significant enough market exists<br>to market a device or an application in order to bring the symptom and<br>the mitigating tech together.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
