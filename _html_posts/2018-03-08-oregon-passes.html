<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>It's going to make the Sheriffs in every county in the state very busy.<br><br>Because now, after every misdemeanor stalking conviction, or after every<br>DV conviction, a seizure warrant will be issued and delivered to the<br>Sheriff.<br><br>The Sheriff will have a specific time period (it's 24 hours in most<br>states, not sure what it is in OR) to get out to the residence and find<br>any and all firearms and confiscate them. Without breaking anything, of<br>course. All locked rooms and all locked doors must be opened. All safes<br>must be opened. Any place a gun could be must be opened, or the Sheriff<br>can break in.<br><br>This will now happen on every stalking misdemeanor conviction.<br><br>So like I said, the real consequence of this new law is that the Sheriff<br>of each county is going to be very, very busy.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
