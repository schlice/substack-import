<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Here's the *actual* potential consequences: **anyone who refuses service<br>to anyone for any legally-protected reason will generate new<br>opportunities for other people to offer those services.**<br><br>In other words, someone is going to open up a wedding website shop<br>*right next door to Lorie Smith* offering wedding websites to same-sex<br>couples.<br><br>Any time one service person refuses to engage in a service, there should<br>be another service person right next door who *will* engage in that<br>service. And since Lorie Smith is clear about what websites she will not<br>build, it would be stupid simple to set up shop right next door to her<br>and offer that service to those people who she will knowingly refuse.<br><br>This is what we call free-market capitalism. Rather than being<br>worried that Lorie Smith won't design one particular website, or that<br>Jack Phillips won't sell one design of cake, be glad that the<br>opportunities for other website designers or other bakers *have now been<br>created.* Jump in there and offer those services! And then thank them<br>for sending all that business your way! It's like free advertising! You<br>do know that there is a baker **on the same street as Masterpiece Cake<br>Shop in Colorado** who will bake cakes for same-sex weddings, right?<br><br>And if you say "well, what happens when there is no one else available<br>to perform service X," I'd say, "well, then you've missed your<br>opportunity to provide that service!"<br><br>And what happens when enough people get on Yelp and give Lorie Smith's<br>business a bad rating because she refused to service them? That's right,<br>people who she *would* do business with choose someone else.<br><br>What's the upshot of all of this? Yes, it's true that the Constitution<br>prevents the state from forcing vendors to create expressive designs<br>speaking messages with which the vendor disagrees. So what do you do?<br>Let the free market decide whose business should profit. Vote with<br>your words (the First Amendment works both ways, you know). Vote with<br>your feet. Vote with your wallet. If you don't like Lorie Smith's<br>criteria for choosing her clients, don't do business with her when you<br>need a website built. Eventually, if enough people don't do business<br>with her, she'll go out of business, and it will be her own decisions<br>which do it.<br><br>TL;DR: Everywhere you see a *victim*, I see an *opportunity*.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
