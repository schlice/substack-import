  and posts when challenged? Are they afraid of debate or concerned that their answers

<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>By answering, I don't claim that I am a "prominent Christian on Quora."<br>I'd probably rate myself as a "marginally known Christian voice." So<br>there's that.<br><br>I don't disable comments, but I will allow a conversation in the<br>comments to progress to a point where we have reached the end of<br>productive discussion, we have all aired our philosophical differences,<br>and we are adding nothing new to the discussion.<br><br>At that point, I will point out that we are doing just that, and I will<br>end the conversation. I will thank the commenter for contributing to the<br>discussion, and then end the conversation.<br><br>*It is at this point* that I will stop accepting more comments. If the<br>commenter just can't help himself and feels like he or she must have the<br>last word, I'll delete the last word and block them.<br><br>But I won't take the conversation down.<br><br>I want their views to stand. They chose to come into my answer and<br>challenge my interpretation of Scripture. That's perfectly fine.<br>Healthy, even. I permit that on my answers; I even *encourage* it.<br><br>But at a certain point (the point beyond which we don't add any<br>additional understanding to the discussion, and we just keep re-hashing<br>the same points), I cut off that conversation because I simply don't<br>have the time to spend on comments which no longer enhance the<br>understanding of either the answer or the comment.<br><br>I think that's probably the best, most reasonable middle ground. It's<br>the best I could come up with anyway.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
