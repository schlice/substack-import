<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Can a person with multiple sclerosis die of a urinary tract<br>infection?**<br><br>Any person *can* die from a urinary tract infection (UTI), not just<br>people with MS.<br><br>Let's be more specific. The UTI itself won't kill you. However, that<br>infection can triggger a disease called *sepsis*. In sepsis, chemicals<br>released into the bloodstream to deal with an infection start to cause<br>inflammation throughout the body. An out-of-control reaction to an<br>infection can cause a chain reaction of inflammation throughout the<br>body, damaging organs and leading to a condition called *septic shock*,<br>which can be fatal.<br><br>People with MS often experience bladder-related dysfunction due to the<br>disease, so the incidence of UTIs in people with MS is higher than the<br>general population. Therefore, the risk of septic shock from a UTI is<br>greater in the population of MS patients than in the general population,<br>because the risk of UTIs is greater.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
