<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>You alone probably aren't going to be able to stop it. So there's really<br>only two things you can do:<br><br>1.  Learn to live with it<br>2.  Change your school<br><br>Under the "learn to live with it" category, find out where the worst<br>smells come from and avoid those areas.<br><br>Under the "change your school" category, it's not as difficult as you<br>think. There are virtual schools you can attend for free (as they are<br>public schools) in nearly every state; there's a good chance your state<br>has one. They're not widely publicized because the government would<br>never do something actively to drive students to other schools (if you<br>want to know why, look up Per Pupil Operating Revenue \PPOR\). Anyway,<br>head on over to the [[K12<br>Website](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=8b5513&url=https://www.k12.com/parent-student-resources/how-to-enroll.html?utm_campaign%3Dtickerlink_howtoenrollswitch){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="k12.com"}]{.qlink_container} to search for a school where<br>you live and look into it. I can vouch for K12. It is a great company<br>and they offer you a solid product.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>What should I do about students at my school doing weed? I smell it<br>everywhere and I\'m sick of breathing in it. Everyone at school thinks<br>it\'s normal, even the teachers.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
