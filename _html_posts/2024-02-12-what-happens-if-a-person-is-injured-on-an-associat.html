<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The "Private Property" signs alert people that permission is required<br>before entering. HOA members and their guests, under normal<br>circumstances, have ongoing permission to access HOA property without<br>additional permissions.<br><br>If a person is injured on Association property, the Association<br>maintains general liability insurance which would pay if the Association<br>was found to be liable for any portion, or all of, the injury. The<br>insurance adjustors handle the liability investigation.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
