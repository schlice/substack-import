<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>It definitely seems that this is a statement buried in a question. And<br>it's dripping with irony.<br><br>> **A clergy person asking for mercy. My God what is the world coming<br>> to?**<br><br>Is that all this particular clergy person did? Is this the questionable<br>statement?<br><br>Because if this is all that was said, then I totally agree with you. A<br>clergy person asking for mercy is a non-issue.<br><br>So let's *zoom out* and look at the entire statement:<br><br>> *Let me make one final plea, Mr. President. Millions have put their<br>> trust in you and, as you told the nation yesterday, you have felt the<br>> providential hand of a loving God. In the name of our God, I ask you<br>> to have mercy upon the people in our country who are scared now. There<br>> are gay, lesbian and transgender children in Democratic, Republican,<br>> and Independent families, some who fear for their lives. The people<br>> who pick our crops and clean our office buildings; who labor in<br>> poultry farms and meat packing plants; who wash the dishes after we<br>> eat in restaurants and work the night shifts in hospitals. They...may<br>> not be citizens or have the proper documentation. But the vast<br>> majority of immigrants are not criminals. They pay taxes and are good<br>> neighbors. They are faithful members of our churches and mosques,<br>> synagogues, gurudwaras and temples. I ask you to have mercy, Mr.<br>> President, on those in our communities whose children fear that their<br>> parents will be taken away. And that you help those who are fleeing<br>> war zones and persecution in their own lands to find compassion and<br>> welcome here. Our God teaches us that we are to be merciful to the<br>> stranger, for we were all once strangers in this land. May God grant<br>> us the strength and courage to honor the dignity of every human being,<br>> to speak the truth to one another in love and walk humbly with each<br>> other and our God for the good of all people. Good of all people in<br>> this nation and the world. Amen*<br><br>So there were a few points which turned this from a sermon into a<br>political statement:<br><br>Budde addressed Trump---who was seated in the front row---directly, by<br>citing his belief about being saved by God from assassination and said:<br>"In the name of our God, I ask you to have mercy upon the people in our<br>country who are scared now."Addressing a single person in the<br>congregation already puts this sermon on shaky ground. But she<br>continued.<br><br>Budde\'s plea mentioned "gay, lesbian and transgender children in<br>Democratic, Republican, and Independent families," across the country<br>"who fear for their lives." This is a left-wing talking point. They fear<br>that Trump is going to murder people because they are gay. Let's be 100%<br>clear: no one has ever, ever even *hinted* **at the fact that<br>LGBT people should be killed.** If they fear for their lives, it's<br>because someone told them they should be afraid, and those someones are<br>the people on the Left. So this sermon has now completely transformed<br>into a left-wing political speech. But she continued.<br><br>The bishop also spoke up for immigrant workers, including those who may<br>not "have the proper documentation," saying the vast majority of them<br>are "not criminals" but rather "good neighbors." This is another<br>left-wing talking point, claiming that because illegal aliens are "good<br>neighbors" that they should not be treated like criminals, **despite the<br>fact that they are**. Violating immigration law is indeed a crime,<br>whether the criminals are good people or not. Your "goodness" doesn't<br>absolve you of your crimes. Certainly, they should be treated humanely,<br>but they should also be treated humanely as criminals.<br><br>Finally, she said, "Our God teaches us that we are to be merciful to the<br>stranger, for we were all once strangers in this land." Now she has<br>taken what she turned into a political speech and started munging<br>Christianity, suggesting that God would overlook crimes because "we were<br>all once strangers." While it's true that God is indeed infinitely<br>merciful, He is also infinitely *just*. And justice demands payment for<br>sin. Thankfully, God provided Jesus to pay for sin on our behalf, if we<br>accept Him.<br><br>To that end, God does not overlook crime. He provides a way out, if we<br>accept it. But God is infinitely just, and He does not *overlook* crime.<br>He does not *ignore* crime. Crimes must be paid for by someone.<br><br>\<br><br>In short, this was a sad sermon. It was more about people than it was<br>about God. It was more about how Trump relates to others than how Trump<br>relates to God. And if I were the bishop, I'd be more worried about<br>Trump's *soul* than his *policy*.<br><br>I think the bishop should stay in her lane.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
