<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What do I do if my boyfriend is an atheist? We have been dating for 2<br>years and 7 in a half months, but I have recently tried to bring God<br>into the equation more and he doesn\'t seem to want to change with me. I<br>want breaking up to be the last option.**<br><br>You may want it to be the last option, but it might be the only one.<br>Because unfortunately, **you two are not going to be able to move<br>forward without a healthy faith base between you.**<br><br>The truth is that without faith, his morality is *self-referential*. He<br>may be a stand-up guy today, but that could change at any time, and he<br>has only himself to determine whether or not that change is good, or<br>useful. He may decide that your love life isn't what he wants, and<br>sleeping around is good for everyone. He may not believe this now, but<br>what about tomorrow? When he only has himself to determine his morality,<br>he can choose to change at any time, and it would be perfectly fine for<br>him. Not so for you, though.<br><br>Without faith, there is no future.<br><br>In order to move forward in your relationship, he has to be willing to<br>work on his faith. He has to be willing to at least try.<br><br>I'm not going to be one to tell you to stick by him and marry him and<br>have kids with him if he steadfastly refuses to work on his faith. I'm<br>sorry, but that's a non-starter for me. I would advise you to make it a<br>deal breaker for you. We could sit here all day and try to divine God's<br>plan for you two. But our human brains simply can't wrap themselves<br>around the depth of God's plans for us. Instead, we have to live how we<br>know we are supposed to live, based on the Bible. Here is what it says<br>about this:<br><br>> Do not be yoked together with unbelievers. For what do righteousness<br>> and wickedness have in common? Or what fellowship can light have with<br>> darkness? What harmony is there between Christ and Belial? Or what<br>> does a believer have in common with an unbeliever? What agreement is<br>> there between the temple of God and idols? For we are the temple of<br>> the living God.<br>><br>> - 2 Cor 6:14--16 NIV<br><br>If he likes pizza and you don't, that's a disagreement you can live<br>with, and even work around. Or if he likes death metal and you like 80's<br>hair bands, you can work around that too. But this is a bridge too far.<br>The Bible warns against it, and this is the truth we can rest on.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
