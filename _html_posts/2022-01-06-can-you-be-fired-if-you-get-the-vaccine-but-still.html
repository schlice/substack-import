<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>In an at-will employment scenario, you can be fired for any reason, or<br>no reason at all. So long as you are not fired for a *protected* reason<br>(i.e. your age, your sex, your skin color, your religion, or your<br>country of origin), you can be fired for any reason.<br><br>So can you be fired if you get the vaccine but still get COVID? Sure.<br>It's a stupid reason to fire an employee (for something that is out of<br>his control), but yes, you can be fired for this.<br><br>Some states may have implemented worker protections to protect employees<br>for getting fired due to COVID; check with your state labor board to see<br>if your state has such protections. But there is a fair chance that your<br>employer already knows the labor laws where you work.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Can you be fired if you get the vaccine but still get the cvirus?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
