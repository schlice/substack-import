<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Can any of the treatments for multiple sclerosis cause cancer? If so,<br>which ones do so?**<br><br>To the best of my knowledge, none of the current MS medications increase<br>your risk of cancer. However, the drugs have only been on the market for<br>MS patients since the mid 80s and for others only a few years before. So<br>we only have about 30 years of runtime on these drugs. Conclusively<br>tying the drugs to cancer likely takes more runtime than that.<br><br>But to date, there is no evidence that the drugs increase cancer risk.<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*This answer is not professional medical advice**, nor is it a<br>substitute for professional medical advice.
