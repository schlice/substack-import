<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>No, the HOA does not set minimum standards to purchase homes.<br><br>However, considering the fact that HOA dues must be paid in addition to<br>whatever mortgage the new owner will be taking on when they buy in the<br>neighborhood, there will be a *de facto* income requirement to afford<br>both the cost of the home and the HOA dues.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
