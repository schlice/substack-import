We are allowed to choose medical<br>treatment which, between us and our doctors in private,<br>legally-protected conversations, are best for us. We are not mandated to<br>accept medical procedures which we do not want, regardless of future<br>disease which may result from that decision.<br><br>Should we say that all vapers who suffer lung cancer which we only learn<br>of 50 years from now only be given palliative care? If it\'s good enough<br>for a vaccine, it\'s good enough for all life choices which result in<br>bodily harm in the future. Remember, prevention for a disease also<br>involves changing your personal behaviors.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Should a law exist that requires that a person who refuses prevention<br>for a disease also can only be given palliative care for that disease?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
