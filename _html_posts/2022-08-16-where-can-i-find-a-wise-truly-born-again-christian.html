<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I think this community qualifies. I'll speak for myself, as I hesitate<br>to ever call myself wise. But I have been born again through water and<br>the spirit, and I'm still a work in progress.<br><br>Ask your questions here, and we'll do our best to help!<br><br>(EDIT) If you want to go to a church to talk to someone, please find a<br>nondenominational church in your local area. You'll want to find a<br>Bible-based church, one which is governed by as many of the five<br>*solas* of the Reformation as you can find.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
