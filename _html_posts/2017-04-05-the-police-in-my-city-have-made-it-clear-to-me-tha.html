<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>A2A<br><br>> *But they have made it clear that they don't mean me well, and that I<br>> should not ever look to them for assistance on any matter.*<br><br>That's unusual. It's going to be an odd conversation when the local<br>sheriff approaches your chief of police and asks him why he's not doing<br>his job; why the sheriff's office has to cover for the police department<br>in an area where the police department has jurisdiction. Hopefully you<br>have your ducks in a row. As you know, there are three sides to every<br>story: your side, their side, and the truth, which usually lies<br>somewhere in between both sides. So the truth of the situation is likely<br>related to this (emphasis mine):<br><br>> *I support the police* *almost* *completely,* *in general**. I<br>> have no record, no activism, no arrests.*<br><br>The reason that your police department might refuse to service your<br>calls may have something to do with those "almosts" and "in generals."<br>Believe me, I am not at all concerned with what those are. Just be<br>prepared for when that conversation ends up on your doorstep, because<br>the first time you call someone else for service, it will.<br><br>To answer your final question:<br><br>> *Is there any other entity that I can contact in case of trouble?*<br><br>In most areas of the country (some older East coast cities may be<br>different), your city is part of a county. Your city is protected by a<br>police department, but your city is also within a county, and the county<br>is protected by a sheriff's department. The two organizations legally<br>have what is called *concurrent jurisdiction;* however, the sheriff has<br>a Memorandum of Understanding or a Memorandum of Agreement between<br>himself and the chiefs of police of each city within his jurisdiction.<br>What it spells out is basically that the city is responsible for law<br>enforcement actions within the city limits. The city can call the<br>sheriff's department for help, but under normal circumstances, the<br>sheriff will defer to the chief of police for that city to handle law<br>enforcement actions within that city. If this is the structure where you<br>live, call your local sheriff's department before you need them and<br>explain that your local police department is refusing to respond to<br>calls for service from you, so it now falls on them to service your<br>calls. I'm certain they will want to follow up with the city on this<br>breach of protocol. If you are forced to call the county for something<br>that should be handled by the city, the two of them are going to have to<br>work it out.<br><br>You're also going to have to find and post near your phone the direct<br>line to the sheriff's dispatch center. You won't be able to call 911,<br>since it will be routed to your local police department's dispatcher.<br>You can try to call 911 and try to tell them that the city police won't<br>respond, but I wouldn't bet my life on the fact that they are actually<br>going to come when you call them.<br><br>Finally, as everyone else here said, the United States is a land of<br>*individual responsibility*. Numerous Supreme Court rulings have<br>affirmed and re-affirmed that the police have no specific duty to<br>protect you. They have a general duty to protect the public at large,<br>but they are under no specific duty to protect you from harm. It is<br>your responsibility to protect yourself from harm. Get a dog, get an<br>alarm system, get a gun (and learn how to use it). You are your own<br>security.<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-4d19f4d3c2540ede544fa29e2186527a){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-4d19f4d3c2540ede544fa29e2186527a" master_w="600"<br>master_h="600"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
