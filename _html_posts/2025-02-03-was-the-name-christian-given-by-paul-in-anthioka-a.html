<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>> and when he had found him, he brought him to Antioch. For a whole year<br>> they met with the church and taught a great many people. And in<br>> Antioch the disciples were first called Christians. \-- Acts 11:26 ESV<br><br>So no, it wasn't Paul's idea, and the name wasn't given by Paul. In<br>Antioch, believers were first identified as "Christians" or<br>"Christ-ones" by those *outside* the Christ community. Within the<br>community of believers, they most commonly called themselves "the Way,"<br>referring to their group as "the followers of The Way" or "the people of<br>The Way."<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
