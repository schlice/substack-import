<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Since many confederate statues were erected by the United Daughters of<br>the Confederacy with its support of the "lost cause movement,"<br>advocating for white supremacy, why do Trump followers support keeping<br>the statues?**<br><br>Removing these items doesn't undo what we have done. It just makes us<br>forget.<br><br>> Every record has been destroyed or falsified, every book rewritten,<br>> every picture has been repainted, every statue and street building has<br>> been renamed, every date has been altered. \...\ Nothing exists<br>> except an endless present in which the Party is always right. ---<br>> George Orwell, *1984*<br><br>And forgetting those lessons gives future generations the opportunity to<br>repeat those same mistakes.<br><br>> Those who do not learn history are doomed to repeat it. --- George<br>> Santayana<br><br>A statue does not automatically enshrine racism. No one looks at those<br>statues and says, "Gee, I want to be a racist just like him!" They<br>remember what was done. They remember the good, and they remember the<br>bad, and they recoil at the truly horrific. Washington was a slave<br>owner. Should we reprint all the \$1 bills and remove his image because<br>of it? What will that accomplish? It's a learning experience. Removing<br>those statues and other icons interrupts that opportunity to learn.<br>Sadly, some would rather not learn, but forget.<br><br>Or perhaps, as in Orwell's dystopian future, rewrite.<br><br>Don't take the temporary win now just to make a feel-good statement that<br>is going to affirmatively hurt us down the road.<br><br>\<br><br>*Sorry, no comments on this one.*<br><br>*If you don\'t like what I wrote, tough shit. If my answer is<br>grammatically low-quality or is un-cited opinion masquerading as fact,<br>downvote it. If you think I\'m wrong, write your own answer. But Quora<br>is a question-and-answer site, not a debate site. If you were simply<br>going to comment to tell me \"ackshually, you\'re wrong,\" then you're<br>the reason why I disable comments. Well done, Karen. You ruined it for<br>everyone.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
