<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: [Actually, it doesn\'t. The Constitution is a document<br>which places limits on the Federal government, not the states. The 10th<br>Amendment says that any rights not expressly granted to the Federal<br>government belong to the states, or to the people. It\'s clear that the<br>Constitution and its Amendments were intended to bind the Federal<br>government, not the states. Also, ratification by a state does not mean<br>that the state is instantly bound by the Amendment; it simply means that<br>the state agrees to make the Amendment part of the US Constitution.<br>There is no effect on a State Constitution when a State ratifies an<br>amendment to the US Constitution, unless that amendment invalidates part<br>of that state\'s Constitution.\<br>\<br>The Supreme Court spent a great deal of time wrestling with this<br>argument. People like Hugo Black wanted \"mechanical incorporation\" of<br>all of the Bill of Rights (1 thru 8) into State law. Others, like Felix<br>Frankfurter, thought that incorporation should be gradual, but only<br>because of due process. He said, \"It is possible that some of the<br>personal rights safeguarded by the first eight Amendments against<br>National action may also be safeguarded against state action, because a<br>denial of them would be a denial of due process of law. If this is so,<br>it is not because those rights are enumerated in the first eight<br>Amendments, but because they are of such a nature that they are included<br>in the conception of due process of law.\" (Twining v New Jersey, 1908)<br>What he was saying is that the rights are protected because of due<br>process (which can change over time), not because they were listed in<br>the Bill of Rights (which does not change). For example, in Palko v<br>Connecticut (1937), the majority ruled that the 5th Amendment protection<br>against double jeopardy did not violate due process, and so therefore<br>didn\'t apply to the states. This was overturned on appeal. It went this<br>way for several Amendments (didn\'t violate due process so didn\'t apply<br>to the states, but then later overturned). So while the Bill of Rights<br>was never \"mechanically incorporated\" to the States, over time and<br>through case law, all 8 of the individual rights amendments were bound<br>against the states. There are some exceptions, but for the most part,<br>they are binding.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/What-does-it-mean-that-the-Bill-of-Rights-is-binding/answer/Bill-Stein<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
