<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The only crime here is possession and/or distribution of child<br>pornography. The girl distributed it, your ex-fiance possesses it. If<br>you're looking to get them both thrown in jail and placed on the sex<br>offender registry, that would be the way to do it. Immediately turn your<br>evidence over to the police if that's what you are planning on doing.<br>Don't mess with the mother, don't mess with the ex, just call the<br>police, if that's what you are going for.<br><br>If you don't want to see your ex go to jail (if the girl goes for<br>distribution, your ex goes for possession), I would suggest you drop the<br>whole ex-fiance thing and move on. Seriously. Get that whole train wreck<br>out of your life. Move on. You can do better.<br><br>But that's not what you asked, and I know I'm providing unsolicited<br>advice, so let me stick specifically to your question. Here are your<br>answers:<br><br>- SMS: You must use a private SMS service. There are plenty out there.<br>  Just search "anonymous SMS" in Google and take your pick. You pay a<br>  nominal fee and send away. I'd also suggest using an anonymous payment<br>  service at the same time, so that even if the police track the service<br>  provider of the SMS service, you can't be located. I'd suggest a<br>  reloadable credit card without an account. At best, they could find<br>  out where and when you purchased and loaded the credit card, so pick a<br>  place to buy your card with minimal surveillance cameras.<br>- Email: You can use any web-based email service to send anonymous<br>  email. Just sign up for that service with fake information. When you<br>  access the service, you must use a web anonymizer such as<br>  [Tor(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=b40976&url=https://tor.eff.org){.external_link<br>  rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>  onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>  qt-tooltip="eff.org"}]{.qlink_container}, otherwise they could trace<br>  your IP address back through the service.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
