<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**The family of Breonna Taylor received 12 million in civil court. If<br>this event led to a cash settlement and law changes needed to be made,<br>doesn\'t it make more sense to charge the officers and force them to pay<br>rather than the uninvolved taxpayers?**<br><br>Maybe. But those investigations are still ongoing.<br><br>That's why most people say that this payout by Louisville was premature<br>and that the mayor's office does not support the officers who work<br>there.\[1\](#tkYGl){#cite-tkYGl .citation_link}<br><br>While the payout may still have been made, most people still believe<br>that the payout should have waited until the conclusion of the<br>investigation into the officers' conduct. Kentucky Attorney General<br>Daniel Cameron appointed himself special prosecutor to look into whether<br>criminal charges should be filed against the officers in the case. No<br>timeline has been released for that decision. The FBI also is conducting<br>a separate investigation in her shooting. And usually, it is the<br>Department of Justice which investigates shootings to see if the<br>victim's civil rights were violated.<br><br>None of this was allowed to complete before the city decided to pay.<br><br>While taxpayers are probably happy that the estate of Breonna Taylor<br>will have some financial compensation for her death, taxpayers are also<br>likely watching the results of the investigations to see if they should<br>have paid at all.<br><br>\<br><br>*Sorry, no comments on this one.*<br><br>*If you don\'t like what I wrote, tough shit. If my answer is<br>grammatically low-quality or is un-cited opinion masquerading as fact,<br>downvote it. If you think I\'m wrong, write your own answer. But Quora<br>is a question-and-answer site, not a debate site. If you were simply<br>going to comment to tell me \"ackshually, you\'re wrong,\" then you're<br>the reason why I disable comments. Well done, Karen. You ruined it for<br>everyone.*<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-tkYGl){.citation_index} [[Critics say Louisville settled<br>too soon in Breonna Taylor case, betrayed police<br>officers](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=533e4c&url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/09/17/louisville-settled-too-soon-mayor-betrayed-police-breonna-taylor-case/3482161001/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="usatoday.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
