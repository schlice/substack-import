<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Can a non-US citizen with a valid driver\'s license use it as proof of<br>identity to fly domestic flights?**<br><br>From TSA, here is the list of valid forms of identification you can use<br>at an airport security checkpoint. These are the only forms of<br>identification which are accepted at airport checkpoints:<br><br>> Adult passengers 18 and over must show valid identification at the<br>> airport checkpoint in order to travel.<br>><br>> - Driver\'s licenses or other state photo identity cards issued by<br>>   Department of Motor Vehicles (or equivalent)<br>> - U.S. passport<br>> - U.S. passport card<br>> - DHS trusted traveler cards (Global Entry, NEXUS, SENTRI, FAST)<br>> - U.S. Department of Defense ID, including IDs issued to dependents<br>> - Permanent resident card<br>> - Border crossing card<br>> - DHS-designated enhanced driver\'s license<br>> - Federally recognized, tribal-issued photo ID<br>> - HSPD-12 PIV card<br>> - Foreign government-issued passport<br>> - Canadian provincial driver\'s license or Indian and Northern Affairs<br>>   Canada card<br>> - Transportation worker identification credential<br>> - U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Employment Authorization<br>>   Card (I-766)<br>> - U.S. Merchant Mariner Credential<br>><br>> Beginning Oct. 1, 2020, if you plan to use your state-issued ID or<br>> license to fly within the U.S., make sure it is REAL ID compliant. If<br>> you are not sure if your ID complies with REAL ID, check with your<br>> state department of motor vehicles.\[1\](#qYnFn){#cite-qYnFn<br>> .citation_link}<br><br>If you have one of these, TSA is wholly unconcerned with your<br>citizenship status. If you have a license issued by a state, and it is<br>valid, you can use it to fly domestic. You could even use a non-US<br>passport, so long as the name matches the name on the ticket, and the<br>picture matches the person standing in front of them.<br><br>The question asked if a "**non-US citizen with a valid driver's<br>license"** can fly domestically. But the OP failed to mention where that<br>license was issued. If that driver's license is issued by a US state,<br>then yes. If it is issued by a foreign country, then unless it is a<br>license issued by Canada (which is in the list above), then no. That<br>non-US citizen will have to provide one of the forms of ID listed above<br>to fly on a domestic US airline.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-qYnFn){.citation_index}<br>[Identification(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=df33f0&url=https://www.tsa.gov/travel/security-screening/identification){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="tsa.gov"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
