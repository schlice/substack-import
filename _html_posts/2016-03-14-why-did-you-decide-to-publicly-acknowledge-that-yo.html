<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>It was time to no longer keep my disease a secret because I had come to<br>terms with my disease personally.<br><br>We don\'t know what causes it. We can\'t really control it. We can\'t<br>cure it. Why on earth would I cause myself additional anxiety by trying<br>to *hide* it?<br><br>I remember the first time I was presented with the opportunity to tell<br>someone outside my family. I was running a baseball practice not long<br>after my diagnosis. My optic neuritis was still in full flare, so the<br>sun was bad enough. There was no way I could focus on a fast-moving<br>baseball. I couldn\'t help pitch because I couldn\'t see well enough to<br>catch the ball. I remember telling one of the other dads to pitch (he<br>was a jerk). He rudely said, \"Why can\'t you do it?\" And I remember<br>stopping, and kinda being frozen in time. I was about to tell someone<br>besides my family that I had a degenerative disease that caused me to<br>leave the military and change my entire life, for the first time.<br><br>So I chickened out.<br><br>I said, \"I have an eye problem, I can\'t see well enough to catch the<br>ball.\"<br><br>He just said, \"Oh.\"<br><br>I hadn\'t yet come to terms with my own disease.<br><br>Ultimately, the first person outside of my family and friends that I<br>told was my boss. He\'s a great guy and we\'ve been working together for<br>many years, so I felt comfortable enough going to him and telling him<br>that I was diagnosed with MS. I was likely going to miss a few days due<br>to appointments throughout the year, so telling the boss was important<br>to get him on board. Thankfully, he and the company have been great to<br>me all these years. If I needed time due to doctor\'s appointments, as<br>long as I let them know in advance, they were okay with that. While they<br>didn\'t quite understand it fully, they did learn over time. I<br>appreciated their acceptance and understanding, so much so that I went<br>on to serve (and still do to this day) on the board for the company\'s<br>newly-formed Affinity Circle for disabled employees. Our Disability<br>Employee Resource Group has won numerous industry awards in the D&I<br>(Diversity and Inclusion) space, and I couldn\'t be prouder of the<br>spirit of inclusion we have fostered at my company. I\'m glad that<br>opening up about my disease could be a part of that.<br><br>Because my neurologist is also a professor at the University of Colorado<br>in Denver, I get the benefit of his considerable knowledge. It\'s for<br>that reason he\'s also the co-director of the Rocky Mountain MS Center.<br>It\'s also that knowledge about the disease, the medications, the<br>symptoms, and all of the related \"stuff\" that goes along with it that<br>he and others have imparted to me. I started helping others, both online<br>and in the real world, to come to grips with, and understand, their<br>disease. This is why I now function as a Patient Advocate, trying to<br>help the newly-diagnosed understand the disease and what it means for<br>their lives. MS is not a death sentence, but it is a life sentence.<br>Coming to grips with that fact is important in the transition towards a<br>healthy and full life managing the disease. If I hadn\'t decided to come<br>forward about my disease, I\'d be in no position to help anyone else.<br><br>Hope this helps!<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
