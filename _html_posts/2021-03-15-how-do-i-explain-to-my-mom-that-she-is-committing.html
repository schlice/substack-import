Yes, you have agency. Yes, you<br>are an individual. Yes, your opinion should be respected.<br><br>But ultimately, unless she is harming you, she can make you go to Lowe's<br>and look at flowers.<br><br>You are not an indentured servant. You are a *child*.<br><br>If you already have a job which allows you to support yourself, you<br>should ask your parents for emancipation.
