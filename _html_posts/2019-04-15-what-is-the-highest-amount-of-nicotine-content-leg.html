<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>What is the highest amount of nicotine content legal in the US?<br><br>Since you're talking about "nicotine content," I can only assume you're<br>talking about "vape juice," or the liquid used in e-cigarettes or in<br>vape "mods." This liquid is usually referred to as "e-liquid."<br><br>Commercial e-liquid is normally available in zero nicotine, 3mg, 6mg,<br>12mg, and 18mg, although the highest nicotine e-liquid may reach 36mg.<br>These numbers are milligrams of nicotine per 1 mL of fluid, so it can<br>also be expressed as a percentage. For example, 18mg/mL can also be<br>expressed as 1.8%.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
