<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>As we have mentioned several times here already, the HOA only has the<br>rights granted to it in the Governing Documents. Every HOA is different,<br>and every set of Governing Documents is also different.<br><br>But I will tell you that most HOAs allow the Board to enter your<br>*property*, not your *home*. For example, just yesterday, we had a<br>property in the neighborhood which is a rental property (the owners live<br>in New Jersey). The previous tenants had moved out, and the house is<br>vacant currently, but in the intervening time, a sprinkler line had<br>broken and was shooting water continuously into the air. While that<br>doesn't seem to be a terrible thing, it could pose a problem for the<br>neighboring house. So what to do? I and one other Board member contacted<br>the rental management agency, and I entered the property (not the house)<br>and went to the main sprinkler line cutoff and turned it off, stopping<br>the water. Our Governing Documents allow us to enter property to address<br>safety issues, and so we did. We took copious time-stamped photos and<br>sent them all to the rental company. They were fine with our action, and<br>they sent someone today to have a look at the issue.<br><br>TL;DR: Generally, Governing Documents don't allow the Board permission<br>to enter your *house*, but most allow them to enter your *property* to<br>address safety issues.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>In Texas, does a community association have the right to enter your<br>home?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
