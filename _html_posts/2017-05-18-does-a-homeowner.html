<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>*Note that in Colorado, most HOAs have separated the Policies &<br>Procedures from the Rules & Regulations. In most other HOAs, they are<br>all one document, generally called the Policies, Procedures, Rules &<br>Regulations, or abbreviated PPR&R. In this answer, any reference to the<br>Rules broadly refers to an HOA's Governing Documents, which can include<br>the Covenants and the PPR&R.*<br><br>In general, HOAs have broad latitude to control the areas within their<br>jurisdictions. Courts have generally supported most HOA rules which are<br>uniformly enforced. Despite what others may have said, an HOA can indeed<br>restrict on-street parking, even when they do not own the street (i.e.<br>it is a city-owned street).<br><br>Essentially, when you sign the covenants, you are entering into a<br>contract between yourself (the Homeowner) and the HOA. The contract (the<br>Covenants) lays out ground rules for living in that community. The<br>Covenants also state that the HOA Board can create Rules and<br>Regulations, and they carry the same force and weight as the Covenants.<br>Again, this is in general, and can vary by state, and even by HOA.<br><br>With that understanding, then yes, the HOA Board can indeed add<br>parking restrictions to those Rules.<br><br>What will be different between an HOA which contains city streets<br>and an HOA which is part of a gated community is what the HOA can do<br>with parked cars in violation of the Rules. The difference turns on who<br>owns the roads.<br><br>- In a gated community, the HOA has complete and total control over the<br>  roads. They can boot or tow improperly parked cars at their<br>  discretion, in accordance with the Rules and Regulations. They own the<br>  roads, they make the rules.<br>- In HOAs where the HOA does not own the streets, their only remedy for<br>  homeowners violating the Rules is whatever remedies are listed in the<br>  Covenants; usually this is limited to fines. The fines are levied<br>  based on the Schedule of Fines listed in the Governing Documents. They<br>  cannot boot or tow cars not following the Rules.<br><br>If you believe that your HOA board is acting unlawfully, your only<br>remedy as a homeowner is to hire an attorney after you are fined under<br>the rule and challenge the legality of that rule.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
