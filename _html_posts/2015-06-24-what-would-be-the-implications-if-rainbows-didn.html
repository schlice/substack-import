<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [The Bible doesn\'t say that rainbows didn\'t exist until<br>the flood. The Bible says that God set a rainbow in the sky after the<br>flood, in the same way that you see a rainbow when there is sun after a<br>rainstorm. It was God\'s promise that he would never again flood the<br>earth in the same way He just did.\<br>\<br>It never says that this is the first ever time a rainbow had appeared.\<br>\<br>I\'d like to believe that God \"co-opted\" the image of the rainbow and<br>used it to teach Noah a lesson. Sorta like, \"when you see the rainbow,<br>remember that I won\'t ever again flood the earth like this.\"\<br>\<br>I believe this because it happened at other times in the Bible. When<br>Jesus shared the Last Supper with his disciples, he took the bread,<br>broke it and said, \"Take this, all of you, and eat it. This is my body,<br>which will be given up for you.\" If you\'re Catholic, that means the<br>bread actually became His body. For everyone else, it\'s a symbol. He\'s<br>saying, \"Every time you break this bread, remember my body, which was<br>broken for you.\" He did the same with the cup of wine, and said, \"This<br>is the cup of my blood, the blood of the new and everlasting covenant.<br>It will be shed, for you and for all, so that sins may be forgiven.<br>Whenever you do this, do it in memory of me.\" Again, if you\'re<br>Catholic, you believe that means the wine became His blood. For the rest<br>of us, He is saying that every time you drink from the cup, remember the<br>blood which was shed for your sins. Jesus used symbology throughout His<br>ministry on earth. We have no reason to believe He wasn\'t still using<br>symbology when communicating with His disciples at the Last Supper.\<br>\<br>Anyway, does that mean that bread and wine didn\'t exist before Jesus<br>made symbols out of them? Not at all. It just means that Jesus used<br>those symbols to further the message He was trying to send: every time<br>you break bread, every time you share a cup of wine, remember my body<br>which was broken for you, and my blood which was shed for you. Jesus<br>used the bread and the wine as symbols signifying His upcoming death and<br>resurrection (which then fulfilled the prophesy and saved us all from<br>sin and separation from God).]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
