<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>All they see is "not Trump."<br><br>They'd literally vote for a chimpanzee in a suit, so long as it was<br>running against Trump. The largest majority of the Democrat party is<br>really only voting for Biden because he\'s not Trump.<br><br>Their hatred for Trump runs *so deep* that they\'d be willing to abuse<br>an elderly man so that Trump will not re-enter the White House.<br><br>It\'s too bad that Nikki Haley didn\'t win the nomination. Because if it<br>was Haley versus Biden in that last debate, not only would she have<br>mopped the floor with him, November would be a landslide victory for<br>her. But because it\'s Trump, it\'s still going to be close.<br><br>As I have always said, Trump\'s biggest problem is Trump. If he could<br>just get out of his own way, he\'d be a good president. As it is, he\'s<br>got good policies, but he\'s not a great person. So most of us have to<br>hold our nose and vote for Trump so that we get the good policies. The<br>country is more important than the man.<br><br>For the Democrats, apparently, the man is more important than the<br>country.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
