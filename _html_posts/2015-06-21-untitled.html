<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: [Do you not see the fallacies of your generalizations? You<br>are looking at such a small data set that it\'s not even worth it.\<br>\<br>If I meet 5 cops in my town and they all happen to be racist, is it then<br>okay for me to generalize and say that all cops are racist? No, because<br>the sample set is too small. Now, if I meet a cop from every part of the<br>country, big departments, little towns, and have a good representative<br>set, and they are all racist, then I might be able to make that claim.<br>But only meeting 5 from one area only tells me about that<br>area.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/How-can-I-become-a-police-officer-if-I-do-not-have-anger-issues/answer/Bill-Stein<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
