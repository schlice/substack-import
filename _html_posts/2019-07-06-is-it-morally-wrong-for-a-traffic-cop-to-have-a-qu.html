<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Is it morally wrong for a traffic cop to have a quota to fill every<br>month?**<br><br>I'm reasonably sure that department policies regarding how many tickets<br>you have to write has little to do with morals.<br><br>Quotas are a bad idea. Officers shouldn't be judged against a pre-set<br>number of tickets, but should be judged on the quality, as well as the<br>quantity, of tickets written. By quantity here, it means that if an<br>officer is supposed to write traffic tickets, a very low quantity could<br>be an indication that he's not doing his job effectively and requires<br>further review. Similarly, a very high number of tickets may also<br>indicate an overzealous traffic officer who maybe needs to settle back a<br>bit. This is why workers have supervisors: to keep them on the right<br>track. A pre-set number you have to "hit" is a poor way to motivate<br>someone to write tickets, because it leads to poor tickets.<br><br>The only time that any sort of measurement of quantity should ever come<br>into play is for specialized enforcement units, such as a traffic detail<br>specifically deployed to a problem area.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
