<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Think about this. We have known, medically, about MS for thousands of<br>years. We haven\'t had effective treatments for it for most of that<br>time. It\'s only been in the last 40 years or so that we have been able<br>to slow the disease progression and lessen its effects. We\'ve gone from<br>effectively "no treatment" to being able to make the lifespan of someone<br>with MS basically match the lifespan of someone without MS, and we have<br>lessened the impact of the disease as well as making the disease less<br>active in the body.<br><br>It has been the development of the MRI and other advanced diagnostic<br>tools that has propelled the treatment of the disease. As diagnostic<br>tools improve, and the technology to understand the disease improves,<br>the race to the cure will be exponential, not linear. I think we will<br>see a functional cure in my lifetime.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
