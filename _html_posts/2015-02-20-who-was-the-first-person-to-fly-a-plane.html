<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [The powered airplane, as we know it, was invented by<br>Orville and Wilbur Wright. The first flight of the *Wright Flyer I* took<br>place on December 17, 1903, in Kitty Hawk, NC. It flew for 120 feet, and<br>is regarded as the first recorded flight of an \"airplane.\" They<br>flipped a coin, and Orville took the first flight.\<br>\<br>Samuel Pierpont Langley built another aircraft earlier in 1903 called<br>the *Aerodrome,* but his tests at powered flight over the Potomac were<br>unsuccessful. Glenn Curtiss heavily modified the design of the<br>*Aerodrome* and successfully flew it in 1914. The Smithsonian used<br>Curtiss\' flight in 1914 as the basis to award Langley (the former<br>Secretary of the Institute) the honor of having his machine, the<br>*Aerodrome,* listed as the first heavier-than-air machine \"capable\" of<br>flight. Later, under new direction, the Smithsonian published a list of<br>Curtiss\' modifications to the *Aerodrome* and rescinded its earlier<br>pronouncement, pronouncing the *Flyer* as the first heavier-than-air<br>machine capable of flight. The Wrights were then allowed to return the<br>*Flyer* to America, and to the Smithsonian, after having it on display<br>in the Science Museum in London.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
