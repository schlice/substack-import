<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>All of my colleagues answering here are correct...for city, state, and<br>local police departments.<br><br>The only major exception is military police. Military police are not<br>issued take-home weapons, even though they are covered by the Law<br>Enforcement Officer Safety Act (LEOSA). If they wanted to carry<br>off-duty, they would need to do so with their own personal weapons.<br><br>Military police are issued a "weapons card" after training (I used to<br>keep mine in my holster when it was empty). At the beginning of the<br>shift, when everyone is suiting up, they'd line up at the armory window,<br>hand over the weapons card (which displays what weapons the officer is<br>qualified to carry), and the card will go in the slot from which a duty<br>weapon is removed and handed back out the window to the officer. He is<br>then provided with ammunition in an appropriate number of magazines,<br>which go into the weapon and the duty belt.<br><br>The weapon is taken to the clearing barrel which is essentially a<br>55-gallon drum full of sand resting in a wooden stand (or built into a<br>wall or a door) at a 45-degree angle. The muzzle of the weapon is<br>inserted into the clearing barrel, the magazine is inserted, the slide<br>is released chambering a round, and the safety is turned off. The weapon<br>is then holstered, ready for duty. The process is repeated in reverse at<br>the end of the shift. The process is monitored by a **clearing barrel<br>official**, or CBO. Unsafe loading is noted, dangerous practices are<br>stopped.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
