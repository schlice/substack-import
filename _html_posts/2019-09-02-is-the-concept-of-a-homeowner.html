<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Is the concept of a homeowner\'s association a contradiction with<br>American beliefs regarding private property? A person\'s home is their<br>castle.**<br><br>Not at all.<br><br>In fact, an HOA is a reaffirmation in American contract law.<br><br>Clearly, what you fail to realize is that a homeowner must voluntarily<br>choose to live in an area controlled by an HOA. When they purchase their<br>house, they actually physically sign the Covenants, which is a legally<br>binding contract between the HOA and the homeowner.<br><br>So homeowners dissatisfied with the fact that their home is in an area<br>controlled by an HOA are either completely ignorant about the papers<br>they signed when buying their house, had a poor real estate agent (who<br>didn't explain what an HOA is and what they were agreeing to), or were<br>*willfully ignorant* about what the HOA can do.<br><br>I know people who moved into areas controlled by HOAs with the attitude<br>of "I know the rules, but I'm just going to break them anyway, what can<br>they possibly do to me?" Those people found out the hard way that the<br>HOA can do quite a lot, especially when you agreed, UP FRONT, to follow<br>their rules.<br><br>If you don't like HOAs, don't buy a house in an area controlled by an<br>HOA. If you're in an area controlled by an HOA and you don't like it,<br>MOVE. Sell your house. It's a great time to do it.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
