<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>This is the *effect* of what SCOTUS said.<br><br>What they *actually* said is that *Roe v. Wade* *itself* was decided<br>wrongly. There is no right to abortion in the Constitution.<br><br>That's it. That's all they said.<br><br>The majority in *Dobbs* held that there is no constitutional right to<br>abortion under either the Due Process Clause or the Equal Protection<br>Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Relatedly, although the Dobbs<br>majority did not directly address the argument, Justice Kavanaugh's<br>concurrence observed that "no Justice of this Court has ever advanced"<br>the so-called "fetal personhood" argument that the Fourteenth Amendment<br>requires states to prohibit abortion (a view advocated by some amici in<br>*Dobbs*).<br><br>The *effect* of this ruling is that there are only a few *potential*<br>methods by which Congress could have the authority to regulate abortion.<br>Potentially the Commerce Clause or the Spending Clause could be used to<br>either enhance or restrict the ability of states to regulate abortion,<br>but ultimately SCOTUS shut down most of what the Federal government<br>could do to either support or restrict abortion.<br><br>This means that the ability to either permit or restrict abortion is a<br>state issue, not a Federal one.<br><br>Biden's handlers are well aware of this fact. They'll continue to have<br>him tell anyone who will listen that he wants Congress to codify *Roe*<br>into law, even though he knows full well that there's no way in Hades<br>that such a thing will ever be attempted, let alone succeed. Those sorts<br>of talking points are just pandering to one's base.<br><br>The SCOTUS ruling does not mean that making laws about abortion is<br>unconstitutional. It simply means that there is no Constitutional right<br>to get an abortion (like the right to freedom of speech or the right to<br>be free from unreasonable search and seizure). Laws can be passed...if<br>you can get consensus to do so.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
