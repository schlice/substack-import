<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>1.  That law did not exist at the time of Mary, so no, there was no such<br>    thing as statutory rape.<br>2.  There was no intercourse in the creation of Jesus. God is<br>    immaterial, so He is incapable of having sex. Because no sin was<br>    passed down through the line of a physical father, Jesus was born<br>    *sinless*. He remained sinless throughout His entire life, which<br>    enabled Him to take on the sins of the world on the cross. If Christ<br>    was conceived through sexual intercourse, He would not have been<br>    able to be born sinless, and would not have accomplished His<br>    mission.<br><br>See? I turned your disgusting, irreverent, disingenuous troll question<br>into a mini-Scriptural lesson. You're welcome.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
