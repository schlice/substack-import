<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Isn\'t everyone who is physically within the borders of the United<br>States \'subject to the jurisdiction thereof \'?**<br><br>No, at least not in the sense that the 14th Amendment reads.<br><br>We tend to think about "jurisdiction" in terms of laws. If you're in a<br>state, you are subject to the jurisdiction of that state, and even if<br>you are a resident of another state, you can be charged under that<br>state's laws if you violate them.<br><br>The 14th Amendment reads:<br><br>> *All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to<br>> the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the<br>> State wherein they reside.*<br><br>In a very literal reading, this says that if you're born in the United<br>States, you are a citizen of the United States.<br><br>But let's dissect this a little bit more carefully.<br><br>The first clause says:<br><br>> All persons born or naturalized in the United States<br>><br>> AND<br>><br>> subject to the jurisdiction thereof<br><br>Just a simple dissection of this phrase shows that, at the time the<br>Amendment was written, there was a group of people who could be born or<br>naturalized in the United States AND NOT subject to the jurisdiction<br>thereof.<br><br>This means that our interpretation of "subject to the jurisdiction<br>thereof" does not match what the writers of the 14th Amendment intended.<br><br>Senator Jacob Howard worked closely with Abraham Lincoln in drafting and<br>passing the 13th Amendment (which abolished slavery). He also served on<br>the Senate Joint Committee on Reconstruction, which drafted the 14th<br>Amendment. In 1866, Senator Howard clearly spelled out the intent of the<br>14th Amendment by writing (emphasis mine):<br><br>> Every person born within the limits of the United States, and subject<br>> to their jurisdiction, is by virtue of natural law and national law a<br>> citizen of the United States. **This will not, of course, include<br>> persons born in the United States who are foreigners, aliens, who<br>> belong to the families of ambassadors or foreign ministers accredited<br>> to the Government of the United States**, but will include every other<br>> class of persons. It settles the great question of citizenship and<br>> removes all doubt as to what persons are or are not citizens of the<br>> United States. This has long been a great desideratum in the<br>> jurisprudence and legislation of this country.<br><br>Through a series of court cases which established case law, we have come<br>to the incorrect understanding that the 14th Amendment applies to<br>"aliens" when, at the time it was written, it did not.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
