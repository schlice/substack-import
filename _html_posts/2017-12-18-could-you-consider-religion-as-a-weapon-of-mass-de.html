<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Unless you can somehow manage to cobble a million Bibles into a huge<br>ball and drop it from an airplane, then it is unlikely that religion<br>(which is an idea, not a thing) does any destroying of anything.<br><br>On the other hand, people (in the name of religion) do manage to<br>destroy lots of things, and kill lots of people. Many major religions<br>have either done this in the past, or are actively doing it today.<br><br>This does not make religion a weapon. It makes religion an *ideology*,<br>which people will follow and cause chaos.<br><br>The religion is not the weapon. The people are.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
