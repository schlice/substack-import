<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>As you can see by my credential, I am exactly the person you are asking<br>about.<br><br>So the specific answer to your question is **it depends on who you<br>ask.**<br><br>If you ask a Roman Catholic, you\'re not a sinner by leaving the church,<br>you are an *apostate*. Catholics would say willingly becoming apostate<br>means you forego your salvation. Is that sinful? As it is a violation of<br>God\'s commands (according to them), then yes, it is a sin.<br><br>But to the Christian, it is not only not sinful, but it the most<br>salvific thing you can do. To the Christian, that act is what will get<br>your heart in a right state. That act will save you!<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
