<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>If you don't even call your PO and tell him what the doctor said, then<br>maybe he'll try to revoke you for failing to report. But if you at least<br>work with him and tell him that your doctor ordered bed rest, revoking<br>you for not reporting would be something you could appeal to the Parole<br>Board. So long as you can show that you tried to work with the PO and<br>he's being stupid about it, you should be fine.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>If a doctor places you on bed rest, can your probation officer revoke<br>you for not reporting?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
