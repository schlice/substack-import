<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Emergency First Responders - What should a civilian do when they see a<br>car accident?**<br><br>If you can assist *safely*, please do assist. However, remember you're<br>not in an emergency vehicle. You don't have bright flashing lights on<br>your car that can notify other drivers that something out of the<br>ordinary is happening in traffic. You must be vigilant while you're<br>assisting.<br><br>So here's a quick checklist on what you should do when you arrive at the<br>scene of an accident:<br><br>- Make sure you can assist safely. It helps no one if you get hurt<br>  while you're trying to help someone else.<br>- Next, call 911. Explain the situation as best you can and stay on<br>  the phone and on the scene if you can until the police arrive.<br>- Don't move anyone unless they can move on their own, or unless<br>  their life is in danger by leaving them in place (i.e. the car is on<br>  fire or they're lying in traffic). Otherwise, treat them in place.<br>- Make sure everyone can breathe and there's no spurting blood.<br>  Remember the Four B's: breathing, bleeding, breaks, and burns.<br>  Treat in that order. They may be bleeding from a cut but if they can't<br>  breathe they'll be dead before you can stop the bleeding.
