<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Rather than start with the law, I'd like to first talk about the<br>technology.<br><br>The technology in question is called RFID - Radio Frequency ID. The way<br>it works is pretty simple:<br><br>1.  A fixed transceiver sends out an electromagnetic signal.<br>2.  A receiver in an RFID chip will receive that electromagnetic signal<br>    in a coil of wire, which induces an electrical current in that wire.<br>3.  The current powers a tiny transmitter, which sends a code.<br>4.  The transceiver receives the code.<br><br>The problem here is that RFID, as you can see, works in a very short<br>range. There are solutions which can work over longer distances, but<br>they are proprietary. Disney uses an RFID chip in their MagicBands, but<br>they also include a second radio, with an antenna that extends all the<br>way into the colored portion of the band, a 2.4 GHz transmitter, and a<br>button-cell battery to power the transmitter. They use XBR receivers<br>located throughout the park to receive the signals from these<br>MagicBands. There are two verified uses of the long-range XBR technology<br>at Disney so far:<br><br>- On certain rides, "ride videos" are created and are attached to the<br>  NextGen accounts of everyone on the ride, as determined by XBR<br>  receivers within the ride area.<br>- Lost Child operations are now greatly simplified if the child is<br>  wearing a MagicBand: park personnel can locate any MagicBand within<br>  the park and greatly narrow the search for a lost child.<br><br>Please note that this is all proprietary technology: there is no<br>long-range RFID equivalent. RFID itself only works at short distances.<br>So while the technology is out there, it is unrelated to an implantable<br>RFID chip. Perhaps at sometime in the future, we will be able to track a<br>low-power location chip embedded in a person anywhere in the world. But<br>with current technology, we can only track people within a confined<br>space, such as a building, using RFID.<br><br>Now, to the law.<br><br>1.  If you are a minor, your parents have legal responsibility for you.<br>    They are legally allowed to authorize medical procedures on your<br>    behalf, including implants.<br>2.  In order to successfully sue, you would have to show some harm from<br>    what they have done. If the implant has caused some demonstrable<br>    harm, your suit might have some legs.<br><br>TL;DR: One, RFID can't track you outside of a few feet, yet. Two,<br>you were presumably a minor when you were implanted, so it was legal for<br>them to do it. Three, you would have to show some harm if you expect<br>your lawsuit to be successful.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
