<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Is it reasonable that an employer be allowed to decide what kind of<br>health insurance you have?**<br><br>Is it reasonable that the entity who is contributing the lion's share of<br>the money to pay for your health insurance determine exactly what<br>insurance they are willing to pay for and what insurance they are not<br>willing to pay for?<br><br>The Supreme Court actually heard a similar case when they decided<br>*Burwell v. Hobby Lobby* in 2014. They held that Hobby Lobby did not<br>have to pay for contraceptive coverage for their employees. Granted,<br>this decision was specific to *closely-held corporations*, and it was<br>specific to the Affordable Care Act's contraceptive mandate, and it was<br>also granted that there were less restrictive alternatives available<br>(and then later, a government-sponsored birth control alternative for<br>women who worked for corporations which did not want to purchase birth<br>control). But the idea is the same: *if I'm paying for it, then I get to<br>determine exactly what I am willing, and what I am not willing, to pay<br>for.*<br><br>To that end, and with that understanding, yes it is reasonable that<br>an employer be allowed to decide what kind of health insurance they will<br>offer to you. Health insurance is offered as a fringe benefit of<br>employment.<br><br>You are under no obligation to accept their health insurance, even if<br>you do work for them. You are also under no obligation to work there.<br>You are always free to find another job at another employer whose health<br>plans are more acceptable to you.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
