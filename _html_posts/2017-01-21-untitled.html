<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>So that there is no further ambiguity, do yo feel that you "had MS,"<br>then changed your diet, and you "cured your MS?"<br><br>Or are you saying that you found a strategy that works for you in<br>controlling inflammation to such a degree that you haven\'t had a<br>relapse in a very long time, but you still have MS? And if this is the<br>case, how do you know you still have MS? MRI results? Somebody tells you<br>that you still have it?<br><br>Some other important tidbits you neglected to add:<br><br>- Are you taking any of the approved MS drugs?<br>- If not, have you ever taken any of them?<br>- Are you under the care of a neurologist?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/I-have-suffered-from-Multiple-sclerosis-since-1984-and-my-question-is-why-am-I-now-95-Ambulatory-after-all-this-time/answer/Roger-Deuxmont<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
