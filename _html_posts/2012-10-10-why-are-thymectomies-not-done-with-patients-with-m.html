<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Thymectomies are not done for MS because the disease<br>action between the two diseases is different.\<br>\<br>Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune disorder in which weakness is<br>caused by antibodies that block acetylcholine receptors at the<br>post-synaptic neuromuscular junction, causing muscle weakness. Up to 75%<br>of MG patients have some form of thymus abnormality; of these, roughly<br>10% present with thymomas. In cases which are exacerbated by thymus<br>abnormality, the disease process will generally remit once a thymectomy<br>is performed. Thus, in some cases, thymectomy is the appropriate<br>treatment.\<br>\<br>Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is also an autoimmune disorder, but the disease<br>process involves T-lymphocytes attacking and destroying the myelin<br>sheath surrounding nerve cells within the CNS. The resultant plaques<br>(scleroses) are areas through which there is decreased signal<br>transmission speed, resulting in weaker muscle responses than the brain<br>intended. The thymus has not been shown to be a part of the disease<br>process; however, research is ongoing and the thymus has not been<br>completely ruled out. That said, because in most cases the thymus is not<br>involved in the disease process, thymectomy is not a recommended<br>treatment course.]<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*This answer is not professional medical advice**, nor is it a<br>substitute for professional medical advice.
