<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [1. Using force against a police officer, ever, is an<br>aggravated felony, regardless of why you did it. Your bravado and the<br>sense that you\'re defending your girlfriend\'s honor by physically<br>attacking a police officer will absolutely, without any shadow of a<br>doubt, land you in jail for at least a year, and will cost you a pretty<br>penny as well. Never, never use force against a police officer. The<br>person who recently pistol-whipped the detective will be going to jail<br>for a long time. Facebook may have applauded him, but the judge won\'t<br>be so kind.\<br>\<br>2. If your girlfriend doesn\'t respect you because you failed to assault<br>a police officer, kick her to the curb. Quick.\<br>\<br>3. If police officers can create such an airtight case against you by<br>planting evidence and fabricating all the evidence needed to convict you<br>in court, there\'s not a darn thing you can do about it. You\'re just<br>screwed. Maybe trying to pay for better lawyers might help, but I highly<br>doubt it.\<br>\<br>4. If the police harass you, follow the normal guidelines we provide for<br>dealing with police officers: do what they tell you at the scene, then<br>file written complaints against the officer with their commander or with<br>Internal Affairs if their department has one. If you can, retain an<br>attorney and sue the department.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
