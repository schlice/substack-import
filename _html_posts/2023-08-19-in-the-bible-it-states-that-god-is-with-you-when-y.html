title: '"In the Bible it states that God is with you when you walk the right path.
  But what about when you are on the wrong one? Does he/she leave you? What if you
  lose faith does he/she leave you then too? Does he/she pick and choose when to be
  beside you?"'

<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I take it you've never heard "Footprints," have you?<br><br>> One night I dreamed a dream.\<br>> As I was walking along the beach with my Lord.\<br>> Across the dark sky flashed scenes from my life.\<br>> For each scene, I noticed two sets of footprints in the sand,\<br>> One belonging to me and one to my Lord.<br>><br>> After the last scene of my life flashed before me,\<br>> I looked back at the footprints in the sand.\<br>> I noticed that at many times along the path of my life,\<br>> especially at the very lowest and saddest times,\<br>> there was only one set of footprints.<br>><br>> This really troubled me, so I asked the Lord about it.\<br>> \"Lord, you said once I decided to follow you,\<br>> You\'d walk with me all the way.\<br>> But I noticed that during the saddest and most troublesome times of my<br>> life,\<br>> there was only one set of footprints.\<br>> I don\'t understand why, when I needed You the most, You would leave<br>> me.\"<br>><br>> He whispered, \"My precious child, I love you and will never leave<br>> you\<br>> Never, ever, during your trials and testings.\<br>> When you saw only one set of footprints,\<br>> It was then that I carried you.\" --- Author Unknown<br><br>God is always with you, whether you willingly walk beside Him, or<br>whether your path tends to stray away from His. He will always be there,<br>gently guiding you back on to His path for your life.<br><br>And what I've noticed through my handful of decades walking this walk is<br>that if you are obedient and you allow Him to guide your path, **your<br>walk becomes significantly easier.** The times in my life where I chose<br>to "make my own decisions" and "go it alone" without God's guidance and<br>wisdom have been the most challenging times in my life.<br><br>I'm not saying that all of our challenges are self-inflicted. What I am<br>saying is that if you let God lead you, He will lead you down a path<br>which will ultimately benefit you.<br><br>> "For I know the plans I have for you," declares the Lord,\<br>> "plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and<br>> a future." --- Jeremiah 29:11<br><br>Even God's plans may be a bit rocky, but if we persevere, His plans will<br>lead us to fullness.<br><br>I think of it as a tandem bike riding down a wooded path. We all tend to<br>want to be in the front, driving the bike, and we tend to want to put<br>God on the back. When we do this, we may initially prosper, but we may<br>end up going off of the path God has planned for us.<br><br>Until one day, we finally decide that we want God to lead the course of<br>our life, so we pull over and we say, "Okay God, you drive." He looks at<br>you and says, "Sit down, shut up, and hold on." Then He gets on the<br>front and starts going, *and suddenly veers the bike off of the path and<br>into the trees!* And you're flying down a hill, bumping and bouncing<br>like crazy, and you're literally doing the best you can to hold on. But<br>then, you emerge, and you break out into the most picturesque meadow you<br>have ever seen in your entire life (think postcard-style meadow).<br><br>And if you hadn't trusted God to drive, and endured the bumps along the<br>way, you never would have found this majestic place.<br><br>Our walk with God is similar. If you let Him lead, you certainly will<br>not go down the path you intended to go on. Your journey will be filled<br>with bumps and bounces. It will sometimes feel chaotic. **But you have<br>to trust God to bring you through it**. And when you do, it will be like<br>nothing you could ever have imagined.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
