<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>It does indeed seem that full-sized pickup trucks are getting larger and<br>larger in an apparent attempt to piss off everyone else on the road.<br><br>It is true that trucks are indeed getting larger every year. But it's<br>not happening to piss people off. **It's happening thanks to the US<br>government.** And it happens because of a standard called CAFE.<br><br>The Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards are fleet-wide<br>averages that automakers must meet for their cars and trucks each year.<br>The purpose of CAFE is to reduce energy consumption by increasing the<br>fuel economy of cars and light trucks. The CAFE standards were first<br>enacted by Congress in 1975. Since 1978, each automaker has had to meet<br>the CAFE standards for their car and truck fleets.<br><br>The CAFE standards for passenger cars and light-duty trucks in the U.S.<br>is 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025. This was set under the Obama<br>Administration, and it was repealed under the Trump administration. In<br>place of CAFE standards, the Trump administration created Safer<br>Affordable Fuel-Efficient (SAFE) standards to give manufacturers more<br>freedom and reduce the quality-adjusted prices of vehicles by an average<br>of \$2,200. While SAFE 1 still increased fuel economy standards, it did<br>so at a slower rate than the standards proposed by Obama's<br>administration. SAFE 1 also proposed that manufacturers comply with the<br>standards by focusing on greenhouse gas emission standards because of<br>the subsequent ability to help reach CAFE standards. SAFE 1 ultimately<br>sought to loosen the annual fuel efficiency increase from 5% to 1.5%<br>through 2026.\[1\](#XSAgK){#cite-XSAgK .citation_link}<br><br>SAFE 1 has since been repealed by the Biden administration for<br>overstepping the agency's legal authority and for not taking local and<br>national interests into account. Under the new administration, the NHTSA<br>finalized CAFE standards for model years 2024-2026 on March 31, 2022.<br>These recently passed standards require about 49 miles per gallon for<br>all light-duty vehicles by 2026 by increasing fuel efficiency by 8%<br>annually for the years 2024 and 2025, and 10% annually for the year<br>2026.<br><br>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) found that<br>the 49 miles per gallon standard could save consumers nearly \$1,400 in<br>total fuel expenses over the lifetime of compliant vehicles. It could<br>also save 234 billion gallons of gas between 2030 and 2050.<br><br>The CAFE standards are determined with a mathematical formula based on<br>vehicle footprints. The goal is to prevent automakers from meeting the<br>mileage requirement by reducing vehicle size and weight, which could<br>reduce vehicle safety. Making the vehicles smaller would automatically<br>increase their fuel economy, as the engines have less mass to move.<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-d343c0b31c1162ce3b0e03bfa768dad4){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-d343c0b31c1162ce3b0e03bfa768dad4"<br>master_w="1000" master_h="778"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>What has happened in the industry is the *inverse*. Rather than making<br>vehicles *smaller* to meet the standards, they made the vehicles<br>*larger* so that they could meet the *lower* standards.<br><br>This growing of truck sizes has a natural limit, but it does push out<br>the requirement for fuel efficiency a few years, and gives physics the<br>opportunity to catch up.<br><br>Therefore, you see trucks getting larger.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-XSAgK){.citation_index} [[Introduction To Corporate<br>Average Fuel (CAFE) Standards \|<br>ACE](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=15915d&url=https://ace-usa.org/blog/research/research-environmental-policy/introduction-to-corporate-average-fuel-cafe-standards){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="ace-usa.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
