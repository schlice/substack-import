<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Among Catholic rules of conduct, which are for all people, and which<br>are only for Catholics? For example, can it be argued that a law against<br>in vitro fertilization in the USA wouldn\'t violate the \"equal<br>protection\" clause of the 14th amendment?**<br><br>I don't think I understand.<br><br>The "law" against in-vitro fertilization is not a law. It's religious<br>guidance. And it only affects Catholics, and it only affects them<br>insofar as they voluntarily follow the rules of their religion.<br><br>You can choose to leave the Catholic religion at any time you like, and<br>follow another Christian religion that more closely aligns with your<br>personal beliefs. Or, you can stay a Catholic and not follow their rules<br>(at your own Catholic peril, of course). Your choice.<br><br>But because you have a choice, it doesn't make your religious "law" a<br>legal requirement for anyone, including Catholics.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
