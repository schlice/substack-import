<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: [There are some devices that you can supposedly buy on eBay<br>that will supposedly open locked car doors. Something like this out of<br>China is available on a website named [[ADK Auto Diagnostic<br>Tool](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=5a23bb&url=http://www.adkautodiagnostic.com/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="adkautodiagnostic.com"}]{.qlink_container}:\<br>]<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-7a3af2fb086934419445e96653fa4d3b){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-7a3af2fb086934419445e96653fa4d3b" master_w="500"<br>master_h="333"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>\<br>It\'s dubious whether or not something like this would work. It would<br>have to record the keypress and then play it back later. And if your<br>keyfob uses rolling-code technology, they would literally have minutes<br>(or possibly less than a minute) to unlock your vehicle becore the code<br>rolled over.\<br>\<br>If your keyfob uses a static code, it\'s possible that there is a<br>brute-force device out there that might be used to roll through all the<br>codes. It would take several minutes to do, but it is theoretically<br>possible. Most folks wouldn\'t be able to build something like that, and<br>most thieves wouldn\'t be smart enough to use one.\<br>\<br>This article at DailyTech has quite a bit more of the technical bits<br>involved in what a hack like this might look like, along with the gear<br>involved. It\'s probably going to be more complex than your average car<br>thief could pull off.\<br>\<br>[[Are \"Keyless Entry\" Hacks Really the Source of Recent Car Break<br>Ins?](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=c1852b&url=http://www.dailytech.com/Are%2BKeyless%2BEntry%2BHacks%2BReally%2Bthe%2BSource%2Bof%2BRecent%2BCar%2BBreak%2BIns/article37339.htm){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="dailytech.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/How-do-the-devices-work-that-thieves-use-to-open-cars-with-electronic-locks-How-do-we-protect-ourselves-from-those-devices/answer/Bill-Stein<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
