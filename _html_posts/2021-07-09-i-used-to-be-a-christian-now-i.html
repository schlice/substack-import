<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Ultimately, it depends on what you mean by "I used to be a Christian."<br><br>What is it that you no longer believe in? Do you simply say that you're<br>not Christian anymore so you don't have to go to church? When you say<br>"spiritual but not religious" do you simply believe that there is a<br>"higher power" that is all around us but you can't put your finger on<br>it, or you simply don't care to? Like your higher power could even be<br>the collective consciousness and goodwill of all of the people in the<br>room, or something like that?<br><br>Are you still saved? It depends on whether or not you were ever saved in<br>the first place. Because I find it hard to believe that you truly<br>believed that Christ was your savior and he died for your sins, but now<br>you don't. What changed? What led you to believe that Christ did not die<br>for your sins? In my view, it doesn't look like you were ever saved in<br>the first place.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>I used to be a Christian. Now I\'m spiritual but not religious. Am I<br>still saved?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
