<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I find it odd that a normal functioning adult would not understand the<br>difference between assault and corporal punishment, but here we are.<br><br>So let's make sure we focus on state law, since the laws we are<br>discussing are all state-level laws. And with that in mind, let's also<br>remember that we have 50 separate, sovereign states, and they all have<br>their own laws. So just for argument's sake, I'll discuss Florida's laws<br>first and foremost.<br><br>Let's start with children. Corporal punishment is an approved method of<br>parental discipline in Florida, so long as it does not cause "harm."<br><br>However, the Florida statute lists the following as not valid or legal<br>methods of corporal punishment:<br><br>- Anything involving a deadly weapon<br>- Inflicting cuts, bites, lacerations, punctures, etc.<br>- Burning or scalding<br>- Damaging the brain or spinal cord<br>- Fracturing any bones or the skull<br>- Causing intracranial hemorrhaging or injury to the organs<br>- Drowning, suffocating, asphyxiation<br>- Any kind of disfigurement or discipline that would result in a body<br>  part not functioning or being impaired in function<br>- Causing significant bruising or welting<br>- Dislocating, spraining, or damaging the cartilage of the body<br><br>Additionally, the statute lays out conduct that could be seen as legal<br>"harm":<br><br>- Forcing, encouraging, or allowing the child victim to be sexually<br>  exploited, like engaging in prostitution<br>- Exposing the child to alcohol or drugs<br>- Abandoning the child<br>- Neglecting the child<br>- Committing, encouraging, or allowing lascivious or lewd acts or sexual<br>  battery to be committed against the child<br><br>\<br><br>When referring to adults, corporal punishment by parents no longer<br>applies. At this point, it becomes assault, which is a crime.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
