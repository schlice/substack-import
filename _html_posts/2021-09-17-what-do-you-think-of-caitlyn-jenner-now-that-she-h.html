<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The last time I tried to talk about abortion on this very platform, I<br>was told, in no uncertain terms, that my opinion didn't matter "because<br>I was unable to have an abortion or carry a child to term."<br><br>Therefore, employing the same Quora logic, Caitlyn Jenner's opinion also<br>doesn't matter, for exactly the same reason.<br><br>Interesting. When it comes to everything else, a woman can be whatever<br>you want it to be, but when it comes to abortion, Caitlyn Jenner isn't a<br>real woman. So either we know exactly what a real woman is, or we don't.<br><br>\<still scratching my head\><br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>What do you think of Caitlyn Jenner now that she has come out in favor<br>of the new Texas abortion ban?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
