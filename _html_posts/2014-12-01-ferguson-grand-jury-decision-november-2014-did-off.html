<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: Absolutely, positively, [NOT{.underline}.\<br>\<br>Officer Wilson was personally threatened with physical harm. Other<br>members of the Ferguson Police Department were threatened with physical<br>harm. There is no way that Officer Wilson can continue to act as a law<br>enforcement officer and still be expected to command respect, after the<br>massive smear campaign perpetrated by the media.\<br>\<br>Even Sir Charles Barkley said today that the media misled the public,<br>because they \"\...love this stuff \race issues\, and lead people to<br>jump to conclusions. The media shouldn\'t do that. They never do that<br>when black people kill each other.\"\<br>\<br>So, in order to protect his fellow officers, and to protect himself and<br>his family, he resigned.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
