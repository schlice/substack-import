<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Are new U.S. States required to ratify the Constitution?<br><br>No, not ratify. It's already been ratified and has been the legal ruling<br>document in the United States for over 200 years. The original 13<br>colonies (the first 13 states) ratified the Constitution.<br><br>The Constitution itself, since the ratification, guides the admission of<br>new states (see Article IV, Section 3, Clause 2). We can use the example<br>of how states previously joined the Union to see how it occurs, and how<br>it might occur again. Let's imagine that the only real contender in our<br>modern time, Puerto Rico, decides it wants to become the 51st state.<br><br>Here's how the process works:<br><br>- Usually, a state is formed out of an existing territory. The organized<br>  government of that territory makes it known that they want to become a<br>  state. Usually, this is done by a *referendum*, which is a special<br>  vote of the entire population of the territory.<br>- Congress would then direct that territorial government to draft a<br>  state constitution using a constitutional convention. The state<br>  constitution must not contradict the US Constitution; in general, it<br>  mirrors the US Constitution. The people of the territory would accept<br>  that state constitution as their governing document.<br>- Congress would then review that state constitution, ensure it does not<br>  contradict the US Constitution, and Congress would then have to vote<br>  to admit that state to the union. Congress is under no obligation to<br>  admit a state to the union, but they must vote to allow a state into<br>  the union. Congress would adopt a joint resolution granting statehood.<br>- The President would make a proclamation announcing that a new state<br>  has been added to the union. The President is not involved in the<br>  process of admitting a state; admission of states is ultimately under<br>  the control of Congress.<br><br>This process has been mostly followed for the entire time we have<br>admitted states to the union. There have been a few one-off instances<br>where the process was modified, but for the most part, this is the<br>process by which a territory becomes a state.<br><br>There is no ratification of the Constitution required. Statehood implies<br>that the new state becomes automatically bound by the US Constitution,<br>and all of its rights are assigned to all citizens of that state.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
