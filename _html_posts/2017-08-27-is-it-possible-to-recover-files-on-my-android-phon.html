<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>You don't need the battery to power the phone...just plug it in. It<br>should turn on while plugged in.<br><br>If you have plugged it in and it still won't turn on, then perhaps you<br>can get a replacement battery to simply power the unit on to restore<br>your files. Although I'd be really surprised to find an Android phone<br>which won't power on just simply being plugged in, dead battery or not.<br>But you can try replacing the battery.<br><br>If the data isn't backed up somewhere and you need access to it that<br>badly, perhaps you could buy a replacement handset on eBay just for<br>parts and swap parts in until it starts working. Alternatively, if the<br>data is that valuable, you can take it to a local repair shop who should<br>be able to get it running, and the cost would have to be less than the<br>hassle to recreate the data.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
