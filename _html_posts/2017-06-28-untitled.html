<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>This is actually in the CBO scores. You do have to go read the scores<br>yourself; you can't rely on anyone (especially news agencies which have<br>agendas) to give you the full picture. And in re-checking my figures,<br>it's 15 million, not 16. (Math --- not my strong suit).<br><br>And what those CBO numbers tell you is that repealing the tax on the<br>uninsured would next year induce 7 million people to cancel their<br>individual insurance policies, 4 million to drop their job-based<br>coverage, and 4 million others to dump Medicaid, **even though the<br>government provides it free of charge** in most cases. If the CBO is<br>right (and that's fairly questionable anyway), then 15 million people<br>would immediately take advantage of a provision of the new law which<br>would no longer require them to purchase a product they don't want and<br>don't feel they need.<br><br>As for the tax numbers, last January the IRS commissioner reported to<br>Congress on the number of uninsured people who paid the tax, got a<br>waiver, or simply refused to indicate whether or not they had insurance.<br>Those specific numbers for you:<br><br>- 6.2 million uninsured people paid the tax on the uninsured<br>- 12.7 million uninsured people got waivers<br>- 4.3 million people simply didn't check the box indicating whether or<br>  not they had insurance. Incidentally, the IRS did not penalize these<br>  people for failing to disclose whether or not they had insurance.<br><br>That's 23.2 million Americans who paid the tax, avoided the tax with a<br>waiver, or simply ignored the law.<br><br>So as I read this, this law will instantly make 38.2 million people<br>happy, and it's rare that Congress can pass a single law which would do<br>that.<br><br>> *And besides, if these people would drop insurance because they can\'t<br>> afford it, then I would say that this bill is not going to help<br>> anything there.*<br><br>Do you remember when they had debtor's prison in England? That was a<br>stupid idea, wasn't it? Put people in jail when they can't pay their<br>debts. You're guaranteed to not be able to pay your debts in prison.<br><br>The Obamacare mandate was debtor's prison for the poor. You can't afford<br>health insurance because we've forced so many provisions into it that<br>we've made it quite unaffordable. Can't afford it? We'll increase your<br>taxes instead!<br><br>What I'm trying to say is that Obamacare was lose-lose for the poor. The<br>only way they could afford these expensive plans was subsidies, paid for<br>by the government, because you forced everyone else to buy insurance.<br>But that didn't work because the economies of scale failed. Forcing<br>people to buy a product they don't want is a losing proposition.<br><br>The only way to fix that is to make less expensive plans. And the only<br>way to do that is to repeal Obamacare's mandates for what must be in an<br>insurance plan, allowing insurers to offer cheaper plans, which was the<br>goal in the first place, right?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/How-does-CBO-calculate-the-patient-coverage-estimates-for-the-Senate-and-House-Obamacare-repeal-bills/answer/Bill-Stein<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
