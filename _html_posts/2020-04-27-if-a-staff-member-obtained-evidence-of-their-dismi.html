If not why not punish the hacking crime separately<br>instead of forbidding the evidence?**<br><br>As long as the "staff member" is not the government, then usually the<br>evidence is admissible.<br><br>The "fruit of the poisonous tree" doctrine is an extension of the<br>Exclusionary Rule. This rule was established in *Mapp v. Ohio* in 1961.<br>Basically, the Exclusionary Rule prevents the government from using most<br>evidence gathered in violation of the Constitution. If evidence was<br>located that falls within the scope of the rule, and this evidence leads<br>the government to more evidence, which they would not have found<br>otherwise, this new evidence is excluded. This "new evidence" is called<br>"fruit of the poisonous tree."<br><br>There are certain situations in which the new evidence is not excluded:<br><br>- If the illegally obtained evidence could be obtained legally by some<br>  other means<br>- *Inevitable discovery,* if the evidence would have eventually been<br>  legally discovered (other than by obtaining a search warrant)<br>- *Attenuation of the taint*, if the "taint" (the illegal procurement of<br>  evidence) becomes so "attenuated" from the eventual discovery of that<br>  evidence that it serves no legitimate purpose to suppress it.<br><br>It is also well known that the exclusionary rule is only binding on the<br>government (i.e. the police and/or the prosecuting attorney). If the<br>police receive unsolicited evidence of a crime, but that evidence was<br>obtained illegally, the police are still allowed to use that evidence.<br><br>TL;DR: As long as the police or the government didn't request that<br>evidence, or request you hack anything to get it, it can usually be<br>used, even if it was illegally obtained.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
