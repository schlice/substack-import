<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If an employer wants you to sign a written warning but you disagree<br>with it, should you sign it?**<br><br>Generally in the US, signing a warning is only an acknowledgement that<br>you received the warning. It is not an acceptance or agreement with the<br>contents of the warning. Generally, the warning document also explains<br>that your signature only verifies receipt of the warning, it does not<br>imply agreement or acknowledgement of any wrongdoing.<br><br>If the warning does not explicitly state the above, you can always write<br>"SIGNED UNDER PROTEST" above your signature and then sign it, or you<br>could refuse to sign it. Refusal to sign will be noted on the form by<br>the person delivering the warning (usually your supervisor) and will be<br>yet another red mark against you (the first one being the one triggering<br>the warning in the first place). You might therefore consider refusal to<br>acknowledge the warning as "strike two" which makes your future with<br>that employer seem less bright.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
