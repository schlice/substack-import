<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>No.<br><br>Because if you're born male, you'll always be male. No amount of surgery<br>or hormone injections will ever make you female. You'll never be a<br>"female-enough male" to participate in female sports.<br><br>Trans females are *unquestionably* biologically male and will never,<br>ever be female, regardless of the plastic surgery or the amount or<br>duration of hormone therapy they do.<br><br>People who are unquestionably one biological gender should not be<br>permitted to engage in sporting events which are exclusive to another<br>biological gender.<br><br>\<br><br>That said, we have a much bigger problem with how to handle *intersex*<br>people, which are an ocean's difference from *transgender* people.<br>Intersex people have an extremely rare condition that results in<br>apparent sex ambiguity. Their bodies are ambiguous, and biologically it<br>takes much more effort to determine an appropriate sporting category.<br>Transgender people, however, **aren't biologically sexually ambiguous at<br>all** but merely claim to identify as something other than their<br>biological sex, *regardless of what plastic surgery or hormone therapy<br>you have done*.<br><br>**But the existence of a tiny handful of intersex cases is completely<br>irrelevant to the issue of allowing unambiguous biological males in<br>female sports.**<br><br>\<br><br>Any "transgender policy" designed to protect female spaces and female<br>sporting events need only specify that participants must have been<br>recorded female at birth on their original birth certificates. If the<br>birth certificate was never issued (or someone wants to question their<br>birth certificate), then biology determines what your gender is for the<br>purpose of participating in sporting competition, not personal feelings<br>about your gender.<br><br>Crafting effective intersex policies is more complicated, but a much<br>less pressing issue for protecting the integrity of women's sports.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
