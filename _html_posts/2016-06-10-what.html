<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>+1 for everyone who says a physical keyboard. There is no screen-based<br>technology that allows me to type highly technical emails as quickly or<br>as accurately as that physical keyboard on a Blackberry. It simply<br>cannot be beat, hands down.<br><br>I do really miss the physical keyboard, and if it was useful enough, I'd<br>get a BB again just to have the keyboard.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
