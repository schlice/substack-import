<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Thanks for the A2A. The \"black box\" is actually two<br>boxes known as a Flight Data Recorder and a Cockpit Voice Recorder. Both<br>devices record the information they receive on solid-state storage<br>media, like flash drives. The FDR records \"telemetry\" information,<br>such as the aircraft\'s location and \"attitude,\" how it was positioned<br>in the sky, as well as the settings for all the controls and control<br>surfaces (flaps, ailerons, rudder, etc). The CVR records all voice<br>conversations, whether they were broadcast over the radio or not. While<br>the aircrew is not keying a radio, their headsets and mics are always<br>on, and they can talk in a normal tone to each other over the noise of<br>the engines. Those conversations are continually recorded.\<br>\<br>]<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-ba27399823abe84386beb82a71388abe){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-ba27399823abe84386beb82a71388abe" master_w="352"<br>master_h="328"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>\<br>As you can see, the box has an underwater locator beacon attached to the<br>outside of it, which will ping for as long as its battery still has<br>charge, so that it can be located underwater. When a plane crashes in<br>water, essentially a big microphone is placed in the water, listening<br>for that beacon\'s \"ping\".<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
