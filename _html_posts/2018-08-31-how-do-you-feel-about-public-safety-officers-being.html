<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>It\'s not an ethical issue. Business owners can give away whatever they<br>choose, to whomever they choose.<br><br>However, it presents an image of favoritism, and if officers know they<br>get free stuff, they will frequent that place. That\'s not a bad thing<br>for the business owner, but it makes for the appearance of uneven,<br>unfair policing, favoring the businesses who can afford to give out free<br>stuff.<br><br>So in order to avoid even the appearance of impropriety, our agency and<br>others like it prohibit deputies from receiving anything for free while<br>on duty.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
