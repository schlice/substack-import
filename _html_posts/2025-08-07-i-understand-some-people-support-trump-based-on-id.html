<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**I understand some people support Trump based on ideological leanings,<br>but couldn\'t many of his followers be accurately classified as a<br>cult?**<br><br>No, for several reasons.<br><br>First of all, you might be able to call some Trump supporters as a<br>"cult," like the usage of the term "cult of personality." In the same<br>way,<br>"[Beliebers(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=a08e4b&url=https://justinbieber.fandom.com/wiki/Belieber){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="fandom.com"}]{.qlink_container}" are a cult.<br><br>But you used the nebulous term "many" and I'm not so sure that we agree<br>on exactly how many Trump supporters constitutes "many," and I'm also<br>not so sure you have a 100% accurate read on Trump supporters. I'm sure<br>anecdotally you've seen a few Trump supporters in your area, but I don't<br>think you have a good enough read of all Trump supporters to be able to<br>claim that "many" of his followers behave as if they are in a cult.<br><br>*<br>
