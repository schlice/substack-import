You can\'t be arrested<br>until you make overt actions towards committing a crime.\<br>\<br>So no, you can\'t pre-pay for your crime under the US justice system.<br>Your time in jail is for a specific reason, not as a hobby.\<br>\<br>Jails are too overcrowded to accommodate hobbyists.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
