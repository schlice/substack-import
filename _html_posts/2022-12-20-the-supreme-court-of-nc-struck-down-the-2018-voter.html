title: '"The Supreme Court of NC struck down the 2018 voter ID law which requires
  residents to present an ID before being able to vote, claiming it discriminates
  against the residents. Is requiring an ID to fly also unconstitutional following
  the same logic?"'

<br><br><h2>Space Submission</h2><br><div><br><br>Space name: Everything Republican<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>First of all, if I were representing the lawmakers in this case, I would<br>immediately appeal to SCOTUS. The reason the law was ruled<br>unconstitutional was because it allegedly \"was motivated by a racially<br>discriminatory purpose.\"<br><br>Frankly, the purpose why the law was implemented is wholly irrelevant.<br><br>The fact of the matter is that it may have been \"motivated by a<br>racially discriminatory purpose.\" That doesn't matter.<br><br>What matters is if it achieves its purpose. *Is* the law *actually<br>racially discriminatory?* For example, the racist people may have told<br>their staffers, "Write me a racially discriminatory law that unfairly<br>targets blacks and makes sure they can't vote" *and the staffers may<br>have written a completely race-neutral law* that doesn't discriminate<br>against anyone.<br><br>The intentions of the legislators does not matter. What matters is<br>the *actual application of the law.* They may have been racially<br>motivated, but if the actual law, as implemented, is race-neutral and<br>doesn't actually unfairly target any one race, then it should not be<br>unlawful.<br><br>The plaintiffs in this case (Democrats) argue that such voter ID<br>requirements are meant to tamp down voter turnout by minorities and<br>others who "are more likely not to have appropriate ID" and tend to vote<br>for their party. But what evidence of this claim exists? Can they even<br>show *one person* who cannot vote because they don't have appropriate<br>ID? How do these alleged people function? There are so many things in<br>life that require appropriate ID, and yet those things are not in<br>question here, because only voting is political. They claim that<br>minorities are more likely to not have appropriate ID, which is a racist<br>view in and of itself. **In order to claim racism, they have to be<br>racist.** But there is no proof that the actual alleged events actually<br>occur, because they know that if they could present one such person, we<br>could easily provide them with a state ID, as there are many mechanisms<br>available to help people get ID cards at little to no cost.<br><br>If this is allowed to stand, we open the door to question the<br>motivations of our lawmakers when they make laws, and judge perfectly<br>acceptable laws as unconstitutional because the motivations of the<br>lawmakers is suspect.<br><br>The whole idea behind our representative system of government includes<br>the fact that all people are flawed and selfish. There are no perfect<br>people, and there are certainly no perfect legislators. What matters is<br>not the motivation of the legislator, but the *actual effect of the laws<br>they write.*<br><br>\<br><br>\<stepping down off of soapbox\><br><br>Now, using the standard established in this case (the motivation of the<br>lawmakers determines whether or not the law is unconstitutional), if the<br>motivations of the lawmakers who made the laws requiring ID to fly were<br>found to be motivated by racism, then yes, the laws requiring ID to fly<br>would also be unconstitutional.<br><br>If the decision in NC is allowed to stand, I should hope that the same<br>group sues the Department of Homeland Security and argues that aircraft<br>passenger ID laws are similarly racist, as well as everything else which<br>requires ID (buying a gun, buying a house, buying alcohol, getting<br>government assistance, etc).<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
