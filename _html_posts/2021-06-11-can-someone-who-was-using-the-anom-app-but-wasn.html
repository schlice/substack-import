<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Before I answer your question, you need to understand how this app came<br>to be.<br><br>For years, police organizations around the world have been looking at<br>TOR and apps like Signal and Telegram, which provide their users<br>end-to-end encryption, and are exclusively used by criminals to hide<br>their planning for their crimes, and wondered how they can legally hack<br>these protocols. Clearly, while some piecemeal progress had been made<br>there, it was very limited, and it had (and still has today) very little<br>public support.<br><br>So the cops had a conversation amongst themselves. Here's an adaptation<br>of how that discussion went:<br><br>*"Hey, wouldn't it be cool if* *we* *built an encryption app that we<br>could monitor?"*<br><br>*"Yeah, that would be cool, but you know, we don't want honest people to<br>use it, so like, we don't want to put it out on the App Store or<br>anything like that."*<br><br>*"Yeah, okay, but we still need to make it sound legitimate to<br>criminals."*<br><br>*"OOO. I have an idea! Let's mod some Google devices, you know, remove<br>the cameras and voice capabilities, and only include the encrypted app<br>on them!"*<br><br>*"Yeah, and then we'll get some criminal influencers to vouch for the<br>device to their criminal buddies, and it will spread organically!"*<br><br>And that's exactly what they did. The ANOM app was only included on<br>specially-designed stripped-back Google Pixel devices. The devices had<br>no voice or camera functionality. Law enforcement provided more than 300<br>criminal syndicates in more than 100 different countries with about<br>12,000 devices. The French news agency AFP reported that the devices<br>containing the ANOM app were distributed over almost two years, allowing<br>agents to \"monitor their communications.\" Australian Federal Police<br>Commissioner Reece Kershaw said the communications were brazen with no<br>attempt to hide criminal plots using code words, according to the news<br>agency. \"We have been in the back pockets of organized crime,\" Kershaw<br>said. \"All they talk about is drugs, violence, hits on each other,<br>innocent people who are going to be murdered.\"<br><br>\"ANOM\'s distributors, administrators and agents had so much confidence<br>in the secrecy of their devices that they openly marketed them to other<br>potential users as designed by criminals for criminals,\" said Randy<br>Grossman, the acting U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of<br>California. \"But the devices were actually operated by the FBI.\"<br><br>When the global police organizations who were working on Operation<br>Trojan Shield were ready, they made busts:<br><br>- Australian authorities said they arrested 224 people and seized more<br>  than four tons of drugs and \$35 million in an ongoing operation that<br>  dates back three years. New Zealand police said they had arrested 35<br>  people and seized drugs and assets worth millions of dollars.<br>- The US Attorney's Office for the Southern District of California<br>  charged 17 foreign defendants who administered or distributed the<br>  devices with racketeering counts. Eight of the defendants were taken<br>  into custody Monday night, and the other nine are considered<br>  fugitives, officials said.<br>- Swedish police prevented a dozen planned killings and believe that<br>  they have arrested several \"leading actors in criminal networks,\"<br>  according to a statement from Linda Staaf, the head of Sweden\'s<br>  national criminal intelligence unit.<br>- Finnish police said Tuesday that nearly 100 people have been detained<br>  and more than 500 kilograms of drugs confiscated, along with dozens of<br>  guns and cash worth hundreds of thousands of dollars.<br>- German authorities said on Tuesday that police had arrested more than<br>  70 suspects and searched scores of sites as part of the global<br>  crackdown. The raids carried out on Monday were largely in the state<br>  of Hesse, according to the Frankfurt public prosecutors office. The<br>  Reuters news agency quoted the prosecutors office as saying police<br>  seized hundreds of pounds of narcotics, more than 20 weapons, dozens<br>  of luxury vehicles and more than \$250,000 worth of cash, as well as<br>  IT equipment. \[1\](#wexSs){#cite-wexSs .citation_link}<br><br>\<br><br>So, back to the original question. Here's your answer:<br><br>If you hold in your hand one of these devices and you were using the<br>ANOM app, and you're not in jail right now, you are either exceedingly<br>lucky or you just haven't been arrested yet. Because honestly, the only<br>people who had these devices and used them were, in fact, criminals.<br><br>If you happen to have one and you're not actually a criminal, hang on to<br>it for a year or so and then sell it on eBay because it will be a<br>collector's item and you'll make a lot of money on it. And by the way,<br>don't turn it on.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>**Can someone who was using the ANoM app but wasn\'t a criminal sue the<br>FBI for misrepresenting the app and reading their private messages?**<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-wexSs){.citation_index} [[\"Heavy blow against organized<br>crime\" after criminal \"kingmakers\" tricked into using FBI-run<br>messaging<br>app](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=cea74d&url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/anom-app-fbi-criminals-messaging-app/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="cbsnews.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
