<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I'm gonna bend your brain a little more.<br><br>You said that Jesus' DNA is said to come only from Mary. *Where,<br>exactly, does it say this? Is it in the Bible?* That's a rhetorical<br>question. It's not. So ultimately, this discussion is indeed purely<br>pedantic and hypothetical, as no one will ever know the actual genetic<br>makeup of Jesus. It's just an interesting thought experiment.<br><br>Also, before you all run screaming to the comments, none of this changes<br>Jesus' *lineage*, as Jesus' lineage came through adoption by Joseph. So<br>there is no question that the prophesy was still fulfilled in Jesus (He<br>came from the lineage of David).<br><br>There are actually three possibilities for the composition of Jesus'<br>DNA:<br><br>1.  Jesus was 100% Mary's DNA, and the Spirit simply provided the<br>    requisite Y chromosome to make him male.<br>2.  Jesus was 50% Mary's DNA and 50% DNA provided by the Spirit.<br>3.  Jesus was 100% DNA provided by the spirit, and Mary was the<br>    *surrogate mother*.<br><br>Catholics believe in possibility number 2. They claim that Jesus was<br>sinless because Mary was sinless. This is the doctrine of the Immaculate<br>Conception, which is often confused with Jesus' conception in Mary's<br>womb. In order to bypass the controversy caused by Jesus being half<br>human and Mary contributing that half, but Mary was born of sin herself,<br>the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception actually states that it was<br>Mary who was born without sin. Actually, Pope Pius IX declared in the<br>papal bull called *Ineffabilis Deus* that it was the doctrine of the<br>Immaculate Conception which made Jesus sinless:<br><br>> We declare, pronounce and define that the doctrine which holds that<br>> the Blessed Virgin Mary, at the first instant of her conception, by a<br>> singular privilege and grace of the Omnipotent God, in virtue of the<br>> merits of Jesus Christ, the Saviour of mankind, was preserved<br>> immaculate from all stain of original sin, has been revealed by God,<br>> and therefore should firmly and constantly be believed by all the<br>> faithful. ---â€‰Pope Pius IX, Ineffabilis Deus, December 8, 1854<br><br>Protestants do not believe this. Most Protestants (who have actually<br>studied the issue) believe in possibility number 3.<br><br>When Martin Luther initiated the Reformation, he said:<br><br>> Mother Mary, like us, was born in sin of sinful parents, but the Holy<br>> Spirit covered her, sanctified and purified her so that this child was<br>> born of flesh and blood, but not with sinful flesh and blood. The Holy<br>> Spirit permitted the Virgin Mary to remain a true, natural human being<br>> of flesh and blood, just as we. However, he warded off sin from her<br>> flesh and blood so that she became the mother of a pure child, not<br>> poisoned by sin as we are. For in that moment when she conceived, she<br>> was a holy mother filled with the Holy Spirit and her fruit is a holy<br>> pure fruit, at once God and truly man, in one<br>> person.\[1\](#wJsye){#cite-wJsye .citation_link}<br><br>To me, it is more likely that Mary carried, protected and nourished a<br>fully-formed zygote which was implanted in her by the Spirit. In this<br>way, it was completely free from the human sin nature. Protestants also<br>believe that the sin nature is passed through the *male* side of the<br>parental structure, so the absence of a male in the genetics would<br>obviate the generativity of the sin.<br><br>However, there is still the question of Mary's sin nature. The Bible<br>supports the understanding that God intervened only once in human<br>genealogy when Jesus became man. God did not intervene to create Mary<br>without sin. Instead, God picked Mary as the woman who would birth His<br>Son because of His grace, not because Mary was sinless. The zygote<br>implanted in Mary's womb was already without sin, because it was not<br>formed *from* a human.<br><br>Some may argue that this doesn't make Jesus human. Yet Adam was formed<br>without a mother, and he was still considered completely human. And<br>Jesus is the fulfillment of the story which began with Adam, so it makes<br>sense that they would be formed the same way.<br><br>Other important things to note: Jesus was not only without sin, but he<br>was without human genetic defect which is impossible without the<br>Spirit also tampering with Mary's side of the DNA. Jesus had no sin<br>nature, no physical defects, and no genetic mutations. In order to<br>create Jesus to save all of humanity, He had to create a human without<br>any of the faults introduced during the normal human reproductive<br>process, which included genetic defect. This supports even further the<br>idea that Jesus was 100% a fully-formed zygote, created entirely by God,<br>and Mary was essentially Jesus' *surrogate* mother.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-wJsye){.citation_index} [[The Protestant Faith - Kindle<br>edition by Forell, George W., Forell, George W..
