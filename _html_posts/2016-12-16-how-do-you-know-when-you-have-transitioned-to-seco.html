<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>[[Erica<br>Friedman](https://www.quora.com/profile/Erica-Friedman)]{.qlink_container}<br>is right on: you will have officially transitioned to SPMS when you and<br>your doctor agree that you have.<br><br>To that end, *how* will you and your doctor know that your have<br>transitioned? You will make the call together, but you will notice that<br>you relapse, and you never fully remit. This can happen on an individual<br>level, even in RRMS, so a single instance is not enough to call it. When<br>a *pattern emerges,* however, you and your doctor may take notice. When<br>you have consistent, *multiple* relapses with incomplete remission, it<br>may be time to say that you have transitioned. Any time you relapse,<br>please make sure your neurologist is informed. They will want to track<br>that, and perhaps (as you indicated) check your EDSS at your next<br>appointment.<br><br>Also, EDSS is not a "test" that you can "pass or fail." EDSS stands for<br>Expanded Disability Status Scale, and is a scale from 0 to 10, where 0<br>is no disability at all noted in the neurological exam, and 9 is<br>completely bedridden. 9.5 is bedridden and unable to communicate, and 10<br>is death due to MS.<br><br>There is [[a really great<br>article](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=d41e98&url=https://www.mscenter.org/images/stories/PDF/InforMSFall2015lowres.pdf){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="mscenter.org"}]{.qlink_container} in the publication<br>*InforMS,* the periodical published by the Rocky Mountain MS Center,<br>regarding neutral load and what may be happening in the brain when we<br>transition from RRMS to SPMS.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
