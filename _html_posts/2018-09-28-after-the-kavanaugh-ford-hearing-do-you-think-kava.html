<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**After the Kavanaugh-Ford hearing, do you think Kavanaugh will be<br>confirmed to the Supreme Court?**<br><br>He was going to be confirmed before the testimony.<br><br>It is universally accepted that, while she was compelling, there wasn't<br>enough evidence presented by Dr. Ford to really warrant changing<br>anyone's votes from yes to no, although apparently some of the swing<br>votes are still up in the air. Sen. Joe Donnelly (D-IN) announced he<br>will vote no when it comes to the floor because he stated that the FBI<br>should have investigated (even though they had no authority to do so).<br>Donnelly is playing a dangerous game, up for re-election in a state<br>which Trump carried in 2016, so he will face exposure for that choice.<br>He believes that the accusation and the fact that the White House<br>decided not to re-open the background investigation for this issue will<br>cover him in November. For his sake, I hope he's right.<br><br>There are nine other Senators besides Donnelly who are facing<br>re-election in states carried by Trump, such as Heidi Heitkamp (D-ND),<br>who could face re-election exposure by voting no, and is already facing<br>massive pressure in ND from Republicans trying to use this as a wedge<br>issue with conservative voters.<br><br>There are other swing votes that have not yet been announced. Votes from<br>Sens. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), Susan Collins (R-ME) and Joe Manchin (D-WV)<br>have not yet been announced. Manchin has been leaning yes since the<br>hearings, but has not announced.<br><br>Finally, Republicans know that if they don't get Kavanaugh confirmed,<br>they will face a massive backlash for that faux pas in November, and a<br>loss of the House would be virtually guaranteed, and the loss of the<br>Senate becomes a distinct possibility. This will weigh heavily on the<br>minds of Republican Senators, especially the swing Republicans. I'm sure<br>they are getting a good talking-to at this moment.<br><br>Reviewing all of this data, at this moment, it appears most likely that<br>Kavanaugh will be confirmed. Narrowly, mind you (Republicans only hold a<br>51--49 majority in the Senate), but he will probably be confirmed.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
