<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Actually, it's the other way around. In more severe cases of progressive<br>MS, cachexia could be a symptom. It likely has no impact on the<br>progression of the disease, it is likely just a side effect of the end<br>stages of progressive MS.<br><br>Cachexia, or "wasting disease," is not fully understood. Inflammatory<br>cytokines could be a factor, but in MS, inflammation is only an<br>underlying issue in relapsing forms of the disease. Progressive forms of<br>the disease are characterized not by inflammation, but neural<br>degeneration. Inflammatory cytokine action is sometimes a result of that<br>degeneration. Therefore, it is most likely that cachexia is a result of<br>other disease activity; it likely is not a cause of any further disease<br>activity.<br><br>Cachexia is odd because it appears as muscle loss and appetite loss.<br>High-density nutrient intake can sometimes slow the progression of<br>cachexia, but does not stop the underlying muscle loss.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
