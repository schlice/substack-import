<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Guns solve a very limited and specific problem. All guns<br>(in general) allow you to kill something with incredible efficiency, at<br>extended distances, with exceptional accuracy.\<br>\<br>Do they solve problems *between people*? That depends on the problem. If<br>one of the persons is wielding a knife and is high on drugs, a gun will<br>solve that problem. If you are having what we could call a \"domestic<br>dispute,\" a gun would likely make that problem worse.\<br>\<br>So whether or not a gun is the right tool to use in any situation<br>depends on the situation.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
