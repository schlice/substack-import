<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Except that such an act would be in violation of the court order which<br>says that Apple controls the software, and it only leaves Apple\'s<br>possession with their permission.<br><br>The way this would work (if Apple does it)<br><br>- FBI brings phone to Cupertino<br>- Apple applies patch in Cupertino<br>- FBI (in Apple HQ) brute-forces the passcode.<br>- Apple flashes correct firmware on the phone.<br>- Apple returns phone to FBI.<br><br>Many people (yourself included) have confused what Apple is trying to<br>say is the danger here. The danger is not that the FBI would have the<br>software, because they won\'t. The danger is that if the FBI can unlock<br>*this* phone, they will want to unlock many phones in a similar way (all<br>with valid court orders, of course), and then foreign governments will<br>be next. Your data\'s insecurity will only be a court order away.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/Should-Apple-be-forced-to-unlock-the-San-Bernardino-shooters-phone-at-the-FBIs-behest/answer/Dan-B-1472<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
