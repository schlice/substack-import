<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What role does gut health appear to play in psychiatric and<br>neurological disorders?**<br><br>At some point, take some time and review [[the gut-brain<br>connection](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=365aac&url=https://www.google.com/search?q%3Dthe%2Bgut%2Bbrain%2Bconnection%26oq%3Dthe%2Bgut%2Bbrain%2Bconnection){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="google.com"}]{.qlink_container}. There's really too much<br>information to re-post here. But it's good stuff, and it's not just<br>marketing material from supplement makers. There are some very<br>interesting papers from [[Johns<br>Hopkins](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=3d57f3&url=https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/healthy_aging/healthy_body/the-brain-gut-connection){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="hopkinsmedicine.org"}]{.qlink_container} and<br>[Harvard(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=34553a&url=https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/the-gut-brain-connection){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="harvard.edu"}]{.qlink_container} discussing the CNS-ENS<br>connection and our new understandings of these. But if you've ever had<br>"butterflies in your stomach," or if you've ever had a "gut feeling"<br>about something, you intuitively know that there is a connection between<br>the gut and the brain. Yet only recently have we discovered some of the<br>real insights into this connection.<br><br>Some brief highlights:<br><br>- Along with the central nervous system (CNS) and the peripheral nervous<br>  system (PNS), we also have the enteric nervous system (ENS). This is<br>  sheaths of nerve fibers which surrounds the entire GI system from<br>  esophagus to anus.<br>- The ENS does the majority of the "heavy lifting" in controlling the<br>  digestion process: releasing enzymes, contracting muscles, etc.<br>- There is a very tight connection between the ENS and the CNS. Just as<br>  a distressed mind can send signals to, and influence, the intestines,<br>  a troubled intestine can send signals to, and influence, the brain.<br>  The result: a distressed intestine can lead to psychological symptoms<br>  like depression and anxiety. In short, we knew that a troubled brain<br>  could result in an upset GI system, but we're learning now that it<br>  works both ways.<br><br>As far as neurologic disorders, think about this: drugs meant to affect<br>the brain, like SSRIs, also induce GI changes. Irritable Bowel Syndrome,<br>or IBS, is partly caused by too much serotonin in our gut. You might<br>also think of IBS as a "mental illness" of the<br>ENS.\[1\](#YMgoP){#cite-YMgoP .citation_link}<br><br>We still have much to learn about this strange and complex interplay<br>between the "big brain" and the "little brain," but what we have learned<br>so far is very enlightening, and can help us in our understanding and<br>treatment of some very hard-to-manage diseases. We have much to learn.<br>For example, if there is such a connection between the gut and the<br>brain, could poor gut health be partly responsible for other diseases<br>within the brain, such as Parkinson's and MS? While probably not the<br>primary cause, they may definitely be related. More research is needed<br>into this fascinating area of medical study.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-YMgoP){.citation_index} [[Think Twice: How the Gut\'s<br>\"Second Brain\" Influences Mood and<br>Well-Being](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=b763a9&url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/gut-second-brain/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="scientificamerican.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*This answer is not professional medical advice**, nor is it a<br>substitute for professional medical advice.
