<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Yes, and then No.<br><br>First, I haven't seen any of the signs of Jesus' return (although some<br>people think that the COVID shot was actually the mark of the beast). So<br>until I see the Antichrist and the False Prophet, I wouldn't expect to<br>see Christ yet. So I would be surprised if Jesus walked up to me<br>*today.*<br><br>But when I do see Christ, I do fully expect to be **chewed out up one<br>side and down the other.** I fully expect Him to rebuke the living crap<br>out of me. I am human, and I sin by nature. Despite my best efforts, I<br>still sin. *But once He's done "rebuking" me,* He'll say, "...but it's<br>okay. I've taken the punishment for your sin already."<br><br>So yes, I fully expect to be rebuked. But then I expect Him to say that<br>I'm forgiven.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
