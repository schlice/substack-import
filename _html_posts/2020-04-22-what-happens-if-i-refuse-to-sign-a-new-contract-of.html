<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>What happens if I refuse to sign a new contract of employment?<br><br>If the position is a contract-only position, this is definitely the most<br>important document to sign, as it defines the contract under which you<br>will be employed. This is a "must-sign" document. Failing to sign the<br>document can lead to your termination if you refuse. But usually,<br>they'll try to work with you by finding out why you won't sign. Perhaps<br>there is a misunderstanding about the contract that some simple<br>communication could clear up. Perhaps there are some changes the<br>employee wants to make that would be acceptable to the business. There<br>are indeed many things that could be the cause of the employee not<br>signing, and the employer will try to consider them before initiating<br>termination proceedings.<br><br>Other specific documents have other remedies if employees refuse to<br>sign. For example, not signing the employee handbook has a different set<br>of remedies, as does not signing a disciplinary memo or a performance<br>report.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
