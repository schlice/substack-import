Is the issue more so on consequences or<br>criticism from free speech?**<br><br>You said that nearly everyone is granted this. Less than half of the<br>country does not believe this.<br><br>[[40% of the country believes that "hate speech" should be<br>regulated.](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=76975d&url=https://www.cato.org/survey-reports/state-free-speech-tolerance-america){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="cato.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>The problem: *"hate speech" is free speech.*<br><br>The First Amendment exists to protect speech you don't like. If everyone<br>spoke only things you like to hear, there would be no need for the First<br>Amendment in the first place. The fact that speech exists which you<br>don't like is an indication that it needs to be protected if we're going<br>to protect freedom of speech at all.<br><br>The issue is indeed about consequences or criticism from free speech.<br><br>- There should not be limits on what words you can say (unless we're<br>  talking about causing imminent harm or inciting a riot or speaking<br>  falsehoods).<br>- Similarly, there should not be limits on *consequences* **from<br>  your speech.**<br><br>For example, you can say whatever you believe about whatever topic you<br>like. However, if your employer finds that your words are incongruent<br>with their corporate philosophy, your free speech may cause you to lose<br>your job. This is all acceptable, and is a natural consequence of free<br>speech.<br><br>Putting limits on what words you can say *before you say it*, or trying<br>to divine what someone was *thinking* when interpreting the words they<br>spoke, is the exact opposite of free speech.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
