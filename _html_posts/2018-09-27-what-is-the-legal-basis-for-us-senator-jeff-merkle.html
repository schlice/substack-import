<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What is the legal basis for US Senator Jeff Merkley\'s request that a<br>Federal Court issue an injunction to stop the Senate from voting on the<br>confirmation of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh? Would the Senate<br>be bound by such an injunction?**<br><br>The courts have no legal authority to control the workings of the Senate<br>in exercising its authority under the Constitution. The Senate has the<br>right to conduct its duties in the manner in which it sees fit. If Sen.<br>Merkley has an issue with how the Judiciary Committee is conducting<br>itself, he can bring his complaint to the Rules Committee. But<br>ultimately, it has nothing to do with how the Senate does business; the<br>White House has decided what documents it is going to release, and what<br>documents it will retain under Executive Privilege. Sen. Merkley is<br>claiming that the Senate cannot perform its "advice and consent" role<br>without the documents, and anyone with half a brain knows that they<br>absolutely can. If the Senate feels they don't have enough information,<br>they can simply vote no. There, advice and consent given. Constitutional<br>question solved.<br><br>This is literally nothing more than a continuation of the Democrats'<br>grandstanding and doing everything in their power to delay the vote on<br>Judge Kavanaugh until after the mid-term elections. It's just that with<br>stupid stunts like this, they show their *desperation.*<br><br>Democrats know that if they can stop the vote, they have a path to win<br>the Senate. And if they win the Senate, they can prevent a second Trump<br>SCOTUS nominee from being seated, *which is their ultimate goal.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
