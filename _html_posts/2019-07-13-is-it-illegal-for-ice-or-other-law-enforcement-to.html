If the<br>church is open to the public, it is open to law enforcement. There is<br>literally nothing special about a church that would prevent law<br>enforcement (including ICE) from doing their jobs there.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
