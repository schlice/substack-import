<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Are American gun rights advocates opposed to the use of the term<br>\"assault rifle\"?**<br><br>No.<br><br>"Assault rifle" is actually a term defined by the military, and it<br>indicates a select-fire rifle. Select-fire rifles can be switched<br>between a mode where one bullet is fired for each trigger pull, and a<br>mode where more than one bullet is fire per trigger pull. You should<br>note that these weapons are heavily regulated in the United States with<br>regard to civilian use.<br><br>The term that gun rights advocates are opposed to is the term "**assault<br>weapon**." Now, I know right now you're probably thinking, *what's the<br>difference*?<br><br>The difference is that while assault rifles have a very clear,<br>accepted legal definition and are highly controlled weapons, **assault<br>weapons** have no clear, accepted legal definition, and can rightly<br>encompass virtually every revolver and semi-automatic firearm ever<br>created.<br><br>Generally, assault weapons are loosely defined by their cosmetic<br>features, such as handles and stocks made of black composite materials,<br>foregrips, collapsible stocks, bayonet lugs, etc. These cosmetic<br>features do not make a weapon more or less deadly, they simply make it<br>"scary-looking."<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
