<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>> *Question Details:*<br>><br>> *A trial seems to be the only routine proceeding we have available to<br>> make a thorough public investigation. A trial can't be held if the<br>> suspect is dead and shouldn\'t be held unless there is strong evidence<br>> that the suspect committed a crime. Grand jury investigations, despite<br>> their recent misuse, are not appropriate because they are not public,<br>> and the only thing that a failure to indict demonstrates is that the<br>> prosecutor didn\'t want an indictment. Yet, there are cases when there<br>> is a need for public examination of all available evidence and a<br>> determination of what happened. Recently, there were the cases of<br>> Michael Brown, Eric Garner, and Tamir Rice. Other cases where I think<br>> such a proceeding would be appropriate include Emma Hernandez and<br>> Margie Carranza, the newspaper carriers shot by Los Angeles police who<br>> mistook them for Christopher Dorner, and Bruce Ivins, who was accused<br>> of sending anthrax-laced letters, but could not be tried because he<br>> was dead. After President Kennedy's assasination, we had the Warren<br>> Commission; it didn't lay all doubts to rest, but it was a lot better<br>> than what we get in cases of lesser national importance.*<br><br>We already have it, it\'s called an<br>[*inquest*(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=805146&url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inquest){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}. It\'s handled by a<br>coroner. And it shouldn\'t be judicial. Most inquests are<br>quasi-judicial, or non-judicial. But their outcomes function much as the<br>outcome of a grand jury in some areas of the country, while others are<br>more judicial, making the accused liable for arrest.<br><br>In some jurisdictions, an inquest can be called by a formal request by<br>the public. We should expand the use of the inquest in cases where there<br>is great public interest in the actual cause of death.<br><br>Your assertion that the grand jury system is broken is also an<br>indication of public distrust of anything that is not done in full<br>public view, even though the Supreme Court has already validated, on<br>several occasions, the validity of the privacy of a grand jury.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
