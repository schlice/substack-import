<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>When we're talking about things like this, we should always remember the<br>old adage:<br><br>**Never attribute to malice what could easily be explained by<br>stupidity.**<br><br>People are attacking Trump over classified materials in his home.<br><br>Yet people so quickly forget that Hillary (who was not the president,<br>mind you) had an official government email server in her house, which<br>was routinely handling tens of thousands of classified emails, and which<br>was revealed by forensic analysis to have likely been compromised.<br><br>The truth is that this document thing happens with presidents all the<br>time when they leave office. It happened with Obama, and it happened<br>with George W. Bush. Trump didn't personally order any of those<br>documents removed from the White House. The GSA has contractors who<br>packed up his documents and personal effects from the White House and<br>moved them to Mar-a-Lago. There were many boxes of documents which were<br>likely in storage, and he likely had no idea what was in there.<br><br>And yet, Trump became the first former president to have a search<br>warrant served at his private residence over documents.<br><br>Sounds legit...<br><br>And with the Secret Service security around that place, do you really<br>think that those documents were wholly unprotected? All of the people<br>who had access to that residence were thoroughly vetted and had<br>clearance. Not necessarily clearance to see those documents, but they<br>weren't "Joe off the street," and they definitely weren't "Russian<br>spies."<br><br>When the Trump Presidential Library is built (and I have mixed feelings<br>while typing those words), the documents would have gone through a<br>validation period and would have either been sent to the library, or<br>back to DC. This validation is done because a third party does the move.<br><br>**Never attribute to malice what could easily be explained by<br>stupidity.**<br><br>And if you *are* **starting with the opinion and the contention<br>that it is malicious, you probably have an agenda.**<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Did Donald Trump digitally scan in or otherwise make copies of the<br>Mar-a-Lago documents before the FBI got them?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
