<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>What do you say is the beginning of personhood?<br><br>Personhood begins at conception.<br><br>The logic follows this way:<br><br>1.  Embryos and fetuses are human beings from conception. "Human<br>    being" is nothing more than the philosophical term for an individual<br>    member of the species *homo sapiens*.<br>2.  A baby is a living human organism. It grows, its cells divide, its<br>    cells respirate, and it is a unique life form separate from its<br>    mother (its DNA is unique from every other organism in existence).<br>    In other words, it is alive.<br>3.  Personhood is defined as being human and being alive.<br>4.  Since embryos are both alive and human from the moment of<br>    conception, they are, by definition, persons.<br>5.  Therefore, unborn children are persons from conception.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
