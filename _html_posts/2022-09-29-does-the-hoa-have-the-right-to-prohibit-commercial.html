<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>In general, yes. If the prohibition is listed somewhere in the Governing<br>Documents (which includes any Rules and Regulations the HOA is<br>authorized to create) then they can indeed prohibit commercial vehicles<br>from parking in a resident's driveway.<br><br>My last HOA did have this restriction, but my current HOA does not.<br><br>But even in my last HOA, we made an exception for emergency vehicles<br>(i.e. vehicles that you are required to have so you can respond from<br>your home to emergencies). One guy brought his truck from the gas<br>company (and it indicated it was an emergency response vehicle) and<br>several police officers and sheriff's deputies had their marked cruisers<br>at home, and those were all exceptions.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Does the HOA have the right to prohibit commercial vehicles from being<br>parked in an owner\'s driveway?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
