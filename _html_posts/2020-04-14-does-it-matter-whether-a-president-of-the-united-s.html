<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Do you have to be born on US soil to be president?<br><br>No. Specifically, the Constitution says that you must be a "natural born<br>citizen of the United States," not that you are actually born on US<br>soil.<br><br>Note that "natural born citizens" can be born outside of the physical<br>United States and still be citizens. For example, if you are born to<br>parents who are both citizens, but you are born physically outside the<br>US, you are still a "natural born citizen," that is, a citizen by birth.<br>You don't have to be "naturalized" in order to become a citizen if you<br>are born to citizens but you are physically born outside of the country.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
