<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Jones was shot accidentally while the officer was acting in<br>self-defense, so his use of force was lawful. In order to be criminally<br>charged, there must be an *unlawful* taking of life. Shooting in<br>self-defense is still unlawful, but has an affirmative defense, so it is<br>not charged. The fact that the victim was an innocent bystander does not<br>change the lawful nature of the original use of force. The State\'s<br>Attorney\'s Office said they \"concluded that there is insufficient<br>evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Officer \Robert\<br>Rialmo did not act in self-defense in shooting LeGrier and Jones.\"<br><br>The Cook County Sheriff's Office is still investigating the officer's<br>actions, and whether or not he may have violated department policy is<br>still being reviewed. In any case, violating department policy or not<br>would have no bearing on whether or not he would be held criminally<br>liable for the death.<br><br>This also does not mean that the family cannot pursue civil charges<br>against the officer for wrongful death. In this case, the department's<br>review of the shooting would be important, because it would establish<br>whether or not the officer acted recklessly or not in keeping with<br>department policy on the use of force.<br><br>> *If I killed an innocent bystander while in the process of defending<br>> myself, I doubt that I would not be held criminally liable for that. I<br>> don\'t understand why that does not apply to police.*<br><br>The tenor of your comments implies that the same standards do not hold<br>true when it comes to shooting in self-defense between police and<br>civilians. While I can see how you can easily misunderstand what has<br>happened here, the standards for self-defense apply equally to everyone.<br>The officer was not subject to any different standards than any member<br>of the public facing a similar deadly-force situation would have been<br>subject to.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
