<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If swimming pools are killing 360,000 people in the United States a<br>year, why aren\'t they banned? That\'s higher than the American death<br>toll from WWII.**<br><br>A few points as to why these things (and other potentially dangerous, if<br>misused) things are still legal:<br><br>1.  Swimming pools are used safely by millions of people every day. The<br>    stupidity of a few should not ruin the enjoyment of millions.<br>2.  You can't legislate good behavior. You can't force parental eyeballs<br>    to be on their children all the time, and while you can force people<br>    to fence off attractive nuisances, you'll never be able to stop<br>    people from entering those areas unlawfully if they choose. People<br>    even break in to indoor swimming pools, so forcing them to be<br>    indoors is not a solution either.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
