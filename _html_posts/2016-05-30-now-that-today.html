<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [First off, I have never been a fan of \"texting and<br>driving\" laws. Here\'s why.\<br>\<br>Most traffic laws do not \"allow\" their use, but disallow certain<br>behaviors rather than focusing on the technology. Besides, we already<br>have laws against distracted driving; must we address every piece of new<br>technology with a new law, or just find better ways to interpret our<br>existing laws?\<br>\<br>The problem with laws is that the underlying technology changes much<br>faster than the cycle of implementation of laws. We started seeing<br>problems with texting and driving while people were using flip phones.<br>By the time most states have implemented laws against texting and<br>driving, we have moved on to Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, two<br>technologies which allow you to use the most popular smartphones<br>hands-free, along with texting by voice. This technology is included in<br>many new cars today. The technology, as usual, has outpaced the law.\<br>\<br>It will be interesting to see how the current technology-focused laws<br>cope with new technology.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
