<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>1.  Make a phone call to someplace in Iraq, Pakistan, Syria, Somalia, or<br>    any other country on the watch list.<br>2.  Tell the person on the other end that you intend on blowing up the<br>    protestors.<br>3.  See if the police arrest you.<br><br>Other than that, a stingray mimics a standard cell tower. It doesn\'t<br>look like an infrastructure cell (microcell) or a home cell (picocell),<br>which may display a different icon on your phone, depending on<br>manufacturer. Therefore, in most cases, you will never know that your<br>phone has connected to a stingray instead of a normal cell tower.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
