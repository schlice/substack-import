<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Whether or not the HOA cares will be in your Governing Documents. It is<br>probably in your Rules and Regulations document regarding the look of<br>the outside of your house.<br><br>If there is nothing in there regarding removing your screens, I can't<br>see how they would complain terribly about it. Not to mention, if it's<br>not in the Rules, how would you know that the HOA wouldn't want you to<br>remove your window screens?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
