<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Shake the dust of that church off of your feet and leave.<br><br>Let's be fair: your pastor was probably injecting his personal opinion<br>about the young man into his guidance, but he did it in the most<br>absolutely wrong way. The pastor can not tell you what the will of God<br>is. He doesn't know. No one knows. And if he says he knows, he should<br>probably get back into Scripture sometime soon.<br><br>> Oh, the depth of the riches of the wisdom and knowledge of God! How<br>> unsearchable his judgments, and his paths beyond tracing out! Who has<br>> known the mind of the Lord? Or who has been his counselor? --- Romans<br>> 11:33--34 NIV<br>><br>> Who has known the mind of the Lord so as to instruct him? --- 1<br>> Corinthians 2:16<br><br>God's mind is "unsearchable" and "unknowable". Who has known the mind of<br>God? Not any of us, that's for sure. Unless God chooses to reveal his<br>plans to us (which he does not often do), the knowledge of those plans<br>will likely stay out of reach.<br><br>Find a better church, and congratulations on your pending marriage!<br>Keeping your marriage grounded in your faith is the number one thing you<br>can do to ensure a long and happy life together.<br><br>And if it helps you to know, I'll be praying for you too.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>I took my fiancé to my pastor to pray for us because we want to get<br>married and the pastor said he is not the will of God for me and I love<br>him. What should I do?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
