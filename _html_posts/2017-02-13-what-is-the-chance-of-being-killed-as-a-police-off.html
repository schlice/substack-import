<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>In 2008. there were roughly 800,000 sworn peace officers in the United<br>States.\[1\](#UimgO){#cite-UimgO .citation_link} That same year, there<br>were 140 officers who died in the line of duty, of all causes. This<br>computes out to 17.5 deaths per 100,000 officers<br><br>This means that your risk of dying, that year, was 0.0175%.<br><br>Compare this to other occupations:<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-31d92146a2d23762df73ff97688f0a97){.portrait .qtext_image<br>.zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-31d92146a2d23762df73ff97688f0a97"<br>master_w="1484" master_h="1900"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>You can see where that 17.5 lies on the chart, under "police and<br>sheriff's patrol officers." Also note that in any given year, almost<br>half of the line of duty deaths were caused by car accidents, either<br>while the officer was driving, or while the officer was at the side of<br>the road outside of his/her vehicle.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-UimgO){.citation_index} [[Law enforcement in the United<br>States -<br>Wikipedia](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=9850a6&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement_in_the_United_States){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
