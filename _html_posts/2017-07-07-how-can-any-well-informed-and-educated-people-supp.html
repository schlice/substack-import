<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I am, by all objective measures, exceedingly smart. I could review my CV<br>with you, but besides being pedantic, it seems a bit too<br>self-aggrandizing and too much of a "you're not smart enough to call<br>yourself smart" debate that I refuse to engage in. Let's just say that<br>I've got the chops to be considered "smart." I'll let you take the time<br>to review my profile if you'd like to verify that.<br><br>In this last election, we had a choice between two terrible candidates.<br>There are other Republican candidates who would have arguably been<br>better choices. There are also other Democrat candidates who would have<br>arguably been better choices. But by hook or by crook, these two ended<br>up being our candidates.<br><br>Quora user<br>[CEO1(https://www.quora.com/profile/CEO1)]{.qlink_container} said why<br>we voted for Trump far more succinctly and eloquently than I can, and I<br>want to give him credit for his excellent answer (emphasis mine):<br><br>> *The truth is that we had two really bad choices and the one that won<br>> did not win because he was the better of the two.* ***He won because<br>> of a desperate desire on the part of the public to change the way<br>> politics works in America.*** *Obama was elected for the same reason.<br>> So will the next president.*<br>><br>> ***People will overlook all the candidates' failings and lack of<br>> experience and even outright stupidity*** \[and even lying and<br>> abhorrent behavior\] ***if they think that there is a chance that this<br>> will be the one that restores their faith in the American political<br>> process.*** *So far, many of our politicians have been successful at<br>> fooling the public into thinking they will change things and then they<br>> revert back to status quo after being elected.*<br>><br>> *This will continue until the public realizes that our politicians are<br>> absolute masters of psychology, propaganda and social manipulation.<br>> They spend millions on consultants and companies that specialize in<br>> deceiving the public and making themselves look good. They are really<br>> good at it and Hillary hired the best.*\[1\](#qbaEH){#cite-qbaEH<br>> .citation_link}<br><br>So why do intellectually intuitive people support Trump? Because despite<br>his flaws (and which one of us isn't flawed in some way), we hope above<br>hope that this is "the one" who will restore some level of sanity to<br>American politics. It's likely going to be messy while we go through it,<br>but we can't dance around it; we must plunge headlong *through* it.<br>Churchill said, "When you're going through hell, keep going." We must go<br>*through* the tough time to emerge on the other side. There's no<br>side-stepping the inevitable conflict. We must simply deal with it.<br><br>What gets me is that liberals can't see it.<br><br>The cognitive dissonance that must exist when they run around with<br>bumper stickers and t-shirts reading things like "well-behaved women<br>seldom make history\" (a quote by Laura Thatcher Ulrich), while they<br>simultaneously marvel at the fact that a disruptive force in Washington<br>is, well, *actually disruptive*, must be surprisingly disturbing. I<br>question how they live with such conflict.<br><br>Nevertheless, Trump was fairly elected. There is no evidence that anyone<br>tampered with votes. There is no evidence of any Russian collusion to<br>tamper with the results. There is no evidence of any Russian-induced<br>voter suppression. So now that Trump is the president, we stand behind<br>him because, despite all your "not my president" drivel, he *is* your<br>President. He is *all* our president. I'm no Obama fan, but he was my<br>president and I supported him in his job, even though I disagreed with<br>many of his positions.<br><br>So we support our president and we do what we can to see him succeed,<br>because we believe in America. If we want the democratic process to<br>work, *we have to make it work*. If you don't like the guy we have, then<br>when he's up for re-election, elect someone else. That's the way it has<br>worked for hundreds of years. It will probably continue to work that way<br>for some time.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-qbaEH){.citation_index} [[CEO1\'s answer to Why isn\'t<br>Hillary Clinton the President when we know Russia tampered with the<br>election?](https://www.quora.com/Why-isnt-Hillary-Clinton-the-President-when-we-know-Russia-tampered-with-the-election/answer/CEO1)]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
