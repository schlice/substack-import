<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>There are two types of HOAs: *voluntary* and *mandatory*. Voluntary HOAs<br>(also commonly known as "civic associations") are groups of homeowners<br>who usually get a benefit or service when they join the Association,<br>like membership at the clubhouse (while others have to pay usage fees).<br>Mandatory HOAs are part of the contract you signed when you purchased<br>your home. They are tied to the property and are on file with the<br>County. Your deed will state that the property is part of a mandatory<br>association. The Governing Documents were included by the title company,<br>and you signed them. agreeing to be bound by them when you bought your<br>house.<br><br>- If you're in a voluntary HOA, you can leave by whatever method they<br>  have set aside for cancelling your membership.<br>- If you're in a mandatory HOA, you cannot leave (thus the definition of<br>  the term *mandatory*). You have a few choices though, the easiest of<br>  which is to **sell your house and move to a neighborhood which does<br>  not have a mandatory HOA.** There are other, more difficult ways to<br>  divest yourself of the terrible burden that is HOA membership: for<br>  example, you might consider *dissolving the HOA*. You can investigate<br>  this with a real estate attorney in your local area. This is a<br>  difficult, time-consuming, and not-free proposition, however, so be<br>  prepared to be told that you'll make more progress spitting into the<br>  wind. But others have indeed dissolved HOAs in the past; you may have<br>  luck as well.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>How can we remove our house from the neighborhood association if we<br>didn\'t sign up for it and we don\'t want to pay dues?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
