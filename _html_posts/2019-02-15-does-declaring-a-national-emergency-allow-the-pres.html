<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Does declaring a national emergency allow the President to send<br>military forces to the border, under Posse Comitatus?**<br><br>No.<br><br>The National Emergencies Act allows the President to invoke certain<br>provisions of law (which are already written into those laws) which he<br>normally cannot access. There are over 400 individual actions the<br>President is authorized to take in over 100 different Federal laws which<br>can be taken when a national emergency is declared. Of course, the<br>actual actions are determined by the actual emergency, but it's all<br>spelled out in the law.<br><br>Posse Comitatus says that the military cannot enforce state law. The<br>military's role is to support and defend the Constitution from all<br>enemies, foreign and domestic. Defense of the homeland has not<br>traditionally been part of the military's mission, but the military has<br>been given more authority to defend the physical border of the country<br>(not just projecting US power overseas) since 2001. Because the military<br>is defending the *national* border, not a state border, and national<br>border security squarely falls under the Federal government, border<br>security can be legally bolstered by the US military without violating<br>Posse Comitatus.<br><br>Additionally, there are several Federal laws (10 USC ยง 284 comes to<br>mind) which allows the military to support "counterdrug" activities,<br>which has been taking place for decades. Military assets have been used<br>to support FBI and DEA counterdrug activities for many years.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
