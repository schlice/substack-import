<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What is the criminal statute of limitations against a New York State<br>police officer, for making a false arrest?**<br><br>The statute of limitations for false arrest claims under Section 1983 in<br>New York is three years. It is different in other states. This means<br>that a person must file his lawsuit within three years of the false<br>arrest or his claim will be ruled untimely and dismissed by the court.<br><br>To bring claims against state employees under state law requires filing<br>a notice of claim within 90 days of the incident. Civil rights<br>claims brought under state law against private citizens (e.g., a false<br>arrest claim against a store security guard) generally must be filed<br>within 1 year of the incident.\[1\](#liemk){#cite-liemk<br>.citation_link}<br><br>To put this into context: because the state holds special privilege in<br>lawsuits against it, if you don't file a notice of claim within 90 days<br>of the incident, you can't file a lawsuit against the state, or a state<br>agent, even though the statute of limitations is three years.<br><br>\<br><br>*This answer is not a substitute for professional legal advice.*<br>*This answer does not create an attorney-client relationship, nor is it<br>a solicitation to offer legal advice.
