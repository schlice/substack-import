<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If a failsafe technology that sensed the blood alcohol content of the<br>person sitting in the driver\'s seat of a vehicle which would render the<br>vehicle disabled were available, would you support it being a<br>requirement in all vehicles? Why or why not?**<br><br>If at all possible, I'd want manufacturers to make it standard equipment<br>in all vehicles *without the government needing to make it required.*<br>And I wouldn't want it to disable the vehicle. I'd want it to notify the<br>driver and any passengers that the driver may be impaired and someone<br>else should probably drive. I'd want the passengers in the car to agree<br>to allow the driver to proceed (assuming there were other passengers in<br>the car). Instead of disabling the car, I'd rather have the car "narc"<br>to the police that someone impaired may be operating, have the police<br>stop the vehicle, and deal with the driver directly.<br><br>Of course, part of the problem here is that there is no standard for BAC<br>across the country, and different states have different requirements, so<br>the vehicle would have to know not only what state it was in, but it<br>would also have to know the laws in that state, and disable the vehicle<br>if the laws of that state were violated.<br><br>You also said that the technology would have to be "failsafe." I agree;<br>it would have to never produce false positives, ever. Even if I've had<br>cough syrup, it still can't incorrectly determine that I've been<br>drinking.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
