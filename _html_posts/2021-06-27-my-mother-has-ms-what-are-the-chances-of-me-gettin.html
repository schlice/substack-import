<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Here is what epidemiology tells us makes you more or less likely to<br>develop MS:<br><br>SEX: Females are two to three times more likely to develop MS than<br>males. Scientists believe that one\'s tendency to develop MS therefore<br>has some hormonal connection.<br><br>FAMILY HISTORY: Statistics show that the chance of the average<br>person in the United States developing MS is about 1 in 750. But close<br>(first-degree) relatives of people with MS, such as children, siblings<br>or non-identical twins, have a higher chance, anywhere from one in 100<br>to one in 40. It\'s not all genetic, though, and you can see this<br>through the \"identical twin\" example. If one identical twin has MS,<br>the other twin (who has the identical gene structure as the twin) has<br>only a 1 in 4 chance of developing MS. If it were all genetic, the<br>unaffected twin would have a 100% chance of developing MS instead of the<br>25% chance they exhibit today.<br><br>ETHNICITY: MS is more common among Caucasians (particularly those of<br>northern European ancestry) than other ethnic groups, and is almost<br>unheard of in some populations, such as Inuit, Yakutes, Hutterites,<br>Hungarian Romani, Norwegian Lapps, Australian Aborigines, and New<br>Zealand Maoris.<br><br>GEOGRAPHY: MS occurs with greatest frequency in higher latitudes<br>(above 40Â° latitude) away from the equator, than in lower latitudes,<br>closer to the equator. This may have something to do with vitamin D<br>production in the skin, and the vitamin\'s prophylactic effect on the<br>development of MS. The exact details about vitamin D\'s involvement with<br>the prevention of MS, however, is still unclear. Moving from one<br>geographic area to another seems to alter a person\'s risk of developing<br>MS. Studies show that families and their children will assume the new<br>risk level (higher or lower) of the area to which they move. Those who<br>move before the age of 15 generally take on the new risk themselves.<br>Those who move after the age of 15 may not see the new risk appear until<br>the next generation.<br><br>INFECTIOUS TRIGGER: Scientists have been searching for years for<br>an infectious agent that might trigger MS. While many different viruses<br>have been suggested, including rabies, herpes simplex virus, measles,<br>corona virus, canine distemper virus, HTLV-1, Epstein-Barr virus, among<br>others, none has yet been confirmed. Chlamydia pneumoniae, a bacteria<br>which 90% of the population has been exposed to over their lifetime, has<br>also been suggested but never proven. Although no trigger has yet been<br>identified, most MS experts believe that some infectious agent is<br>involved in initiating the disease process.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>My mother has MS. What are the chances of me getting it, and is there<br>anything I can do to lower my chances?<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*This answer is not professional medical advice**, nor is it a<br>substitute for professional medical advice.
