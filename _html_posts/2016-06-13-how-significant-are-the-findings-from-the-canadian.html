<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>This is a very radical therapy option. It's something that we have known<br>about for many years.<br><br>The findings are significant in the sense that it shows that autologous<br>hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) may potentially have some<br>benefit in patients with Multiple Sclerosis.<br><br>It is, however, only a Phase 1 study, which means that it was only<br>tested against a very small group of patients for safety. There are<br>significant safety concerns with a therapy like this, since it is so<br>very radical.<br><br>To clarify, in order to accomplish this therapy, the patient's immune<br>cells are harvested and then duplicated in a lab. Next, the patient's<br>entire immune system and bone marrow is destroyed using chemotherapy.<br>Finally, the patient's harvested and reproduced immune cells are<br>re-introduced to the patient to grow new bone marrow.<br><br>The patient is at great risk during the therapy, and an extended<br>hospital stay is required. Slow re-introduction to normal society is<br>also required, since the person will essentially have no immunities<br>following the treatment. Re-population of all previous immunities will<br>need to be done; essentially, all vaccinations that you would normally<br>receive as a baby will need to be performed again, from scratch.<br><br>Therefore, because of the significant risks in performing such a<br>procedure, it is only something that would currently be recommended for<br>someone who is not responding to any therapy we can currently provide.<br>Until the procedure can be refined and made to be more safe, it will<br>only be something we relegate to the most severe cases in which no other<br>therapy has been effective.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
