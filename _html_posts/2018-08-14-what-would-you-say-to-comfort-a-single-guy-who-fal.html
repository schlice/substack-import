<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What would you say to comfort a single guy who falls in love with a<br>prostitute who is married and has two children?**<br><br>"Sir, you're a moron."<br><br>1.  You don't fall in love with a prostitute.<br>2.  You don't fall in love with a *married* prostitute, because the<br>    family dynamics in that situation are just wrong on so many levels.<br>3.  You don't fall in love with a married prostitute *who has two<br>    children*. I'll bet she's not 100% sure that they're the husband's.<br><br>Literally, forget about her and move on. And quit frequenting<br>prostitutes and expecting long-term unpaid relationships.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
