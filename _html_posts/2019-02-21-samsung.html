<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Samsung's Galaxy Fold may be premature, but I still see a foldable<br>iPhone in our future. Do you think so?**<br><br>It depends on how well the Galaxy Fold does.<br><br>Since Samsung released their foldable first, Apple will wait to see what<br>happens. Unfortunately with the Galaxy Fold, it's not ready for<br>consumers.<br><br>First, its release price is \$1980. This is not a consumer device. It's<br>a device for people who are either die-hard Samsung fans, or people who<br>buy things like Supreme or \$600 sneakers with a rapper's name on them.<br><br>Second, the device is intended to be a foldable tablet, not a device<br>that you use primarily as a phone and then occasionally pop open to use<br>as a tablet. Consumers aren't really interested in foldable tablets just<br>yet.<br><br>It does do some things surprisingly well, but its high price tag and its<br>lack of appeal to the broader consumer market are things that will make<br>this release of the Galaxy Fold something that is not yet ready for<br>broad consumer adoption. And Apple isn't going to go anywhere near a<br>foldable device until they know that there's a solid market for it.<br><br>\<br><br>What Samsung *did* do right was to release a trio of Galaxy S10<br>devices that exceed Apple in both price and quality. The Galaxy S10e<br>starts at \$749.99, the Galaxy S10 starts at \$899.99, and the Galaxy<br>S10+ starts at \$999.99, and you get 128 GB of storage on each of those.<br>Compared to Apple's lineup, the iPhone XR is also \$749.99, but only<br>comes with 64GB of storage. The iPhone XS and XS Max start at \$999 and<br>\$1,099 respectively, but also only come with 64GB of storage. So just<br>based on price alone, Samsung's offerings appear to win on price.<br><br>But that would only remain true if Samsung's hardware was at least on<br>par, if not better, than Apple's. And from an objective comparison,<br>Samsung's hardware beats Apple's hardware, hands down.<br><br>The Snapdragon 855 is faster and more efficient than the A12 Bionic chip<br>Apple is running. Now arguably, as Apple's iOS is custom-designed to run<br>on Apple's A12 chip, iOS still runs more efficiently than Android on a<br>Snapdragon. But it still suffers from thermal throttling that the<br>Snapdragon does not. The Snapdragon hardware is simply a better mobile<br>processor.<br><br>Samsung's displays beat Apple's displays, hands down. Why would I say<br>that? Apple displays are sourced from --- Samsung. So of course, Samsung<br>is going to produce better display technology for themselves than they<br>are going to provide to Apple.<br><br>They have other features as well. The new Samsung devices are also<br>sporting under-glass ultrasonic fingerprint readers. This makes them<br>quicker, they don't require visible bright lights to read, and they are<br>more secure, when compared to any other security technology. The new<br>Samsung devices have larger batteries than any other flagship device.<br>Finally, they also sport a feature called Wireless PowerShare, which is<br>essentially Qi charging in reverse. This allows them to charge small<br>Qi-enabled devices, like the Samsung Galaxy Buds, which sport wireless<br>charging in the case.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
