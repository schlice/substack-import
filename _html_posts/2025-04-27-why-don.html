<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>You're absolutely right. Jesus doesn't take away your sin. You are<br>still guilty of your sin. No one can take your sin away from you. Even<br>when you die and stand before the throne of judgement (Romans 14:10--12)<br>you will be a sinner, and you will be guilty of all of your sin.<br><br>But for Christians, that's not the end of the story. Because next comes<br>the *payment*.<br><br>*Someone is going to have to pay for that sin.* God is, if nothing<br>else, a *just* God. God is *infinitely* just. This means that someone<br>will pay for that sin.<br><br>But alongside God's justice is God's mercy and grace. He is at the same<br>time infinitely just and infinitely merciful and gracious. He made a way<br>for us to allow *someone else* to pay the penalty for *our* sin.<br><br>Jesus did not sin. His account is clean. He's the only person who ever<br>existed who did not sin. So that makes Him uniquely capable of doing<br>what seems impossible: Jesus has the ability to pay for our sin.<br><br>Jesus, on the cross, took our sin debt upon Himself. Past, present, and<br>future, the blood of Christ, shed for us, pays for our sin. Jesus<br>credits His righteousness from His sinless life to our account, He takes<br>our sin debt from us, and He pays for it with His own death. Only Jesus<br>could do this.<br><br>But because we have free will, we must *choose* to love Jesus. We must<br>*choose* to believe that He gave His life to save us. We must *accept*<br>that gift of life. This retains our free will: we must make the choice<br>to accept Christ as our savior. We can choose to reject this gift. God<br>allows us to make that choice. For those who reject Christ, **they<br>choose to pay for that sin themselves** in eternity. For the believer,<br>Christ's salvific work on the cross is credited to us, and He takes the<br>penalty for our sin.<br><br>C. S. Lewis said it best when he wrote, "There are only two kinds of<br>people in the end: those who say to God, 'Thy will be done,' and those<br>to whom God says, in the end, '*Thy* will be done.' All that are in<br>Hell, choose it. Without that self-choice there would be no Hell. No<br>soul that seriously and constantly desires joy will ever miss it. Those<br>who seek find. To those who knock it is opened." That door is being held<br>open by Jesus Christ.<br><br>So how do we do it? How can we "walk through that door?" Paul wrote, "If<br>you confess with your mouth, 'Jesus is Lord,' and believe in your heart<br>that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For it is with<br>your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth<br>that you confess and are saved" (Romans 10:9).<br><br>Some will say, "I believe that Jesus died for my sins and rose from the<br>dead." And that's good but merely *believing* that Jesus died for your<br>sins and rose from the dead is not enough. You need to put your<br>*trust* in him. For example, you can believe that a certain person would<br>make a great spouse, but that's not enough to make that person your<br>spouse. You need to go *beyond* the belief, beyond the intellectual and<br>to the volitional: you must put your trust in that person by saying "I<br>do." The same is true concerning your relationship with God. Trusting<br>Him is not just a decision of the head, but of the heart. It is often<br>said that the distance between heaven and hell is about eighteen inches:<br>that's the distance between the head and the heart.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
