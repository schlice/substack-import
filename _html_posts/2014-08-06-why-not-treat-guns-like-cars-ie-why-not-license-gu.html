<br/><br/>Answer<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content: [I\'m going to piggyback on Jevan\'s answer and remind you<br/>that owning a car is not regulated, but driving a car is a privilege<br/>granted by the state. Keeping and bearing arms is a right. Rights cannot<br/>be infringed.\<br/>\<br/>I would advise you to ask yourself if there are any other rights in the<br/>Bill of Rights that you would also support \"licensing and registration,<br/>insurance/liability requirements, required safety equipment, etc\" laws<br/>for.\<br/>\<br/>Start with the First Amendment right to freedom of speech. Should you be<br/>\"licensed and registered\" before you exercise your free speech? What<br/>sorts of state-run classes would you be in favor of establishing in<br/>order to license someone to speak freely? Should you need to buy<br/>indemnification insurance before you exercise your free speech? Shall we<br/>prohibit access to any Web site that has a comment section unless you<br/>have a license? Shall we prohibit access to Facebook and Twitter (and<br/>Quora) until your license to speak has been added to your profile?\<br/>\<br/>What would the penalties be for violating the free speech licensing<br/>requirements? Shall we cut your tongue out (to use the<br/>politically-correct terminology of the day: surgically remove your<br/>tongue)?\<br/>\<br/>If this sounds a little bit far-fetched to you, it\'s because you would<br/>never think about restricting free speech with laws. Similarly, gun<br/>rights advocates do not think of restricting a right with laws. We<br/>understand that there are responsibilities to being a gun owner, and<br/>those responsibilities can be codified in law, but the laws must make<br/>sense and must further a responsibility of being a lawful gun<br/>owner.]<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content language: English<br/><br/><br/>
