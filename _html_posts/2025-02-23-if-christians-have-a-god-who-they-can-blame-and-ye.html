<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>If Christians have a God who they can blame and yell at when their life<br>goes horribly wrong, then they are either uninformed, or they are<br>actually atheists.<br><br>These weak, uninformed people seek to blame God for something that is<br>either patently not God's fault, or something which is within God's<br>power to alter, but He has chosen to not alter. They, like the atheists,<br>believe that *if God has the power to change something, they*<br>*expect* *Him to change it.*<br><br>We could go down the path of explaining why expectations are bad, but<br>any first-year psychology student could do that, and this was asked in<br>the C&C space. Therefore, we'll keep this focused on the religious, not<br>the psychological.<br><br>This question is based on flawed logic. Let me see if I can draw out the<br>logical argument:<br><br>1.  I hold the opinion that something is wrong in my life.<br>2.  I know that God has the power to fix it.<br>3.  For whatever reason, God does not fix it.<br>4.  Therefore, God is wrong (uninformed Christian) or God doesn't exist<br>    (atheist).<br><br>So first, let's look at the deduction. Is 4 correct? If something is<br>*truly* *wrong* in your life, and if God has the power to fix it,<br>and He does not, does it naturally follow that God is wrong? Or are the<br>atheists correct that following this logic, God doesn't exist? No, it<br>does not follow. God may not intervene for any number of reasons. He may<br>not intervene because *you* may see it as a problem, but *He* does not.<br>Perhaps this trouble you are going through is meant for your growth.<br>Perhaps it contributes to God's larger plan. Or, perhaps, God *will* fix<br>it, but you're not ready. Or, perhaps, God *will* fix it, but *He's* not<br>ready (the time to fix it has not yet come). So as far as the deduction<br>to get to that end state goes, it clearly does not follow.<br><br>So we know that the logic, on its face, is wrong. But are the statements<br>themselves incorrect? This is important, because even if the logic was<br>correct, and the premises logically flowed to the conclusion, they could<br>still lead to a faulty outcome if the premises themselves were untrue.<br>And in this case, they are. Let's just start with #1. Is it true that<br>something is wrong in your life? You certainly may think so, but that's<br>not necessarily the truth. As we already discussed, God may have other<br>plans that you can't see. God doesn't answer every prayer with a yes. In<br>fact, there are four possible responses to a prayer that God can give:<br>no, slow, grow, and go. He could say no, you do not need<br>what you think you need, because it doesn't advance His good plans for<br>you. He could say slow, meaning that it is not yet His time to do<br>what you're asking. He could say grow, meaning that the time may be<br>right, but *you are not ready*. Perhaps you need to grow more as a<br>Christian. Or He could say go, meaning that He does what you're<br>asking.<br><br>So not only is the logic incorrect, but the premises themselves are<br>flawed.<br><br>**Therefore, the idea posited by the questioner, that Christians have a<br>God who they can blame and yell at when their life goes horribly wrong,<br>is both logically wrong, and based on flawed premises.**<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
