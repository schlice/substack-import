<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>First of all, let's address the elephant in the room. Despite what<br>someone may have told you, no translation of the Bible has "added" or<br>"subtracted" anything of substance to any book of the Bible. I challenge<br>anyone to show me where brand new text, "out of whole cloth," as we say,<br>has been either added or subtracted, from the Bible, from any version.<br>Show me the original text, and then show me what was added or<br>subtracted.<br><br>That said, doing translations between languages can be challenging, and<br>translating anything out of Greek is no exception. For example, there<br>are *seven* Greek words for love, and there are at least two Greek words<br>for rock. The different words describe different "contexts" of the word.<br>In the case of love, words like *eros*, which means romantic love,<br>*philos*, which means intimate friendship, *storge*, which means<br>familial love, and *agape*, which means universal emphatic love, all<br>exist. But we only have one word in English. So how do you translate it?<br>If you just say "love" when you see one of the seven Greek words for<br>love, you lose quite a bit of context. So since the very first<br>translation, there has been a debate between a "word-for-word"<br>translation, and a "sense-for-sense" translation. Both types of<br>translations exist, and the debate over which kind is best continues<br>today.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Why do so many Christians insist on using the KJV, when it has multiple<br>additions, changes, and subtractions in direct contradiction to<br>Revelation 22:18,19?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
