<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Phones have to do more than substitute words that might be similar to<br>your misspelled or unrecgonized word.<br><br>They need to do grammatical matching (i.e. does the word I\'m about to<br>substitute make grammatical sense in this sentence). Modern-day word<br>processors do grammatical checking all the time; there is no reason that<br>a suitably-powered processor on a phone (which we are rapidly<br>approaching) could also check grammar as well as spelling. The<br>convergence of those two is what produces a better spell check, and<br>therefore, auto-correct.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
