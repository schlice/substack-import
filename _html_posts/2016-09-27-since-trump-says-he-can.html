<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>There is no law which says that if you're being audited, you can't<br>release your tax statements.<br><br>That said, I think it's a stupid tradition.<br><br>We teach our kids that your financial information is private. So just<br>because you're running for President, suddenly your tax returns are fair<br>game?<br><br>We don't demand this from ***any other elected official anywhere in the<br>government***. Why do we demand this of presidents?<br><br>To be clear, he was told by his lawyer to not release his tax documents.<br>That's not because it's illegal. It's because it could hamper whatever<br>investigation is ongoing that his lawyers are handling. His lawyers told<br>him not to do it. If my lawyer told me not to do it (and they advise me<br>on legal matters), I wouldn't do it either, even if I was running for<br>president.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
