<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: [A few problems I have with your state\'s \"safe storage\"<br>law:\<br>\<br>1. Your state licenses gun ownership. This is in violation of the<br>Constitution. Unless he is a felon, \"the right to keep and bear Arms<br>shall not be infringed.\" *DC v Heller* upheld the individual right to<br>bear arms. Your state\'s law is unconstitutional and should be<br>challenged. So I\'m guessing you live in either Illinois or New York.\<br>\<br>2. It\'s clear that \"unintended consequences\" happen all the time when<br>writing law. We would have to make several things clear in the law:\<br>a. This would only be a civil penalty, not a crime. Thus, no jail time.\<br>b. The only penalty would be monetary fines.\<br>c. The State cannot be harmed by you improperly storing firearms. So you<br>cannot be \"charged\" by a police officer, or have a police officer<br>write you a citation for improperly storing your firearm.\<br>In this way, this penalty can only be assessed if someone is harmed by<br>your handgun and you made absolutely no efforts to store it properly.<br>The law can be crafted in such a way that it only hurts you if you<br>don\'t immediately report your gun as stolen (i.e. within 24 hours of<br>discovering the theft), and/or if you failed to properly store a firearm<br>(i.e. stored it loaded, unlocked, in a drawer, didn\'t make any effort<br>to separate the gun from the ammo, etc) and someone got hurt.\<br>\<br>You also assumed that you didn\'t have kids. I do. What if my kid went<br>to his friend\'s house and was playing with a loaded gun that the parent<br>didn\'t lock up? If your state has no \"safe storage\" law, I can sue<br>him for negligence, but he\'s under no legal obligation to lock up his<br>weapons in order to keep kids safe. If he wants to endanger his own<br>kids, that\'s his business I guess. But if he endangers my kids, now we<br>have a problem.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/Why-not-hold-owners-and-sellers-of-guns-or-other-weapons-financially-responsible-for-their-misuse-Is-there-any-reason-we-should-socialize-the-costs-instead-of-introducing-this-element-of-personal-responsibility/answer/Bill-Stein<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
