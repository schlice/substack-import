<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [You have a disease. Your life isn\'t over. You just get<br>\"extra\" challenges to deal with.\<br>\<br>If you had a physical handicap, like if you were missing an arm, would<br>you be able to live happily and positively, knowing the problems you<br>were going to be facing? Sure you could get a prosthetic, but it\'s not<br>the same, and they are not easy to live with. You\'re always going to be<br>missing an arm. But you can work around the problem and still live a<br>normal life.\<br>\<br>MS is the same. You can fight the disease. You can take one of the<br>approved MS treatment drugs and slow down the disease progression.<br>You\'re always going to have MS, and eventually down the road it\'s<br>going to cause you more issues than you have now. But you can work<br>around those issues and still live a (mostly) normal life.\<br>\<br>Look, everybody\'s got \"something.\" For some people, it\'s alopecia.<br>For some, its obesity. For others, it\'s low self-esteem. One way or<br>another, everyone is dealing with someone.\<br>\<br>What matters is not the size of the obstacle you have to overcome. What<br>matters is the fact that you work to overcome your personal obstacles,<br>whatever they are. Sir Edmund Hillary didn\'t look up at Everest and<br>say, \"Whoa, that mountain is too high to climb, I\'m out.\" He worked<br>at it and eventually climbed the mountain.\<br>\<br>You\'ll have to tweak some things to live a mostly normal life, but this<br>is just a roadblock; a bump in the road. It\'s not the end of the road.<br>It just means the road you\'re traveling is a little bumpier than others<br>your age. Don\'t give up the journey; improve your<br>suspension.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
