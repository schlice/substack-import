<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Your can contact the Public Affairs division of the police department in<br>question. They may provide you with information as to what was going<br>on, but they are under no obligation to do so. You can also discuss<br>policy and strategy with them, and perhaps work with them on getting the<br>word out to local citizens when something happens.<br><br>Often, police departments will publish their "blotter" online (mine<br>does). Check with your city government website and click through to your<br>police department website to see if yours does. Our city and county<br>police departments, Sheriff's offices, and PIOs (public information<br>officers) will actively tweet new additions to the police blotter. It's<br>pretty convenient. A quick look at my phone keeps me updated on the<br>goings-on around the community. Just this morning the police announced<br>via their Twitter feed that they made an arrest in a recent string of<br>catalytic converter thefts (apparently, I learned, you can recover the<br>platinum from a catalytic converter).<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
