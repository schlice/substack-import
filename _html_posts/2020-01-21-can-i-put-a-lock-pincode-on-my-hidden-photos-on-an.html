<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Can you put a lock pin/code on your hidden photos on an iPhone?<br><br>Natively? No.<br><br>But you can use a third-party application to hide and encrypt photos. As<br>an example,<br>[â€ŽGalleryVault(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=1400a7&url=https://apps.apple.com/us/app/galleryvault-hide-photo-video/id899163792){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="apple.com"}]{.qlink_container} is an app I use on Android<br>(the link is to the Apple Apps store for the iOS version) to secure<br>photos that I don't want others to see.<br><br>No, it's not porn.<br><br>I will often use WhatsApp to communicate sensitive information since it<br>is encrypted. But once the photo lands on my side, that photo is<br>unencrypted in my photo gallery. If I want to keep the photo, I will<br>transfer it into GalleryVault to secure the photo so that I can keep it<br>safe while it's in my phone itself.<br><br>Additionally, you can also set up Pro features (for a fee) such as<br>removing the GalleryVault icon, hiding it in plain sight within a<br>"GCalculator" app, and even using a special code to open a "bare"<br>version of the app with nothing inside it, so that you demonstrate<br>plausible deniability should you be forced to unlock your Gallery Vault.<br>It will store both photos and videos as well as documents, and also has<br>a camera app so that photos and videos you take will be stored directly<br>in the vault, skipping your phone's Photos storage. As if that's not<br>enough functionality, it will also allow you to use the native sharing<br>features of most apps to share photos and videos directly into the app's<br>secure storage, and more Pro features like Cloud backup and sync mean<br>that you'll never lose your encrypted photos<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
