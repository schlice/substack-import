<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The answer is "it depends." It depends on the fighter, the weight of the<br>fighter at the time, the ambient air temperature and air pressure, the<br>current speed of the aircraft at the time it runs out of fuel, and the<br>current altitude above ground level (AGL).<br><br>Every aircraft has what they call an "optimum glide slope" which is the<br>optimum attitude for the aircraft to be placed in when in an "engine<br>out" situation. Every pilot trains on the optimum glide slope when you<br>are out in training and your instructor pulls your throttle all the way<br>to idle and says, "You just lost your engine." Instincts and muscle<br>memory take over, and you trim the aircraft for its optimum glide and<br>start looking for a place to set it down. On the Cessna 172R, we roll<br>the trim wheel three turns back to trim for engine out.<br><br>But it is literally different for every aircraft.<br><br>There is a [[glide ratio<br>calculator](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=72f78a&url=http://www.csgnetwork.com/glideratiocalc.html){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="csgnetwork.com"}]{.qlink_container} on the Internet you can<br>use to calculate the optimum glide.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
