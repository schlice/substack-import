<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Because having an opinion isn't illegal (yet).<br><br>Aiding and abetting (thankfully) has an *actual legal definition* which<br>must be satisfied in order to charge someone with this crime. In<br>general, *aiding and abetting can be charged when someone helps someone<br>else commit a crime.* Now be aware, laws vary by state, but this is a<br>pretty solid definition:<br><br>> A person charged with these accomplice crimes is usually not present<br>> when the crime itself is committed, but he or she has knowledge of the<br>> crime before or after the fact, and may assist in its commission<br>> through advice, actions, or financial support. Depending on the degree<br>> of involvement, the offender\'s participation in the crime may rise to<br>> the level of conspiracy.\[1\](#mwpkX){#cite-mwpkX .citation_link}<br><br>So just looking at the general definition of the crime of aiding and<br>abetting, you can probably see that a *supporter of a political party*<br>is not "aiding and abetting a criminal" simply by supporting a political<br>party or position. In order to be charged with the crime, a person had<br>to:<br><br>- know that the crime was going to take place<br>- assist with the crime, usually through some action (and giving money<br>  is considered action). Giving advice on how to commit the crime is<br>  also covered.<br><br>Anyone who knew or aided the protesters in unlawfully entering federal<br>property could be charged with aiding and abetting in the crime of<br>unlawfully entering federal property.<br><br>But if you still believe, to this day, that the group of rioters on<br>January 6th was trying to take over the government, you need to move out<br>of your parent's basement.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Aiding and abetting a criminal act is in itself a criminal act, after<br>January 6 2021 attempted overthrow the United States Government, why<br>aren\'t his supporters indicted and for prosecuted aiding and abetting<br>after the fact according to federal law?<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-mwpkX){.citation_index} [[Aiding and Abetting/Accessory -<br>FindLaw](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=331ac7&url=https://www.findlaw.com/criminal/criminal-charges/aiding-and-abetting-accessory.html){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="findlaw.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
