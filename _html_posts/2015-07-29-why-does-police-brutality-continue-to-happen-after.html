If so why do some<br>rapists still act unlawfully?*\<br>\<br>This is not a silly conflation. If someone is going to break the law,<br>they are going to break the law. If someone is going to violate policy,<br>they are going to violate policy.\<br>\<br>The question you should be asking is when are police departments<br>going to get tougher on officers who continually engage in behavior<br>commonly referred to as \"police brutality,\" or what the department<br>calls \"excessive use of force?\"\<br>\<br>The answer is when public opinion sours enough that the department is<br>forced to change its policy regarding UOF incidents.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
