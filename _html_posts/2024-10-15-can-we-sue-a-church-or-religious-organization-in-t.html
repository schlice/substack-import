<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>You can always file lawsuits against anyone for what they have done to<br>you. The question, of course, is whether or not you can *prevail*.<br><br>And in the case of a church, what they did "wrong" to you will determine<br>whether or not you might prevail in your lawsuit.<br><br>If they *harmed* you in some tangible way, you can absolutely sue for<br>damages. You can sue to recover damages in exactly the same way as if<br>you were harmed by someone who is not a church.<br><br>But if a church promised you an *intangible religious benefit* and you<br>don't feel you received that benefit, you cannot sue for that, because<br>there is no real "harm" from not receiving an intangible benefit.<br><br>So ultlimately, what they did or didn't do will determine how successful<br>you may be in a lawsuit.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
