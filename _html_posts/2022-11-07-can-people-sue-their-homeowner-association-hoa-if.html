<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>You can sue anyone for anything.<br><br>The question is, of course, what your odds are of being successful in<br>your suit.<br><br>And in this case, the odds are pretty slim that you'll be successful.<br><br>Because unless you can prove that the HOA is fining you for something<br>that they're not fining your neighbor for, and you're both doing the<br>same wrong thing, then your fines are not "unfair." If you broke the<br>HOA's rules, you pay the fines. If it's in your Governing Documents<br>which you signed when you bought your house, you have to play by the<br>same rules.<br><br>You might *feel* that your fines are unfair. But if the HOA has the<br>power to levy fines, and they have documentation which shows you broke<br>the rules, they can fine you, and you must pay.<br><br>You should probably fix whatever it is that they're fining you over, or<br>work with them to show that you're making progress to get it fixed. That<br>would be a much better use of your time than telling the Internet that<br>the HOA is unfair.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
