<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Cops are still using alwyas-on RADAR. It\'s built in to many patrol<br>cars, so why not use it? Special stings will still take place using<br>instant-on RADAR guns and LIDAR, but those constant-on units are still<br>built in to many patrol cars, so it will still be used.<br><br>Additionally, RADAR detectors can absolutely detect \"splash\" from<br>other cars; even instant-on and LIDAR can be detected if it\'s hitting<br>other cars in front of you. So RADAR detectors are still useful, even<br>against instant-on and LIDAR. You just have to be vigilant.<br><br>And as [[David<br>Rosen](https://www.quora.com/profile/David-Rosen-5)]{.qlink_container}<br>mentioned, using them in conjunction with Waze or ESCORT Live will up<br>your chances. Finally, you\'ve probably noticed that your RADAR detector<br>is going off constantly these days as you drive around. That\'s because<br>most modern cars that have \"blind-spot warning\" systems and other<br>driver-assist systems use RADAR, and your detector picks that up.<br><br>Escort and Valentine systems (as far as I know) have built-in logic to<br>detect these in-car driver-assist systems and filter them out. If<br>you\'re going to get a RADAR detector, get a good one. Don\'t waste your<br>money on a cheap one.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
