<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Are there any proven strategies to lower the risk of cognitive<br>dysfunction in those with MS?**<br><br>The short answer is no. There are no proven strategies to lower risk of<br>cognitive dysfunction in those with MS.<br><br>Cognitive dysfunction is one of the most common symptoms of MS; over 50%<br>of patients have reported some cognitive change. With some, it was their<br>first symptom.<br><br>Some points about cognitive dysfunction in MS:<br><br>- Changes can occur at any time --- even as a first symptom of MS ---<br>  but are more common later in the disease.<br>- Cognitive function correlates with number of lesions and lesion area<br>  on MRI, as well as brain atrophy.<br>- Cognitive dysfunction can occur with any disease course, but is<br>  slightly more likely in progressive MS.<br>- You are more likely to experience cognitive dysfunction (the first<br>  signs or new changes) during an exacerbation.<br>- Cognitive changes generally progress slowly. They are unlikely to<br>  improve dramatically once they have begun.\[1\](#aOIuy){#cite-aOIuy<br>  .citation_link}<br><br>Cognitive changes do not correlate well to other symptoms. Someone who<br>has many physical changes may have no cognitive decline at all, while<br>someone who is relatively healthy physically may have significant<br>cognitive impairment.<br><br>Most of the research today focuses on treatment of cognitive dysfunction<br>rather than avoidance. Since cognitive dysfunction is a function of<br>number of lesions and brain atrophy, using the existing disease<br>modifying drugs to limit the number of lesions and limit atrophy should<br>also help to stabilize cognitive changes. Research into this area is<br>ongoing.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-aOIuy){.citation_index} [[Cognitive<br>Changes](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=869adf&url=https://www.nationalmssociety.org/Symptoms-Diagnosis/MS-Symptoms/Cognitive-Changes){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="nationalmssociety.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
