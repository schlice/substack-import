<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Would the United States Government sell a state for<br>\$100,000,000,000,000 (100 trillion)?**<br><br>*Would* they? In a hot second. I know a few states Trump would be<br>willing to sell without a second thought.<br><br>*Could* they, though? Nope, not a chance.<br><br>Even if they wanted to sell a state to a foreign country (and that<br>foreign country were willing to buy that state), the government has no<br>authority to do so.<br><br>When a state entered the union, it did so through mutual agreement<br>with all of the other states. That means that the state wanted to join,<br>and the other states allowed them to join. It was a *mutual* agreement.<br>Also, it is Congress who drives the admission of a state into the Union,<br>not the "government," by which you probably mean the President.<br><br>While a state voluntarily leaving the union has been discussed (but<br>never seriously), and the Constitution has nothing regarding such an<br>event (because the thought of it never even crossed the minds of the<br>founders), if it were to even approach the idea of legality, all states<br>would have to agree to allow the one state to leave the union. But even<br>so, *selling* a state sounds like something that would be *involuntary*<br>and in such a capacity would definitely be unconstitutional. You can't<br>deprive people of their citizenship involuntarily, and selling a state<br>would mean potentially hundreds of thousands of citizens having their<br>citizenship involuntarily revoked. There's no way in Hades that such a<br>scheme would even get off the ground, let alone fly.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
