<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [What qualifies a person to be President of the United<br>States is exactly what the Constitution says qualifies a person to be<br>President of the United States.\<br>\<br>Article 2 Section 1 Clause 5 states the qualifications for the office of<br>President and Vice President:\<br>]<br><br>- Natural born citizen<br>- At least 35 years old<br>- Has inhabited the United States for at least 14 years.<br><br>\<br>I\'m not sure what the delusion is that would make someone believe that<br>he meets all of these qualifications. When you find out what delusion<br>that is, be sure to let us know.\<br>\<br>People try to say that candidates somehow are not \"qualified\" to be<br>President, when the only qualifications for office are the ones listed<br>in the Constitution.\<br>\<br>Being a good leader is really all that\'s needed to be a good President.<br>You don\'t have to know everything, but you do need to know enough to<br>have a good staff, listen to them when they advise you, and overrule<br>them when they go off track. The leader sets the vision, the staff sets<br>the policy.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
