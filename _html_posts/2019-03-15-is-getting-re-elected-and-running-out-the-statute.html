It's certainly unfair to the plaintiff to<br>have the President avoid an indictment by running out the clock on the<br>statute of limitations when he can't be indicted, and there is a natural<br>time when he can (either the natural conclusion of his term, or<br>impeachment and removal from office).<br><br>Therefore, the statute of limitations would most likely be tolled until<br>the President could actually be indicted.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
