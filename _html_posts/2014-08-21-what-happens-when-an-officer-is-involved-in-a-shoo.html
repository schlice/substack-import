<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [EDIT: I am aware I did not answer the question, but watch<br>the video. The scream from the officer was somewhere between sheer<br>terror and pain. That touches anyone who has ever been involved in law<br>enforcement in a special way, so i wanted to talk about that.\<br>\<br>In this stop, the officers did not progress beyond attempting verbal<br>commands. The progression is:\<br>\<br>]<br><br>- I ask you to do something<br>- I tell you to do something<br>- I make you do something<br><br>\<br>The officer got to the \"telling\" step, but never progressed the force.<br>When the suspect started the looney dance, they should have been alerted<br>that this was going to be a high-risk traffic stop and they should have<br>stopped their original tack and changed the stop.\<br>\<br>When the suspect got in the officer\'s face and blatantly failed to<br>follow verbal orders, he should have been forced to the ground and<br>cuffed for his own safety, let alone the officer\'s safety, because the<br>stop should have changed to a high-risk stop. It was clear at that point<br>he was not going to comply, so there was no need for the officer to<br>continue yelling. He should have been brought to the ground at that<br>point. Instead, the officer allowed the suspect to return to his<br>vehicle, a violation of the high-risk traffic stop protocol. This is<br>what leads me to believe that they did not properly transition the stop<br>to a high-risk stop. The second officer in the vehicle should have moved<br>to assist at this point (the suspect invaded the personal space of the<br>first officer). He may have even touched the first officer; we couldn\'t<br>see that from this angle in the video. Either way, this was the point<br>that some sort of escalation in the use of force was warranted.\<br>\<br>Once the suspect went rifling around under his seat grabbing for<br>something, the incident had progressed past the point of no return, and<br>someone was going to get shot. When a stop progresses to this point,<br>someone is probably going to die, and regardless of who it is, it\'s<br>always sad. In this case, it was two officers.\<br>\<br>The officers should have progressed their use of force beyond verbal<br>commands when it was clear that the suspect was not going to comply.<br>Batons, pepper spray, and hands-on instruction should have been all in<br>play well before the man returned to his truck.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
