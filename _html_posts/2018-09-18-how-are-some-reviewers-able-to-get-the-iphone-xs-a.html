<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**How are some reviewers able to get the iPhone XS and XS Max before its<br>released to the general public and do unboxing and review videos?**<br><br>Some reviewers are directly contacted by manufacturers, and demo units<br>are offered to them specifically to do unboxing and review videos. Who<br>gets demo units is generally based on viewership and subscription<br>numbers.<br><br>It's a double-edged sword, however: pre-production units are still in<br>beta, they're not full-fledged production units, so not all the features<br>will be fully implemented in them<br><br>For that reason, manufacturers often don't allow the unboxers to do full<br>feature reviews. In some cases, they allow reviews of only certain<br>features, not all of them.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
