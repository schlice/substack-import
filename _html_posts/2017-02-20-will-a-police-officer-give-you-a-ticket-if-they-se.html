<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>They absolutely can. If they observed you driving without your seat<br>belt, or (in most states) as a front-seat passenger without your seat<br>belt, the observation is all that matters. At the time of the<br>infraction, the infraction itself is all that counts.<br><br>Would they apply some leniency if they saw you applying your seat belt<br>later? Maybe. It's up to the individual officer and the circumstances<br>under which you were stopped. Perhaps you'll get some credit for<br>(eventually) doing the right thing. Perhaps not. In any case, putting<br>the seat belt on later has no impact on the actual infraction.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
