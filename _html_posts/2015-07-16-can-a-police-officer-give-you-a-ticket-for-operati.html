<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [It is a reasonable assumption to make that you drove the<br>car to that property. You didn\'t walk up on it and start filling it.<br>The presumption was made that you drove the car to that location. And<br>it\'s a service station; it\'s not private property, but a public<br>accommodation.\<br>\<br>If you were sitting in a car on your 40-acre ranch, you probably<br>couldn\'t get a ticket.\<br>\<br>Unless you can produce the person who drove the vehicle and explain<br>where they were when the police arrived and why they weren\'t present<br>the entire time you were receiving a ticket, it is a reasonable<br>assumption for the police to make that you drove the vehicle there.<br>Plus, even if you could produce the person who \"drove the vehicle<br>there,\" you\'d still have a missing insurance card charge to deal with.<br>You\'re out of luck either way.\<br>\<br>If I were you, I\'d follow [[Cliff<br>G.](https://www.quora.com/profile/Cliff-G-13)]{.qlink_container}\'s<br>advice and get your license renewed and get your insurance documents<br>updated and petition the court for a mitigation hearing to get your fine<br>lowered. You can absolutely get your fine lowered for the insurance card<br>charge, as that charge, in most states, is a dismissible offense,<br>provided you can show that you had insurance at the time, just an<br>invalid or missing card. You will still have to pay administrative fees<br>in most jurisdictions, but that fine can be dismissed. The license fine<br>might be reduced, but you\'re still going to have to pay something for<br>that offense.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
