<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The subject should have involved the state's regulatory board<br>immediately, since HOAs have to follow the Fair Housing Act, which<br>requires them to allow ESAs in the vast majority of circumstances. That<br>means that ESAs must be allowed in all HOA controlled areas: houses,<br>condos, and common areas.<br><br>The vast majority of states have similar provisions in their state Fair<br>Housing Acts, requiring HOAs to follow the federal Fair Housing Act<br>requirements related to ESAs. Here in NC, their emotional support animal<br>laws, protected under the Fair Housing Act, grant individuals with<br>disabilities the right to have emotional support animals in their homes<br>and common areas of housing complexes, regardless of any \'no pets\'<br>policy in their HOA. The FHA protects the right of people with<br>disabilities to keep ESAs, even when an HOA's policy explicitly<br>prohibits pets.<br><br>The subject can retain the services of an attorney who specializes in<br>ADA and FHA housing law and sue for violation of the state Fair Housing<br>Act, along with seeking compensation for retaliation, pain and<br>suffering, and anything else he can think of to tack on.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
