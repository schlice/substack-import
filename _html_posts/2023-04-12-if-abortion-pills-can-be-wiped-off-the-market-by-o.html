<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>If it can be proven that abortion pills are actually harmful, and the<br>companies that manufacture them knew about that harm and covered it up,<br>it is prudent that a judge pull them from the market until the details<br>can be sorted out.<br><br>You'd want that kind of power to be resident in a judge because<br>timeliness of response is required.<br><br>And in this specific case, we found that the FDA did not do the<br>necessary work to ensure these drugs were safe. For example, the FDA<br>never studied the effects of these drugs on anyone under 18. They are<br>required to, under their own rules, but they did not. You have 12- and<br>13-year-old girls taking these drugs, and their effects have never been<br>tested.<br><br>Also, in studies conducted by the Charlotte Lozier Institute, up to 8%<br>of women experienced complications resulting from the abortion pill<br>regimen. In 2020, there were over half a million chemical abortions. If<br>just 5% of those women had complications, that means 25,000 women had<br>complications. Objectively, if 25,000 women have complications from a<br>drug, that drug is not safe.<br><br>And none of these statistics include abortion drugs that were shipped<br>illegally.<br><br>But there are details on both sides, and two different judges seem to<br>have taken two different opinions on the same question. This will have<br>to be sorted out by the Supreme Court, as it is exclusively their<br>jurisdiction when two Circuit Courts differ on the same issue.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
