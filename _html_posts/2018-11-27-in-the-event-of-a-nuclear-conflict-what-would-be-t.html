<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**In the event of a nuclear conflict, what would be the instructions for<br>the Air Force One, if it was known that major bases were taken out?**<br><br>First of all, missile flight time is not instantaneous. It would take<br>about 30 minutes for a missile to go airborne and then to impact within<br>the United States. So we do have a few minutes to react.<br><br>In the event of missile launch threatening the United States, the<br>President would go airborne from wherever he is. If he is at the White<br>House, he, the First Family, and key staffers from the White House would<br>be evacuated by helicopter to Joint Base Andrews. From there, they would<br>board Air Force One and would take off. Where and when they land would<br>be entirely up to them.<br><br>The rest of the cabinet and those in the line of succession would be<br>evacuated to [[Site<br>R](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=246c1a&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raven_Rock_Mountain_Complex){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}. For reference, on<br>September 11th, 2001, the President went airborne, and the Vice<br>President went to Site R.<br><br>NORAD staff would relocate from Peterson Air Force Base up the road into<br>the Cheyenne Mountain Complex.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
