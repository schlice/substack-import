<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>A2A<br><br>Follow the model of the Boy Scouts of America. They have been doing the<br>job the government refuses to do and has been teaching shooting to<br>elementary school age boys for decades.<br><br>The Scouts use pump-action BB rifles to simulate firearms. They teach<br>the boys to treat them *exactly* the same way as a loaded firearm.<br>They teach the boys range discipline and weapons discipline, teaching<br>them to have a healthy respect for the weapon at an early age. We (adult<br>leaders) hold the firing ranges as sacrosanct, and we make sure we show<br>the same respect to the weapons that they boys should.<br><br>We also do archery with the boys. Some school gym classes do archery.<br><br>We could very easily transfer the Scouts model to school gyms. Adding BB<br>courses alongside archery courses is a great way to introduce the<br>respect for guns at an early age. As long as the guns are treated in the<br>same way you would treat any other firearm, you can teach gun safety in<br>a safe and responsible way, and the kids can still put holes in paper<br>targets.<br><br>To go further, we could re-introduce shooting clubs to high schools for<br>those who wish to pursue the sport.<br><br>The *effect* would be to de-mystify guns. Guns, like alcohol, are<br>somehow magical and mysterious because they are restricted. While Eddie<br>Eagle's advice to kids about what to do when you see a gun (Stop, Don't<br>Touch, Leave the Area, Tell an Adult) may be wise for the untrained, it<br>teaches children that guns are things to not touch. Mix a rebellious,<br>hormonally-charged teenager with something they are not allowed to do,<br>and they will do it, *just because*. If instead, they looked at a gun<br>and said, "Meh, I know all about those," accidental shootings by<br>children would plummet.<br><br>Conversely, if we don't couple this with a commensurate increase in<br>psychological evaluations of children, we may see an increase in<br>*intentional* shootings by children.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
