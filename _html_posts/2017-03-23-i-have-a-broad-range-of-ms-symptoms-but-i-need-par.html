<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The answer, of course, is "it depends."<br><br>You must ensure that the requirements of the job can be met with<br>reasonable accommodations. Are there reasonable accommodations that<br>allow you to fulfill the essential functions of the job you're applying<br>for?<br><br>For example, what if the employer requires four hours of physical and/or<br>mental exertion per day for a part time employee? What happens to you<br>after two hours? Do you need a 30-minute break and then you can do<br>another two hours? Perhaps an employer might consider that to be a<br>reasonable accommodation. If you can only work for two hours **per<br>day**, and the employer requires four hours, this may not be a<br>reasonable accommodation. Since you're part time, the employer *may* be<br>able to schedule you for only two hours per day, but that may not meet<br>the minimum requirements that the employer has to accomplish the<br>essential functions of the job. Perhaps even a part time employee needs<br>to be available for a minimum of four hours on a scheduled workday.<br><br>To answer the specific question, you have to be able to accomplish the<br>job with reasonable accommodations. You do not have to disclose your<br>illness during the hiring process. You only need to disclose the fact<br>that you require a reasonable accommodation when you determine that you<br>actually need one. Reasonableness will be determined by you and the<br>business. It will turn on whether or not the business needs to<br>*significantly* change in order to accommodate your disability. If they<br>have to hire more workers to cover you, and they are a small business,<br>that may be considered a significant change. If they have to move around<br>a few shift schedules, that's probably something they can do. Denying a<br>request for accommodation is also very significant, and the business<br>will ensure they are well within the law before doing so. But in most<br>circumstances, the business will try to meet your accommodation.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
