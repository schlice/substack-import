He loves you so<br>much that He won't coerce you into loving Him, he only *offers* his love<br>to you. He loves you *so much* that He allows you to reject His love if<br>you choose. He allows you to choose an eternity of separation from Him,<br>and as much as He *anguishes* over this, He loves you *so much* that He<br>will let you do it to yourself if you choose.<br><br>God loves you *so much* that He took the punishment that you and I<br>deserve on himself so that we could be together for all eternity,<br>but He still allows you to reject that gift.<br><br>God *never* stops loving us. Ever. I simply can't imagine how He could<br>love us *more.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
