<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Whether they do or not, the outcome will be the same. Trump is still<br>going to take office in January.<br><br>If anything at all comes of this investigation, it will happen after<br>Trump is inaugurated. At worst, Trump would be indicted, and then the<br>Senate would have to impeach him. If they do, the vice president will<br>then become president.<br><br>However, to be fair, I don\'t see any of that happening. To me, the<br>timing is just too coincidental. For an incident that happened over 25<br>years ago to be coming to light right now seems a bit too sketchy to me.<br><br>She should\'ve come forward a year ago, and derailed his entire<br>presidential election campaign. It\'s a bit too late to stop his<br>election now.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/What-happens-if-between-now-and-Jan-20-17-evidence-is-found-that-substantiates-one-of-the-more-serious-accusations-against-Trump-and-he-is-arrested/answer/Eleanor-Murray-1<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
