<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>She won't have to, because Trump should have been corrected by now.<br><br>Trump was supposed to highlight the difference between himself and her,<br>that he is a political outsider and she has been part of the<br>"establishment" for 30 years. Instead, he jumbled the words up in his<br>head and said that she's been in power for 30 years and hasn't made any<br>improvements.<br><br>As usual, they need to work on Trump's delivery. He knows the basic<br>idea, but the way he phrases things leaves you with the wrong<br>impression. He's got to work on his delivery. He's got to work on the<br>*accuracy* of his statements. What he says, and how he phrases it,<br>matters. If he can't get that down, he's done. He needs to deliver a<br>consistent message, and he doesn't.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
