<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Depends on your definition of "prove."<br><br>Does "prove" mean that we will know, with 100% certainty, that a person<br>is guilty?<br><br>If that's what your definition of "prove" is, then we will never get<br>there.<br><br>The reason: forensic analysis uses the Principle of Uniformity, which<br>states that causes in the past are the same as causes we observe today.<br>In other words, by the Principle of Uniformity, we assume that the world<br>worked in the past just like it works today, especially when it comes to<br>causes.<br><br>But note there we said "assume." Knowledge we gain from inference is<br>never 100% certain, only highly likely. So *at best*, it can only be<br>highly likely that a person is guilty. This is why the standard of proof<br>at trial is "beyond a reasonable doubt." The standard is not "beyond<br>*all* doubt."<br><br>That is, would a reasonable person, looking at this evidence, believe<br>that the person is guilty? The jury box is supposed to be full of<br>reasonable people, so as they evaluate the evidence, they should be able<br>to say whether or not they believe that the person is guilty of what he<br>is accused of doing *beyond a reasonable doubt.*<br><br>Therefore, we can only "prove beyond a reasonable doubt," we can never<br>"prove beyond all doubt."<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
