<br/><br/>Answer<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content: <br/><br/>While I agree with all of the posters, I would have to echo<br/>[Lisa\'s(https://www.quora.com/profile/Lisa-Scroggins)]{.qlink_container}<br/>advice first and foremost.<br/><br/>If you are a person who is diagnosed with MS, I can\'t suggest strongly<br/>enough that you start one of the approved MS treatment drugs. I would<br/>caution anyone in following any other advice about any other "treatment"<br/>exclusively. Eating right and exercising are exceedingly helpful to<br/>anyone, but are especially helpful to anyone who has MS. Using<br/>complementary and alternative medicines can also help many people.<br/>However, doing these things **and at the same time excluding approved<br/>treatments** is strongly discouraged, since eating right and exercising<br/>will not slow the disease progression. They will definitely improve<br/>your quality of life and will maintain your overall health, but the<br/>disease will continue to silently progress.<br/><br/>We must be clear about this point, regardless of what you may have heard<br/>on the Internet or what you heard anecdotally from someone. **Changing<br/>your diet alone will not slow down or stop Multiple Sclerosis. There is<br/>no \"magic diet\" that will cure MS.** If you \"had MS\" and you changed<br/>your diet and it \"cured your MS,\" you didn\'t have MS. You had<br/>something else that mimicked MS, but you did not have MS. There is not a<br/>single doctor out there who can show true randomized, double-blind,<br/>placebo-controlled studies that prove that a diet will cure MS.<br/><br/>I can\'t stress this enough: eat right, exercise, and take an<br/>approved MS therapy drug. Over 20 years of research show us that the<br/>approved therapies work, and using them in conjunction with lifestyle<br/>modification offers you the best chance for successfully managing the<br/>disease.<br/><br/>(EDIT) I want to make this point clear as well.<br/><br/>There currently is no cure for MS. So, what's a "cure?" A cure, in<br/>the medical context, means that the disease *reverses course*. Any<br/>damage done by the disease is healed, and there is *zero trace of the<br/>disease* anywhere in the body. The disease is *gone*. There is no<br/>further disease process, and further medications become unnecessary and<br/>superfluous.<br/><br/>In this context, there is no cure for MS. There is no diet which<br/>will cure MS. There is no treatment of any kind which will cure MS. Even<br/>the approved MS *therapy* drugs cannot cure MS. However, the drugs<br/>*do* slow down the disease progression, reduce the severity and duration<br/>of relapses, and increase the amount of time between relapses.<br/><br/>*Can't a diet do those things?* A diet can make the relapses less<br/>severe, but it has zero effect on the disease course. The disease<br/>will continue to progress, and the relapses will continue to come. For<br/>someone with MS, the relapses will not slow down due to diet.<br/><br/>The closest we have to a "cure" right now is Autologous Hematopoietic<br/>Stem Cell Therapy (aHSCT). This treatment has been used for cancer<br/>patients for decades, and has only recently been approved for trials for<br/>MS patients in the US. Basically, it is a process by which the immune<br/>system of the body is "reset." The body's red blood cell-generating bone<br/>marrow is destroyed, and then it is re-created using the body's own stem<br/>cells. It is an extreme procedure, and it is not without risk. Once the<br/>chemotherapy is started, the *entire immune system is destroyed*. No T<br/>lymphocytes will be created. The patient must stay in isolation to avoid<br/>any disease, because even a cold virus can kill them at that point, as<br/>the body has no effective means to fight it.<br/><br/>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br/>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br/>!(images/qimg-433e86f5075cf4ecd5a917cd00d478fd){.landscape<br/>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br/>master_src="images/qimg-433e86f5075cf4ecd5a917cd00d478fd"<br/>master_w="2157" master_h="1418"}<br/>:::<br/>::::<br/><br/>&gt; Studies show aHSCT may be a safe and effective treatment in people<br/>&gt; who:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; - have relapsing-remitting MS<br/>&gt; - are less than 50 years of age<br/>&gt; - have had MS for less than 10 years<br/>&gt; - have breakthrough disease activity (new inflammatory lesions on MRI<br/>&gt;   and/or relapses) despite treatment with a high-efficacy DMT\* or<br/>&gt;   are unable to take a high-efficacy DMT.\*<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Factors including older age, greater disability and certain health<br/>&gt; conditions (for example, heart or lung disease) are associated with<br/>&gt; increased risk of life-threatening side effects following aHSCT.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; \*High-efficacy DMTs: natalizumab (Tysabri®), alemtuzumab (Lemtrada®),<br/>&gt; ocrelizumab (Ocrevus®), rituximab (Rituxan®), or ofatumumab<br/>&gt; (Kesimpta®). Some MS specialists consider cladribine (Mavenclad®) in<br/>&gt; this group.<br/><br/>For some patients who have not been helped by traditional high-efficacy<br/>DMTs, aHSCT has either radically slowed, or eliminated, the disease.<br/><br/>*Disclaimer:*<br/><br/>*This answer is not professional medical advice**, nor is it a<br/>substitute for professional medical advice.
