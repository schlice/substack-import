<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Christians seem to ask a lot of questions about why atheists don't<br>believe in their God. Are these Christians actually curious about<br>atheists, or are they perhaps showing a bit of uncertainty about their<br>own faith?**<br><br>Actually, Christians may be testing their apologetics legs by trying to<br>engage atheists in a little bit of gamesmanship.<br><br>Asking an atheist to ground their belief is the first step in a game of<br>arguing the four classic proofs for God's existence (cosmological,<br>teleological, moral, and ontological), and asking an atheist why they<br>don't believe in God is the first step towards asking them to ground<br>their belief.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
