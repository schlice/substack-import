<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>There are plenty of things unique about Christianity. Let me give you<br>just a few.<br><br>- In every other world religion, you earn your way into<br>  heaven/salvation/the afterlife. You have to live a certain way in<br>  order to get your reward. And you never know if you're "good enough"<br>  to make it. In Christianity, you can do nothing to earn your<br>  salvation; it is a gift to you. All you have to do is accept it. This<br>  creates a changed life and your right living follows your salvation.<br>  We could never be good enough to be saved. We couldn't earn it, we<br>  don't deserve it. But He saves us anyway.<br>- Only in Christianity did God sacrifice Himself to save us. He took on<br>  flesh and died on a criminal's cross to redeem us. This concept of<br>  God's grace and His sacrifice is central to Christianity and is only<br>  found there. In every other religion, you seek God. In Christianity,<br>  God seeks *you*.<br>- Christianity offers an open door to salvation, anyone can choose to be<br>  saved, and Christ can meet you where you are whatever your language or<br>  cultural background. You are not saved by works, you are saved by<br>  faith. A saved person does good works *because* of his salvation, not<br>  *in order to gain* it.<br>- In Christianity, God meets us where we are. He saves us while we are<br>  still sinners. We don't have to become perfect in order to be saved.<br><br>Ultimately, no one can tell you why you should live your life a certain<br>way. To me, however, the Christian worldview fits the evidence we have<br>better than any other worldview.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
