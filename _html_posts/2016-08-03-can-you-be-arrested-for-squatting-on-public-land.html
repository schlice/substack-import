<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The simple fact that the land is "public" does not make squatting legal.<br>The land is still owned by a local jurisdiction, then made available for<br>public use.<br><br>We had a problem recently with homeless camps until the city cracked<br>down on them, passing a citywide ordinance which states that overnight<br>camping may only take place in designated camping areas, and that public<br>land was not designated camping area. Special permits could be obtained<br>from the city for camping on public land, but homeless camps were not<br>one of the approved reasons you could obtain a permit.<br><br>And yes, violation of the law can result in arrest.<br><br>[[Homeless Camps In Colorado<br>Springs](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=f6a1a9&url=http://www.krdo.com/news/Homeless-Camps-In-Colorado-Springs/17961072){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="krdo.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
