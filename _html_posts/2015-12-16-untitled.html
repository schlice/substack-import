<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Really? A lawyer fabricating evidence isn\'t life-altering to the<br>defendant? A judge on a mission to rid the world of drug dealers isn\'t<br>life-altering to that defendant? And what\'s to say that convenience<br>store clerk isn\'t carrying a legal concealed weapon?<br><br>The difference is that the cop has the gun as part of the tools he is<br>required to carry for his job. But in this country, anyone can carry<br>life-altering power in their waistband (except for felons and the<br>mentally ill).<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/Someone-prank-calls-911-They-send-police-to-my-address-it-is-1-am-and-I-am-sleeping-I-injure-kill-the-cop-thinking-he-is-a-criminal-What-happens-The-cop-cops-didnt-yell-Police-when-coming-into-my-property/answer/Bill-Stein<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
