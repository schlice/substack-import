<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [It looks like you need to file for patent protection.\<br>\<br>You can patent your idea if it\'s a process, a machine, an article of<br>manufacture, a composition of matter, or an improvement of any of these.<br>Abstract ideas, natural phenomenon, and inventions deemed not useful are<br>not eligible to be patented.\<br>\<br>The US Patent and Trademark Office has a list of what can and cannot be<br>patented. That\'s where I would start.\<br>\<br>[[United States Patent and Trademark<br>Office](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=313c74&url=http://uspto.gov){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="uspto.gov"}]{.qlink_container}\<br>\<br>Once you have patented your idea, it is protected from being copied. You<br>can disclose your patented idea. You can turn over your patented idea to<br>someone else using whatever terms you choose (i.e. payment, requirement<br>that your name be used with the idea, etc). But before you do that, I<br>strongly suggest you consult with a patent and trademark attorney to<br>ensure that what you want to happen is really what will<br>happen.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
