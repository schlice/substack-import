<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>So clearly you are looking for an average, since there is no consistency<br>in any of those numbers. Large cities can have thousands of officers,<br>while there are many small departments (several thousand if I remember<br>correctly) which have just one officer or sheriff.<br><br>So let's run the numbers:<br><br>There are anywhere from 500,000 to upwards of 900,000 sworn officers in<br>the United States, full-time and part-time, amongst all Federal, State<br>and local agencies, performing all law enforcement duties.<br><br>There are 3.797 million square miles of land in the United States.<br><br>Doing the math, that gives you anywhere from 0.131 to 0.237 officers per<br>square mile, or, on average, roughly one officer per every 5 square<br>miles.<br><br>But again, this is a very simplistic view, as officer density is not<br>tied to acerage. Officer density is tied to *population density*, so<br>instead of officers per square mile, we generally look at ***number of<br>officers per 100,000 people.*** In this way, areas with higher<br>population density will have a much higher number of officers than an<br>area with much greater landmass and a much smaller population density.<br>This is why major metropolitan police departments can have *thousands*<br>of officers, while many small departments can have just one county<br>sheriff.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
