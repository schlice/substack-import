<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [You must be prepared to give real, honest information. The<br>department will respond in kind.\<br>\<br>You will be seated in an interview room with someone from the<br>department. It may be an officer, it may be a civilian in HR. Each<br>department is different, and depending on why you are filing a report, a<br>different person from the department will take your statement. You will<br>have to give your real name, address, phone number, and (in many cases)<br>Social Security number or driver\'s license number. These must be real.<br>Failing to give real information (anywhere during the process) leaves<br>you open to charges of filing a false report.\<br>\<br>You will be read your Miranda rights and you will be advised that<br>anything you do say can be used against you in court. You will also be<br>advised that you are making an official statement and everything that<br>you\'re about to say is true and correct to the best of your knowledge,<br>and that filing a false police report is a crime.\<br>\<br>Once the \"administrivia\" is out of the way, they will basically ask<br>you to recount everything in as much detail as possible. They will<br>usually ask you to think of the who/what/when/where/why/how of the<br>incident, and add as much as you can remember. Once your report is<br>filed, you will be contacted by the investigating group in the<br>department where you filed the report.\<br>\<br>If you are filing a report about officer misconduct, you will be<br>interviewed by a supervisor, in an interview room. Usually it will be<br>the officer\'s supervisor, but it can be any supervisor in the<br>department. If any dash cam or body cam video of the incident exists,<br>you will review it with the supervisor. Depending on the department,<br>they may offer to give you a copy of the video on DVD. They may not.<br>Department policies differ on how non-evidentiary video is treated. If<br>the supervisor agrees with you that misconduct took place, the<br>supervisor will take the information to the chain of command, who will<br>determine any appropriate actions to take. If there was possible<br>criminal misconduct, the supervisor and the chain of command will take<br>the evidence to the district attorney, who will decide whether or not<br>charges will be pressed. If there are no charges filed by the DA\'s<br>office, the chain of command will proceed with its own internal<br>disciplinary process.\<br>\<br>Be aware that you do not have a right to know what happened to the<br>officer. You can know that the chain of command received your report and<br>is determining appropriate actions to take, but what those actions are<br>is a matter of internal department procedure, and the officer\'s privacy<br>and confidentiality of his training and disciplinary records is taken<br>seriously.\<br>\<br>If you are filing a report about something other than police misconduct,<br>the appropriate reviewing agency will get back to you to let you know<br>what they\'ve done with your report.\<br>\<br>In any case, you can always call the department to ask them what the<br>status of the report is and who owns that status.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
