<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>First of all, you didn't know they had an allergy. If it was an<br>accident, then you did not intend to harm them. Accidents do happen.<br>Unless you're asking because you really did know they have an allergy,<br>in which case you were trying to harm them. Only you can answer that<br>question.<br><br>Second, people with allergies need to take some responsibility for<br>themselves and ask if the food contains whatever they are allergic to<br>before they eat it.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
