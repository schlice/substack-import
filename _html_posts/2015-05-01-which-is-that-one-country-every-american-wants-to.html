<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [America.\<br>\<br>Almost universally, Americans *live* here, but have never really *seen*<br>it all, or even most of it. It\'s a sad state of affairs.\<br>\<br>I see it in my own life, too. I\'ve lived in Colorado Springs for almost<br>25 years, have lived at the foot of Pike\'s Peak for nearly the whole<br>time, and I have never been to the top. There\'s a road, and a Cog<br>Railway that can take you up. It\'s even paved. There\'s a Summit House<br>with really good donuts. But I\'ve never been there.\<br>\<br>It\'s a beautiful place, this \"America.\" We should visit it<br>sometime.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
