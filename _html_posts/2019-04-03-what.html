<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What\'s the next step if Congress issues a subpoenas to get Muller<br>report and DOJ does not comply?**<br><br>The House Judiciary Committee (not the full Congress) has already issued<br>subpoenas to get the full, unredacted report from the Special Counsel.<br>The DOJ will not comply, because they legally are unable to do so.<br><br>If the House Judiciary Committee wishes to press forward, they will have<br>to file a lawsuit to attempt to force the matter in court. They will,<br>similarly, lose there as well.<br><br>They can also hold the Attorney General in contempt of Congress. This<br>too will have no effect. How do I know this? [[It's happened<br>before.](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=1ad2c4&url=https://www.politico.com/blogs/under-the-radar/2014/10/judge-declines-to-hold-holder-in-contempt-196650){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="politico.com"}]{.qlink_container} And in this case, just as<br>in that case, no judge in his or her right mind would hold an AG in<br>contempt of Congress for following the law.<br><br>By the way, they fully know this. This is nothing more than a publicity<br>stunt that their 2020 hopefuls can run on.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
