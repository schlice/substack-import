<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [It does sound like you\'re looking for the scenario that<br>would trigger \"verbalizing a threat\" or \"intimidation\" or<br>\"harassment\" and none of what you said rises to that level. Wishing<br>someone dead is not a crime.\<br>\<br>It is a crime if you actually threaten someone with bodily harm or<br>death. The difference is between \"I wish you were dead\", and \"I am<br>going to kill you.\"]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
