<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The consideration of ridiculousness is based on how well the belief<br>comports with knowable, observable reality.<br><br>If the belief flies in the face of what is knowable, repeatable and<br>observable, then the belief can be considered ridiculous.<br><br>For example, evolutionists believe that DNA just randomly<br>self-assembled. However, knowable, observable reality tells us that<br>messages (specified complexity) only come from intelligence. Observation<br>and repetition tell us that unguided naturalistic processes never create<br>specified complexity.<br><br>So if someone believes (without evidence) that DNA just randomly evolved<br>out of nothing, then we can rationally call that belief ridiculous.<br><br>But if someone believes that God exists, then we can point to the fact<br>that God specifically exists outside of the physical, so demanding<br>physical evidence for an immaterial god is not rational. We use the<br>evidence we do have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that God exists<br>(the evidence in nature, like DNA, and the truth which is written on to<br>every human heart).<br><br>So such a belief would not be considered to be ridiculous.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
