<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Legally, you may have violated Facebook's Terms of Service by creating a<br>fake account. If you did (and off the top of my head, I'm not sure), you<br>can be punished by being banned from using Facebook.<br><br>If the girl was underage, you can be arrested and charged with receiving<br>child pornography, but (you say) you didn't download or keep a copy of<br>the images, so there may only be the Facebook "paper trail" to show that<br>you did receive the images. If they can tie the fake account to you, you<br>can be thus charged.<br><br>If the girl was not underage, the photos may have simply violated<br>Facebook's Terms of Service again when she provided them to you on their<br>platform. They may prohibit sending or receiving adult content (again,<br>off the top of my head, I'm not sure). She may face a Facebook ban<br>herself.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
