I don\'t count Vietnam as a loss. My<br>opinion.\<br>\<br>The only country I could see doing this is China. They have the ability<br>and the finances to go toe-to-toe with the United States. And I\'m not<br>sure how long it will take. But I suspect China is<br>close.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
