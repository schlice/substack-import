Most states are similar. Therefore,<br>unless a peace officer saw you speeding, they can't give you a ticket.<br><br>In all practicality, you won't be cited for your speed simply because<br>that's not the case they are after. It would be considered "bad optics"<br>to cite the person turning over evidence in a crime, as it would<br>probably not engender much more help from other witnesses.<br><br>I think that in all cases, they'd let the speed violation slide so that<br>they could catch the actual criminal.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
