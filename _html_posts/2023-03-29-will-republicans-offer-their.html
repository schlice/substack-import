<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>In the realm of "bad questions," this one has quite a few examples of<br>badness:<br><br>- False dilemma fallacy: You compare two things that are either not<br>  comparable, or are presented as the only two options when, in fact,<br>  there are many. In this case, it's both. Not only are the two choices<br>  not comparable, but you can offer your thoughts and prayers for the<br>  families of the victims while simultaneously doing other things, too.<br>- Your statistics are wrong. Want to argue with me? Show me the source<br>  of your statistics. Two statistics are incorrect:<br>  - Trans people represent 0.011% of all mass shooters in the US<br>  - The US is the country with the largest number of mass shootings by a<br>    factor of 100 times.<br><br>We'll need to see statistics for those please.<br><br>So there's not really anything to answer here.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
