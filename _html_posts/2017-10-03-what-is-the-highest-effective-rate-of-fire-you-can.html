<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>As fast as you can pull the trigger. Each weapon has its own "cyclic<br>rate" which is the fastest that the weapon can conceivably fire,<br>assuming you could actually move your finger that fast.<br><br>This is what makes bump stocks so effective. You're actually pulling the<br>trigger each time you shoot. A bump stock doesn't mechanically change<br>the weapon. It doesn't convert the weapon to full auto, although the<br>effect is that the weapon fires at a rate close to the cyclic rate of<br>the firearm.<br><br>In order for the weapon to be considered automatic, you have to get more<br>than one shot from each trigger pull. In the case of the bump stock, you<br>get one round per pull, but you're pulling the trigger really fast. So<br>technically, it's not illegal.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
