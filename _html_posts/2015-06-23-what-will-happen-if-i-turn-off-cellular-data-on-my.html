<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Cellular data only allows the phone to connect to a data network over<br>its cellular connection (i.e. 3G, 4G, LTE, etc).<br><br>You can use Wi-Fi for most of your communications.<br><br>Also, you can choose which of your installed applications use cellular<br>data when you have it active. If you go into Settings \> Cellular, you<br>can check/uncheck the applications you wish to have access to your<br>cellular data. When the apps are unchecked, they will only communicate<br>over Wi-Fi (when you are connected). Doing this, you may be able to<br>leave cellular data active (which will only engage when Wi-Fi is<br>disconnected) and only have a small number of apps use it.<br><br>The same page (where the cellular data switches are) will also show you<br>how much data each one of your apps consumes. Note that it is lifetime<br>data; you have to reset it to see a particular time frame. The counter<br>reset button is all the way at the bottom of that page.<br><br>You can also use the "brute force" method to force everything on to<br>Wi-Fi:<br><br>1.  Activate "Airplane Mode," which turns off *all* radios<br>2.  Manually turn on Wi-Fi.<br><br>*Can I still make a phone call?*<br><br>That depends on your service provider. The iPhone has the capability of<br>supporting "Wi-Fi Calling," but your carrier needs to support the<br>feature also (since it's the carrier's VoIP endpoint that will service<br>the call). T-Mobile, by default, supports Wi-Fi calling. It's how they<br>make up the difference for an, overall, weaker cellular signal. On a<br>T-Mobile Android phone, Wi-Fi calling is on by default. On a T-Mobile<br>iPhone, you must activate Wi-Fi calling.<br><br>Not all carriers support Wi-Fi calling. For those that do not, you will<br>have to activate your cellular radios to make a call.<br><br>\<br><br>Hi readers! I'm moving! No, not my house, my column!
