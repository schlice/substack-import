<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>China has taken on a very strict "Covid-zero" policy to try to eradicate<br>the virus. Because there is a not-zero chance that your cat or dog can<br>transmit the virus to a human (even though that risk is really, really<br>small), once the pets were found to be Covid-positive, they were<br>euthanized.<br><br>The US doesn't recommend euthanizing Covid-positive pets. They instead<br>recommend the more commonsense approach of isolating the pets in a room<br>and wearing gloves when handling or interacting with them, until they<br>test negative.<br><br>You know, kinda like you do with Covid-positive *people*.<br><br>China has never been known for proportionality, so this doesn't surprise<br>me at all.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>What are your thoughts on people\'s pets being euthanized in China<br>because of COVID-19 precautions?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
