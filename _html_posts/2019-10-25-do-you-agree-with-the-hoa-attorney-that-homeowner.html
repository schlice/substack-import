<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Do you agree with the HOA attorney that homeowner associations are<br>entitled to undermine constitutional rights?**<br><br>HOAs are not government organizations. The Constitution (and the Bill of<br>Rights) prevents government from infringing on your rights.<br><br>Private organizations which you willingly choose to join can infringe on<br>your Constitutional rights. For example, HOAs can control what signs you<br>post outside your house and what they can and cannot say. They can<br>prevent you from speaking freely on the street corner with a megaphone<br>if it disturbs homeowners. They can prevent you from forming a church in<br>your house, even though you have the freedom of religion. Those are just<br>some of the ways that your rights can be curtailed, and I haven't even<br>left the 1st Amendment.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
