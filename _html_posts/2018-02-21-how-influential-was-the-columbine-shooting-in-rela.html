<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**How influential was the Columbine shooting in relation to today\'s<br>ever increasing mass shootings?**<br><br>Really? That's like asking, "How influential was Orville and Wilbur<br>Wright's flight at Kitty Hawk in relation to today's ever increasing<br>aviation industry?"<br><br>The answer is someone is always the pioneer. Someone has to be the<br>first to do something.<br><br>But in order for others to do it, someone has to be first, and then<br>*others have to hear about that first person, and believe that what they<br>did was a good idea that should be furthered.*<br><br>Columbine was a watershed moment for a lot of things. It changed<br>policing tactics and created entire new doctrines on active shooters<br>(look up "code red active shooter protocol" on YouTube sometime for more<br>information). It changed how we deal with bullying and the<br>disenfranchised in primary school.<br><br>But it also created a *movement* that others could rally behind. And<br>this movement has *martyrs,* which makes it akin to a *religious*<br>movement, which means that some people will follow it with religious<br>zeal. This, of course, was fueled by the 24/7 coverage of the event for<br>weeks following the shooting.<br><br>Columbine was the first, and the biggest, school shooting. Its founders<br>are martyrs to some, which means that some will follow that example like<br>a religion.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
