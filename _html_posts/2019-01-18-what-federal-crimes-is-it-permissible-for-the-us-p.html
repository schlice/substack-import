If any, what are<br>the applicable laws?**<br><br>You have some mixing of issues here.<br><br>The President is not *immune* from laws; he's not above the law. He's<br>still an American citizen. That said, the President cannot be *indicted*<br>while he is in office. He has to be out of office before he can be<br>indicted.<br><br>Therefore, if a president commits a "high crime or misdemeanor," the<br>Constitutional remedy would be impeachment, removal from office, and<br>*then* indictment for his crime.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
