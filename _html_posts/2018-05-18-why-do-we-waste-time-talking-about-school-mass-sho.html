<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Why do we waste time talking about school mass shootings when it's<br>impossible for America to stop them anyway?**<br><br>Your assumption is incorrect. It is certainly not impossible to stop<br>school shootings.<br><br>However, the political will, and the monetary capital, to make the<br>appropriate changes to safeguard kids in schools is simply not there.<br>Plus, the opposition to those changes (yes, people *actively oppose<br>making the security changes necessary to keep our kids safe*) amounts to<br>about half of the country, so getting these changes made is something<br>that only works at the state level, in school districts which are more<br>politically conservative.<br><br>We keep talking about mass shootings because there are things which can<br>be done to stop them. We just have to have the political will to do so.<br>And by the way, none of them have anything to do with repealing the<br>Second Amendment or removing guns from the hands of law-abiding<br>citizens. Those things won't stop criminals hell-bent on killing people.<br><br>1.  Remove the targets. Right now, across the United States,<br>    lawmakers have created "target-rich" zones called "Gun-Free Zones"<br>    in which law-abiding citizens who possess Concealed Carry Permits<br>    cannot carry their firearms. These zones are typically in schools.<br>    You will find that the *vast* majority of shootings occur in<br>    gun-free zones. Why is that? Criminals are *crazy*, they are not<br>    *stupid*. Have you ever seen a mass shooter shoot up a police<br>    station? Or a gun range? No? Why not? Don't they hate cops? Of<br>    course they do, but clearly they're not going to try to pull off a<br>    mass shooting in a place where *everyone is armed*. Duh.<br>2.  Allow teachers with CCWs to carry. To follow along with #1,<br>    allowing teachers who are already certified to carry firearms in<br>    school simply increases the number of "good guys with guns" who<br>    could potentially stop a mass shooter. I know, there are plenty of<br>    arguments about why we shouldn't arm teachers, and how teachers<br>    shouldn't have to protect kids, but I think we're approaching a<br>    tipping point where even some of the most ardent critics will say,<br>    "We have to do something, let's try this."<br>3.  Start reinforcing school security. You'll also notice that there<br>    are no mass shooters in airports. Why not? You have to go through<br>    millimeter-wave scanners or magnetometers and X-Ray machines to get<br>    in, and every other entrance is locked and secured by armed guards.<br>    The common trope heard is, "It's a school, not a prison." Of course<br>    it's not. How many "prisons" let the inmates leave whenever they<br>    want? The guards only keep the bad guys out. School districts need<br>    to get on board and start securing schools. One entrance and exit<br>    during school hours. All the other doors become alarmed fire exits<br>    only. Armed school security guards should be present. Eventually,<br>    you could sterilize the environment with magnetometers and X-ray<br>    machines if it's a problem. Create security in layers. It can be<br>    done, and it can be done unobtrusively. It doesn't have to look like<br>    a war zone, with barbed wire and smoke grenades. It can be done in a<br>    way which blends with the environment, to still create an appealing<br>    but safe location.<br><br>These are just some of the basics we can do right now, with little to no<br>effort (some clearly will need some effort, but most do not) to stop<br>school shootings.<br><br>It's just going to take the political will (and some money) to do it.<br><br>So ask yourself this: ***why won't your politician take the necessary<br>steps to protect children? Why do they enforce the policies that make<br>children into "soft targets?"***<br><br>Now go ask your politician.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
