A shy schoolboy<br>wanted to make a friend but was lost for words, so instead, he touched<br>the girl\'s arm, and he's now convicted of sexual assault.**<br><br>When they convicted him, the magistrates told him:<br><br>> The complainant\'s evidence was very clear, logical and without<br>> embellishment. We can think of no motivation for you to touch the<br>> victim other than sexual.<br>><br>> Had she not taken evasive action the assault was likely to have been<br>> even more serious.<br>><br>> The first assault can be recognised as opportunistic however there is<br>> more evidence of premeditation in the second.<br><br>Their conclusion comes, in part, from the victim assuming facts not in<br>evidence. He was attempting to touch her arm. She believed that he was<br>attempting to touch her breast, but she moved, and the touch ended up on<br>her arm.<br><br>Magistrates used that statement to *imply* that the defendant *actually*<br>wanted to sexually assault the girl. A sexual assault did not occur.<br>However, because the victim believed that the suspect actually wanted to<br>touch her breast, and it was only her movement that made it a touch on<br>the arm, the boy was convicted. Additionally, because it happened twice,<br>on two separate occasions. Put all this together, and the magistrates<br>find it to be a sexual assault.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
