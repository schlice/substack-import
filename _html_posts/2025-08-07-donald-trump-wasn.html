<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Donald Trump wasn\'t legitimately elected but Joe Biden was. Why<br>can\'t Republicans see and accept it?**<br><br>The problem is that your premise is untrue. And neither assertion you<br>claim in your question is true (yet, as of December 2020).<br><br>What makes a legitimate election? When states certify their elections<br>and Congress certifies the Electoral College vote.<br><br>To that end, Trump was indeed legitimately elected, as the states all<br>certified their election results, and Congress certified the Electoral<br>College vote. Biden has not yet been legitimately elected, as<br>Congress has not yet certified the Electoral College vote. This happens<br>in January, right after the new Congress is sworn in.<br><br>When you discuss legitimacy, you must define what exactly you're<br>referring to. As far as most of us are concerned, a legitimately elected<br>president is one who was elected in accordance with the rules specified<br>in the Constitution.<br>
