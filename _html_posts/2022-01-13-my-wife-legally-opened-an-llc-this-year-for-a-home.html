<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The short answer is that if you don't make any income, you may not need<br>to pay any taxes, but the IRS may still require you to file.<br><br>That said, even if you don't make any money, there may be some benefits<br>to filing. But you really won't find out if you need to file until you<br>enter all of your information into TurboTax first:<br><br>> When you\'re a sole proprietor, you report your business revenue and<br>> expenses on Schedule C. After you calculate your net business income,<br>> write it on your Form 1040, along with any other income you made. That<br>> includes investments, your day job and your spouse\'s day job if you<br>> file jointly. Your tax is based on the total of all that income, plus<br>> self-employment, minus your deductions.<br>><br>> Even if your business made no money, your total income may require you<br>> to write a check to the IRS.\[1\](#rhZTp){#cite-rhZTp<br>> .citation_link}<br><br>Additionally, there could be some benefits to filing even if you didn't<br>make any money. If you are eligible for a tax refund, or if you are<br>eligible for business tax credits, the only way to get those is to file.<br>Also, you can write off your business loss against business gains in<br>future years, but you won't be able to do any of that if you don't file.<br><br>If you have questions, speak to a tax professional. TurboTax has options<br>for you to engage with tax professionals from within the program.<br><br>\<br><br>*This answer is not professional tax advice, nor is it a substitute for<br>professional tax advice, or a solicitation to offer professional tax<br>advice.
