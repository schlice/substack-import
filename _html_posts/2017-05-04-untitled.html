<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Just curious, what other rights should we make dependent on whether or<br>not you pay taxes? Should churches be subject to searches without a<br>warrant? Protection against unreasonable searches should only be<br>reserved for groups that pay taxes, right? Should pastors who receive<br>salaries paid for by tax free money be afforded Miranda rights? Should<br>they be free from self-incrimination? They don\'t pay taxes, so why<br>should they? For that matter, why provide them police or fire services?<br>They didn\'t pay for them!<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/How-should-an-Independent-who-voted-for-Trump-understand-the-seemingly-hyperbolic-rhetoric-coming-out-of-a-lot-of-the-Democratic-Party-these-days/answer/Sara-Carrillo-2<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
