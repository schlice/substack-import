<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>This is a very popular Western viewpoint. All religions are right. All<br>religions are just "different paths up the same mountain." It's a<br>concept that greatly appeals to the broadly tolerant American mind. In<br>America, truth in religion is considered an oxymoron. There is no truth<br>in religion, we are told. It's all a matter of taste or opinion. You<br>like chocolate, I like vanilla. You like Christianity, I like Islam. If<br>Buddhism works for you, then it's true for you. Besides, you ought not<br>judge me for my beliefs!<br><br>But this is *incorrect*.<br><br>How do we know? Religions teach opposite things, and two opposite things<br>cannot be true at the same time. For example, Christianity teaches that<br>Jesus rose from the dead. Islam teaches that Jesus never died. Only one<br>of these is correct. They can't both be correct. Christianity teaches<br>that Jesus is God. Judaism teaches that Jesus was a prophet, a really<br>great one, but He wasn't God. Only one of these can be right. They can't<br>both be right.<br><br>Also, there can't be more than one infinite being. There can only be one<br>infinite being, because in order for two beings to be distinct and<br>different from each other, one must have something that the other lacks.<br>But an infinite being lacks nothing. So you can't have more than one<br>infinite God.<br><br>At some point, you're going to have to realize the truth that truth<br>exists, and there is only one truth and everything opposed to it is<br>false.<br><br>What truth will *you* believe?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
