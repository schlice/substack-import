<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [In addition to what\'s already been stated, the Framers<br>were also worried that the Federal government would gain and hold too<br>much power, as the original configuration had Congress electing the<br>President. Again, at the time, popular elections for President were<br>unrealistic. So the compromise was the Electoral College: the people<br>vote for Congress; the states vote for President.\<br>\<br>The idea behind this is that the state elector(s) vote for the candidate<br>that their state has elected, giving the states appropriate voting power<br>based on population as well as landmass, so as not to disenfranchise<br>smaller states. Without it, Presidential candidates can effectively<br>ignore smaller, less populous areas and pander to big cities to win the<br>majority of the votes. Larger cities tend to lean Democratic, while<br>smaller, more rural, and less populous areas tend to lean Republican.<br>Undoing the Electoral College would tip the balance of power and allow<br>candidates to effectively ignore whole regions of the country.\<br>\<br>The EC is also supposed to help prevent voter fraud, but if we can\'t<br>even agree that you need to show ID to vote, then we\'re never going to<br>truly address that problem. But I digress\...\<br>\<br>Part of the confusion is in the ballot presented by the state. It shows<br>you voting for a Presidential candidate (a popular vote), when, in fact,<br>you are voting to tell your state Electors what candidate to vote for.<br>You don\'t actually directly vote for a President. The popular vote<br>total is interesting, but not relevant.\<br>\<br>Should it be? When we become a true democracy, and every person has a<br>vote AND EVERY PERSON USES THEIR VOTE, we can disband the Electoral<br>College. But with less than 40% of the population actually voting, I<br>don\'t want to leave that to chance. I\'d rather keep the system we<br>have.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
