<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Do Conservatives lack tact because they think people shouldn't become<br>offended? Do conservatives take "personal responsibility" when someone<br>hits them for what they said, even though a responsible thing to do<br>would be to have tact?**<br><br>Wow, there are so many logical fallacies here, I think you may have<br>confused *yourself.* Let's try to deconstruct this.<br><br>> **Do Conservatives lack tact because they think people shouldn't<br>> become offended?**<br><br>Conservatives don't believe that people shouldn't become offended.<br>Conservatives believe that *you don't have the* *right* *to never be<br>offended.*<br><br>In other words, in your life, it's virtually guaranteed that someone<br>will offend you. What can you do about it? Here's three choices:<br><br>1.  Punch them because they offended you<br>2.  Sue them because they offended you<br>3.  Change the channel, leave the room, or express a different opinion.<br><br>If you picked anything other than 3, you're probably not a Conservative.<br><br>If you picked 1, you're a criminal. That's called *assault* and you go<br>to jail for that. And if you stand in front of the judge and he asks why<br>you assaulted a person and you said it was because you felt offended,<br>when he's done laughing at you, he'll probably let your charge stand.<br><br>If you picked 2, you're a snowflake. A snowflake is a person who<br>believes they have the right to never be offended. But in this country,<br>everyone has freedom, not just you! Everyone is free to express their<br>opinion, including you. Everyone has an opinion. Everyone has a right to<br>an opinion. Yes, opinions can offend. But that offense is *your<br>response* to someone else's opinion. It's not their opinion, but *your<br>response,* which is at issue. They are not required to conform to your<br>opinion because non-conformance risks offending you. You are required to<br>temper your response if you feel offense.<br><br>> **Do conservatives take "personal responsibility" when someone hits<br>> them for what they said**<br><br>Oh yes, I take personal responsibility when someone hits me. I take<br>responsibility to pick up the phone and call 911 so I can report an<br>assault.<br><br>> even though a responsible thing to do would be to have tact?<br><br>It is irresponsible to withhold your opinion simply because someone else<br>may find it offensive. That is the antithesis of a free society. A<br>society which values propriety more than openness is a dictatorship. A<br>society which values feelings above truth is a demagoguery.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
