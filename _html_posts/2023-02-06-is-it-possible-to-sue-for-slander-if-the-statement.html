<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>"it was only a joke" is never a defense against defamation. Slander is<br>spoken defamation while libel is printed or written defamation.<br><br>There are four elements to defamation:<br><br>- The defamatory statement, which is made claiming to be fact<br>- Publication or transmission of the statement to a third party<br>- Fault amounting to at least negligence, and<br>- Damages, or some harm caused to the reputation of the person against<br>  whom the statement was made.<br><br>In order to prevail in a defamation case, you need all four. And if the<br>"joke" actually caused damages, suing for defamation is still possible.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
