Stay away from junk food and<br>sugar, eat more meat and veg than carb, etc. Make sure you're<br>participating in some form of aerobic activity no less than three days a<br>week for at least 30 minutes each time. Try to throw a little strength<br>training in there on the opposite days.<br><br>Ideally, you'll want to build stamina, so some easy over-distance<br>jogging would not be terrible.<br><br>If you're doing the right things to take care of yourself now, the Air<br>Force will shape you into the Airman they want you to be, so don't worry<br>about that part too much. Just stay healthy, avoid the dumb mistakes<br>that teens sometimes make, and you'll be ready to go.<br><br>Good luck!<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
