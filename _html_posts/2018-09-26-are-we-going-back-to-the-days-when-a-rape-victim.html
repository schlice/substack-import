<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Are we going back to the days when a rape victim\'s testimony doesn\'t<br>count as evidence?**<br><br>Thanks for your question,<br>[Jordan(https://www.quora.com/profile/Jordan-Magill)]{.qlink_container}.<br>You have the question tagged with the topic of Brett Kavanaugh's<br>nomination hearings, and this is the question you ask? As someone who<br>professes to have survived professional politics, you ask a question<br>about a legal process in the context of political dinner theater.<br><br>I find that curious, that you can't tell the difference.<br><br>In the legal world, yes we've made some mistakes in our nation's legal<br>history, and failing to treat rape victims with the respect they deserve<br>was definitely one of them.<br><br>But the clown circus which judicial nomination hearings has become has<br>literally nothing to do with the legal system. In fact, Democrats have<br>completely *abandoned* any semblance of tradition imported from the<br>legal system: they have repeatedly called Kavanaugh "guilty" because<br>he's a man and a woman made an accusation. Specifically, Sen. Schumer<br>and others said that this is not a legal proceeding so there is no<br>presumption of innocence. How is this, in any way, something that would<br>be legally acceptable?<br><br>To prove it, let me ask this: *Could Brett Kavanaugh be charged with a<br>crime?* As in, arrested and charged with sexual assault, based on this<br>allegation?<br><br>The answer is an emphatic no, not only because the statue of limitations<br>has expired (which makes this a non-starter in court), but even if it<br>could be a court case, because the victim's testimony (of which you are<br>concerned) is so uncorroborated and unverifiable. Dr. Ford's testimony<br>is that while she remembers a year, she doesn't remember dates. She<br>doesn't remember where the alleged party took place. Every person she<br>has named as being present at the party has denied that they were<br>present at the party. Every person she claims took part in the assault<br>emphatically denies that it ever happened at all.<br><br>At least if she could remember a date, Kavanaugh could present<br>exculpatory evidence, as his calendar from that time has already been<br>provided (amazing that he had that, but still). So there's no way that<br>this case could be heard in an actual court of law.<br><br>So to answer your question: no, we're certainly not returning to an era<br>where rape victims' testimonies are not regarded as evidence. Because<br>nothing is changing when it comes to criminal law. The Kavanaugh<br>hearings change nothing in the law or in the rules of evidence.<br><br>But we're approaching a tipping point of *irrelevance* when it comes to<br>Judiciary Committee nominating hearings. Ever since Robert Bork was<br>treated this way, these hearings have been nothing more than, as I said,<br>political dinner theater, a place where Senators can pontificate,<br>grandstand, and audition to their base for a shot at becoming the next<br>candidate for President (see Harris, Kamala and Booker, Cory), not<br>actually find out any useful information. Anything they need to know can<br>be asked and answered in written questions and statements, and probably<br>already has been. The Senate is driving this process into irrelevance,<br>and it is by their own hand.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
