<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Why are for-profit prisons allowed? Is there any benefit to having<br>them?**<br><br>Why wouldn't they be allowed? They don't violate any laws, they follow<br>all government regulations and they provide prison services at lower<br>cost than the government can. And before anyone comments and says that<br>private prisons are not following law, you had better be reporting it to<br>your state's Attorney General, not commenting on Quora.<br><br>Even if you were to remove all private prisons today (which only house<br>8.2% of US prisoners as of 2017), you still have massive amounts of<br>private participation in the public prison system, with private<br>companies providing *services in most prisons* such as healthcare, food,<br>and communications.<br><br>Still, "\t\his works out to about 15 percent of federal prisoners and<br>7 percent of state prisoners at the time. At least 27 states<br>incarcerated people in private facilities, and eight of those states<br>used private facilities to house at least 15 percent of their prison<br>populations (not all states reported data). Montana topped that list<br>with 38 percent of prisoners in private<br>facilities."\[1\](#WenCh){#cite-WenCh .citation_link}<br><br>But since it is true that private prisons most generally follow all<br>government regulations, the problem then is that government regulations<br>are not structured to give you the outcomes you want. "The reality is<br>that private prisons are a tool, and like all tools, you can use them<br>well or use them poorly," Adrian Moore, vice president of policy at<br>Reason Foundation, said.<br><br>So if you want better private prisons, you need better private prison<br>regulations.<br><br>\<br><br>*For the time being, I have re-enabled comments on selected answers.<br>Some people like to comment. Some people like to engage with me in a<br>civil manner, and I did kinda miss that\...a little. But do not<br>misunderstand, I take this step very cautiously. My mental well-being<br>isn\'t worth your harassing, inane behavior. If you don\'t like what I<br>wrote, tough shit. If my answer is grammatically low-quality or is<br>un-cited opinion masquerading as fact, downvote it. If you think I\'m<br>wrong, write your own answer. But Quora is a question-and-answer site,<br>not a debate site. If you are simply commenting to tell me \"ackshually,<br>you\'re wrong,\" don\'t be surprised if I quietly delete your comment.<br>Put anything vaguely harassing in there, and your deletion will be<br>followed by a block and a mute, and a BNBR report. I will do this<br>immediately and with no compunction. You have been warned. Be nice.*<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-WenCh){.citation_index} [[Here\'s Why Abolishing Private<br>Prisons Isn\'t a Silver<br>Bullet](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=8151e4&url=https://www.themarshallproject.org/2019/09/12/here-s-why-abolishing-private-prisons-isn-t-a-silver-bullet){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="themarshallproject.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
