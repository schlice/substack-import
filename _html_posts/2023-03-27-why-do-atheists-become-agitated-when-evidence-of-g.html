<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Because it's not the "right kind" of evidence.<br><br>Evidence exists. Not everyone finds the evidence compelling or<br>convincing --- that's by design. But that doesn't mean that the evidence<br>is nonexistent.<br><br>The problem is when atheists demand proof which is either<br>unreasonable or irrelevant. They tailor the definition of "evidence" so<br>narrowly that God's existence can never meet their unrealistic burden of<br>proof. Clearly, you're not going to find *physical* evidence of a God<br>who is not physical, and some atheists will claim that if God is not<br>material, then God does not exist. However, even those very same<br>atheists and devout skeptics agree that many things which are immaterial<br>do exist. For example, the laws of logic are not visible or material,<br>but they are indeed real and can be examined and used as proof. The same<br>would hold true for other concepts like morality and love. In fact,<br>thought and reason itself is immaterial. Yes, it involves chemicals in<br>the brain, but chemicals do not reason, they do not think. So thought<br>and reason are not purely material.<br><br>There are several broad categories of evidence for the existence of God.<br>None of them taken alone can prove that God exists, or even that the God<br>of the Bible provides an accurate description of Him. But when you take<br>them together, they provide a fairly compelling argument that God is<br>real and He does exist.<br><br>- Humans have a natural "sense" of God. Both anthropologists and<br>  historians agree that nearly all people who have ever lived have had<br>  some form of supernatural belief. There are vanishingly few people<br>  worldwide who totally reject all manifestations of a higher force or<br>  spirit. Even in extremely \"secular\" cultures, this is true. Secular<br>  fields of research like cognitive science of religion contend that<br>  such convictions are ingrained in the human mind\'s basic structure.<br>  This implies, at the very least, that there is something real to be<br>  perceived, just as the senses of sight and hearing focus on real<br>  phenomena.<br>- Logic points to the existence of God. Several logic-based<br>  arguments support the existence of God. Though they are challenging to<br>  argue against, some, such as the ontological argument, are not thought<br>  to be particularly compelling. Some are thought to be considerably<br>  more reliable, such the kalam cosmological argument. Along the same<br>  lines, teleological arguments---such as intelligent design---draw<br>  logical conclusions from facts to support the presence of God.<br>- Observational science supports the existence of God. Because so<br>  many components of reality seem to have been planned out, teleological<br>  arguments can be convincingly made. Such proof strongly suggests the<br>  existence of a Creator on its own. The Big Bang is a well-known<br>  illustration. Atheists initially opposed this theory because they felt<br>  it was too \"religious.\" Nonetheless, secular science\'s proof of a<br>  non-eternal cosmos lends substantial support to the assertions made in<br>  the first few chapters of the Bible.<br>- History, literature and archaeology support the existence of God.<br>  Whether or not opponents agree with it, the Bible is a reliable source<br>  of proof for God\'s existence. Not just \"because the Bible says so,\"<br>  but also due to the Bible\'s track record of accuracy. It is illogical<br>  to dismiss it as prejudiced just because it asserts ideas that<br>  skeptics do not agree with. That would be just as illogical as denying<br>  the validity of every biography of Julius Caesar and then asserting<br>  that there are no records mentioning him. While debating the existence<br>  of God, it follows that we would point to the Bible\'s accuracy and<br>  its consistency with secular history and archaeology.<br>- Personal experiences support the existence of God. These are<br>  undoubtedly compelling just for those specific people. But a lot of<br>  people have developed extremely personal relationships with and<br>  understandings of God. These experiences are legitimate to take into<br>  account as supporting evidence for the existence of God insofar as<br>  they align with other evidence. It would be virtually impossible to<br>  deny everyone in all of human history who has ever had any kind of<br>  spiritual experience. This includes Abraham, Moses, Isaiah, Kepler,<br>  Newton, Pascal, and Jesus Christ himself.<br><br>Finally, it's important to note that it is literally the weakest<br>response to evidence of God's existence to simply ignore it and claim<br>"there is no evidence." This claim usually comes alongside a very fluid<br>definition of what is considered proof. Just like what happened with the<br>Big Bang (which virtually no one denies by this point), atheists will<br>still ignore the (continually growing) mountain of evidence that the<br>universe, and all time, space, and matter within it, began at a single<br>point and nothing existed before that, and will still claim that humans<br>are some cosmic accident arising uncaused, from random, nonliving<br>chemicals. First, disprove Einstein's Theory of General Relativity and<br>then we'll talk about the merits of "from Goo to You through the Zoo."<br><br>But just as one person's belief that God exists doesn't make it true,<br>one person's disbelief doesn't make God's existence untrue. Combining<br>what we know from logic, science, personal experience, and other areas,<br>there is more than enough evidence that God exists. In fact, there is<br>more evidence which shows that God exists than evidence which shows that<br>God does not exist.<br><br>In fact, you atheists who are chomping at the bit to reply to me, **I<br>challenge any one of you to provide me with proof that God does not<br>exist.** Any proof will suffice. There is plentiful evidence of God's<br>existence, but there is no proof that He does not exist. Therefore, more<br>faith is required to be an atheist than to be a theist, because more<br>evidence exists proving God's existence than not.<br><br>TL;DR: When presented with the facts, and when presented with the<br>truth that it takes more faith to be an atheist than it does to be a<br>theist, I can understand why atheists become agitated. It's called<br>*cognitive dissonance*, and yes it is very annoying. It can be really<br>agitating to have to try to explain away all of the affirmative evidence<br>for the existence of God. And the farther along we go, and the more<br>science we learn, the more we find out that the universe is even more<br>impossibly complex than we could ever have imagined, and natural<br>processes become less and less likely to have been able to do what<br>atheists say they did.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
