<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Sure!<br><br>You know what else we could do? We could say that only people with *some<br>skin in the game* should be able to affect the outcome of the country.<br>So you can only vote if you own land. Then, only people *who have<br>something to lose* can vote.<br><br>And we certainly don't want people with no money voting to give<br>themselves federal dollars, so only people with money should vote. Yeah,<br>you should have to pay a fee to vote. We can call it a *poll tax*<br>because Congress is able to levy taxes. It's right there in the<br>Constitution.<br><br>Oh wait. They already said all of these things violate the Equal<br>Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment.<br><br>Darn. I guess the law really does apply to all citizens then, regardless<br>of education level.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
