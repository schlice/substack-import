<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Why has someone not challenged the legitimacy of the reconstruction<br>amendments?**<br><br>Maybe I don't understand what you mean by by challenging the legitimacy<br>of a Constitutional amendment.<br><br>The Amendments (13, 14, and 15) were passed by Congress and ratified by<br>the states. They followed the Constitutional process to make an<br>amendment. That makes them *de facto* legitimate Constitutional<br>amendments.<br><br>(EDIT) The OP was actually asking about the argument that the amendments<br>were illegitimate because the Southern state governments were not<br>actually legitimate.<br><br>This argument usually follows one of two basic argument lines:<br><br>1.  The southern state governments were not legitimate because of the<br>    irregular way in which those governments were created.<br>2.  Some or all of the ratifications were extorted through unlawful<br>    federal threats.<br><br>There are three basic rationales under which, despite the aforementioned<br>arguments, the amendments were still valid.<br><br>1.  Southern state ratification was unnecessary, because the former<br>    Confederate states, at the time, were not counted as states as far<br>    as Article V is concerned, and therefore didn't count in the<br>    ratification process anyway. And even if all the southern states<br>    voted against the amendments, there was more than enough support in<br>    the remainder of the states to ratify them anyway. While this theory<br>    holds water, I don't really find it particularly persuasive.<br>2.  Determining whether or not a state's government is lawful is a<br>    political question which is ultimately decided by Congress. Congress<br>    recognized the postwar Southern state governments as legitimate. To<br>    that end, their votes were legitimate, regardless of the actual<br>    legitimacy of their state governments. This particular argument<br>    could go either way, in my opinion, so I'll not rely on it as a<br>    rationale for why the amendments are valid.<br>3.  The most persuasive argument is the fact that those Southern state<br>    governments had *de facto authority*. We have long recognized de<br>    facto government authority in our history. We accept it with other<br>    world governments, so we also accept it with our state governments.<br>    Because the Southern state governments exercised de facto authority<br>    over their states, even if their governments were, in truth,<br>    illegitimate, their decisions remain binding. Therefore, their votes<br>    are also binding.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
