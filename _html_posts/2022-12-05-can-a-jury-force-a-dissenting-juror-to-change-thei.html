<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>*Force?* No, a jury cannot *force* a dissenting juror to change their<br>mind. They may attempt to *pressure* the juror to do so, often bemoaning<br>the fact that if they continue to deliberate but continue on past the<br>end of the day, they may end up being sequestered for the night (but<br>more importantly, they have to come back the next day to keep going).<br>The jury foreman should prevent juries from devolving into pressuring<br>any one juror to change their mind. If the fact is that all of the<br>jurors are confident in their votes, and none of the jurors have any<br>questions about the facts as presented, then a non-unanimous decision<br>means that the jury is *deadlocked.* The foreman should make sure that<br>everyone's questions are answered, but should ensure that no one feels<br>pressured into changing their votes.<br><br>If the jury finds themselves hopelessly deadlocked, the jury is<br>considered *hung*. This leads to a mistrial. No decision is<br>made. It is then up to the state to decide if they are going to re-try<br>the case in front of another jury, or the plaintiff or the state may<br>simply decide to not re-try the case and the case is dropped.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
