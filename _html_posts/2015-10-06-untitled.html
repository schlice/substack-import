<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: [*We need to change from a sense of entitlement to a form<br>of earned reward.*\<br>\<br>That\'s the problem with rights, isn\'t it. You are never \"rewarded\"<br>with a right. You are rewarded with a privilege. Privileges are earned,<br>and can be revoked. Neither of those conditions apply to rights. Rights<br>are natural and are bestowed just by being a citizen. They are<br>\"unalienable\" because you can never not be human, so you can never<br>lose those rights.\<br>\<br>*You can owen the AR-15, but first you need to take this weapons safety<br>and handling class and prove you can responsibily shoot the thing.*\<br>\<br>There are no requirements in order to be able to exercise your rights.<br>In fact, if you impose such a standard, you actually *restrict* the<br>right to people who can afford the safety and handling class, which is<br>thus unconstitutional because it prevents an entire class of citizens<br>from being able to exercise their rights.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/How-do-British-police-officers-manage-to-stop-knife-wielding-suspects-safely-when-they-dont-carry-firearms-A-knife-wielding-suspect-is-likely-to-be-shot-by-North-American-police/answer/Samuel-Agboola<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
