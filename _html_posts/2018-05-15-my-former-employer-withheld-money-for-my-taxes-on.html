<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What happens if my ex-employer never pays the IRS my withholding? Will<br>I still get my refund?**<br><br>The answer, of course, is "it depends," and it all depends on whether or<br>not you have a W-2 which shows that the employer withheld the amount<br>from your paycheck.<br><br>*If you have a W-2 which shows that your employer withheld Federal<br>income taxes from your paycheck*, then you're fine. You submit what your<br>employer gave you (because it's the same thing the employer gives the<br>IRS), it is used to compute your actual tax due, and if you have<br>overpaid (based on what your employer claims they withheld), you get a<br>refund, period. If the employer then fails to pay the withholding to the<br>IRS, that's between the IRS and the employer, not you.<br><br>*If you have a W-2 which shows that* *no taxes were withheld*, then<br>the responsibility is on you to pay those taxes on your income. This<br>sucks royally, and if an employer did that to me, I'd be out the door in<br>a hot second. That's a lotta tax that I'd owe. I'd have to set up a<br>payment plan with the IRS in order to repay the tax I owed. No fun at<br>all.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
