<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I started out my faith journey as a baby, when my parents baptized me as<br>a Roman Catholic. I was "sprinkle baptized," which isn't Biblical. No<br>one was "sprinkle baptized" in the Bible. And no one was a baby, either.<br><br>Catholics believe that baptism is required to impart God's grace, so<br>parents get their babies baptized as quickly as possible.<br><br>Protestants do not believe that baptism does anything special to you.<br>**Protestants do not believe that baptism saves you. Protestants believe<br>that baptism is what saved people do.**<br><br>Later on, I was baptized by immersion of my own choosing and through the<br>urgings of the Spirit, to show that I was "all in" on my faith.<br><br>We were commanded to be baptized, to prove to the world and to ourselves<br>that we stand for something greater than ourselves, not to gain<br>salvation. Ephesians 2:8--9 says that it is by grace through faith that<br>you are saved, not by anything you can do yourself. Baptism (as a thing<br>you do) no more saves you than putting on a Tampa Bay Lightning jersey<br>makes you an NHL hockey player. You become an NHL hockey player when you<br>sign your contract, just as you are saved when you repent and believe.<br>Much like the hockey jersey represents your NHL contract, baptism is an<br>outward sign of an inward salvation. But anyone can put on a hockey<br>jersey; it doesn't make them any more a hockey player than dunking<br>yourself in a tub of water makes you saved.<br><br>TL;DR: Repentance and belief save you. Baptism does not save you.<br>And once you've been baptized (through immersion baptism), you don't<br>need to be baptized again. You can certainly choose to be baptized<br>again, but it's not necessary, and one might question your motives if<br>you were already saved and you've already been baptized.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
