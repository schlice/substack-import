<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I think you missed what I was saying, because I absolutely agree with<br>you. Point a), I'm not so sure that a lack of funding within law<br>enforcement is the issue. Perhaps a shortfall of funding within BATFE<br>(whose jurisdiction FFLs fall under) is indeed the issue. Point b), we<br>should most definitely make those arrests, and Point c), we should<br>actually immediately revoke that FFL from that dealer. Even in cases<br>where the FFL has found to be in the wrong, very rarely is the license<br>actually revoked. This is a travesty. And Point d) would be moot if we<br>could get BATFE to do their jobs and revoke FFLs from dealers who<br>actually do break the law. If they can no longer sell firearms because<br>they're not playing by the rules, we would indeed put a big dent in the<br>illegal arms trade. It would, of course, transition to other forms of<br>illegal arms trade outside of the errant illegally-operating FFLs, but<br>when you're faced with a dam with a million holes, you gotta start<br>plugging those holes somewhere.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/Is-America's-political-process-enabling-a-lack-of-gun-control/answer/Robert-Suchner<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
