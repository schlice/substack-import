<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>There are ten known *non-Christian writers* who mention Jesus within 150<br>years of His life:<br><br>- Flavius Josephus, a Jewish historian<br>- Tacitus, a Roman historian<br>- Pliny the Younger, a Roman politician<br>- Phlegon, a freed slave who wrote histories<br>- Thallus, a first-century historian<br>- Seutonius, a Roman historian<br>- Lucian, a Greek satirist<br>- Celsus, a Roman philosopher<br>- Mara Bar-Serapion, a private citizen who wrote to his son<br>- the Jewish Talmud.\[1\](#haDCZ){#cite-haDCZ .citation_link}<br><br>Some of these non-Christian sources, such as Celsus, Tacitus, and the<br>Jewish Talmud, could be considered *anti-Christian* sources. While these<br>works do not have any eyewitness testimony that contradicts events<br>described in the New Testament, they are works written by writers whose<br>tone is decidedly anti-Christian.<br><br>What can we learn from them and the more neutral non-Christian sources?<br>We learn that they admit certain facts about early Christianity that<br>help us piece together a storyline that is surprisingly congruent with<br>the New Testament. Piecing together all ten non-Christian references, we<br>see that:<br><br>1.  Jesus lived during time of Tiberius Caesar.<br>2.  He lived a virtuous life.<br>3.  He was a miracle worker.<br>4.  He had a brother named James.<br>5.  He was acclaimed to be the Messiah.<br>6.  He was crucified under Pontius Pilate.<br>7.  He was crucified on the eve of the Jewish Passover.<br>8.  Darkness and an earthquake occurred when he died.<br>9.  His disciples believed he rose from the dead.<br>10. His disciples were willing to die for their belief.<br>11. Christianity spread rapidly as far as Rome.<br>12. His disciples denied the Roman gods and worshiped Jesus as God.<br><br>And we learn all of this from *non-Christian* sources.<br><br>When we *combine* the non-Christian sources with the Christian sources,<br>there was *more* written about Jesus within 150 years of His life than<br>was written about Julius Caesar. There was *as much* written about Jesus<br>as was written about Tiberius Caesar, the actual emperor at the time.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-haDCZ){.citation_index} [[Baker Encyclopedia of Christian<br>Apologetics;Baker Reference Library: Geisler, Norman L.: 9780801021510:<br>Amazon.com:<br>Books](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=b42f70&url=https://www.amazon.com/Encyclopedia-Christian-Apologetics-Reference-Library/dp/0801021510){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="amazon.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
