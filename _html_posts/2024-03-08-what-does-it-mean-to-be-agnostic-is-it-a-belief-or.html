<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Agonstics are different than atheists. Atheists say "I know there is no<br>god," while agnostics say "I don't know if there is a god."<br><br>But there are two types of agnostics. Ordinary agnostics say "We don't<br>know anything for sure." Ornery agnostics say "We can't know anything<br>for sure."<br><br>The ornery agnostic's position, however, is logically unsupportable. If<br>you say, "We can't know anything for sure," you are making an *absolute*<br>truth statement to try to prove something which you are claiming you<br>can't know absolutely. In other words, when you say you can't know<br>anything for sure, *how do you know* *that* *for sure?* You'd have<br>to know what you claim you can't know in order to make that statement.<br>So it is logically unsupportable. It's a self-defeating position.<br><br>So let's look at the ordinary agnostic's position. If, as the ordinary<br>agnostic does, you say, "We don't know anything for sure," then why<br>don't you know? Most ordinary agnostics at this point claim that the<br>reason that they don't know is because no one has shown them the<br>evidence.<br><br>The problem is that the evidence they think they want just isn't<br>available. To find out why, see my other answer on this:<br><br>[[Bill Stein\'s answer to When religious folks tell me to have faith<br>when I ask for concrete evidence backing the existence of their God how<br>is that any different from \"trust me bro\"? in Practical<br>Faith](https://practicalfaith.quora.com/When-religious-folks-tell-me-to-have-faith-when-I-ask-for-concrete-evidence-backing-the-existence-of-their-God-how-is-th-2)]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
