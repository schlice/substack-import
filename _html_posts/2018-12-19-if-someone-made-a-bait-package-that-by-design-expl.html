<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If someone made a bait package that, by design, exploded and killed a<br>package thief, how would such a case play out in court? Would the<br>package designer be guilty of murder?**<br><br>Yes. Booby traps are illegal for just this reason.<br><br>First of all, it is not the bait package designer's place to determine<br>that a thief deserves the death penalty when a court would never<br>prescribe such a remedy. Secondly, booby traps are *indiscriminate*.<br>They can harm good guys in just the same way that they can harm bad<br>guys. What if the thief's kid happened upon the stolen package and<br>triggered it?<br><br>The only way to make a real bait package is to *over-engineer* it.<br><br>[https://youtu.be/xoxhDk-hwuo(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=9cbb23&url=https://youtu.be/xoxhDk-hwuo){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>One of the best lines I have heard spoken by anyone ever is Mark's line<br>in this video:<br><br>> Ultimately, when they open the package, I just wanted to celebrate<br>> their choice of profession with a cloud of glitter, because, I mean,<br>> who doesn't love glitter?<br><br>By the way, this particular Mark Rober video (who if you don't subscribe<br>to, I [[highly<br>recommend](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=fefd12&url=https://www.youtube.com/markrober){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="youtube.com"}]{.qlink_container}) is literally going<br>*viral*. It's getting picked up by mainstream media channels now. i<br>think I saw it on the Daily Wire this morning, and CNBC yesterday.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
