<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: [Communism means that whatever you make belongs to the<br>government, and the government will give you everything you need.\<br>\<br>Socialism means the government controls the means of production and<br>therefore controls the results of production. You\'re only given what<br>the government chooses to give you.\<br>\<br>Your assessment that the country is \"happier\" than the US doesn\'t<br>mean that socialism is better.\<br>\<br>Even in the United States, some industries are indeed controlled by the<br>government. Amtrak and the US Postal Service are businesses which have<br>been nationalized. That doesn\'t make them effective business models. It<br>simply means that legislators have decided that tax dollars would<br>support those industries.\<br>\<br>And just because I said that bridges and roads was a result of \"proper<br>functioning government\" doesn\'t mean that socialism means \"not proper<br>functioning government.\" You read that into my answer. Socialism is a<br>form of government. Communism is a form of government. A Federated<br>Republic is a form of government. I won\'t say that one is \"better\"<br>than the other. In some cases, some function well; in others, they do<br>not. In the United States, we built a model of government which is<br>largely not communistic or socialistic. The Federal government is<br>intentionally limited in size, scope, and power, and the state<br>governments have the authority to do far more than the Federal<br>government. It\'s a model that works for us. It certainly wouldn\'t work<br>well for every country, but it works for us.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/Should-we-trust-Bernie-Sanders-if-he-begins-to-say-he-is-not-a-socialist/answer/A-Eldritch-Peacock<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
