<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [You\'re already screwed because you made a verbal contract<br>with no defined repayment terms. Thankfully you did tell him that you<br>were actually going to set a date at some time in the future, so with<br>enough advance notice, I think you can set a date without too much<br>damage to your friendship.\<br>\<br>I don\'t think you\'re ready for court though. First, write a letter<br>indicating that you are adding the repayment terms to your verbal<br>contract. Send it certified, give him plenty of time before you require<br>repayment, but set a start date.\<br>\<br>Then, if he still fails to repay you, you can look at court<br>options.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
