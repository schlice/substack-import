<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [I\'m sorry, but the other posters here are incorrect.\<br>\<br>The RFRA as has been interpreted in Indiana (which has been on the books<br>since the 90\'s) only allows for businesses to be granted religious<br>exemptions from government programs.\<br>\<br>It says nothing about individual actions.\<br>\<br>The original RFRA was in relation to Native Americans and peyote. Native<br>Americans claimed a religious exemption because of peyote in their<br>religious practices, and the RFRA was born, passed by a Democratic<br>Congress and signed into law by Bill Clinton.\<br>\<br>It was used most recently by Hobby Lobby, claiming a religious exemption<br>to the Affordable Care Act. And the exemption was granted, and it was<br>upheld by the Supreme Court.\<br>\<br>Note that the LGBT cases had nothing to do with RFRA, and any religious<br>exemption attempted to be claimed by individual businesses attempting to<br>not serve the LGBT community failed. Those businesses were legally<br>compelled to serve gays, or face fines. The last business that tried to<br>deny service to gays was run out of business.\<br>\<br>(EDIT) It appears that people are confused because there is a federal<br>law and Indiana passed their own law too. Yes, along with at least 26<br>other states, Indiana also passed their own law. It\'s pretty close to<br>the exact wording of the Federal law. There are some minor differences,<br>and LGBT supporters believe that the law will be used by businesses to<br>deny service to them. The differences between the two laws are very<br>minor wording differences, and the governor made it clear that he would<br>clarify the law to ensure that it would not be used by businesses to<br>discriminate against individuals.\<br>\<br>Again, much ado over nothing.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
