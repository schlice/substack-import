<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The Bible says that Jesus is God's son. But the Bible also says that<br>Jesus is God in the flesh.<br><br>*wait...what?*<br><br>The Trinity is a really difficult concept to understand. It simply does<br>not make sense in a human context.<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-5bd24f46e8e187f5d22cac5dc1fe85be){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-5bd24f46e8e187f5d22cac5dc1fe85be" master_w="473"<br>master_h="385"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>To try to end some of the confusion, I'll call God the Father by His<br>name, Yahweh. Yahweh is God. Jesus is God. The Holy Spirit is God.<br><br>But Yahweh is not Jesus. Jesus is not the Holy Spirit. And the Holy<br>Spirit is not Yahweh.<br><br>One God, three persons, wholly distinct, yet one and the same. This is<br>literally a concept that is antithetical to our human experience. Either<br>they are distinct or they are not.<br><br>What's even weirder is that God exists as all three persons of the<br>Trinity *at the same time.* It's not that God can only exist as one or<br>the other. The example of water is only useful if you consider a glass<br>of water, with an ice cube in it, and water vapor at the surface. Three<br>states of water, all existing simultaneously. It may not be the best way<br>to describe a triune God, but it is one way.<br><br>Jesus is God, and Jesus is Yahweh's son<br><br>We know Jesus is Yahweh's son, because He told us so.<br><br>> Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to be baptized by John. But<br>> John tried to deter him, saying, "I need to be baptized by you, and do<br>> you come to me?"<br>><br>> Jesus replied, "Let it be so now; it is proper for us to do this to<br>> fulfill all righteousness." Then John consented.<br>><br>> As soon as Jesus was baptized, he went up out of the water. At that<br>> moment heaven was opened, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like<br>> a dove and alighting on him. And a voice from heaven said, "This is my<br>> Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased." --- Matthew 3:13--17<br>> NIV<br><br>Not only do the words explain that Jesus is God's son, but we see the<br>Holy Spirit in the form of something that looked like a dove. All three<br>persons of the Trinity, all separately represented, but all three are<br>God.<br><br>Jesus also admits that He is God. The most famous, in my opinion:<br><br>> Jesus answered, "If I glorify Myself, My glory is nothing; it is My<br>> Father who glorifies Me, of whom you say, 'He is our God'; and you<br>> have not come to know Him, but I know Him; and if I say that I do not<br>> know Him, I will be a liar like you, but I do know Him and keep His<br>> word. Your father Abraham rejoiced to see My day, and he saw *it* and<br>> was glad." So the Jews said to Him, "You are not yet fifty years old,<br>> and have You seen Abraham?" Jesus said to them, "Truly, truly, I say<br>> to you, before Abraham was born, I am." --- John 8:54--58 NASB<br><br>That term "I AM" in the Bible refers to God. It is an Old Testament<br>reference from Moses, when God sent him to the Israelites:<br><br>> God said to Moses, "I am who I am. This is what you are to say to the<br>> Israelites: 'I am has sent me to you.'" --- Exodus 3:14 NIV<br><br>So when Jesus said "Before Abraham was born, I am," He was referring to<br>Himself as God. The Jews listening to Jesus speak knew *exactly* who He<br>was referring to when He said that, because their response is recorded<br>in the very next verse:<br><br>> At this, they picked up stones to stone him, but Jesus hid himself,<br>> slipping away from the temple grounds. --- John 8:59 NIV<br><br>Blasphemy was a crime punishable by death by stoning. When the Jews<br>heard Jesus refer to Himself as God, they immediately picked up stones<br>to kill Him. The only way Jesus could have slipped away was if there was<br>a commotion when He spoke those words. So clearly, they fully understood<br>what He said, and it caused quite a stir. It caused so much commotion<br>that Jesus was able to blend in to the rioting crowd and slip away<br>before He could be stoned.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
