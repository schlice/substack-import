<br/><br/>Answer Comment<br/><br/><br/>Content: [\&gt; when we remove the tests and intrusion from<br/>heterosexuals in determining the ability to conceive (which already<br/>exists in lots of ways today), why, using your logic, do they not lose<br/>the right to marriage as you expect gays to?\<br/>\<br/>There are two questions there. First, you said that \"I expect gays to<br/>LOSE the right to marriage\" implying I expect them to lose a right they<br/>already possess, which is not true. This right never existed, for all of<br/>the reasons we already described.\<br/>\<br/>Secondly, the methods by which we determine whether or not a couple is<br/>fertile is not at question. Be it easy or hard, intrusive or plainly<br/>visible, the couple\'s fertility or ability to have children is not part<br/>of the equation. Your answer reveals that you missed the point. Let me<br/>try to make it more clear.\<br/>\<br/>1. Evidence, both scientific and anecdotal, reveals that children have<br/>the BEST chance for success in life (not the only chance, but the<br/>best one) if they are raised in a single household with their biological<br/>parents. Dispute this if you must, but the state currently believes the<br/>evidence it has, and so does the majority of society, otherwise this law<br/>would have been easily overturned everywhere.\<br/>\<br/>2. The state has an overriding interest in protecting the welfare of<br/>children. Doing whatever it can to benefit children is a state<br/>interest.\<br/>\<br/>So, to recap what I just said, children are best raised in a house with<br/>their biological parents. The state has an overriding interest in<br/>providing what\'s best for children. Therefore, the state incentivizes<br/>the familial configuration that provides the best possible outcome for<br/>children (not the only one, just the best one). Other factors are not<br/>considered, regardless of how easy or difficult it is to tell whether or<br/>not someone is able to have children. The law has never been oriented in<br/>this way. The focus is the children, and encouraging adults to arrange<br/>their lives in such a way to provide the best possible outcome for<br/>children. The law has always been oriented in this way.\<br/>\<br/>If such a time comes that two men or two women, without a great deal of<br/>medical intervention, can easily produce children, AND it is found that<br/>such a familial arrangement produces children with a better chance of<br/>success than traditional family configurations, the marriage law should<br/>be revisited. Until then, and assuming that all of the above is still<br/>true, changing the marriage law does not benefit children. And since the<br/>law is about children, a change in the law must benefit children.\<br/>\<br/>Therefore, the law follows what\'s best for children, so if the evidence<br/>shows that children of same-sex couples have a better chance of success<br/>in life than heterosexual couples, the law would have to change to<br/>incentivize that relationship. However, it would be a very long and<br/>arduous process to reprogram generations of people to believe this is<br/>true, despite the biological evidence and the anthropological ideas<br/>which believe that human beings were created in two sexes because there<br/>are benefits to children from both a mother and a father. Otherwise, why<br/>have two sexes at all, anthropologically?]<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Answer:<br/>https://www.quora.com/Why-are-gay-people-asking-for-the-right-to-marry-If-it-is-legal-stuff-they-are-asking-for-cant-they-go-to-some-separate-setup-for-partners/answer/Bill-Stein<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content language: English<br/><br/><br/>
