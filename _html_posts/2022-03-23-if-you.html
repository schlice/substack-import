<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Well, I don't use *religion* to talk to them, since they dismiss it out<br>of hand. I have to use reason and logic. The atheist thinks that I can't<br>use reason and logic, because they think it's a "reason vs religion"<br>thing, but they are quite mistaken. Religion happens specifically<br>*because of* good logic and good reason, not in spite of it. But that's<br>a discussion for another day. And that's not the question which was<br>asked.<br><br>You asked what you say to an atheist who tells you that God doesn't<br>exist. Remember, "atheist" means "no god." So a true atheist believes<br>that God doesn't exist at all. To them I say, "How do you know? How do<br>you absolutely know that God doesn't exist?"<br><br>The truth is, it's impossible to know that God does not exist. As<br>philosopher and legal scholar Mortimer Adler put it, "An affirmative<br>existential proposition can be proved. But a negative existential<br>proposition---one that denies the existence of something---cannot be<br>proved." For example, I could tell you that purple squids exist, and you<br>could tell me that purple squids do not exist. I only need to show you<br>one example of a purple squid to prove my assertion. But you need to<br>examine all squids that have ever existed, across all time, to prove<br>that purple squids do not exist, and have never existed. It's<br>impossible. This is why *intellectually honest* atheists will admit that<br>they cannot prove that God does not exist. At best, an atheist could<br>say that it's unlikely that God exists, since the theist says that it's<br>likely beyond a reasonable doubt that God does exist.<br><br>From there, we can talk about the reasons why we believe that God<br>exists, and why it's more rational to believe that God does exist than<br>that he doesn't. And for a committed atheist, that's a very long and<br>detailed discussion.<br><br>Finally, we would need to discuss the seriousness of the truth claims<br>that atheists make, and the amount of evidence which should be required<br>to make such serious claims. For example, I could sit two glasses of<br>lemonade in front of you and tell you to choose one, but one of them is<br>more tart than the other. You probably wouldn't need to have too much<br>evidence to make a choice, since the consequences of drinking a more<br>tart glass of lemonade aren't all that serious. But if instead, I told<br>you that one was sweetened with sugar and the other was sweetened with<br>rat poison, you'd need weighty and incontrovertible evidence before you<br>made a choice.<br><br>This is where the atheists sit when they claim that God does not exist<br>and there are no eternal consequences for our actions in this life. In<br>order to make such a claim, which could have serious and eternal<br>consequences, they should be required to produce voluminous and<br>overwhelming evidence which proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that God<br>does not exist, and they cannot. **Atheism simply cannot meet the test<br>for evidence to support the seriousness of the charge that it makes.**<br>Instead the atheist, and those who they convince of their position,<br>slide into eternity with their fingers crossed, and hope that they don't<br>find the unpleasant truth that eternity does exist, and that such a<br>place is an awfully long time to be wrong. Quoting Mortimer Adler once<br>more: "**More consequences for life and action follow from the<br>affirmation or denial of God than from any other basic question.**"<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>If you\'re a Christian, how do you respond to atheists telling you God<br>doesn\'t exist?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
