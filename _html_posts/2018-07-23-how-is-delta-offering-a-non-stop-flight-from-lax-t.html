<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**How is Delta offering a non-stop flight from LAX to Tokyo NRT in a<br>Boeing 737?**<br><br>Answer: it doesn't. Delta does not flay a LAX to NRT route, and does not<br>use the 737.<br><br>However, a 737 is capable of flying a LAX-NRT route.<br><br>There is a great video you should watch so that you can understand why<br>this is now possible. It's about 9 minutes long.<br><br>[https://youtu.be/HSxSgbNQi-g(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=24b6fc&url=https://youtu.be/HSxSgbNQi-g){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>It has to do with changes to flight regulations which previously stated<br>that two-engine planes could only fly no more than 60 minutes away from<br>any airport.<br><br>However, as time went on and engines became increasingly more reliable,<br>these rules were severely outdated.<br><br>In 1985, ETOPS (Extended-range Twin engine Operational Performance<br>Standards, or more colloquially, Engines Turn Or Passengers Swim) rules<br>were put in place (begrudgingly) for TWA (Trans World Airlines) to fly<br>their twin-engine 767 between Boston and Paris. ETOPS certifications for<br>aircraft mean that they are built with appropriate redundancies, fire<br>suppression and communications systems to fly safely if one engine<br>fails. The 767 previously mentioned has an ETOPS type rating of 180<br>minutes, which means it can fly anywhere as long as it is within 180<br>minutes of a diversion airfield. An ETOPS 180 rating means that 95% of<br>the world's surface becomes available for aircraft to fly over.<br><br>The granting of ETOPS type ratings allowed carriers to start serving the<br>"long and thin" routes that are inefficient to fly with larger aircraft.<br><br>The LAX-NRT route is, indeed, one of these "long and thin" routes. If<br>you check the [[Great Circle<br>Mapper](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=fa006c&url=http://www.gcmap.com/mapui?P%3Dlax-nrt%26MS%3Dwls%26DU%3Dmi%26EV%3D397%26EU%3Dkts){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="gcmap.com"}]{.qlink_container} for the LAX-NRT route, you<br>see that it is well within the ETOPS 180 and over-water rating for which<br>the aircraft has been certified.<br><br>The Boeing 737--700ER (Extended Range), with its up to 9 auxilliary fuel<br>tanks, can fly up to 5,510nm. Again according to GCMap, the LAX-NRT<br>ideal route is 4,736 nm (5,451 mi), something the 737--700ER can handle<br>easily.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
