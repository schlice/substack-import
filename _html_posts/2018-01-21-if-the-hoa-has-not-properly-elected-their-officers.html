<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If the HOA has not properly elected their officers, can we get rid of<br>it since nothing has been properly registered since it\'s release from<br>the developer? It is only 7 homes & 1 nut.**<br><br>As<br>[User-12319322104263110727(https://www.quora.com/profile/User-12319322104263110727)]{.qlink_container}<br>said, the Board that is in place is likely the Board that was installed<br>by the developer when the HOA was turned over to the homeowners. From<br>here on out, the HOA must follow the Director election process as laid<br>out in the Governing Documents. An election is not necessary at initial<br>stand-up of the HOA; generally, the developer installs a Board of<br>Directors which will serve until the first mandated election.<br><br>Additionally, you cannot "get rid" of an HOA. HOAs are legal entities<br>registered with the City. If you no longer want your HOA, you will need<br>to dissolve it, which is a legal process. You generally need 3/4 of<br>the homeowners to vote to dissolve the HOA. If your HOA only consists of<br>seven homes, you'll likely need at least 5 of the homeowners to agree to<br>dissolve the HOA. Laws may be different in your city, or your governing<br>documents may call for something more than the law requires as a<br>minimum; check your Governing Documents to determine what would be<br>needed for dissolution. You then need to determine what to do with any<br>community property which was owned by the HOA. You can sell it to a<br>private owner, or you can donate it to a charity. In either case, you<br>need the services of a real estate attorney who specializes in HOAs to<br>assist you with the transition. You (homeowners) will need to pay for<br>that attorney yourselves, and he ain't cheap. You'll also need to<br>re-file with the City to show that an HOA is no longer in place, and<br>that's not free either.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
