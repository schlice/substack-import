<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Why I\'m I going to hell if I don\'t worship Jesus Christ?<br><br>The answer is a little more nuanced than "if you don't worship Jesus,<br>you're going to hell." It requires some definitions, particularly a<br>definition of the word "worship" as well as the word "hell."<br><br>Christians generally define a point on the spectrum of belief in order<br>to say that a person has achieved salvation. The most often quoted<br>biblical reference is John 3:16, but there are many others:<br><br>> *For God so loved the world that He gave his one and only Son, so that<br>> whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.*<br><br>This, among others, establishes that "point" which Christians believe is<br>the point between salvation and "not salvation:" belief that Jesus<br>Christ is the son of God and that he died on the cross to forgive our<br>sins. The Bible is very clear on this point. A little later on in John<br>(14:2--6), Jesus says the following:<br><br>> *"My Father's house has many rooms; if that were not so, would I have<br>> told you that I am going there to prepare a place for you? And if I go<br>> and prepare a place for you, I will come back and take you to be with<br>> me that you also may be where I am. You know the way to the place<br>> where I am going."*<br>><br>> *Thomas said to him, "Lord, we don't know where you are going, so how<br>> can we know the way?"*<br>><br>> *Jesus answered, "I am the way and the truth and the life. No one<br>> comes to the Father except through me."*<br><br>It's clear that Jesus says that the way to salvation is through Him;<br>more specifically, belief in Him.<br><br>Therefore, "worship" means "believing that Jesus Christ is your personal<br>Savior who died on the cross to atone for your sins."<br><br>Christianity is the only major religion which believes that it is grace<br>alone which saves you; good works are incidental to the grace received.<br>You cannot save yourself. There is nothing you can "do" which will<br>*earn* you a place in God's eternal kingdom. As Christians, we know that<br>we are sinners and "fall short of the glory of God" (Romans 3:23). It is<br>*only* through the grace of God that you are saved, and that salvation<br>comes specifically from believing that Jesus Christ died on the cross to<br>pay for your sin. When you believe that the blood of Christ has washed<br>you clean, when you believe that Christ died to make all things right<br>between you and God, it is then that you have your salvation.<br><br>The definition of "hell," in most contexts, is not a fiery pit of<br>damnation which smells of fire and brimstone, but an eternal separation<br>from the love of God; an eternal rejection of the gift that Jesus so<br>freely offered you. He wants nothing in return for this gift. He has<br>given you the gift of salvation; all you need to do is *accept* that<br>gift.<br><br>In actuality, it's slightly more involved than that, but basically,<br>that's it.<br><br>\<br><br>*For the time being, I have re-enabled comments on selected answers.<br>Some people like to comment. Some people like to engage with me in a<br>civil manner, and I did kinda miss that\...a little. But do not<br>misunderstand, I take this step very cautiously, and I have no tolerance<br>for harassing or inane behavior. If you don\'t like what I wrote, tough<br>shit. If my answer is grammatically low-quality or is un-cited opinion<br>masquerading as fact, downvote it. If you think I\'m wrong, write your<br>own answer. But Quora is a question-and-answer site, not a debate site.<br>If you are simply commenting to tell me \"ackshually, you\'re wrong,\"<br>don\'t be surprised if I quietly delete your comment. Put anything<br>vaguely harassing in there, and your deletion will be followed by a<br>block/mute, and a BNBR report. I will do this immediately and with no<br>compunction. You have been warned. Be nice.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
