<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Will Trump now support abortion since he was cured by a cocktail of<br>antibodies developed from the cells of aborted fetuses?**<br><br>No.<br><br>And the statement "he was cured by a cocktail of antibodies developed<br>from the cells of aborted fetuses" is only slightly inaccurate.<br><br>So that you don't think the technical explanation is something I made<br>up, I'll quote it directly from MIT Technology Review:<br><br>> Last Friday, as Trump developed worrisome symptoms of covid-19, the<br>> president received[ [an emergency cocktail of anti-coronavirus<br>> antibodies](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=e1b692&url=https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/10/02/1009278/what-drug-treatments-will-president-trump-get/){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="technologyreview.com"}]{.qlink_container} made by<br>> Regeneron. These molecules are manufactured in cells from a hamster's<br>> ovary, so-called "CHO" cells, according to the company---not in human<br>> cells.<br>><br>> But cells originally derived from a fetus were used in another way.<br>> According to Regeneron, laboratory tests used to assess the potency of<br>> its antibodies employed a standardized supply of cells called HEK<br>> 293T, whose origin was kidney tissue from an abortion in the<br>> Netherlands in the 1970s.<br>><br>> Since then, the 293T cells have been "immortalized," meaning they keep<br>> dividing in the lab, somewhat like a cancer, and have undergone other<br>> genetic changes and additions.<br>><br>> According to Regeneron, it and many other labs employ 293T cells to<br>> manufacture virus "pseudoparticles," which are virus-like structures<br>> that contain the "spike" protein of the deadly coronavirus. It needs<br>> those to test how well different antibodies will neutralize the<br>> virus.\[1\](#yNOLE){#cite-yNOLE .citation_link}<br><br>The Trump administration has sought to block funding of research which<br>uses newly-acquired tissue from *recently-performed abortions*, not<br>old tissue from abortions decades ago. The goal in blocking such<br>research is to prevent the creation of a fetus-acquisition supply chain<br>in which women get pregnant and abort their babies in order to earn<br>money when selling the aborted fetal tissue to laboratories who use the<br>tissue in medical research.<br><br>Because these materials were harvested so long ago, the medical<br>community claims that the tissues used to test Trump's treatments have<br>been reproducing in the lab for so many decades, that they transcend the<br>abortion debate and are no longer thought of as part of abortion<br>politics.<br><br>The discussion is a lot more nuanced than a simple "abortion helped<br>Trump, Trump loves abortion." That's way too ham-handed of an analysis<br>to be even remotely workable. The truth is far more nuanced than that.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-yNOLE){.citation_index} [[Trump's antibody treatment was<br>tested using cells originally derived from an<br>abortion](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=892b37&url=https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/10/07/1009664/trumps-antibody-treatment-was-tested-using-cells-from-an-abortion/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="technologyreview.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
