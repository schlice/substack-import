<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Short answer: yes.<br><br>Longer answer: It only really matters on smaller aircraft. I\'ve spent<br>many late nights flying the short hop from Denver to Colorado Springs.<br>The crews on those aircraft (usually Canadair regional jets) will<br>redistribute passengers throughout the cabin for weight and balance<br>purposes. I\'ve often been seated near the front of the plane and have<br>voluntarily moved to the last row for weight and balance requirements.<br>It\'s kinda fun back there. Plus the flight is only about 20 minutes; I<br>can stand on my head and spit nickels for 20 minutes. I don\'t mind<br>moving.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
