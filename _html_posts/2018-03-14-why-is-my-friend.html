<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Why is my friend's Galaxy S5 Prime periodically turning off and not<br>turning back on for a while?**<br><br>There are several things which can cause this behavior, but it's most<br>likely hardware-related.<br><br>When a phone turns off because of something software-related, the<br>software gets reset when it turns off, so it should turn back on<br>immediately.<br><br>If the phone will not turn back on for a while, the problem is most<br>likely hardware-related, and in this case, is probably related to heat.<br><br>If a phone gets too hot, circuitry inside the phone will power it off to<br>prevent it from overheating to the point where the heat will damage the<br>phone. Depending on cases and other accessories, you may not even know<br>exactly how hot the phone is getting. Once the phone sufficiently cools<br>down, it allows the power to turn back on again.<br><br>Your friend should try taking the phone out of its case for a while and<br>see if that helps. At the very least, he'll know pretty quick if it's<br>overheating.<br><br>He could try to reset the phone back to factory condition.<br>Malfunctioning software could be causing the phone to run too hot. A<br>full factory reset will clear that up.<br><br>If that doesn't work, he should take the phone in for service. There may<br>be lint or dust blocking the heat pipes which move the heat away from<br>the processor and to the body of the phone. A good phone repair place<br>can clean out that gunk and have the phone running cooler.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
