<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [You would have to show harm was done. You would have to<br>show that there wasn\'t another pharmacy within 60 miles that takes your<br>insurance. Basically, the only way the pharmacist could be compelled to<br>sell you the pills is if he was the only game in town, so to speak. At<br>that point, if he wanted to exercise his freedoms, he would have to<br>relocate his practice somewhere where the consumer had choice in which<br>pharmacist they used.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
