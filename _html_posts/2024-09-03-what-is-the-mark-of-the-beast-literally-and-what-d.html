title: '"What is the mark of the beast literally and what does it consist of? If you
  was to report an incident to the police, what would you call and say? The mark of
  the beast did it? They would probably lock me up in a mental ward if we said that."'

<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>A lot of information here, and some of it is good. What is "good" is not<br>what I think is good. What is "good" is what is *Biblical*.<br><br>The "mark of the beast" is specifically a mark, either on the forehead<br>or on the hand, which will indicate fealty to the Antichrist. This mark<br>acts as a seal for the followers of the Antichrist and the false prophet<br>(the spokesman for the Antichrist). It will be the false prophet who<br>causes people to take the mark, which will actually be a **literal<br>mark** on the forehead or the hand. It won't be just an ID card or<br>something internal. It will be something visible.<br><br>Some have talked about medical implants, vaccines, and RFID chips as the<br>"mark of the beast." The biblical answer is that these *could be* the<br>beginnings of what will eventually be the mark of the beast, but they<br>themselves are not the mark. The mark of the beast will be an end-times<br>identification required by the Antichrist in order to buy or sell, and<br>it will be given only to those who worship the Antichrist.<br><br>Lots of Revelation scholars have weighed in on what exactly the mark<br>will be. Some have said it's an ID card, some have said it will be a<br>mark or a barcode tattooed on the skin, or others have said that it is<br>simply a mark which shows loyalty to the Antichrist (which is exactly<br>what the Bible tells us). All of these things are indeed possible, but<br>right now we simply don't know.<br><br>It's also not accurate to think of Revelation as simply symbolic. This<br>is the "allegorical" method of interpreting the Bible, claiming that the<br>Bible must be separated into the "literal," the "allegorical," "the<br>moral," and the "eschatological."<br><br>But the majority of Christians believe in the "literal grammatical"<br>method of interpreting the Bible. This doesn't mean that we don't<br>recognize symbolism, but it does mean that when symbolism exists, the<br>text will say so. For example, if a Bible writer said "The sky is blue,"<br>we should believe that the Bible writer meant exactly what he said. But<br>if he says something like "listen to this parable" or "he was roaring<br>*like* a lion," then there is a good chance that the text was meant to<br>be figurative or representative.<br><br>Why? We already know that the book of Revelation is prophesy. But<br>even prophesy is told from the perspective of the person receiving the<br>prophesy. To that end, because John describes this book *as* prophecy,<br>the reader does not have to hypothesize, theorize, allegorize, or<br>spiritualize the meaning of the events laid out in the Book of<br>Revelation. We should expect the interpretation of the book be laid out<br>in order for us by the author who gave us the prophecy, so that we may<br>understand and be blessed by it (cf Revelation 1:3). Also, there were<br>*specific numbers* given in Revelation. How are we to hypothesize or<br>allegorize those specific numbers? We don't. We take them as they are<br>written.<br><br>So back to the mark of the beast. Because the book of Revelation is<br>clear that the mark will be a physical mark on the forehead or the hand,<br>we believe that it will be something visible, on the forehead, or on the<br>hand. An ID card or a barcode or an RFID chip may be part of it, but we<br>don't know that yet. We do know that it will only be given to those who<br>show loyalty to the Antichrist.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
