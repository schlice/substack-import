<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Despite what you may have heard, there is no \"big red button\" in the<br>Presiden\'ts office that launches missiles. And there\'s nothing at all<br>\"easy\" about launching nuclear missiles. While it\'s entirely possible<br>that a President could unilaterally make the decision to launch a<br>nuclear missile, that decision would not go unnoticed by anyone, and I<br>think that lots of people in the military chain of command would<br>question the order to launch, especially the order to launch nuclear<br>missiles. Remember, we prosecuted Nazi officers who were \"just<br>following orders.\" No one person is authorized to violate the Geneva<br>Convention. A viable threat must exist first, and there are several<br>people in that chain between the President and the missiliers in the<br>bunker turning their keys.<br><br>While the President does have the authority to launch missiles, it is<br>not unilateral. He still has to receive intelligence that indicates a<br>nuclear launch would be appropriate. He has to confer with the JCS<br>(Joint Chiefs of Staff) and review the intelligence provided. The<br>President, though, makes the final decision. If he decides to launch<br>missiles, he must use nuclear \"launch codes\" which are carried in a<br>locked briefcase by a military attach√© attached to the White House<br>staff. The briefcase containing the launch codes is colloquially known<br>as \"the football.\" Once the targets are confirmed, the President<br>verbally authorizes launch after providing the correct launch codes.<br><br>The second set of "codes" is held by the Secretary of Defense. This is<br>part of the "two-man rule" in place protecting unilateral launch of any<br>one, or all, missiles. Both the President and the SecDef must agree to<br>launch missiles, or they don't leave the silos.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
