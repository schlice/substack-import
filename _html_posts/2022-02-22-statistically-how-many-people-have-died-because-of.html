<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>This is not a valid statistic that can be known.<br><br>There are several things that would need to be true before you could<br>know what you are asking:<br><br>- SImply being unvaccinated, or not wearing a mask, would have to be a<br>  guaranteed cause of death, and it is not.<br>- Being vaccinated or wearing a mask would have to be a guaranteed<br>  prevention of transmission of COVID, and it is not.<br><br>Therefore, you can never know how many people have died because of<br>people refusing vaccination or masking, because vaccination and masking<br>do not prevent transmission of the disease, nor do they prevent death,<br>in themselves or others.<br><br>And before the comments start coming in, *slowing down* the rate of<br>transmission does not equal *preventing* transmission. *Reducing* the<br>likelihood of being hospitalized with severe illness does not equal<br>*preventing* death.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Statistically, how many people have died because of people refusing<br>vaccination or masking? Themselves or others?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
