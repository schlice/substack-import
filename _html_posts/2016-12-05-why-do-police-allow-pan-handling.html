<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>What "police" allow is up to their supervisors and chiefs of police and<br>mayors.<br><br>The other undeniable fact: *policing is political*. Just look at the<br>decrease in assertive policing in New York City since the uptick in<br>resistance by groups like Black Lives Matter. Once a powerful political<br>bloc has denied the legitimacy of a specific policing technique, you<br>will see less of it. This is understandable, and if we're honest, is how<br>things should work.<br><br>Depending on the current political climate then, you will either see<br>more or less disruption of panhandlers by police. If the current<br>political climate was like the climate in NYC in 2012, they were<br>"cleaning up Times Square" and rousting the panhandlers and prostitutes,<br>cracking down on unwanted windshield cleaning, D&Ds, etc. (This, by the<br>way, goes back to "broken windows theory" of policing adopted by<br>Commissioner William Bratton, which led to "Compstat," the most<br>successful government program ever).<br><br>Since the mood has somewhat shifted, everyone from the Mayor on down has<br>softened on assertive policing (as is happening nationwide). As a<br>result, we are seeing now the first sustained spike in violent crime in<br>over two decades.<br><br>Eventually, people will get tired of seeing the increased crime and will<br>demand more loudly than the protesters, and things will swing back the<br>other way again.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
