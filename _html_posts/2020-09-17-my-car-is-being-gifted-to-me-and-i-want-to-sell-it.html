<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**My car is being gifted to me, and I want to sell it after it's gifted.<br>How do I go about that? I don't want to put insurance on it because it<br>will be sitting until sold.**<br><br>Once you have the title, the car is yours to do with as you please. You<br>can turn right around and sell it. I suggest you get a "gift letter"<br>together and both sign it so that you can prove it was a gift.<br><br>When you sell it, follow your state's rules for private auto sales. You<br>usually need some form of a bill of sale and you need to sign the title<br>over to the new buyer. Since you aren't driving it, chances are you<br>won't have plates on it either, so nothing to worry about there.<br><br>Do check with your county or your state to ensure you accomplish all the<br>correct paperwork.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
