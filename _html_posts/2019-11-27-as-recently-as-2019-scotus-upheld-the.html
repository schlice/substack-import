<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**As recently as 2019, SCOTUS upheld the "separate sovereigns" doctrine.<br>Is there any legal reason why a separate sovereign (AKA one of the<br>States) couldn\'t indict a sitting US President if s/he broke the law in<br>that state?**<br><br>The answer to all legal questions is "it depends."<br><br>In this case, a state has never tried it, so we simply don't know if a<br>state could indict a sitting president. It would also be far too easy<br>for the President to claim that acquiescing to such a demand would be<br>far too disruptive to the functioning of the government to entertain.<br>And as a practical matter, a state would have a really tough time<br>enforcing such an indictment against the President.<br><br>Additionally, a state which disagrees with the President could be<br>accused of trying to use state prosecutorial authority to disrupt the<br>President's Constitutional authority as granted by the voters.<br><br>The state would have a much better chance of getting the President to<br>comply after he has left office. The state issuing the indictment would<br>have to work closely with the state wherein the ex-President now resides<br>in order to compel extradition to face those charges.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
