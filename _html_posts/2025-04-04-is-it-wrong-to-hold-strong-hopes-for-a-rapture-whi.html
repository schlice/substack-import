<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Whether or not people are lost will not alter God's plan.<br><br>Christ indeed has said that He is coming back. Revelation explains<br>what's going to happen once it happens. We have no reason to doubt what<br>the text says.<br><br>Evangelism appears to be a lost art in the Christian churches, mostly<br>because they haven't been taught. They have a commandment to bring the<br>Gospel to the nations, but they don't know how. So I feel like that's a<br>different conversation. Regardless, we aren't going to change the<br>message because the messenger isn't trained.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
