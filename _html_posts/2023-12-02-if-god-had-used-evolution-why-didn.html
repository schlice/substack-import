<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Because God didn't use evolution.<br><br>Defining "evolution" is perhaps the greatest point of confusion in the<br>creation-evolution controversy. This is where Darwinian errors and false<br>claims begin to multiply if not checked by those who believe observation<br>is important to science.<br><br>Consider what happens to bacteria attacked by antibiotics. When bacteria<br>survive a bout with antibiotics and multiply, that surviving group of<br>bacteria may be resistant to that antibiotic. The surviving bacteria are<br>resistant to that antibiotic because the parent bacteria possessed the<br>genetic capacity to resist, or a rare biochemical mutation somehow<br>helped it survive (we say "rare" because mutations are nearly always<br>harmful). Since the sensitive bacteria die, the surviving bacteria<br>multiply and now dominate.<br><br>Darwinists say that the surviving bacteria have evolved. Having adapted<br>to the environment, the surviving bacteria provide us with an example of<br>evolution. Fair enough, but what kind of evolution? The answer we're<br>about to give is absolutely critical.<br><br>Here's what observation tells us: ***the surviving bacteria always stay<br>bacteria***. They do not evolve into another type of organism. That<br>would be macroevolution. Natural selection has never been observed to<br>create new types.<br><br>But macroevolution is exactly what Darwinists claim from the data. They<br>say that these *observable* micro changes can be extrapolated to prove<br>that *unobservable* macroevolution has occurred. They make no<br>distinction between microevolution and macroevolution, and thus use the<br>evidence for micro to prove macro. By failing to make this critical<br>distinction, Darwinists can dupe the general public into thinking that<br>any observable change in any organism proves that all life has evolved<br>from the first one-celled creature.<br><br>This is why it is essential that the right distinctions be made and that<br>all hidden assumptions be exposed when discussing the creation-evolution<br>controversy. So if someone ever asks you, "Do you believe in evolution?"<br>you should ask that person, "What do you mean by evolution? Do you mean<br>micro- or macroevolution?" Microevolution has been observed; but it<br>cannot be used as evidence for macroevolution, which has never been<br>observed.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
