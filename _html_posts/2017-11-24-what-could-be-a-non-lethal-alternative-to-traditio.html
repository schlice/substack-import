<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>What could be a non-lethal alternative to traditional guns?<br><br>*Phasers.*<br><br>Yep, the Star Trek ones: handheld nuclear reactors producing instantly<br>disabling beams of light, targeted at one person, and instantly<br>"stunning" them, regardless of their size, physical composition, or<br>amount of clothing worn.<br><br>Oh, did you want something that exists *today?*<br><br>Then the answer is *nothing*.<br><br>Guns are lethal weapons. Therefore, non-lethal alternatives to<br>traditional guns are *anything which is not a gun.*<br><br>But if you need lethal force, are you going to reach for a "non-lethal<br>alternative?" That would not make much sense, would it? The old line,<br>which was originally from the 1987 movie *The Untouchables,* says,<br>"Isn\'t that just like a wop? Brings a knife to a gun fight."<br><br>In other words, you use the right tool for the job.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
