<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If a suspect pulls a gun on an officer why does the officer fire<br>lethal shots and many?**<br><br>Officers do not fire "lethal" shots as opposed to firing a shot which<br>would be "non-lethal." Even a shot to a leg could hit the femoral artery<br>and the suspect would be dead within minutes from exsanguination<br>(bleeding out). An implement of deadly force, by definition, cannot fire<br>"non-lethal" shots. All shots from a firearm are potentially lethal. It<br>is possible that you can be hit by a firearm and live. It happens all<br>the time. Even the dreaded "head shot" can be survived. One of our local<br>police officers was shot in the head and survived. He's still<br>recovering, but he's alive. Additionally, killing is not the goal. If it<br>was, then an officer would be in trouble for not doing his job if the<br>suspect survived, and that has never happened. Therefore, officers are<br>not shooting to kill.<br><br>Officers instead shoot to stop a threat, and they are trained to<br>continue shooting until the threat is stopped.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
