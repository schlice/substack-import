<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Is there a smartwatch that functions independently as a cell phone?<br><br>Yes, there are many smartwatches which function independently of a<br>mobile phone. When you're shopping for a smartwatch, look for keywords<br>like "4G" or "LTE" or "SIM card" support. These indicate models of<br>smartwatch which support standalone cellular operation, separate from<br>other connectivity methods such as Bluetooth or Wi-Fi. This is an<br>example of a [[Samsung Gear<br>S3](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=d8c1de&url=https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Gear-Frontier-Smartwatch-SM-R765A){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="amazon.com"}]{.qlink_container} smartwatch which supports<br>4G, which means it has a cellular radio.<br><br>**Could this be used without a monthly cell phone bill payment solely<br>for the purpose of calling 911 in case of emergencies?**<br><br>The smartwatch can physically be used in lieu of a smartphone. There are<br>a few caveats, however.<br><br>- The Carrier. The trick is getting a cellular carrier to give you a<br>  "smartwatch-only" plan. Usually, smartwatch support is an "add-on" to<br>  an existing cellular contract, so getting a smartwatch-only plan may<br>  take some doing. You will likely have to shop around to find this.<br>- The Battery. On a good day, the battery on a smartwatch will last<br>  you the whole day before it needs to be recharged. With smart battery<br>  management, it will last you a day and a half. But that's all *without<br>  cellular support*. Add in a cellular radio and your battery life drops<br>  dramatically. You may not even make it through the day with the<br>  cellular radio on all the time, and without a connected smartphone,<br>  the smartwatch with no radios on is just a watch.<br>- The Sound Quality. The smartwatch would be good for a quick call<br>  or an emergency call, but using it as your primary phone may not be<br>  wonderful, as sound quality on both ends may not be stellar.<br><br>I also don't think any carriers have "prepaid" smartwatch plans which<br>only have minutes you buy and use when you need them (as in the case of<br>emergencies). I'm reasonably sure most carriers only support "postpaid"<br>plans for smartwatches and other accessories.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
