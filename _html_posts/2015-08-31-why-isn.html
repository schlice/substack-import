<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Seatbelts became mandatory for all occupants in the front<br>of a car after a very expensive, targeted grassroots campaign entitled<br>\"Seatbelts save lives.\" Legislators, not wanting to miss the boat,<br>passed laws that state that seatbelts must be worn by all occupants in<br>the front row of a car. Back seat seatbelt requirement differ by state.<br>Most at least require children to wear them.\<br>\<br>In general, laws that protect you from you are bad laws. The purpose<br>of laws in a civil society are to protect you from me, and vice versa.<br>Seatbelt laws protect you from you. In general, these are silly laws. We<br>all know that you\'re safer if you wear your seatbelt than if you<br>don\'t. But a law to make you safer? That\'s a *nanny state* law.\<br>\<br>The one exception is children. We all know that parents don\'t always do<br>what\'s best for their kids. Laws that require all children under 18<br>wear seatbelts at all times in all seating positions are fine. The other<br>exception might be the driver. Forcing the driver to wear a seatbelt<br>might keep the driver in his seat longer, and thus keep him in control<br>of the vehicle longer, in the event of a crash. However, these instances<br>where a seatbelt might keep a driver in his seat and in control during a<br>crashare dubious at best.\<br>\<br>There is no concerted effort to mandate anything for motorcycle riders.<br>In fact, states are split on helmet usage; not all states require riders<br>to wear helmets. Again, helmet laws protect you from you, and so in<br>general, are bad law.\<br>\<br>In all actuality, helmets are useful. They keep the head intact for<br>easier victim identification. As macabre is it may seem, anyone with<br>half a brain knows that a high speed motorcycle accident will almost<br>certainly result in death for the rider.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
