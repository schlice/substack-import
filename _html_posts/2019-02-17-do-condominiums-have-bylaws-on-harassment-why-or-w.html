<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Do condominiums have bylaws on harassment? why or why not?<br><br>Because bylaws and rules generally must follow a purpose, and that<br>purpose is generally twofold:<br><br>- Set the conditions so that one person's actions doesn't negatively<br>  impact the property value of someone else<br>- Set up rules for use and maintenance of common property.<br><br>Bylaws and rules are generally not re-writes of state or Federal law.<br><br>Harassment is a blanket term which involves both criminal and civil<br>activities. Some states define a criminal harassment law, but most<br>states have civil harassment penalties. Harassment is not something<br>which needs to be addressed in order to meet the property value or<br>common property goals for which bylaws or rules and regulations are<br>written.<br><br>**TL;DR: Harassment is not within the scope of a Condo Association or<br>HOA to address; it is for lawyers (or the police) to address. If you<br>suspect harassment, get a lawyer. If your state has a criminal<br>harassment law, call the police.**<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
