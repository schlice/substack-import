<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The problem we're having is one of *perspective.* Basically, we're<br>discussing things that police "unlawfully" do at the scene, but we're<br>using the wrong perspective. The reason is that *we cannot determine the<br>lawfulness of an action at the scene*.<br><br>**While a cop is performing his duty, everything he says is a lawful<br>order until a court proves that it is not.** Only a court can determine<br>whether or not a police officer's actions are lawful. You can't. I<br>can't. Even a lawyer at the scene can't. So up to that point, you have<br>no choice but to presume that the officer is acting lawfully. Why must<br>you do this? Because presuming anything else may lead you to actively<br>resist complying with the officer's directives. Resisting a police<br>officer because you believe what they are doing is unlawful will only<br>get you more "attention" from the police (or worse) because you're<br>resisting. At the scene, the officer is in charge. Let them do what they<br>do. Then talk to your lawyer and let the system figure out if what the<br>police did was actually lawful or not.<br><br>They can confiscate your phone, but they can't force you to unlock it.<br>You'll get it back eventually. You've seen how difficult it is for the<br>police to get into a locked phone. They need a warrant, which means they<br>need real evidence to show that there is evidence of a crime on that<br>phone. This does not happen to "innocent" people.<br><br>They can confiscate your camera, but did they "unlawfully confiscate<br>your camera?" We don't know. It's up to a court to decide, not you.<br><br>They can arrest you, and then the court gets to determine whether or not<br>that arrest was unlawful. Police don't "unlawfully arrest the innocent."<br>Police make an arrest based on the best evidence they have at the time,<br>and the court makes a determination whether or not that arrest was<br>lawful.<br><br>Perspective.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
