<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The article is absolute bunk. It's not even worth the server space that<br>it is hosted on.<br><br>Seriously, I want an example of just one person who isn't able to vote<br>because "they don't have an ID." Do they get food stamps? Medicaid? Do<br>they get any government program at all? Because every one of them<br>requires an ID. Do they get prescription drugs from a doctor? Needs an<br>ID. Do they have a bank account? A credit card? They all require some<br>form of positive identification, and if you have that, you can get a<br>government-issued ID card, and demonstrably poor people can qualify for<br>low-cost or no-cost ID cards (depending on the state).<br><br>There is an extremely small number of people who don't have some form of<br>government-issued ID card (or can't get one), and this issue primarily<br>affects the elderly, not the poor. Basically, the argument is that<br>some people simply have never had, and can't produce, the background<br>documents needed in order to get an ID card from the state. They don't<br>have a birth certificate, they don't have a credit card, etc. And even<br>in these cases, there are procedures for people who can't get the<br>documents themselves. Do they have children? Do those children have<br>birth certificates? Do those birth certificates list *parents*? In many<br>states, having your children present their birth certificates which<br>indicate the parents (and signing an affidavit) is sufficient to get a<br>government issued ID card. There are most definitely ways around the<br>problem. I think the actual number of people who cannot, under any<br>circumstances, get a government issued ID card (and who don't utilize<br>any government services which require one) is very small.<br><br>The only reason one would want to deny requiring voter ID (as is<br>required in virtually all of the civilized world today) is to allow for,<br>and encourage, voter fraud.
