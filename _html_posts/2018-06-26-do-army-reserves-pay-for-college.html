<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>In addition to the great GI Bill options you're hearing about here, if<br>you are not yet in the military, you might be able to get into Army ROTC<br>in your college (if they offer it) and there are scholarships available<br>if you go that route. Once you complete college, you'll be commissioned<br>as a 2LT in the Army Reserves.<br><br>So it's the same thing, just in reverse (college first, then the Army<br>Reserves).<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
