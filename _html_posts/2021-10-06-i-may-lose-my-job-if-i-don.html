<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The vaccine is the right choice for most people, and if you are able,<br>I'd encourage you to get it.<br><br>But it's not the necessary choice for everyone.<br><br>For example, if you've already had COVID-19 and recovered, you already<br>have antibodies against the virus. You don't need more. The government<br>says it's a good idea, and maybe it is. You know, like wearing your seat<br>belt *and* wearing Kevlar while you drive, but the truth is that it's<br>not necessary.<br><br>So what you do is entirely dependent on whether or not you want to keep<br>your job, and whether or not you have the funds to fight a legal battle<br>against unlawful termination.<br><br>No one here can advise you what is right for you. You are free to not<br>take the vaccine, this is your choice. Don't listen to the fearmongers<br>trying to scare you into taking the vaccine. They don't really care<br>about you. They care more about protecting themselves against some<br>unquantifiable threat. Their fearmongering is all about them, not you.<br>You are no more of a threat to them than I am, as I, as a vaccinated<br>person, can still get COVID-19 and can still pass it on, and if I can do<br>that, I can also harbor and create a new strain just as easily as you<br>can. So don't listen to their nonsense.<br><br>**That said, you have to be prepared to deal with the consequences of<br>your own choices.** The vaccine will only protect you, not them. Without<br>it, you could contract severe COVID-19, and you could die. While the<br>chances are pretty low, they are there. That risk is on you.<br><br>Good luck!<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
