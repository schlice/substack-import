<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: [Wow, you must work for the IRS. You seem to have a lot<br>invested in our current system of taxes, which is regressive and full of<br>cheaters and loopholes. It\'s estimated that almost 16% of Americans are<br>out of compliance with our current system because they unknowingly did<br>something incorrect when filing taxes.\<br>\<br>You can cheat the FairTax system much less easily than you can cheat the<br>current system. And with fewer taxpayers (businesses only), there\'s<br>lots more eyes on them, so it\'s much easier to ensure compliance.\<br>\<br>I\'m not even going to go into each one of your responses because most<br>of them are just flat-out wrong or have no facts or say silly things<br>like let\'s open up our borders. Gah, it\'s like arguing with a two-year<br>old.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-strongest-arguments-against-illegal-immigration-in-the-United-States/answer/Bill-Stein<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
