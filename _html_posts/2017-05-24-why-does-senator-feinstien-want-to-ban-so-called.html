<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>1.  Today's Democrats support measures which feel good. Today's<br>    Republicans support measures which do good. Any Democrat who is<br>    seen as doing something which "feels" good or "feels" right is going<br>    to get votes. Republicans don't support such measures because they<br>    don't do any good. They don't make people safer. They don't<br>    reduce crime. They don't keep weapons out of the hands of criminals.<br>    They only restrict the rights of law-abiding citizens.<br>2.  There's a great deal of confusion (which they actually caused)<br>    around "assault weapons." They have banned "scary-looking" guns and<br>    their attachments, which have absolutely zero bearing on their<br>    function. Democrats are attempting to sow that confusion, and then<br>    capitalize on it. If they can get people confused enough about what<br>    an assault weapon is, they can gin up enough support to sneak some<br>    bans through.<br><br>So while they can't wholesale ban firearms (which is actually their<br>ultimate goal), they can attempt to chip away at gun rights until there<br>are simply so many regulations that they are functionally banned. This<br>is why the NRA and their Institute for Legislative Action as well as<br>many other grassroots organizations must keep fighting. If they back<br>off, Democrats will be able to get their foot in the door and get<br>nonsense legislation passed, which is the beginning of the end for the<br>right.<br><br>They know they've lost the battle with handguns, so they have switched<br>to assault weapons, attempting to capitalize on that confusion.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
