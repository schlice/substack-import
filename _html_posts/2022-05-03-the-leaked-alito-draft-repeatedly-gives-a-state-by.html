<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>No, because Congress has always had the ability to codify access to<br>abortion. or to codify banning abortion. They just never had the<br>political will to do so.<br><br>The House passed a bill which would codify the right to an abortion on<br>September 21, 2021. It passed 218 to 211. That is a razor thin margin in<br>the House --- just seven votes. Nevertheless, it barely squeaked through<br>the House. But it didn't make it through the Senate, which would have<br>needed 60 votes to overcome a filibuster, and it didn't even have full<br>support of all the Democrats in the Senate. Susan Collins, a Republican<br>who usually votes with the Democrats, couldn't support the bill because,<br>she said, it would weaken the conscience protections in the Religious<br>Freedom Restoration Act.<br><br>Congress could always codify the right to access abortion, or to ban<br>abortion, in federal law, but they don't have the broad consensus they<br>need to do so.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>The leaked Alito draft repeatedly gives a state-by-state based context<br>but then says \"we return it to the people and their representatives\",<br>not states? Is this intentionally ambiguous to allow a future Congress<br>to pass a nationwide abortion ban?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
