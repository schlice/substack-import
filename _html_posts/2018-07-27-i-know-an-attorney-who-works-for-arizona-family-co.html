<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**I know an attorney who works for Arizona Family Court / DCFS. The<br>attorney talks freely about her client's including names and various<br>detailed information. Is this a HIPAA violation?**<br><br>No, HIPAA is a law which protects healthcare information.<br><br>What you're referring to is what is known as **attorney-client<br>privilege**. However, not all conversations between an attorney and a<br>client are covered by attorney-client privilege.<br><br>> \T\he elements necessary to establish the attorney client privilege<br>> generally are:<br>><br>> 1.  The asserted holder of the privilege is (or sought to become) a<br>>     client; and<br>> 2.  The person to whom the communication was made:is a member of the<br>>     bar of a court, or a subordinate of such a member, and in<br>>     connection with this communication, is acting as an attorney; and<br>> 3.  The communication was for the purpose of securing legal advice.<br>><br>> There are a number of exceptions to the privilege in most<br>> jurisdictions, chief among them:<br>><br>> 1.  the communication was made in the presence of individuals who were<br>>     neither attorney nor client, or was disclosed to such individuals,<br>> 2.  the communication was made for the purpose of committing a crime<br>>     or tort,<br>> 3.  the client has waived the privilege (for example by publicly<br>>     disclosing the communication).\[1\](#XMmKg){#cite-XMmKg<br>>     .citation_link}<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-XMmKg){.citation_index} [[Attorney--client privilege -<br>Wikipedia](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=d0db25&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attorney%25E2%2580%2593client_privilege){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
