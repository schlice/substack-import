<br><br><h2>Space Submission</h2><br><div><br><br>Space name: Christians & Christianity<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>An interesting question indeed! I thought God gave me free will, but I<br>can't use it to choose to end my life? What kind of limited free will is<br>this?<br><br>The short answer is because God wants you to exist. But we can<br>understand it a little more deeply than just that. So let's address why<br>choosing to no longer exist is illogical.<br><br>First, suicide is a sin.<br><br>> 1 Corinthians 3:17 (NIV): If anyone destroys God's temple, God will<br>> destroy that person; for God's temple is sacred, and you together are<br>> that temple.<br><br>Our bodies are temples, created by God, for God. Destroying that temple<br>is indeed a sin.<br><br>Second, suicide is selfish.<br><br>*No it's not! It's selfless! I'm a burden to those around me! Their life<br>would be so much better without me around!*<br><br>This is fraudulent thinking. Take a look at Romans 12:<br><br>> Romans 12:1--8 (NIV): Therefore, I urge you, brothers and sisters, in<br>> view of God's mercy, to offer your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy<br>> and pleasing to God---this is your true and proper worship. Do not<br>> conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the<br>> renewing of your mind. Then you will be able to test and approve what<br>> God's will is---his good, pleasing and perfect will.<br>><br>> For by the grace given me I say to every one of you: Do not think of<br>> yourself more highly than you ought, but rather think of yourself with<br>> sober judgment, in accordance with the faith God has distributed to<br>> each of you. For just as each of us has one body with many members,<br>> and these members do not all have the same function, so in Christ we,<br>> though many, form one body, and each member belongs to all the others.<br>> We have different gifts, according to the grace given to each of us.<br>> If your gift is prophesying, then prophesy in accordance with your<br>> faith; if it is serving, then serve; if it is teaching, then teach; if<br>> it is to encourage, then give encouragement; if it is giving, then<br>> give generously; if it is to lead, do it diligently; if it is to show<br>> mercy, do it cheerfully.<br><br>This passage shows us a few things. First, God wants us to offer<br>ourselves as a living sacrifice. Serve others with whatever gifts you<br>have been given. Even if you feel like you haven't really been given any<br>great gifts, you can still serve others, and that's what God wants.<br><br>The other thing to notice here is to not think of yourself "more highly<br>than you ought." This means you shouldn't think of yourself as better<br>than your fellow man, but it also means that if you believe that people<br>are better off without you around, *you are elevating your importance in<br>relation to others around you,* and that is not what God wants.<br>Believing that your death will make everyone better off is no better<br>than believing that your presence will make everyone better. Both<br>are similar examples of flawed thinking.<br><br>God wants you to exist.<br><br>Your very presence on the earth right now is proof that God wants you to<br>be here. God wants us to be a living sacrifice; you can't be a *living*<br>sacrifice if you are no longer living.<br><br>***But you didn't answer the question. Do I have the freedom to choose<br>to die?***<br><br>You're right, I gave a lot of reasoning why you should stay. But does<br>God give us the freedom to choose to die?<br><br>The answer is yes, you are free to choose death. Just as you are<br>free to commit any sin, you are free to commit this sin, too.<br><br>But there is a problem with this particular sin: *once you commit this<br>sin, you can't repent of it.*<br><br>This is a problem, isn't it? As Christians, we know that once we repent<br>of our sin, we are forgiven. But if you're dead, you can't really repent<br>of your sin, and that's a problem.<br><br>It doesn't affect your salvation (which is instantaneous once you repent<br>and believe), but it does mean that you're committing a sin which you<br>have no opportunity to repent of. With every other sin, you have the<br>opportunity to repent and ask for forgiveness *before* you face<br>judgement. But with this sin, you do not.<br><br>So what does that mean? A Christian who commits suicide will still go to<br>heaven, but he will have to account for that sin himself (that sin is<br>not forgiven), and you will face consequences that we don't fully know<br>or understand.<br><br>How does that honor God's grace? We honor God's grace with our worship<br>and living a Christ-centered life, but how does a final defiant act do<br>that? We dishonor God when we make that choice, because we take his<br>grace for granted. We bank on the fact that our salvation is assured,<br>but we can commit sin and allow it to remain unresolved before we face<br>God in our judgement. That's really reckless.<br><br>If we're so confident in God's grace (his grace will see me through this<br>sin), why are we not as confident that God's grace will see us through<br>our suffering *while we're still alive?* Conversely, if we're doubtful<br>that God's grace will see us through our suffering while we're alive,<br>*can we really be confident that God's grace will see us into heaven<br>after we commit a final, unrepented sinful act?* And if we are doubtful<br>of our salvation, then suicide is *extremely risky* because it's so<br>final. You have no further opportunity for repentance.<br><br>So yes, you have the freedom to make the choice to no longer exist. But<br>as you can see by this analysis, that's an extremely risky position, and<br>it doesn't make logical sense.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Why doesn\'t God give us a choice to cease to exist?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
