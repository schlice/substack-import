<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Depends on the jurisdiction and the lender.<br><br>As part of the sale process, the HOA must certify that there are no<br>outstanding HOA debts against the house before it can be sold. If there<br>are, in most cases in most states, the back payments will come out of<br>the sale of the home and go to the HOA before any proceeds go to the<br>seller.<br><br>In some cases, the debt transfers to the new owner, and they begin their<br>life in their new home in the hole with the HOA as well as with their<br>lender.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
