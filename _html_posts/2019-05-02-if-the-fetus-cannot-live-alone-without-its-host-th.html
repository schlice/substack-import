<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If the fetus cannot live alone without its host the mother, then with<br>what logic are pro lifers saying the baby\'s rights should trump the<br>mother's rights?**<br><br>Viability is not the determining factor in order to be eligible for<br>human rights. Human rights are available to everyone who is a human.<br><br>Fetuses are indeed human, just at an earlier stage of development. There<br>isn't a definable point during the development of a human at which it<br>becomes human, and it is not human before that. It is a member of the<br>human species for the entirety of its existence, from the moment it<br>develops unique DNA until it dies. Because it is human, it should have<br>the same rights which are endowed upon every human. This includes the<br>right to life.<br><br>That said, we can decide to abridge those rights through force of law.<br>We do it to death row inmates. We say that after "due process," the<br>state can abridge the right to life. We can do the same to a fetus if we<br>choose. We can say that the mother has control over the due process<br>rights of the fetus and can choose to abridge its right to life. This is<br>a more cogent argument than saying that a lack of viability makes it<br>something not human, which is simply not scientifically supportable.<br><br>The Supreme Court fouled this all up, instead of doing what we just<br>suggested, by finding a "right to privacy" in the "emanations and<br>penumbras," but not the text, of the Constitution (i.e. *Griswold v.<br>Connecticut*) and then using that non-existent-right as the basis to<br>determine that the mother's right to privacy extended to the life of her<br>infant child still in the womb (*Roe v. Wade*).<br><br>If we affirmatively stated that the baby has a right to life, but the<br>mother has the ability to abridge that right, that would legally be<br>fine. We could even define limits around when the mother is able to do<br>this. For example, we say every day that when we can't detect brain<br>waves, and there is no pulse and no heartbeat, a human is "dead." Why<br>can we not extend the same logic to a fetus? Why can't we say that when<br>we can detect brain waves, when we can detect a heartbeat and a pulse,<br>the human (in the mother's womb) is "alive?" Not "human" or "not human,"<br>not "viable" or "not viable," "alive" or "not alive." And at that point,<br>killing that human would not be permitted. Why can we not do this?<br><br>The upshot would be that abortion on demand would be allowed until the<br>tiny human is alive (which we can detect scientifically). Beyond that<br>point, abortion would only be allowed to save the life of the mother<br>(i.e. the mother would die if the pregnancy continued).<br><br>It's a hard discussion that no one wants to have. We can do this. We<br>can balance the rights of the mother to have an abortion on demand<br>with the rights of the tiny unborn human to live, while still protecting<br>the lives of both. It can be done. We<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
