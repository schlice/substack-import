<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>There are a few realities that you are ignoring.<br><br>1\. There are 300,000,000 guns in the United States. How do you propose<br>enforcing such a ban on non-biometric weapons? Should the police go<br>door-to-door? Should they break down doors and dig up yards to find<br>hidden weapons caches? You have to repeal the 2nd, 4th, and 14th<br>Amendments before you can do this Should there be a buyback, and will<br>they pay fair market price, and where exactly will all that money come<br>from?<br><br>2\. The beauty of firearms is their simplicity and reliability. Taking a<br>firearm and making it inherently more complex and less reliable<br>hamstrings the weapon. Additionally, what will happen if the WiFi or the<br>biometrics fail exactly when you need to use them? You\'re dead. And<br>with a gun being such a simple mechanical device, it\'s an easy task to<br>bypass any such biometric locks.<br><br>3\. The Constitution does not grant you the right to self-defense. The<br>Constitution enjoins the government from restricting the right you<br>already had. Self-defense is a natural right. The state, therefore,<br>can\'t grant you the right to own weapons, you already have it as a<br>function of being a US citizen and a human being. The Constitution<br>simply says that the government cannot make any laws which infringe on<br>the right you already have. You\'d have to re-write the Second Amendment<br>to allow it to be restricted by government, which is antithetical to how<br>it was originally intended.<br><br>I like your ideas, but they are far more far away than you think, and<br>they have to get far more reliable before anyone will accept them.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-key-differences-between-Obama-and-Reagan-on-gun-control/answer/Bill-Stein<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
