<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: [Let me AGAIN clarify, as I did earlier in this discussion.<br>I\'ll add emphasis to help the clarification.\<br>\<br>In a state where it was compulsory that you register your guns,<br>law-abiding citizens would only have registered guns.\<br>\<br>If Texas does not require you to register your guns, failing to register<br>them does not make you any less law-abiding than anyone else. If you<br>lived in New York or Connecticut, you might be running afoul of the law<br>if you fail to register your guns, regardless of your reason. And in<br>that circumstance, yes, you would be breaking the law. You can call<br>yourself a law-abiding citizen while simultaneously picking and choosing<br>which laws you choose to follow, but that won\'t actually make you a<br>law-abiding citizen. I can call myself a purple elephant despite the<br>fact that I am not a purple elephant, and no amount of cognitive<br>dissonance will make me a purple elephant.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/Why-would-law-abiding-US-gun-owners-not-want-to-take-a-gun-safety-and-health-test-then-register-their-weapons-in-a-national-database/answer/Bill-Stein<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
