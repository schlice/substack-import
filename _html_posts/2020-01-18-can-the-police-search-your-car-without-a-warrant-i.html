<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Can the police search your car without a warrant if you refuse to show<br>your driver's license?**<br><br>As with all legal questions, the answer is "it depends," and it depends<br>on the status of your license.<br><br>**Simply failing to present your license is not grounds to search your<br>car.** However, depending on the status of your license, it *may* be<br>grounds to arrest you. Laws differ in every state, so check your state's<br>laws before thinking you can leave your license at home the next time<br>you get in your car.<br><br>Driving without being in possession of your license, or driving on an<br>otherwise valid but expired license, is usually just a traffic<br>infraction. However, if you're driving and you never had a license in<br>the first place, or if you are driving on a suspended or revoked<br>license, in most states that's a misdemeanor traffic offense. In other<br>words, if you are driving without having your valid license in your<br>possession, or if you let your otherwise valid license expire, it's a<br>fine. If you're driving on a suspended or revoked license, it's jail<br>time.<br><br>You can be arrested at the scene. If you are, your car will be<br>impounded. Your car will be searched incident to the impounding, to<br>catalog all of the items found in the car.<br><br>That's pretty much the only way your car can be searched without a<br>warrant simply by refusing to show a driver's license.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
