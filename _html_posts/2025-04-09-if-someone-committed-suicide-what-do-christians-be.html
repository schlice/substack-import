<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>***NOTE: This is an answer about suicide in the realm of Christianity.<br>It is not meant to discuss any one situation, nor is it meant to judge<br>anyone who has committed suicide, or who is contemplating committing<br>suicide.***<br><br>***If you fall into the last category, and you are considering suicide,<br>please seek help now. Please find the box titled "There is Help" and<br>reach out to someone. In the US, please call 988 or 1-800-273-8255, the<br>national hotline. Or get yourself to a hospital or call 911. Or go alert<br>someone in your home, apartment, or workplace, or wherever you are.***<br><br>*Do whatever it takes to get help.*<br><br>\<br><br>TL;DR: As far as Christians are concerned, what happens to them<br>depends on whether they have accepted Christ as their savior while they<br>were still alive.<br><br>To be sure, Christians view suicide as a sin. God, as our Creator, is<br>the only one who gets to decide when and how a person should die. Psalm<br>31 says, "My times are in your hands" (Psalm 31:15). God is the giver of<br>life. He gives, and He takes away (Job 1:21). Therefore, ending your own<br>life goes against God's plan for our life, and is therefore sinful.<br><br>But here's the important part: while we believe suicide is a sin, it's<br>just like any other sin we commit on a daily basis, with the notable<br>exception that we don't get the opportunity to repent of this particular<br>sin before we die. And if suicide is a sin like every other sin, then<br>**committing the sin of suicide does not determine a person's eternal<br>destiny.** Our eternal destiny rests solely on God's grace. Those who<br>trust in Jesus Christ are fully forgiven of every sin, and they receive<br>eternal life; those who reject Him remain condemned (John 3:16--18, 36;<br>Ephesians 2:1--10). And once we have been saved, we do not lose our<br>salvation because we have committed a sin. We face judgement for our<br>sins, but we are still saved if we were saved before.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
