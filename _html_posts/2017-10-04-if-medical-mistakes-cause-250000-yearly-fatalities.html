  why is that largely absent from public discourse? Gun control, with 34,000 yearly
  fatalities, seems to get all the attention."'

<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The two are unrelated other than in the context of this question, that<br>they both cause death. The reason they are not equated is because their<br>end goals are different. Doctors exist to *save life* while guns<br>exist, and are specifically designed, to *take life*.<br><br>That's not a bad thing (that guns are designed to kill), so long as<br>there are rational, reasonable situations in which taking life is<br>acceptable. Because there are such situations in which taking life is<br>not only legal, but appropriate and acceptable, the tool used to do so<br>does not make a difference. In fact, it is safer and easier in such<br>situations to use the most efficient and accurate tool available to do<br>so.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
