<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**How long do kids have after they turn 18 to sue the rapists their<br>welfare mothers left them with?**<br><br>There are a lot of moving parts to your question. The amount of time you<br>have to bring civil suit for sexual assault varies wildly between the<br>states. For example, in Florida, currently filing suit against your<br>attacker for criminal sexual assault is allowed within 7 years after you<br>turn 18, within 4 years of the time you discover the link between a<br>related injury and the abuse, and within 4 years of the time you<br>abandon/stop depending on the abuser. However, in California, you have<br>until you turn 40, or within 5 years of the time you discover the link<br>between a related injury and the abuse, whichever is later.<br><br>So the short answer is it depends on the state in which the abuse took<br>place and the laws there. However, laws are changing quickly. In<br>Florida, they passed Donna's Law in 2020, which removes the statute<br>of limitations for criminally prosecuting acts of sexual battery against<br>children under 18. However, the law *is not retroactive*; in other<br>words, it only applies to sexual battery which occurred after the law<br>was passed (July 1, 2020). Many states are modifying their laws<br>regarding statutes of limitations for sexual assault on a minor. This is<br>why it is crucial that you reach out to a personal injury attorney as<br>soon as you can, otherwise the time you have to file a claim may expire.<br><br>**Can a minor child who suffered being raped sue their custodial mother<br>too, when they turn 18 or is the rape of a child not the problem of the<br>custodian?**<br><br>Yes, if a sexual assault occurs due to someone else's negligence, that<br>party may be liable. All caretakers have a *duty of care* over those for<br>whom they care. If that duty of care is violated, and that negligence<br>causes injury to another, that party may be liable for violating that<br>duty of care.<br><br>Again, it is imperative that you reach out to a personal injury attorney<br>in your area as soon as possible, or the time you have to file a claim<br>may expire.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>How long do kids have after they turn 18 to sue the rapists their<br>welfare mothers left them with?
