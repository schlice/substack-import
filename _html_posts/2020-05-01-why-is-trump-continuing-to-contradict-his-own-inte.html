<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Why is Trump continuing to contradict his own intelligence<br>community?**<br><br>Intelligence is just one piece of evidence that constitutes the *body of<br>evidence* any leader uses to make decisions.<br><br>Intelligence is not infallible. Just ask George W. Bush. So it's not<br>like he's ignoring known good facts. It's intelligence, and all you know<br>is that he made a decision that does not align with the recommendation<br>from the intelligence community. You don't know the *confidence level*<br>of the intelligence he contradicted., Was it strong or weak? Was it<br>verified by other intelligence agencies, or are our guys standing alone<br>in their assessment?<br><br>A good leader does not blindly follow the "experts." The leader has more<br>to consider than the experts do.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
