<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Let's take your questions one at a time.<br><br>What happens if I don't pay my HOA fees?<br><br>The HOA can send your account to collections, or they can put a lien on<br>your house for the unpaid amount (if it gets high enough). If you have a<br>lien on your house, you can't sell it or refinance your mortgage until<br>that lien is paid. If it goes long enough, the HOA can foreclose on your<br>lien, which means they sell your house out from under you and use the<br>proceeds to repay the debt you owe.<br><br>**I've asked the landscapers to not touch my property since they use<br>cancer-causing chemicals, and I do all my own yard work. So do they<br>really have any recourse?**<br><br>For the purposes of this answer, I'm going to assume that the HOA<br>provides landscaping services, and it is paid for by your HOA dues.<br><br>You probably won't be able to negotiate directly with the landscapers,<br>as they take their direction from the HOA board under contract, not from<br>you. However, it's likely that you can opt-out of HOA landscaping<br>services. You may not necessarily get a credit on your HOA dues. In<br>fact, it's likely that you won't get a credit. Your HOA dues will likely<br>remain the same, but you won't have HOA-provided landscaping.<br><br>You will have to take this up with your HOA Board of Directors. Tell<br>them you want to opt out of HOA-provided landscaping. Understand that<br>they will likely tell you that you won't get any credit on your dues,<br>and you'll have to accept this. If they are unwilling to let you opt-out<br>of their provided landscaping service, you will have to consult a real<br>estate attorney in your area who specializes in HOA law.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
