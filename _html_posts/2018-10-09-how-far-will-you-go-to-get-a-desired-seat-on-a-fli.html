<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>How far will you go to get a desired seat on a flight?<br><br>I will go exactly as far as the airlines allow me to go.<br><br>If we're talking about all the major carriers except for Southwest, that<br>means paying for an upgrade in the coach cabin, which I guess you'd now<br>consider a "premium coach seat."<br><br>If we're talking about Southwest, it either means setting alarms so I<br>can check in exactly 24 hours prior to boarding, or paying for Early<br>Bird check-in. I have only paid for Early Bird check in when I knew that<br>I was going to be out of coverage (i.e. at sea) when 24 hours rolled<br>around. I also paid for it on business flights where my seat was paid<br>for by the company. I can chip in a little to get a better seat<br>selection on-board.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
