<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Of course an officer can use abrasive language with<br>someone.\<br>\<br>Should he? Probably not, especially if the suspect was being polite. You<br>have to be able to relate to every person you deal with, and for some,<br>that type of language is normal. But the officer\'s language should, at<br>the very least, match the coarseness of your own.\<br>\<br>If you feel that an officer\'s behavior was unacceptable and didn\'t<br>match the behavior you presented to the officer, you should file a<br>complaint with the officer\'s department.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
