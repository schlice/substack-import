I love Pushbullet; its automation features are<br>awesome, and I can integrate it with IFTTT for even more automation.<br><br>You can also use other sync programs such as the ones you probably are<br>already using in Android, such as Google Drive. Save your memo to your<br>Google Drive and open it on your laptop. You probably don't even need to<br>install anything else.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
