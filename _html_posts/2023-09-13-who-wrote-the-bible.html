<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>There wasn't "a man" who wrote the Bible, as the Bible isn't just one<br>book.<br><br>It's 66 books, written by about 30 different authors, over the span of<br>approximately 1500 years. On three different continents.<br><br>And yet, with all of that diversity, there is *unity* in the message of<br>the Bible. There are no contradictions between the books, and the books<br>are scientifically and historically accurate.<br><br>There is no way that humans alone could have possibly done that.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
