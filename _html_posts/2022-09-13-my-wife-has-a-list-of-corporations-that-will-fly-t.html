<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Since you asked this question in the Christian Corner, I'm going to give<br>you a Biblical answer. And the answer is more related to where you allow<br>your money to be spent.<br><br>Your money is not yours. It's God's. We Christians know this. God gives<br>us the resources we need to live our lives. We are merely stewards of<br>the resources that God has given us.<br><br>So tell me: are you being a good steward of God's resources if you<br>knowingly allow it to be given to an organization which will use those<br>resources to facilitate the murder of babies?<br><br>I don't doubt that It will be hard. You'll have to give up your iPhones.<br>In my case, I'll have to forego renewing my Annual Pass to Walt Disney<br>World, despite the fact that from all signs, Disney is not going to sell<br>Annual Passes in their current form any more, so once I let it go, it's<br>most likely gone for good.<br><br>But I also know that there are plenty of other companies whose health<br>plans include travel to "centers of excellence" or locations for<br>specialized healthcare if it is not available near you. For example, my<br>company's health plan allows for travel reimbursement in these cases,<br>for all covered health services. So if I, for example, get cancer, I can<br>travel to a cancer treatment center and recoup some of my travel<br>expenses through my health care plan. But what constitutes a "covered<br>health service" varies from company to company, and it's not all<br>black-and-white, and it's not all out in the open. So it becomes very<br>difficult to really know whether your money will actually be<br>facilitating abortions.<br><br>However, for the "clear-cut" cases (like where companies have literally<br>issued press releases declaring that they will pay for employees to<br>travel to states which allow the killing of babies), we can choose to<br>spend our money elsewhere.<br><br>\<br><br>That said, is there a *limit* to how much we must disrupt our lives? For<br>example, if Visa said that they will pay for their employees to travel<br>to abortion clinics, do I have to cancel all of my Visa cards because of<br>this? If my bank supported this policy, should I change banks? If my<br>*employer* supported this policy, should I quit?<br><br>And what about *taxes*? What if the government successfully repeals the<br>Hyde Amendment and actual tax dollars are forced to be paid to abortion<br>providers like Planned Parenthood to pay for abortions? Can I refuse to<br>pay taxes because my money will go towards paying for abortions?<br><br>I struggle with these questions, and I'd love to hear your thoughts in<br>the comments.<br><br>But I know that God is sovereign, He is just, and He is righteous.<br>Notice that nowhere in the Bible does it say that God is *fair*. So I<br>know that He is loving and righteous, but sometimes following Him isn't<br>fair, or fun, or painless. I will have to be uncomfortable. I will have<br>to be inconvenienced. I may have to even endure suffering at times. But<br>all of it is according to His will and His good plan for us.<br><br>In my opinion, where companies *applaud* evil, I will make the most<br>inconveniencing efforts to distance my resources from that company.<br><br>But you will have to follow the dictates of your conscience and the pull<br>of the Spirit on your heart. In the end, we will all account for our<br>actions in this life, whether we have been washed clean by the blood of<br>Christ or not. I pray that God will guide our hearts to make decisions<br>regarding stewardship of His resources that will be pleasing to Him and<br>will advance the Kingdom<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
