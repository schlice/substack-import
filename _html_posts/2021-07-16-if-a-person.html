<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The science we use to determine this answer is called *epidemiology*,<br>which is the study of disease patterns in groups of people.<br><br>The average risk in society of developing MS is 1 in 750. Having a<br>first-degree relative (parent, sibling, non-identical twin) with MS<br>increases that risk to anywhere between 1 in 100 to 1 in 40.<br><br>But it's not all genetic, though, and you can use the identical twin<br>scenario to prove it. If one of the twins has MS, the other twin has a 1<br>in 4 chance of developing MS. If it was all genetic, the other twin<br>would have a 100% chance of developing MS as they possess the exact same<br>genome, but because the risk is only 25% among identical twins, we know<br>that there are other factors involved as well, such as age, sex,<br>ethnicity, area where you were born and where you lived your childhood,<br>and an as-of-yet unidentified infectious trigger which starts the<br>disease process.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>If a person's mother has multiple sclerosis, what are the chances that a<br>person would have it as well?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
