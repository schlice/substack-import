<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Hijacking aircraft, and the attitudes surrounding it, have<br>been the biggest changes in the aviation industry.\<br>\<br>Before 9/11, a hijacker would \"take over\" an aircraft by holding the<br>pilot hostage and demanding the plane be flown to a particular location.<br>The plane would be met at the destination airport by police, a hostage<br>situation would ensue, and the hijacker would either surrender to police<br>or be killed. Easy peesey.\<br>\<br>9/11 completely changed the attitude towards hijackers, and completely<br>changed the security posture inside of an aircraft. During the 9/11<br>attacks, instead of taking the pilots hostage and demanding they fly to<br>some location, the hijackers *killed* the pilots and took over control<br>of flying the aircraft, to turn the aircraft into human-guided missiles.<br>This was a quantum shift in the hijacking game, one which changed the<br>face of in-aircraft security, and changed the way we think about<br>hijackers.\<br>\<br>Have you noticed that not too many planes have been hijacked since 9/11?<br>The incidence of hijackers on aircraft has dropped substantially, and<br>9/11 is the proximate cause of that change. Cockpit security has been<br>dramatically increased, and any attempts at incursion into the cockpit<br>have been met with violent and swift response, binding any attackers<br>until the aircraft can make its first emergency landing to remove the<br>unruly passenger. Even drunkards on aircraft are dealt with more harshly<br>now. There is very little tolerance these days for un-gentlemanlike or<br>un-ladylike behavior aboard an actively flying<br>aircraft.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
