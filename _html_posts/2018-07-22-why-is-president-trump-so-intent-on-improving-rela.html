<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Why is President Trump so intent on improving relations with Russia?<br><br>*\[PLEASE NOTE: This answer was written during Trump's first term, but<br>it seems to have aged very well, into his second term.\]*<br><br>There are a lot of answers here<br>[Judy(https://www.quora.com/profile/Judy-Hulen)]{.qlink_container},<br>but two quotes seem to stick out for me, and they're not<br>politically-charged quotes (i.e. apply more to one side than the other).<br>They're more life lessons that seem to fit well here:<br><br>*"Keep your friends close, but keep your enemies closer."*<br><br>and<br><br>*"The enemy of my enemy is my friend."*<br><br>We spend a lot of time talking about Russia, but the biggest threat to<br>the United States right now is China. I'm FAR more worried about a<br>Chinese invasion than I am about a Russian invasion. China has made<br>billions of dollars through special economic zones such as exists today<br>in Shenzen, incentivizing companies to come in and manufacture goods for<br>far cheaper than they could do at home. In the process, China has been<br>stealing the very same intellectual property (IP) and creating virtual<br>copy knock-offs and has made billions more. Through the injection of<br>other companies' IP, they have now started developing their own,<br>non-IP-stealing tech that rivals some of ours in terms of actual build<br>quality and design. It doesn't beat it yet, but it rivals it. They've<br>used that infusion of cash to invest in US businesses and real estate to<br>the point where they control vast swaths of real estate in major cities.<br>If they ever called any of those loans, we'd be in some serious hot<br>water.<br><br>If China ever decided to stop being so friendly and start attacking, we<br>need whatever allies we can get, and a China-Russia alliance *could*<br>spell the end of the United States. I know it's hard to see that because<br>we haven't successfully been invaded in, well, ever, but discounting the<br>possibility simply because it hasn't happened before is a mistake we'll<br>only make once. That's because we'll only have the opportunity to make<br>it once, and from then on, we'll be Annex 8 to China and we'll all be<br>learning Mandarin in school instead of English.<br><br>Making sure that Russia remains *our* ally and not China's ally takes a<br>lot of work over a long period of time. President Trump realizes that<br>being allies with Russia only benefits the United States.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
