<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The Constitution is interpreted dispassionately. Or, at least, it is<br>supposed to be.<br><br>The *effect* of laws is something that *lawmakers* take into<br>consideration. The *Constitutionality* of laws is the only thing<br>addressed by SCOTUS.<br><br>So to answer the big question:<br><br>> Would SCOTUS overturn a gun law that actually prevented deaths without<br>> disproportionately inconveniencing lawful gun owners?<br><br>The answer is yes, if the law was unconstitutional.<br><br>*How* that elimination of that law played out is irrelevant to the<br>decision. In other words, "preventing deaths" is not a valid reason to<br>leave an unconstitutional law in place, just as "retaining a woman's<br>access to legal abortions" is not a valid reason to leave an<br>unconstitutional decision like *Roe* in place.<br><br>If lawmakers want to continue to prevent deaths or retain access to<br>legal abortion, they can write a new law which does not violate the<br>Constitution.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
