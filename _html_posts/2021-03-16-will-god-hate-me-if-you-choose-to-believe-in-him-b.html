<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Will God hate me if you choose to believe in him but not be a part of<br>the church?**<br><br>No, God will not hate you. God will never hate you, no matter what you<br>do.<br><br>God is not hateful. But sometimes, God is saddened, because he wants a<br>much closer relationship with you. He wants you to do more than believe<br>in him. He wants to be friends. He wants to hear all about your day. He<br>wants to know your fears.<br><br>And then, eventually, he wants you to lean on him. He wants you to put<br>your *faith* in him to guide your life in the direction that he chooses.<br>It may not be what you expected, or even wanted, but it will glorify him<br>and it will be amazing.<br><br>So he's certainly not mad at you, and he doesn't hate you. But I bet<br>he's sad, because he really wants more. He wants more for you than<br>you're giving him.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
