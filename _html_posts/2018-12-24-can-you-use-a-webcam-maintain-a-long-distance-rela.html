<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Can you use a webcam maintain a long-distance relationship with your<br>cat or dog while away at school?**<br><br>The answer: in most cases, no.<br><br>Most computer monitors and televisions run at a 60 Hz refresh rate. This<br>means the image refreshes (or changes) 60 times per second. Human eyes<br>can be fooled at around 50 Hz, so we see a continuous, smooth image. If<br>it falls below 50 Hz, we don't see a smooth image. We see flickering<br>images and annoying lines.<br><br>Dogs generally have better eyesight than we do, and will see nothing but<br>flicker until about 75 Hz. So unless you're using a high-end gaming<br>monitor at 144 Hz or higher, it's unlikely your dog will be able to see<br>you clearly.<br><br>Also, dogs aren't going to sit and watch an image that's not at their<br>eye level, so you'll have to set your high-end gaming monitor on the<br>floor.<br><br>So in the case of the dog, it is possible, but in order to do it, you<br>have to have a gaming PC with a graphics card capable of generating over<br>75 Hz and a monitor capable of displaying such an image. Those aren't<br>cheap. For the full gaming rig at decent quality, you can expect to<br>spend at least \$1500. Most gamers have standard rigs that run about<br>\$2000, on average, with some custom rigs running even higher than that.<br><br>Cats, on the other hand, can see images on a standard 60 Hz TV. However,<br>cats are easily bored and are disinterested in human pursuits, so it's<br>unlikely you'll be able to attract their attention, let alone be able to<br>interact with them. But it's worth a try.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
