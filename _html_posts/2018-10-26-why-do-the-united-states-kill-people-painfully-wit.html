It does<br>this through the injection of three drugs:<br><br>1.  Sodium thiopental or pentobarbital: an ultra short-action<br>    barbiturate, an anesthetic agent used at a high dose that renders<br>    the person unconscious in less than 30 seconds. Depression of<br>    respiratory activity is one of the characteristic actions of this<br>    drug. Consequently, the lethal-injection doses will---even in the<br>    absence of the next two drugs---cause death due to lack of<br>    breathing, as happens with overdoses of opioids.<br>2.  Pancuronium bromide: a non-depolarizing muscle relaxant, which<br>    causes complete, fast, and sustained paralysis of the skeletal<br>    striated muscles, including the diaphragm and the rest of the<br>    respiratory muscles; this would eventually cause death by<br>    asphyxiation.<br>3.  Potassium chloride: a potassium salt, which increases the blood and<br>    cardiac concentration of potassium to stop the heart via an abnormal<br>    heartbeat and thus cause death by cardiac<br>    arrest.\[1\](#xRrxS){#cite-xRrxS .citation_link}<br><br>The drugs are administered in order: the first drug causes loss of<br>consciousness, the second drug causes paralysis, and the third drug<br>induces cardiac arrest.<br><br>In some instances, the drugs did not work in the order or doses in which<br>they were given. Especially in drug abusers who already have high<br>tolerances to certain drugs like barbiturates, the pentobarbital may<br>have little effect, rendering the inmate conscious while the second drug<br>is administered. When the third drug is administered, if you are still<br>conscious, you would essentially be experiencing painful cardiac arrest,<br>while conscious and paralyzed. This, arguably, is torture.<br><br>The problem is that the drugs are administered by prison guards, not by<br>an anesthesiologist. Things like previous drug use and size of the<br>inmate are not adequately taken into consideration when the doses of the<br>drugs are determined.<br><br>There are other ways to execute prisoners more humanely.
