<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>[Sedition(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=e3d9b6&url=https://criminal.findlaw.com/criminal-charges/sedition.html){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="findlaw.com"}]{.qlink_container}. It is a Federal crime for<br>"two or more people within the jurisdiction of the United States:<br><br>- To conspire to overthrow or destroy by force the government of the<br>  United States or to level war against them;<br>- To oppose by force the authority of the United States government; to<br>  prevent, hinder, or delay by force the execution of any law of the<br>  United States; or<br>- To take, seize, or possess by force any property of the United States<br>  contrary to the authority thereof."<br><br>Clearly, there's a lot of conflict between sedition and the 1st<br>Amendment, right? So how do you prove sedition? In order to get a<br>conviction for seditious conspiracy, the government must prove that the<br>defendant in fact conspired to use force. Simply **advocating for<br>the use of force is not the same thing** and in most cases is protected<br>as free speech under the First Amendment.<br><br>So no, it's highly unlikely that Trump's tweets could be considered<br>felony sedition.
