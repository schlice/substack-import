<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I have personal experience with this issue. Not me personally, but *my<br>pastor* is independently wealthy (from his former life, and he married<br>well also). So we talk about personal wealth and things like what we<br>wear (and how we accessorize) quite a bit, because it's a very outwardly<br>visible thing in my church.<br><br>The problem is not the fact that you wear expensive clothes. The problem<br>is *why* you wear expensive clothes.<br><br>Peter talks about "outward adornment" in parallel to what Paul says to<br>Timothy.<br><br>> Your beauty should not come from outward adornment, such as elaborate<br>> hairstyles and the wearing of gold jewelry or fine clothes. Rather, it<br>> should be that of your inner self, the unfading beauty of a gentle and<br>> quiet spirit, which is of great worth in God's sight. --- 1 Peter<br>> 3:3--4 NIV<br><br>As you can see, "outward adornment" is less important than the "inner<br>self." Christians should focus less on outward adornment and more on the<br>development of the "inner self."<br><br>The Bible also talks about doing everything we do (including how we<br>dress) for the glory of God:<br><br>> So whether you eat or drink or whatever you do, do it all for the<br>> glory of God. --- 1 Cor 10:31 NIV<br><br>So the motivation of our heart is well known to God. If you're wearing<br>expensive clothes to "stand out" or to "fit in," your motivation may<br>fall short of God's plan for us. The clothes themselves may not be<br>sinful, but our motivation for wearing them may be.<br><br>Finally, we are also God's ambassadors:<br><br>> We are therefore Christ's ambassadors, as though God were making his<br>> appeal through us. --- 2 Cor 5:20 NIV<br><br>What message does our clothing send? Does our clothing *enhance* God's<br>message, or does it *detract* from the delivery of that message?<br><br>Since what clothing exactly we should be wearing is never really<br>discussed, it's sort of a "gray area" where you should listen to the<br>Spirit and be sensitive to those around you. If you're standing out, you<br>might consider "dressing down" a bit.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
