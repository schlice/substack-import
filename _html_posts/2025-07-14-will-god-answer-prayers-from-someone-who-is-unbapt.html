<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Yep.<br><br>Baptism is an outward sign of an inward truth. Baptism means "I'm<br>declaring to the world that Jesus is my personal savior, and I will<br>demonstrate how I will die and be buried with Him (go under the water)<br>and will rise with Him on the last day (come up out of the water). It's<br>a very visceral, visual representation of what it means to be a<br>Christ-follower. It was very important in the time of Jesus: to show<br>*visually* that you were taking that step of faith as a believer. So it<br>is commanded of believers, and so we do it today.<br><br>Baptism doesn't confer any special power or authority on to you. In<br>fact, you can be unbaptized and still get to heaven. Just look at the<br>thief on the cross. He wasn't a Christian until he was hung on a cross<br>next to Jesus, and Jesus promised him heaven.<br><br>But for those of us not hanging on a cross, we are commanded to be<br>baptized *as believers*. We demonstrate our belief through baptism.<br><br>In other words, baptism isn't what saves you. Baptism is what saved<br>people do.<br><br>So yes, God will indeed answer prayers from someone who is unbaptized.<br>And hopefully, that person who is unbaptized will give their life to<br>Jesus and will *get* baptized.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
