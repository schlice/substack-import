<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I'm a Christian and I really despise these "did you know" questions.<br><br>OF COURSE THEY KNOW THAT THEY CAN'T PROVE THAT GOD DOES NOT EXIST.<br><br>But in exactly the same way and using exactly the same tools, **we also<br>cannot prove that God exists.**<br><br>Of course, the reason for that is, in that scenario, the tools we both<br>are trying to use are wrong. Science can never prove or disprove the<br>existence of God, because God exists outside of what science can detect.<br>It's like trying to use an X-ray machine to find a plastic spoon.<br>Science is simply the wrong tool.<br><br>We can prove that God exists using logic and reason. This is evidence<br>gained through *inductive* reasoning, and as such, can never be 100%<br>certain. Atheists, however, reject these proofs as lacking, despite the<br>fact that we can prove God exists beyond what we would consider<br>reasonable doubt. The difference between our two camps is what we both<br>consider *reasonable.*<br><br>And that, dear questioner, is *by design.*<br><br>> See, God designed us with free will. And the beauty of free will<br>> in God's plan is that if you're not willing to accept Christianity,<br>> then you're free to reject it. This freedom to make choices---even the<br>> freedom to reject truth---is what makes us moral creatures and enables<br>> each of us to choose our own destiny.<br>><br>> This really hits at the heart of why we exist at all, and why God<br>> might not be as forthcoming in revealing Himself to us as you would<br>> like.<br>><br>> For if the Bible is true, then God has provided each of us with the<br>> opportunity to make an eternal choice to either accept Him or reject<br>> Him. And in order to ensure that our choice is truly free, He puts us<br>> in an environment that is filled with evidence of His existence, but<br>> without his *direct* presence---a presence so powerful that it could<br>> overwhelm our freedom and thus negate our ability to reject Him.<br>><br>> In other words, **God has provided enough evidence in this life to<br>> convince anyone *willing to believe*, yet He has also left some<br>> ambiguity so as not to compel the *unwilling*.**<br>><br>> In this way, God gives us the opportunity either to love Him or to<br>> reject Him without violating our freedom. In fact, the purpose of this<br>> life is to make that choice freely and without coercion. For love, by<br>> definition, must be freely given. It cannot be<br>> coerced.\[1\](#zFRwD){#cite-zFRwD .citation_link}<br><br>**TL;DR: Yes, atheists know full well that they can't prove God doesn't<br>exist. And that is by design.**<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-zFRwD){.citation_index} [[I Don\'t Have Enough Faith to Be<br>an Atheist: Geisler, Norman L., Turek, Frank, Limbaugh, David:<br>9781433580758: Amazon.com:<br>Books](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=770f5b&url=https://www.amazon.com/Dont-Have-Enough-Faith-Atheist/dp/1433580756){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="amazon.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
