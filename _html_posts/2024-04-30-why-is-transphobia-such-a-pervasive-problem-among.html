<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The answers here have covered the issue of the perception of<br>transphobia, since that is the real thrust of the question. But most of<br>our answerers here glossed over the last part where the questioner says<br>that Jesus tells us to not judge.<br><br>I want to take a moment to address this, as it is a *very* common<br>misinterpretation of the Bible. Many people use this verse in an attempt<br>to silence their critics, interpreting Jesus' meaning as "You don't have<br>the right to tell me I'm wrong." Taken in isolation, Jesus' command "Do<br>not judge" does indeed seem to preclude all negative assessments.<br>However, there is much more to the passage than those three words.<br><br>Christians are often accused of "judging" when we point out sin, but<br>doing so is not wrong. When you point out what is true and right, it<br>naturally defines what is *not* true and right, and the attacks start to<br>come from those who have chosen what is not right. But the simple fact<br>is that the right thing is always the right thing, regardless of how<br>many people have chosen the wrong thing.<br><br>Let's dig in to that concept of biblical judgement. My friends over at<br>[GotQuestions.org(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=c2491a&url=http://gotquestions.org){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="gotquestions.org"}]{.qlink_container} have a really great<br>write-up on what Jesus meant when he said not to judge:<br><br>> The command to not judge others does not mean we cannot show<br>> discernment. Immediately after Jesus says, "Do not judge," He says,<br>> "Do not give dogs what is sacred; do not throw your pearls to pigs"<br>> ([[Matthew<br>> 7:6](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=3b1fc9&url=https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/7/Matthew-7-6.html){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="bibleref.com"}]{.qlink_container}). He goes on to say,<br>> "Watch out for false prophets. \...\ By their fruit you will<br>> recognize them" (verses 15--16). How are we to determine who are the<br>> "dogs" and "pigs" and "false prophets" unless we have the ability to<br>> make a judgment call on doctrines and deeds? Jesus is giving us<br>> permission to tell right from wrong. In other words, Jesus is giving<br>> us permission to judge.<br>><br>> Also, the Bible's command that we not judge others does not mean that<br>> all actions possess equal moral weight or that truth is subjective.<br>> The Bible clearly teaches that truth is objective, eternal, and<br>> inseparable from God's character. Anything that contradicts the truth<br>> is a lie---but, of course, to call something a "lie" is to pass<br>> judgment. To call adultery or murder a sin is likewise to pass<br>> judgment---but it's also to agree with God. When Jesus said not to<br>> judge others, He did not mean that no one can identify sin for what it<br>> is, based on God's definition of *sin*.<br>><br>> Additionally, the Bible\'s instruction not to judge others does not<br>> imply that there should be no system in place to address sin. The<br>> Bible has a whole book literally called *Judges*. The judges in the<br>> Old Testament were raised up by God Himself ([[Judges<br>> 2:18](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=2846a6&url=https://www.bibleref.com/Judges/2/Judges-2-18.html){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="bibleref.com"}]{.qlink_container}). The contemporary<br>> judicial system, along with its judges, is an essential component of<br>> society.<br>><br>> In other instances, Jesus explicitly commands us *to* judge: "Stop<br>> judging by mere appearances, but instead judge correctly" ([[John<br>> 7:24](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=0c55e2&url=https://www.bibleref.com/John/7/John-7-24.html){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="bibleref.com"}]{.qlink_container}). This passage begins to<br>> show us the difference between the correct form of judgment and the<br>> incorrect one. Taking this verse and some others, we can compile a<br>> description of the types of judgments that are considered sinful.:<br>><br>> - *Superficial* judgment. Passing judgment on someone based<br>>   solely on appearances is sinful ([[John<br>>   7:24](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=0c55e2&url=https://www.bibleref.com/John/7/John-7-24.html){.external_link<br>>   rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>>   onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>>   qt-tooltip="bibleref.com"}]{.qlink_container}). It is wrong to jump<br>>   to conclusions before investigating the facts ([[Proverbs<br>>   18:13](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=7227ff&url=https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/18/Proverbs-18-13.html){.external_link<br>>   rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>>   onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>>   qt-tooltip="bibleref.com"}]{.qlink_container}). Simon the Pharisee<br>>   passed judgment on a woman based on her appearance and reputation,<br>>   but he could not see that the woman had been forgiven; Simon thus<br>>   drew Jesus' rebuke for his unrighteous judgment ([[Luke<br>>   7:36--50](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=15e02c&url=https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/7/Luke-7-36.html){.external_link<br>>   rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>>   onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>>   qt-tooltip="bibleref.com"}]{.qlink_container}).<br>> - *Hypocritical* judgment. Jesus' command not to judge others<br>>   in [[Matthew<br>>   7:1](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=fdf5be&url=https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/7/Matthew-7-1.html){.external_link<br>>   rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>>   onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>>   qt-tooltip="bibleref.com"}]{.qlink_container} is preceded by<br>>   comparisons to hypocrites ([[Matthew<br>>   6:2](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=453244&url=https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/6/Matthew-6-2.html){.external_link<br>>   rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>>   onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>>   qt-tooltip="bibleref.com"}]{.qlink_container},<br>>   [5(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=af8cfa&url=https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/6/Matthew-6-5.html){.external_link<br>>   rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>>   onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>>   qt-tooltip="bibleref.com"}]{.qlink_container},<br>>   [16(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=295bc9&url=https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/6/Matthew-6-16.html){.external_link<br>>   rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>>   onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>>   qt-tooltip="bibleref.com"}]{.qlink_container}) and followed by a<br>>   warning against hypocrisy ([[Matthew<br>>   7:3--5](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=70208b&url=https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/7/Matthew-7-3.html){.external_link<br>>   rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>>   onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>>   qt-tooltip="bibleref.com"}]{.qlink_container}). When we point out<br>>   the sin of others while we ourselves commit the same sin, we condemn<br>>   ourselves ([[Romans<br>>   2:1](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=dc7403&url=https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/2/Romans-2-1.html){.external_link<br>>   rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>>   onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>>   qt-tooltip="bibleref.com"}]{.qlink_container}).<br>> - *Harsh, unforgiving* judgment. We are "always to be gentle<br>>   toward everyone" ([[Titus<br>>   3:2](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=09d981&url=https://www.bibleref.com/Titus/3/Titus-3-2.html){.external_link<br>>   rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>>   onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>>   qt-tooltip="bibleref.com"}]{.qlink_container}). It is the merciful<br>>   who will be shown mercy ([[Matthew<br>>   5:7](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=42f76e&url=https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/5/Matthew-5-7.html){.external_link<br>>   rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>>   onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>>   qt-tooltip="bibleref.com"}]{.qlink_container}), and, as Jesus<br>>   warned, "In the same way you judge others, you will be judged, and<br>>   with the measure you use, it will be measured to you" ([[Matthew<br>>   7:2](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=8310d2&url=https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/7/Matthew-7-2.html){.external_link<br>>   rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>>   onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>>   qt-tooltip="bibleref.com"}]{.qlink_container}).<br>> - *Self-righteous* judgment. We are called to humility, and<br>>   "God opposes the proud" ([[James<br>>   4:6](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=5a0dad&url=https://www.bibleref.com/James/4/James-4-6.html){.external_link<br>>   rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>>   onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>>   qt-tooltip="bibleref.com"}]{.qlink_container}). In Jesus' parable of<br>>   the Pharisee and the tax collector, the Pharisee was confident in<br>>   his own righteousness and from that proud position judged the<br>>   publican; however, God sees the heart and refused to forgive the<br>>   Pharisee's sin ([[Luke<br>>   18:9--14](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=086cf3&url=https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/18/Luke-18-9.html){.external_link<br>>   rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>>   onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>>   qt-tooltip="bibleref.com"}]{.qlink_container}).<br>> - *Untrue* judgment. The Bible clearly forbids bearing false<br>>   witness ([[Proverbs<br>>   19:5](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=22f113&url=https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/19/Proverbs-19-5.html){.external_link<br>>   rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>>   onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>>   qt-tooltip="bibleref.com"}]{.qlink_container}). "Slander no one"<br>>   ([[Titus<br>>   3:2](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=09d981&url=https://www.bibleref.com/Titus/3/Titus-3-2.html){.external_link<br>>   rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>>   onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>>   qt-tooltip="bibleref.com"}]{.qlink_container}).\[1\](#TzQdb){#cite-TzQdb<br>>   .citation_link}<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-TzQdb){.citation_index} [[What does the Bible mean when it<br>says, "Do not<br>judge"?](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=c11ee9&url=https://www.gotquestions.org/do-not-judge.html){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="gotquestions.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
