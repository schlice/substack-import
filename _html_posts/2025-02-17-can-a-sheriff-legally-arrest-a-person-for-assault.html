<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>This is an interesting question, because without evidence (or probable<br>cause to believe that the person arrested actually committed the assault<br>alleged), then the arrest would be thrown out.<br><br>Is it *illegal* to make such an arrest? Technically, it is not illegal<br>for a police officer to make such an arrest *assuming he was acting in<br>good faith with the information he had at hand.*<br><br>If the officer *knowingly* made an arrest without probable cause and not<br>acting in good faith, the arrest, while not a crime in and of itself,<br>would become the topic of a civil rights violation lawsuit, where such<br>causes of action as "false arrest" would be levied.<br><br>If the police were to arrest a person without probable cause, based on<br>mistaken identity, through police misconduct, through unlawful searches<br>and seizures, or through coerced false testimony, that officer and that<br>department could be sued for false arrest.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
