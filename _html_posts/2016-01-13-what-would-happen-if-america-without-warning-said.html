<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>We tried it once before. It didn\'t work out as well as we hoped.<br><br>After WWI, the US took on a very isolationist foreign policy, because we<br>really didn\'t want to get involved with any issues in Europe. We<br>essentially closed down all immigration. We imposed steep tariffs on<br>imported goods, essentially blocking foreign goods out of the US. We<br>refused to join the League of Nations so as to avoid unpleasant and<br>unnecessary entanglements with European nations.<br><br>That isolationist policy was one of the factors that contributed to the<br>rise of Hitler and WWII. How?<br><br>European countries had accumulated massive debt to the United States<br>during the war. They had difficulty repaying those roughly \$10 billion<br>in loans (even though the US lowered interest rates for them) because of<br>our aforementioned high tariffs. The Europeans looked to Germany to<br>repay their war debt, which at the time topped \$33 billion. Germany was<br>going through its own financial crisis and became completely unable to<br>repay anyone. Europeans became bitter over these war debts as they<br>claimed they did most of the fighting and suffered the most, so the US<br>should cancel their war debts. The US said that more than a third of the<br>loans were made after the end of the war, so there was no basis to<br>cancel the debts. With Europe, Germany, and the US locked in this<br>triumvirate of debt, an overall bitterness set in all across Europe,<br>especially in Germany (which owed the most), which (yep, you guessed it)<br>contributed to the rise of Hitler in the 30\'s.<br><br>Good intentions, bad consequences. Isolationism is, therefore, bad.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
