<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I thought there was a minimum age to vote. Maybe I'm wrong about that.<br>I'll have to go look that one up. If the person isn't of voting age, it<br>really doesn't make sense to even send them a ballot, even if you know<br>they exist. I mean, why don't they send ballots to every registered<br>child in every household? Because they can't use them. There's literally<br>no justification for doing so.<br><br>Also, most states since the 2020 election have made it illegal to mail a<br>ballot to someone who has not requested a mail-in ballot. You know,<br>because of situations just like this. Of course, Democrats denounced<br>this, saying that Republican legislatures which were just trying to rein<br>in the excesses during the pandemic are actually "disenfranchising"<br>voters (they say that word a lot without really understanding what it<br>means).<br><br>We could very easily fix this if we simply require an ID to vote. I<br>think most fetuses don't have ID, so it's unlikely they'll be voting any<br>time soon. I think we don't need to worry about this one too much.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Why can\'t Republicans understand that if SCOTUS overturns Roe v. Wade,<br>The DemonRATS will start mailing ballots to every embryo and fetus ever<br>conceived, even the aborted ones, and totally wipe out the \"Red Wave\"<br>they were expecting?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
