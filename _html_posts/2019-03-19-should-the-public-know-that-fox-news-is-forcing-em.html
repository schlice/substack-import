<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Should the public know that Fox News is forcing employees to sign<br>non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) to prevent them from revealing that the<br>network refuses to report some negative news about Individual Number<br>One?**<br><br>Your question is slightly incorrect, and missing a lot of detail.<br><br>First of all, not just Fox News has employees sign NDAs. [[NDAs are<br>ubiquitous across<br>media](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=6d564e&url=https://www.cjr.org/watchdog/journalists-nda-nondisclosure-harassment-metoo-newsrooms.php){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="cjr.org"}]{.qlink_container}, both on-air and print. NDAs<br>are both necessary and evil, both allowing business to keep company<br>confidential information secret, while simultaneously creating the<br>environment in which things like sexual harassment can occur unchecked.<br><br>Secondly, NDAs are perfectly legal, as private businesses are not<br>covered by the First Amendment. While the First Amendment prohibits<br>*government* from making a law regarding freedom of speech, it says<br>nothing about whether or not a private company can make rules which<br>silence certain speech. This is why NDAs are legal. A private business<br>(in this case, a news organization) can decide whether or not they want<br>to air a particular story, and they can force their employees to not<br>discuss matters of business decisions about what stories they run while<br>they are employed, and for a time after. The article you quoted seems to<br>gloss over the fact that NDAs are common in business, allowing them to<br>keep insider information confidential.<br><br>That Fox News scuttled stories in order to protect the President from<br>fallout during an election should be no surprise to anyone. Every major<br>media outlet has done the same thing. Indeed, the Stormy Daniels saga is<br>the story of a media outlet purchasing the rights to a story and then<br>*not* running that story, in a media practice called "catch and kill."<br>Fox directed the journalist in question, Diana Falzone, to not run a<br>story on Daniels. The New Yorker alleges that [[Fox did this to protect<br>the<br>President](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=9a9a03&url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/03/11/the-making-of-the-fox-news-white-house){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="newyorker.com"}]{.qlink_container}.<br><br>Deferential treatment of politicians has been the dirty little secret of<br>the mainstream media for the past ten years, but has become overtly<br>partisan over the last two. The media treated President Obama with kid<br>gloves during his entire presidency, either fearing the fallout from<br>negativity against the nation's first black president, or covertly<br>working to keep his record as flawless as possible. Your level of<br>conspiracy will determine which you believe is true.<br><br>You'll also note that the NDA Falzone signed allowed her to discuss the<br>issue with the government because, like most NDAs, it has an exception<br>for government investigations.<br><br>The larger question, of course, is whether or not media outlets should<br>be allowed to make journalists sign NDAs in the first place. Some argue<br>that NDAs allow media outlets to function more like campaign<br>organizations than journalists, and the public should hold campaign<br>organizations to a different standard than media outlets in terms of<br>what we believe about their message.<br><br>On the other hand, most NDAs are actually unenforceable in court.<br>Especially in the case where a company is doing something illegal,<br>existing law protects those employees. Whistleblower statutes allow<br>employees reporting illegal behavior to be protected from retribution,<br>and other existing laws limit the things to which two parties in a<br>contract may agree. Often, if a suit is filed alleging NDA violations,<br>the employer will settle out of court, because they know that their<br>contract likely will not hold up to legal scrutiny.<br><br>Enforceable or not, the NDA creates the environment of secrecy backed by<br>the threat of a potential lawsuit.<br><br>So, to answer your question: should the public know about NDAs? Yes.<br>There's a lot of things that the public should know about. Should they<br>be allowed to continue? Yes, because they do allow for companies to keep<br>*some* secrets. However, *employees, even more than the public,*<br>should know what existing law says, and that they can safely report<br>illegal behavior without fear of reprisals.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
