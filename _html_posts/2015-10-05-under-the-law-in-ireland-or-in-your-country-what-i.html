<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [I\'m sorry that I can\'t answer for Ireland. In the United<br>States, slander or libel can only be brought as charges if you have<br>suffered some demonstrable harm from the \"opinion\" of the liar. As<br>hurtful as the comments may be, at least in the United States, they are<br>not illegal. If the comments cost you a job, or got you into legal<br>trouble, you may have a claim. But if someone was simply stating their<br>opinion (albeit incorrect), it is not illegal.\<br>\<br>Perhaps you could post the paper trail on your own website (not<br>Facebook), appropriately redacted to remove personal information, so<br>that people who have doubts can see for themselves that you have indeed<br>used the money as you state you have.\<br>\<br>I know, you shouldn\'t have to do that. But in an informaton-driven<br>world, sometimes it\'s okay to fight misinformation with real<br>information.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
