<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>To be honest with you, I can't see how that would be "easier."<br><br>Think about what you're saying. You enlist in the Air Force, attend<br>Basic Training in Lackland, go to Tech School, serve three years as an<br>enlisted member so that you can show that you have what it takes to be<br>an Air Force officer so that you can be recommended by your chain of<br>command so that you can attend the Prep School so that you can enter the<br>Academy and take Basic Training all over again.<br><br>That doesn't sound very "easy" to me.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
