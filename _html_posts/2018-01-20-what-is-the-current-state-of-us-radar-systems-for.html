<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Radar is one component of our missile early warning system. It is used<br>along with infrared satellite-based sensors to form **dual<br>phenomenology** when identifying a launch event. We have PARCS radars<br>along both US coasts. A missile event is not fully reported until we<br>have dual phenomenology.<br><br>Raw radar data is literally useless until it is correlated at a<br>correlation center (like NORAD). Additionally, it rides on classified<br>point-to-point comm circuits, as missile launch events are classified<br>until the event is concluded, so raw radar data cannot be made public.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
