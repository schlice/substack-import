<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Why can you be impeached but not removed from office?<br><br>Impeachment can be roughly equated to an indictment in the legal system,<br>even though impeachment and removal from office are political actions,<br>not legal ones.<br><br>An impeachment simply says that the House found enough evidence to start<br>a "trial" in the Senate. The person must still be "convicted" in the<br>Senate in order to be removed from office.<br><br>In every other impeachment before Trump, a majority of Representatives<br>on both sides of the aisle found that there was evidence to proceed to<br>trial. In Trump's impeachment, not a single Republican voted to impeach.<br>Zero. This shows that this particular impeachment was 100% politically<br>motivated and did not actually have enough evidence to succeed on its<br>merits. Basically, it was dead on arrival at the Senate.<br><br>\<br><br>*For the time being, I have re-enabled comments on selected answers.<br>Some people like to comment. Some people like to engage with me in a<br>civil manner, and I did kinda miss that\...a little. But do not<br>misunderstand, I take this step very cautiously. My mental well-being<br>isn\'t worth your harassing, inane behavior. If you don\'t like what I<br>wrote, tough shit. If my answer is grammatically low-quality or is<br>un-cited opinion masquerading as fact, downvote it. If you think I\'m<br>wrong, write your own answer. But Quora is a question-and-answer site,<br>not a debate site. If you are simply commenting to tell me \"ackshually,<br>you\'re wrong,\" don\'t be surprised if I quietly delete your comment.<br>Put anything vaguely harassing in there, and your deletion will be<br>followed by a block and a mute, and a BNBR report. I will do this<br>immediately and with no compunction. You have been warned. Be nice.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
