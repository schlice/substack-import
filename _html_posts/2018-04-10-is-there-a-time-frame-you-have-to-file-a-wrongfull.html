It's called the *statute of<br>limitations*, and as I said, if you're wanting to sue the government,<br>not only are there very short statutes of limitations, but there are<br>steps you must follow before you can file, and if you don't, you lose<br>your standing to file. Just as an example, some cities require that you<br>file a notice of intent to sue within 30 days of the incident or you<br>lose your standing.<br><br>The laws and the statutes of limitations are different in every city, so<br>you must contact an attorney, and you must do so very quickly, or<br>you may miss your opportunity to file.<br><br>However, remember the elements required for wrongful death in almost<br>every jurisdiction:<br><br>- The death of a human being;<br>- Caused by another\'s negligence, or with intent to cause harm;<br>- The survival of family members who are suffering monetary injury as a<br>  result of the death, and;<br>- The appointment of a personal representative for the decedent\'s<br>  estate.\[1\](#SwzJf){#cite-SwzJf .citation_link}<br><br>These elements *must* be present in order to have standing to file. The<br>suit may only be brought by the personal representative for the<br>decedent's estate, which is why that element is required.<br><br>Negligence or intent to cause harm is also a required element.<br>Accidental injury does not rise to the level of wrongful death.<br>Negligence means that the person being sued *knew* the correct course of<br>action, and *willfully* chose to do something else. It is your burden to<br>prove that this happened with a preponderance of evidence, which means<br>that more than half of all of the evidence points to negligence or<br>intent to cause harm.<br><br>In any case, as everyone here has already said, you must contact an<br>attorney.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-SwzJf){.citation_index} [[Wrongful Death Overview -<br>FindLaw](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=1818ac&url=http://injury.findlaw.com/torts-and-personal-injuries/wrongful-death-overview.html){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="findlaw.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
