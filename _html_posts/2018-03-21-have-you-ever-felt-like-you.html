<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>If you've ever been to counseling, one of the key takeaways you learn is<br>that there is really no such thing as a soulmate. It's a pipe dream.<br>Everyone you meet has the capability of being someone "compatible" with<br>you, the question is of degree. "How" compatible someone may be is key.<br>Ideally, you want to start off with someone who is at least mostly<br>compatible, and work out the little differences later, with time.<br><br>The secret sauce of marriage: y*ou don't marry your soulmate.* You marry<br>someone whom you love deeply and with whom you want to spend the rest of<br>your life. Like new gears in a machine, there may be a few burrs and<br>rough edges that need to be smoothed down over time, but after a while,<br>*and with consistent effort*, those little rough edges will get<br>smoothed down and you will become *natural soulmates*.<br><br>You may not start off being able to complete your spouse's sentences,<br>but after a while, you will. You may not be able to walk into a store<br>and look at a rack of clothing and say, "my spouse would love that," but<br>over time, you will. You may not be able to walk into a store right away<br>and know what purchases you make that may upset your spouse, but as time<br>goes by, you will. Those things will come, over time.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
