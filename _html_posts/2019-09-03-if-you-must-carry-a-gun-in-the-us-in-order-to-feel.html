<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If you must carry a gun in the US in order to feel "safe," why would<br>you continue to live here, if you had the option of living in a country<br>where that type of armed vigilance is not only unnecessary, but a daily<br>waste of time and energy?**<br><br>I suppose that if the only reason you carried a gun was to "feel safe,"<br>you would probably want to move somewhere where you "felt more safe."<br>This only makes sense.<br><br>But your assertion that "vigilance is unnecessary and is a daily waste<br>of time" is foolhardy in any country. I can apply that statement to any<br>country in the world. Any. One. Name it, and I'll show you why vigilance<br>is not only necessary, but it is the one thing that will prevent you<br>from becoming a statistic.<br><br>The United States is unique in the world. People love to compare the<br>United States to places like Norway or even the UK, where it "seems"<br>like crime is less and no one needs to carry a gun. But any such<br>comparison is an apples and oranges comparison. Populations in those<br>countries are largely homogeneous, and it is a much smaller population<br>than the US. In the US, we have over 300 million people and the<br>population is an incredible mix of people from all over the world.<br>Additionally, the United States was created on a foundation of<br>*independence*, fierce independence and an attitude which states that I<br>can do anything I set my mind to, and I don't need anyone's help.<br><br>That attitude extends to my own defense (and the defense of others in my<br>care). In fact, in the United States, the Supreme Court has stated many<br>times that the police have no duty to protect you. The police cannot be<br>there to prevent all crime. They are not your personal bodyguards. Your<br>security is your responsibility, no one else.<br><br>Additionally, I would argue that *the gun creates a civilized society*.<br>Without the gun, I am at the mercy of those who are physically stronger<br>than me, younger than me, and who outnumber me. It is the tyranny of the<br>strong, the young, and the many. The gun is the only tool which can<br>equalize that *force inequality*. The gun is equally as effective in the<br>hands of an octogenarian as it is in the hands of a weightlifter. It is<br>the only tool which puts the old man on par with the young gangbanger.<br>It is the only tool which puts the young woman on par with her male<br>attacker. And it is the only tool which puts the gay man on par with the<br>car full of baseball-wielding drunk frat boys. When I carry a gun, I<br>cannot be forced to do anything. I can only be reasoned with.<br><br>To that end, I do not carry a gun because I am afraid. I carry a gun<br>because it allows me to be unafraid. I do not carry a gun because I want<br>confrontation. I carry a gun because I want to be left alone. Since the<br>gun removes force from the equation, left in its wake is only reason.<br>The most civilized society only employs reason, not force. Therefore,<br>*carrying a gun is the most civilized thing you can do.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
