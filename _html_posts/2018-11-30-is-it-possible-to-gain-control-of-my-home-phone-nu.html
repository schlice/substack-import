<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Is it possible to gain control of my home phone number? AT&T<br>disconnected it and will not port the number without my paying a \$99.00<br>\"installation fee\".**<br><br>In general, you must port your number while your line is still active.<br>Canceling your phone line service generally implies releasing control of<br>your number. You're probably out of luck on that number unless you<br>restart service with AT&T. Looks like it may be time for a new number.<br><br>In fact, for most carriers, the "port out" process cancels your line<br>automatically. So there is no need to cancel your line; when you port<br>out your number, your line cancels pretty much the same day as your port<br>out.<br><br>Be sure you record the day your carrier approved the port out so that<br>you can complain later when they continue to charge you for the line.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
