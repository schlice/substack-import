<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I recall answering this question once, but I can't seem to find it at<br>the moment. So I suppose I'll just answer it again.<br><br>Yes, a Homeowner's Association can indeed charge an owner for damage<br>done to common areas.<br><br>When homeowners use common areas, they accept liability for any damage<br>done during the time they are using that common area. So, for example,<br>let's assume you have a recreation room in your HOA (possibly in an<br>activity center). Let's also say you, as the homeowner, reserve the room<br>for a party. If the HOA comes in the next day and finds the room<br>damaged, they can charge the homeowner the cost to repair the room.<br>Presumably, the HOA also has cameras which have documented the damage<br>being done, but the HOA can hold the reserving homeowner responsible if<br>damage occurs during the time they have the room reserved.<br><br>For common areas where responsibility is less clear-cut, the HOA would<br>have a difficult time assigning liability to a particular homeowner<br>unless they have some form of evidence to show who damaged the area and<br>what damage was done.<br><br>Assuming the HOA has a reasonable basis to hold a homeowner liable for<br>damage, the HOA will most likely hire their own maintenance people to<br>repair the damage, the HOA will pay for the repairs, and the HOA will<br>add the cost to the homeowner's payment account (the same one where HOA<br>dues and fines go). This is the most common way for the HOA to address<br>the issue.<br><br>If you have been charged by the HOA for damage done to a common area,<br>and you are not necessarily liable for that damage, you should retain a<br>real estate attorney in your local area who specializes in HOA law to<br>help you work the issue with the HOA.<br><br>(EDIT) Additionally, if there is no one homeowner to whom fault can be<br>assigned, the HOA can pass the cost on to all of the homeowners,<br>assuming that the damage falls outside of the HOA's projections for<br>routine maintenance and upkeep of the facility. For example, if a water<br>line breaks and floods the common area, the HOA may have budgeted enough<br>for standard maintenance but not catastrophic loss, and they may have to<br>do a special assessment to collect the money to pay for the damages.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
