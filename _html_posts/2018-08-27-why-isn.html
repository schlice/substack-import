<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Why isn't pornstar Stormy Daniels being arrested for blackmail? If she<br>had sex with President Trump over 10 years ago, then threatened to<br>expose this encounter just because he was running for President, isn't<br>that a crime?**<br><br>It is blackmail when you demand money from someone in<br>exchange for either revealing or not revealing some injurious<br>information about that person.<br><br>It is not blackmail when the person *offers* to pay you so that you<br>maintain your silence. Hush money is not blackmail.<br><br>What generally happens in cases like this is a process called "catch and<br>kill." When word gets out that someone like Stormy Daniels has<br>information about an affair, a tabloid like the National Enquirer will<br>mysteriously get paid by some unknown entity, like a shell corporation.<br>The tabloid will then approach the person and buy the rights to her<br>story. That contract specifies that she cannot tell her story to anyone,<br>because the Enquirer owns the rights to that story. The Enquirer has no<br>intention of publishing the story. But they own the rights to it, so<br>they can publish it at any time, or even never publish it at all.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
