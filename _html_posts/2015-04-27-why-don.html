<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Believe it or not, America is probably one of the easiest<br>countries to naturalize into (even with all of our immigration<br>problems). It is not easy to naturalize into another country; most<br>countries\' immigration rules are far more strict than ours. It\'s not<br>as easy as telling someone, \"You don\'t like it here? Leave!\" Where<br>would they go? There really is no place in the world that is \"easy\" to<br>emigrate to.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
