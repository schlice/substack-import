<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Like [[Charles<br>Evans](https://www.quora.com/profile/Charles-Evans-14)]{.qlink_container}<br>said, it really depends on what your definition of \"common sense\" gun<br>control is.\<br>\<br>Libertarians fundamentally believe that all individuals are soverign<br>over their own lives, and \"no one should be forced to sacrifice his or<br>her values for the benefit of others.\"\<br>\<br>The Libertarian stance on gun control from the [[Libertarian<br>Party](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=22c013&url=http://www.lp.org){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="lp.org"}]{.qlink_container} website:\<br>\<br>]<br><br>> Libertarians, like other Americans, want to be able to walk city<br>> streets safely and be secure in their homes. We also want our<br>> Constitutional rights protected, to guard against the erosion of our<br>> civil liberties. In particular, Libertarians want to see all people<br>> treated equally under the law, as our Constitution requires.<br>> *America\'s millions of gun owners are people too.*\<br>> \<br><br>> Law-abiding, responsible citizens do not and should not need to ask<br>> anyone\'s permission or approval to engage in a peaceful activity.<br>> **Gun ownership, by itself, harms no other person and cannot morally<br>> justify criminal penalties.**\<br><br>\\...\\<br><br>> One of the most important protections we have against government<br>> tyranny is that we are presumed innocent of any crime until proven<br>> guilty, before a jury, in a proper trial.\<br>> \<br>> Gun control advocates would declare all gun owners guilty without<br>> trial, simply for owning guns, even though millions of them have never<br>> used their guns to harm another person. Such blanket condemnation is<br>> immoral, unfair and *contrary to the principles* on which America was<br>> founded.\<br><br>\\...\\<br><br>> **Libertarians agree with the majority of Americans who believe they<br>> have the right to decide how best to protect themselves, their<br>> families and their property.** Millions of Americans have guns in<br>> their homes and sleep more comfortably because of it. Studies show<br>> that where gun ownership is illegal, residential burglaries are<br>> higher. A man with a gun in his home is no threat to you if you<br>> aren\'t breaking into it.\<br>> \<br>> The police do not provide security in your home, your business or the<br>> street. They show up after the crime to take reports and do detective<br>> work. The poorer the neighborhood, the riskier it is for peaceful<br>> residents.\<br>> \<br>> Only an armed citizenry can be present in sufficient numbers to<br>> prevent or deter violent crime before it starts, or to reduce its<br>> spread. Interviews with convicted felons indicate that fear of the<br>> armed citizen significantly deters crime. A criminal is more likely to<br>> be driven off from a particular crime by an armed victim than to be<br>> convicted and imprisoned for it. Thus, widespread gun ownership will<br>> make neighborhoods safer.\<br>> \<br>> Foolish politicians and police now seek to ban semi-automatic<br>> \"assault rifles\". They ignore the fact that only honest citizens<br>> will comply; criminals will still have them. **Such a ban will only<br>> increase the criminals\' ability to victimize the innocent.**\<br><br>\\...\\<br><br>> Guns are not the problem. They are inanimate objects. Gun control<br>> advocates talk as if guns could act on their own, as if human beings<br>> cannot control them, so the uncontrollable guns must be banished.\<br>> \<br><br>> **Let us put the responsibility where it belongs, on the owner and<br>> user of the gun.** If he or she acts responsibly, without attacking<br>> others or causing injury negligently, no crime or harm has been done.<br>> Leave them in peace. But, if a person commits a crime with a gun, then<br>> impose the *severest penalties* for the injuries done to the victim.<br>> Similarly, hold the negligent gun user fully liable for all harm his<br>> negligence does to others.\<br>> \<br>> Rather than banning guns, the politicians and the police should<br>> encourage gun ownership, as well as education and training programs. A<br>> responsible, well-armed and trained citizenry is the best protection<br>> against domestic crime and the threat of foreign invasion. America\'s<br>> founders knew that. It is still true today.\<br><br>\<br>I think this says it all. Libertarians believe guns are not the problem.<br>Put the responsibility on the owner and user of the gun, not on the gun<br>itself. A gun is an inanimate object and by itself can\'t cause any harm<br>without an owner or a user interacting with it. Do not focus on the gun,<br>focus on the user of the gun. If someone has a gun and they hurt no one<br>with it, they have not committed a crime and they should not face any<br>penalty. But if someone commits a crime with a gun, the most severe<br>penalties available should be imposed.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
