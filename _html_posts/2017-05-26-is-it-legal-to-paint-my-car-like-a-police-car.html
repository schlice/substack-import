<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>In most jurisdictions it is legal to paint your car like a police car.<br>However, there are restrictions on flashing lights which vary by state.<br>Check your state's Vehicle and Traffic Law before you mount any flashing<br>lights on your car. You generally cannot have colored lights flashing on<br>your car, with the exception of white or orange (for slow-moving or<br>frequently stopping vehicles).<br><br>It would be *illegal* to attempt to exercise any police powers. If you<br>pulled a car over, you would be guilty of the offense of "impersonating<br>a police officer," and police officers do not take kindly to that<br>offense.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
