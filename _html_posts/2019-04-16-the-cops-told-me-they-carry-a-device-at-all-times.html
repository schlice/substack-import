<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**The cops told me they carry a device at all times that can hack into<br>your phone from a good distance away and be able to acesse my call\'s,<br>text\'s, photos and web search history when ever they want. Is this<br>true?**<br><br>I'll never say never, but this one is a pretty safe bet that it's<br>untrue. That technology simply doesn't exist.<br><br>There is a technique called "bluesnarfing," which allows a user to<br>remotely pair to your phone and download contacts but that only works on<br>much older versions of Bluetooth with certain security vulnerabilities.<br>None of today's modern phones are susceptible to being bluesnarfed.<br><br>There is also a similar technique called "bluesniping," wherein a<br>directional antenna and a small Linux embedded OS system are mounted on<br>a rifle stock. Bluesniping, with its highly directional antenna, was<br>said to work at over a mile away, far beyond the 10 meters that a normal<br>Bluetooth connection was capable of using.<br><br>Again, all of these techniques take advantage of security flaws in<br>Bluetooth technology that were patched years ago. The last time<br>bluesnarfing and bluesniping were showcased was 2004.<br><br>But even despite the technology, the law hasn't changed. Is it possible<br>that the police have some undisclosed vulnerability that they have<br>weaponized into a new bluesniping rig? Sure, it's possible. But to what<br>end? They can't use any of the information they steal in court, as it<br>was obtained illegally, through hacking. So even if they could hack into<br>your phone and get your calls, SMS messages, photos and web search<br>history, what are they going to do with it? Legally, there is absolutely<br>nothing they can do with it.<br><br>If they do have a warrant, they won't use bluesniping. They will go to<br>your carrier who will give them your call logs and SMS history. They may<br>also have records of your mobile data usage, including web searches, but<br>again, that's all with a warrant.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
