<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Would changing my phone battery improve my phone\'s performance<br>(Samsung S6)?**<br><br>You quoted an article about the iPhone and you're asking about the S6.<br><br>Apple *deliberately* reduced the iPhone's processor's speed in order to<br>prevent unintended shutdowns caused by batteries which have lost much of<br>their useful life. They only did this on devices with older batteries. A<br>battery replacement would reset this feature, and the processor would<br>run at full speed again.<br><br>*Samsung has not done this*.<br><br>So if you think that your S6 is slow because Samsung was deliberately<br>slowing down the processor to prevent unintended shutdowns, and that<br>getting a new battery will speed up the phone again, this is incorrect.<br><br>Your phone is slow because it is not designed to run the operating<br>system which is running on it. There's a fair chance you're running<br>Android version 6 or possibly 7, and when that phone was released, it<br>was released with Android version 5. The hardware just has a difficult<br>time keeping up with everything you're asking it to do.<br><br>About this, there is not much you can do but upgrade your hardware. If<br>you're a serious techie, you could root the device and install a<br>different OS (I would suggest<br>[LineageOS(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=395593&url=https://lineageos.org/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="lineageos.org"}]{.qlink_container}, which is the<br>currently-maintained fork of the now discontinued CyanogenMod). The S6<br>is well past any warranties you may have, so there's no risk in voiding<br>a warranty by rooting and installing a custom OS.<br><br>So you have two really viable choices: root the device and install a new<br>OS, or upgrade your hardware.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
