<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**About how much time should someone be expecting when they go to court<br>for being charged with possession of a weapon + ammunition while being a<br>felon?**<br><br>The answer, as with any legal answer, is "it depends."<br><br>Each state has different sentencing guidelines, and they're built in to<br>every statute in every state. In general, most states will sentence<br>anywhere from two to ten years for felon in possession. However, because<br>the defendant is a prior felon, punishments tend to be on the higher<br>side than other similar crimes. Some states will "enhance" a punishment<br>at final conviction, other states will deny probation. Still other<br>states will enhance a punishment if the defendant not only possessed a<br>gun, but attempted (or succeeded) in using the gun in some potentially<br>dangerous way.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
