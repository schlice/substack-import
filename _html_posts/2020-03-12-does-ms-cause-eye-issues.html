<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Indeed, one of the most common eye issues associated with MS, oftentimes<br>the very first symptom of the disease (and my first symptom,<br>incidentally) is called retrobulbar optic neuritis, or just optic<br>neuritis (ON).<br><br>ON is a condition caused by swelling in the optic nerve just behind the<br>eyeball. It is characterized by vision changes (blurry vision, visual<br>auras such as sparkles or stars, dim vision, or changes in color vision)<br>and pain while looking away from center. It usually occurs in just one<br>eye. ON, while potentially frightening, does generally resolve on its<br>own. In some cases, it can leave some residual effects, and some can<br>worsen in the heat (cool off the body to get them to return to normal).<br><br>Other vision issues which are less common with MS are nystagmus<br>(uncontrolled eye movements) and diplopia (double vision).<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*This answer is not professional medical advice**, nor is it a<br>substitute for professional medical advice.
