<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Before we can answer that question, we must discuss what a miracle is.<br><br>But before we can answer *that* question, we must discuss how God chose<br>to deliver His Word.<br><br>*(I apologize for the length of this answer, but the background is<br>exceedingly important to detail up front in order to fully grasp the<br>argument)*<br><br>\<br><br>We are all aware that God has communicated to us through His creation as<br>well as through our morality/conscience through what we call *general<br>revelation*. This informs us that He exists, and gives us basic ideas<br>about His existence, power, and moral requirements.<br><br>But how can He give us more details about Himself so that we can<br>understand His ultimate purpose for us?<br><br>He can't do face-to-face conversations, as His power would be so<br>awe-inspiring and overwhelming as to override our free will and coerce<br>us to love Him and believe in Him. He does not desire that.<br><br>So how else could He have given us information about Himself? Perhaps<br>God has manifested Himself in some way to a select group of people over<br>many centuries and inspired them to write down what they witnessed and<br>heard from Him. Written language is a precise medium of communication<br>that can easily be duplicated and passed on to succeeding generations,<br>yet it also can be easily ignored by those who freely decide that they<br>don't want to be bothered with God. So a book would work as a valid but<br>not overpowering means of communication from God. This fits with God<br>being able to deliver a concise message but still allow people the free<br>will to accept or reject it.<br><br>But whose book? Has God communicated through the book of the Jews, the<br>book of the Christians, or the book of the Muslims? How are we supposed<br>to tell whose book, if any, is really a message from God?<br><br>In the days before mass communications, kings would *authenticate* their<br>messages with a seal. The king would place a dollop of hot wax on<br>the scroll with his message, and he would press his seal into it. This<br>seal would be a sign to the recipient of the message that the message<br>was authentic---it really came from the king and not from someone just<br>posing as the king. Of course to make this system work, the seal needed<br>to be unusual or unique, easily recognizable, and it had to be something<br>only the king possessed.<br><br>So how did God authenticate His message?<br><br>Miracles.<br><br>Miracles are unusual and unique, easily recognizable, and only God can<br>do them. Even atheists, by demanding a sign from God, are implicitly<br>admitting that miracles would prove His existence.<br><br>Miracles are, by definition, a special act of God that interrupts the<br>normal course of events. Atheist Antony Flew put it well: "A miracle is<br>something which would never have happened had nature, as it were, been<br>left to its own devices." If God actually works in this way, then a<br>miracle confirms the message and the sign confirms the sermon. Or, to<br>put it another way, a miracle is an act of God to confirm the word of<br>God through a messenger of God.<br><br>So is the beginning of the universe a miracle? The outspoken atheist<br>David Hume said the following about why you shouldn't believe in<br>miracles, and his definition explains why he would not consider the Big<br>Bang a believable miracle:<br><br>1.  Natural law is by definition a description of a regular occurrence.<br>2.  A miracle is by definition a rare occurrence.<br>3.  The evidence for the regular is always greater than that for the<br>    rare.<br>4.  A wise man always bases his belief on the greater evidence.<br>5.  Therefore, a wise man should never believe in miracles.<br><br>If those first four premises are true, then the wise man should never<br>believe in miracles. *But are they true?* Not necessarily. Premise 3 is<br>not necessarily true. Here's some examples:<br><br>1.  The origin of life happened only once. It was a rare,<br>    unrepeatable event, yet every naturalist believes that life arose<br>    spontaneously from non-life somewhere on the earth or elsewhere in<br>    the universe.<br>2.  The origin of new life forms also happened only once. Those<br>    rare, unrepeatable events are nevertheless dogmatically believed by<br>    most naturalists, who say it all happened by unobserved (i.e., rare)<br>    macroevolutionary processes.<br>3.  In fact, **the entire history of the world is comprised of rare,<br>    unrepeatable events.** For example, David Hume's own birth happened<br>    only once, but he had no trouble believing it occurred!<br><br>In every one of those counterexamples, Hume's third premise must be<br>considered false. Therefore, Hume must disbelieve his own premise about<br>the origin of life and the origin of new life forms. He must also<br>disbelieve his own birth!<br><br>So the issue is not whether an event is regular or rare. The issue is<br>whether we have good evidence for the event. We must *weigh*<br>evidence for the event in question, not *add* evidence for all previous<br>events.<br><br>But as you rightly noted, atheists do not want to deal directly with the<br>flaws in Hume's argument, which tells us that their disbelief in<br>miracles is probably more a matter of the will than of the mind. It<br>seems as though some people uncritically cling to David Hume's argument<br>because they simply don't want to admit that God exists.<br><br>*But since we know that God exists, miracles are possible. Any argument<br>against miracles that can be concocted, including that of David Hume, is<br>destroyed by that one fact.* For if there is a God who can act, there<br>can be acts of God (miracles).<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
