<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Is pre-existing condition the cause of Republicans damning ACA,<br>ObamaCare? Are they being thoughtful to American needs or just trying to<br>undo Obama policies?**<br><br>Close. The real reason Republicans didn't like ACA was the pre-existing<br>condition's requirement: the individual mandate.<br><br>Mostly however, it's a Democrat talking point. Every plan Republicans<br>brought forward to replace ACA with, even before ACA was passed,<br>protected pre-existing conditions. Every single one. Not a single<br>Republican has ever talked about denying coverage to anyone with<br>pre-existing conditions.<br><br>However, actions speak louder than words. It is true that many<br>Republican-proposed plans in the past had "holes" where their<br>protections were not nearly as strong as ACA.<br><br>The reason? **ACA could force pre-existing condition coverage because of<br>the individual mandate.**<br><br>In other words, in order to force insurance companies to pay for all<br>pre-existing conditions, there has to be a way to pay for it. ACA did it<br>with the individual mandate. Since Republican plans did not have an<br>individual mandate, their plans may have had sliding scale deductibles,<br>or loopholes like insurance plans could deny coverage for specific<br>conditions if they couldn't deliver services adequately. This means they<br>could still offer coverage, but they could deny individual services<br>because they couldn't adequately deliver them. Ergo, Republicans want to<br>deny you coverage for pre-existing conditions. Not exactly true, but not<br>exactly untrue either. A perfect talking point.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
