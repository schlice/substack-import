title: '"In Eccl 3:19, Solomon discusses the commonality of death. Before Jesus, the
  idea of a resurrection was little known, yet a measure of stability existed under
  Pax Romana. What motivational need would have been served by promoting a false resurrection?"'

<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>None. There is no motivation whatsoever to promote a false<br>resurrection. Because if the Resurrection never happened, Christianity<br>falls like a house of cards, or a house built on sand. The Resurrection<br>is the bedrock upon which Christianity is built.<br><br>The Resurrection is the central event in Christianity. As Paul wrote:<br><br>> *And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile and you are<br>> still in your sins. \-- 1 Cor 15:17 ESV*<br><br>If the Resurrection were a false story, then the New Testament writers<br>certainly would have made them longer and would have added more detail.<br>They probably would have also said that they *personally* witnessed<br>Jesus physically rising from the dead. Instead, they get to the tomb<br>after He had risen, and they made no attempt to embellish their<br>discovery with flowing descriptions or any other sorts of miracles.<br>Matthew, Mark, and Luke don't even say anything about what the<br>Resurrection means to believers, and John reports that meaning in just<br>one sentence (John 20:31).<br><br>That point, the point about the Gospel writers *not* detailing the<br>theological implications of the Resurrection, deserves attention. It<br>indicates that they were concerned about getting the history<br>correct, not "inventing" a new theology.<br><br>New Testament scholar N. T. Wright makes the astute observation that<br>"neither 'going to heaven when you die', 'life after death', 'eternal<br>life', nor even 'the resurrection of all Christ's people', is so much as<br>mentioned in the four canonical resurrection stories. If Matthew, Mark,<br>Luke and John wanted to tell stories whose import was 'Jesus is risen,<br>therefore you will be too', they have done a remarkably bad job of<br>it."\[1\](#jbTmL){#cite-jbTmL .citation_link}<br><br>I tend to agree. If you go to most evangelical church services today,<br>the constant emphasis is "believe in Jesus to be saved." That notion is<br>certainly *taught* in the New Testament, but it is barely mentioned in<br>the Gospels, because the Gospel writers were writing *history*, not<br>*theology*. Certainly, the history has dramatic implications for the<br>theology, but those implications are explored elsewhere, in other New<br>Testament writings (and the Christian church primarily includes Paul's<br>letters to do that).<br><br>It would have been easy for the Gospel writers to detail the theological<br>implications of every historical event, but they didn't. They were<br>eyewitnesses who were writing *history*.<br><br>\<br><br>Additionally, if the Resurrection never happened, and the writers<br>weren't trying to build a new religion, but instead were merely<br>recording history as we just detailed, what could the Gospel writers<br>hope to personally gain by promoting it? What did they personally gain?<br>History tells us that they didn't gain fame or notoriety. They gained<br>persecution, torture, and death. Or at least the threat of death. They<br>were hunted down by the Romans and the Jews. They tried to kill John a<br>number of times but when they found him to be surprisingly resilient,<br>they simply exiled him to the island of Patmos for the remainder of his<br>days. Clearly, if the Resurrection wasn't true, then the writers'<br>adherence to the story makes no sense.<br><br>In other words, people might die for a lie they believe is the truth,<br>but no one dies for a lie they know is a lie. The apostle's willingness<br>to die to promote the Resurrection story can only be adequately<br>explained if they truly believed the story themselves. This lends<br>credence to the fact that, at the very least, *they* believed the<br>Resurrection actually happened.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-jbTmL){.citation_index} [[The Resurrection of the Son of<br>God (Christian Origins and the Question of God, Vol. 3): Wright, N.
