<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Everyone is mad at Starbucks, but what about the police? Did procedure<br>actually require an arrest? Couldn\'t they have just said, \"Get lost\"?<br>How, and why, did it end in handcuffs?**<br><br>In case you didn't know, the police don't just wander around looking for<br>random people to arrest.<br><br>The only reason they were present at that Starbuck's was because the<br>manager called them and reported two people trespassing.<br><br>The scenario played out like this:<br><br>- Two men sitting in a Starbuck's, not ordering anything, not using the<br>  Wi-Fi, etc. Just taking up space for paying customers.<br>- Manager asks them to order something or leave. They refuse.<br>- Manager calls the police and reports two men trespassing (refusing to<br>  leave).<br>- Police arrive. Police request the two leave voluntarily (in other<br>  words, police told them to "get lost.") They again refuse.<br>- Police forcibly remove the violators from the premises, and they each<br>  receive a shiny new pair of silver bracelets for their trouble.<br><br>Remember: Starbuck's is not public property. Starbuck's is a **private<br>establishment which is open to the public.** Owners (or owners'<br>representatives) can ask patrons to leave at any time for any<br>non-protected reason. In this case, the two didn't order anything and<br>were simply taking up prime real estate reserved for paying customers.<br>You can stay in Starbuck's to use the Wi-Fi for as long as you like, but<br>generally they want you to buy something. It's how they make money. So<br>buy a cup of coffee and then stay as long as you want.<br><br>But not buying anything and not leaving is not good for business.<br>Managers can ask anyone to leave in such a scenario.<br><br>Once you are asked by management to leave and you refuse, *you are<br>trespassing*. And as in this scenario, the police can be called to<br>remove you from the premises when you refuse.<br><br>The police simply enforced the wishes of the store manager. Do you think<br>it would have been more right for the police to say, "Well, we think<br>you're a racist, so we're not going to enforce the law today"? This<br>likely would have been worse, and it's not the police's job to determine<br>whether or not the manager is a racist. It's the police's job to enforce<br>the law.<br><br>The men can sue if they think their civil rights were violated by<br>Starbuck's. In fact, they probably will. We'll see how that turns out.<br><br>(EDIT) I think, after re-reading the question, the OP was asking if the<br>police could have refused to do anything at all. Perhaps the police<br>could have told the manager to "get lost," is perhaps what the OP was<br>asking.<br><br>What you're talking about is what's known as "discretion." I could<br>imagine a police officer at a lunch table taking a complaint between two<br>diners, with one saying, "He stole my fruit cup! I want him arrested for<br>theft!" In that scenario, could the police arrest the thief for petty<br>theft? Probably not, because the dollar value is too low. More likely,<br>the police will ask the two to work it out instead of resorting to law<br>enforcement to handle all interpersonal issues. That's a simple example<br>of discretion in enforcement. Another example would be a police officer<br>issuing a warning instead of a ticket to a driver who is compliant and<br>respectful, who admitted his driving error, and who otherwise has a<br>clean driving record.<br><br>So what about this scenario? Could the police simply have refused to<br>enforce the law here? Couldn't they have used "discretion" and told the<br>manager that the charge was silly and possibly racially-motivated? The<br>short answer here is no, the police probably could not have used<br>discretion in this case. The reason is that *the complaint was brought<br>by a third party, not by the police themselves.* If you have a<br>complainant who is willing to press charges, the police have a duty to<br>complete the processing of the charge if probable cause is found that a<br>law was violated. The police could have tried to convince the<br>complainant to drop the charge, but why would they? The complainant is a<br>business manager who is trying to run a business. Why would the police<br>tell that person to not press charges? They don't want the paperwork?<br>There's no real valid reason for the police to attempt to tell a private<br>citizen that they should not seek to enforce the laws already on the<br>books.<br><br>In this case, the manager called the police because of trespassers<br>(persons who refuse to leave and refuse to buy anything). You have a<br>complainant pressing charges, and upon further investigation, you have<br>suspects who are actively refusing to comply with the directives of the<br>management and the directives of law enforcement. The police, in this<br>case, have a duty to enforce the law.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
