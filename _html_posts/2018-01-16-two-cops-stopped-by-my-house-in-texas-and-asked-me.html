<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The answer to any legal question is "it depends."<br><br>What kind of "friendly questions" were these? Did they want to know what<br>kind of music you like, or your favorite movie this year? Or did they<br>want to know whether or not you heard anything suspicious at your<br>neighbor's house last night? Or worse, where you were last night?<br><br>It really depends on the question.<br><br>Cops don't generally have the cycles to just randomly pop by someone's<br>house and ask random questions without a reason. They were likely<br>investigating an incident in the area and they were asking some general<br>questions to see if you needed to be investigated further.<br><br>You'll know soon enough whether or not you were selected for additional<br>screening.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
