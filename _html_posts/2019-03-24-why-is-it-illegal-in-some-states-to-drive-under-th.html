<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Why is it illegal in some states to drive under the influence of<br>marijuana,**<br><br>It's illegal in every state to drive impaired. The *source* of the<br>impairment is irrelevant, whether it be from alcohol, prescription<br>medication, sleeping pills, NyQuilâ„¢, or anything else you ingest that<br>may impair motor function.<br><br>yet I can\'t find any proof that it impairs driving?<br><br>The proof is in the pudding, as they say.<br><br>A charge of impaired driving starts with a law enforcement officer<br>observing behavior which may indicate a driver who is under the<br>influence of a substance which impairs motor function. The officer stops<br>the vehicle and performs some roadside tests which demonstrate the<br>driver's ability to function. This *body of evidence* is then used to<br>make a determination as to whether or not the driver is impaired.<br><br>The truth is we don't have to know exactly what substance is impairing<br>the driver. We don't have to know how much of the substance was<br>ingested. There doesn't need to be a Breathalyzer test to determine how<br>much THC is present in the bloodstream. Impaired driving is a traffic<br>infraction wherein the driver is impaired by an ingested substance which<br>so affects motor function that driving a car becomes unsafe. It is a<br>*subjective* charge made by the officer.<br><br>**TL;DR: The substance itself doesn't determine whether or not you can<br>be charged with driving under the influence. The driver's motor<br>functions do.**<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
