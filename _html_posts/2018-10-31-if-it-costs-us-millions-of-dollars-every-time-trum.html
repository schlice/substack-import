How can he campaign<br>on U.S. tax money?**<br><br>Some of the costs of any president's political campaign travel (not just<br>Trump) is paid by the taxpayer. For example, Secret Service details<br>guard the president 24x7, regardless of where he is. This is true<br>whether he's visiting Pittsburgh for a funeral, traveling to a campaign<br>rally, or going on vacation. This is just one of the costs we as<br>taxpayers bear to protect the president, regardless of what he's doing<br>or where he goes.<br><br>But some other costs when campaigning, like the cost to run Air Force<br>One, are not paid for by taxpayers. Federal law requires that campaign<br>travel is reimbursed by the campaign. In Trump's case, the RNC pays for<br>that portion of his travel. In the most recently available figures, it<br>costs approximately \$180,118 per flight hour for Air Force One, which<br>includes everything needed (spare parts, food, fuel, etc). The campaign<br>pays for that.<br><br>If someone flies on AF1 with the president while campaigning (like when<br>Hillary Clinton flew with Obama while she was campaigning), they don't<br>get a free ride. A formula is used to compute what they pay, and it is<br>relative to what it would likely cost for a commercial first-class<br>ticket\[1\](#ejDWk){#cite-ejDWk .citation_link}, and the campaign<br>similarly pays for that.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-ejDWk){.citation_index} [[Who Pays When the President<br>Travels for Campaign<br>Events?](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=5492cc&url=https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/pays-president-travels-campaign-events/story?id%3D40361545){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="go.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
