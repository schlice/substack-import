<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Yes, the church can prevent non-Christians from entering the<br>building.**<br><br>While anti-discrimination laws apply to businesses, religious gatherings<br>are specifically exempted from anti-discrimination laws which prevent<br>discrimination based on "creed" or "religion". You wanted a separation<br>between church and state, so great, the church won't influence the<br>government. But that works both ways: the government cannot interfere<br>with how a religious organization operates.<br><br>Additionally, churches are private property, and can control who enters<br>and who does not, so long as they do not bar entry for *any other<br>non-religious* *protected reason* (race, color, country of origin, etc).<br><br>Even if the church is using public property, like a public school on<br>the weekend, during the time that the church is using the property,<br>church rules apply, not government rules. Churches can keep<br>non-Christians out if they so choose.<br><br>\<br><br>*But why would they?*<br><br>The whole point of church is to get more people to *become* Christian.<br>Yes, the church also ministers to believers, but they similarly minister<br>to *unbelievers* as well. Most churches of which I am aware actually<br>*welcome* those who do not believe. Heck, come on in, have a free donut<br>and some coffee, listen to some good live music, and hear a message<br>which, even if you don't believe the Christianity of the message,<br>probably still has some beneficial themes and points. We encourage<br>non-believers to come in, ask questions (even the hard ones), and enjoy<br>our hospitality.<br><br>TL;DR: They *can*, but they *shouldn't.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
