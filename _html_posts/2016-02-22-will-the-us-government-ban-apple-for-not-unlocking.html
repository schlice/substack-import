<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>First, I don\'t know what you mean by \"banning\" Apple. You mean<br>banning them from selling anything in the United States? I can\'t see<br>that happening.<br><br>*If* Apple refuses to comply with the order or states that they<br>physically cannot bypass security without wiping the phone, and *if*<br>the court finds that Apple can do such a thing (I have no idea how the<br>court would find thusly, but hey, it\'s my hypothetical), they could<br>find Apple in contempt of court and fine the company. There could be<br>other legal consequences.<br><br>However, I suspect that Apple will state that regardless of what other<br>execs may have said, it is technically infeasible to do what it is that<br>the government is asking, and they will have to leave it there.<br><br>It\'s unfortunate that Tim Cook had to stir up such a brouhaha over<br>nothing, but I think it will just come down to Apple saying, \"we can\'t<br>do it.\"<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
