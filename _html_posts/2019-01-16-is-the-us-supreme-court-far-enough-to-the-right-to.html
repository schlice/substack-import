<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Is the US Supreme Court far enough to the right to allow mandatory<br>teaching of the Bible in public schools?**<br><br>The Supreme Court is not "left" or "right." They either are "strict<br>constructionists." wherein they interpret laws against the text of the<br>Constitution and its understanding at the time it was written, or they<br>are "living Constitutionalists," wherein the interpretation of the<br>Constitution changes with the times, since the Constitution is too<br>inflexible to change appropriately. It just so happens that those who<br>believe in the strict construction of the Constitution happen to be more<br>conservative in their views, and those who believe in the "living<br>Constitution" view tend to be more liberal in their views.<br><br>The problem that teaching the Bible presents is one of "separation of<br>church and state." It would be very difficult to teach the Bible without<br>it appearing that the state is sanctioning or endorsing a religion, in<br>violation of the First Amendment. I don't think that a state can<br>effectively teach the Bible without giving the appearance of state<br>sponsorship. Even if, as this Florida legislator would mandate, they<br>\"follow all state and federal laws and guidelines in maintaining<br>religious neutrality and accommodating the diverse religious views,<br>traditions, and perspectives of all students in the school.\" They may<br>do that, but they're still teaching the Bible, and that is the religious<br>text for only a few religions, but primarily Christian and Jewish<br>religions.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
