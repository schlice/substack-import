It<br>doesn\'t seem like there would be much reason to do this.\<br>\<br>Now: what motivation would the teller have for telling? On the surface,<br>it would seem the teller is trying to protect you. But is she really?<br>Does she have an ulterior motive? Does that person want your bf for<br>herself? Is she trying to drive a wedge in between you and your bf? Is<br>she trying to make trouble?\<br>\<br>It seems to me that out of the two motivations we listed, the teller<br>trying to make trouble seems more likely.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
