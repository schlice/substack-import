<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Because you weren't carrying a copy of her signed **Durable Medical<br>Power of Attorney**.<br><br>I'm assuming that because you said "partner" that you're not married.<br>It's an assumption. If it's wrong, you can edit your question's details.<br><br>You can only accompany your spouse (whatever spousal arrangements are<br>legal in your state), or the person for whom you have been<br>pre-authorized to make medical decisions. Any partners can make medical<br>decisions for any other partners, married or not. You simply must have a<br>Durable Medical Power of Attorney signed by your partner, and you<br>have to be able to produce that document.<br><br>Of course, if she is conscious, she can make her own medical decisions,<br>power of attorney or not.<br><br>*(Note that I am not a lawyer and I am not giving you binding legal<br>advice; depending on what state you live in, the rules may be<br>different).*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
