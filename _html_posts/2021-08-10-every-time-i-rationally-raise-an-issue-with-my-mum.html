<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>First, tell me where you got your magical powers of mind control which<br>are so powerful that you can make someone do or think something they<br>don't want to do or think. You are quite the wizard!<br><br>But that slight bit of hyperbole should illuminate my point: **you don't<br>actually *make* anyone else do anything or think anything**. You<br>have no control over your mother. Unless you're actively trying to<br>coerce her into doing your bidding which is invoking a nascent tendency<br>towards suicide, then how she reacts is her problem, not yours. You have<br>needs, and being able to discuss those needs is critical.<br><br>If your mother cannot discuss your needs in a rational manner without<br>feeling like she wants to commit suicide, she needs help. And if she<br>would *like* you to consult with her before you start making decisions<br>on your own, without her input whatsoever, then she had better think<br>about getting herself some help to control her suicidal tendencies.<br><br>You asking this question tells me that *you need her*, not just for<br>someone to bounce ideas off of, but as someone whose judgement you<br>respect, and likely because you love her, too, and you want what's best<br>for her.<br><br>Remind her that you do not control her, she controls her, and she needs<br>to get those issues taken care of so that you can talk to her.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Every time I (rationally) raise an issue with my mum she plays the<br>victim and tells me that I make her suicidal. It's so upsetting. How<br>should I react?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
