<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I've been on Gilenya for 15 months. I have had no new lesions, and no<br>active lesions on any scan I've had during that time. I haven't<br>experienced any of the episodes of muscle weakness that caused me to<br>switch off of Copaxone after 7 years.<br><br>I have had my fair share of side effects, but they are side effects of<br>being on an immunosuppressant therapy. I used to get frequent sinus<br>infections as a kid. I was mostly past that as an adult. Within five<br>days of starting Gilenya, I got a sinus infection. It took the entire<br>course of antibiotics to knock it down. Within three months, I got a<br>second, and it took two full courses of antibiotics to get rid of it. So<br>I have to take extra medication (antihistamines and decongestants) daily<br>to try to stay ahead of that. It works, but it's just more pills. I also<br>take an extra 1000 mg of Vitamin C along with my daily multivitamin,<br>also for the immune-boosting effects.<br><br>I'm also on Vitamin D therapy because my vitamin D levels are<br>chronically low, and I have to take 5000 IUs a day to keep them in<br>check.<br><br>I also take krill oil (instead of fish oil) to get my Omega-3's for the<br>day.<br><br>I also take flaxseed oil because I have high triglycerides, probably<br>also caused by the medications, but none of them are specifically<br>indicated as medications that increase triglycerides, so no one is<br>really sure about that one.<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-2b6e55163d01467edce8540fcd32c2f6){.portrait .qtext_image<br>.zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-2b6e55163d01467edce8540fcd32c2f6" master_w="485"<br>master_h="862"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>Taste the rainbow!<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
