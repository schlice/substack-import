<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Because the government has given them the idea that you can mask and<br>vaccinate your way out the pandemic.<br><br>You cannot.<br><br>Masks do not prevent infection. One CNN commentator said masks are just<br>"facial decoration," with which I totally agree.<br><br>Vaccines only help *you* avoid the worst outcomes of the virus, but<br>vaccinated people can still catch the virus, and can still spread the<br>virus. Vaccines don't slow the spread of the virus, especially today<br>with far more transmissible strains out there.<br><br>But in an effort to "do" something, some states believe that you can<br>lockdown your way out of the pandemic. They believe you can mask and<br>vaccinate your way out of the pandemic. So they do what their<br>population, in general, thinks will be best.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Why are American states instituting ludicrous mask and vaccine mandates?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
