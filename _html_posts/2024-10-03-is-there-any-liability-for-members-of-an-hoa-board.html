<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>In any corporation, while there is a fiduciary responsibility to do<br>what's best for the corporation, there is no liability if you do your<br>job, but just do it poorly. This holds true for the smallest HOA Board<br>of Directors all the way up to the President of the United States.<br><br>Liability attaches if you *intentionally* or *unintentionally fail to do<br>your job as it is written.*<br><br>But if you do your job and it doesn't turn out as you planned, or even<br>if you did your job but you made poor decisions, that doesn't rise to<br>the level of legal liability, unless your conduct was so egregious such<br>that a reasonable person in the same situation would never have made the<br>decisions you did.<br><br>In almost every case, Board members on HOA Boards are covered by<br>Director and Officer (D&O) insurance, providing liability coverage when<br>you do your job but legal actions are raised against you.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
