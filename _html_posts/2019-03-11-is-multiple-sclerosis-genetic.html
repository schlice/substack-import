<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Is multiple sclerosis genetic?<br><br>Not 100% genetic, but there is a genetic component to it.<br><br>Statistics show that the chance of the average person in the United<br>States developing MS is about 1 in 750. But close (first-degree)<br>relatives of people with MS, such as children, siblings or non-identical<br>twins, have a higher chance, anywhere from one in 100 to one in 40.<br>It\'s not all genetic, though, and you can see this through the<br>\"identical twin\" example. If one identical twin has MS, the other twin<br>(who has the identical gene structure as the twin) has only a 1 in 4<br>chance of developing MS. If it were all genetic, the unaffected twin<br>would have a 100% chance of developing MS instead of the 25% chance they<br>exhibit today.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
