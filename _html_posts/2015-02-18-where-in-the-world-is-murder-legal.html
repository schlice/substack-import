<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [State-sanctioned killing is called \"execution\" and is a<br>punishment handed down through the legal system. Some countries still<br>have executions; most have gotten rid of executions as a form of<br>punishment.\<br>\<br>There are \"justifiable homicides\" which are common in many places<br>throughout the world, but that\'s a decision that is made by a court.<br>There may be killings that are \"allowed\" through religious or cultural<br>rules in some parts of the world, but again, that\'s a decision reached<br>through a religious or cultural inquiry.\<br>\<br>But as a broad brush statement, murder isn\'t really legal<br>anywhere.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
