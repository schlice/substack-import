<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>No. Murder is illegal in all 50 states.<br><br>But it's going to be important here to define what constitutes murder,<br>since you asked the question.<br><br>In common legal parlance (and still active in federal law), **murder is<br>the unlawful killing of a human being with malice aforethought.**<br><br>So let's unpack this:<br><br>- unlawful: this implies that some killing is lawful. For example,<br>  when the state executes someone who has been duly convicted of a crime<br>  and sentenced by a competent jury to death.<br>- killing: this means your actions directly caused a death.<br>- human being: you can't murder a dog.<br>- malice aforethought: ah, that classic turn of phrase that really<br>  trips everyone up. Let's dig into that one.<br><br>"Malice aforethought" is the mental state (also known as the *mens rea*)<br>required to prove first degree murder in federal law and in some states.<br>Generally, a killing doesn't qualify as murder in the first degree<br>unless it is done after premeditation and deliberation. So a killing in<br>the heat of passion would not qualify.<br><br>Most states have abandoned the "malice aforethought" language, and<br>instead have adopted language which is more precise that "malice." Most<br>have adopted language which refers to intent and premeditation.<br><br>So can you get away with gun murder? If you're not caught.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Can you actually get away with gun murder in some states?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
