<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Finally, an easy question today!<br><br>Here's your answer:<br><br>While you're in there, use a temporary deadbolt. Here's an example from<br>Amazon:<br><br>[https://www.amazon.com/Portable-\...(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=0249ec&url=https://www.amazon.com/Portable-Security-Additional-Traveling-Apartment/dp/B094V74XM7){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="amazon.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>You're going to get an earful when someone tries to barge in to your<br>room. When they realize that you can lock yourself in, maybe you can<br>have a real discussion with them about setting boundaries.<br><br>Now, when you're outside of your bedroom, that's a different story. If<br>it's not your house (and if you're not sharing an apartment with<br>others), I'm not sure you can stop anyone going in to your room; that's<br>just something you're going to have to live with until you leave home.<br>Best not to leave anything lying about that would be incriminating.<br>Basically, "sanitize" the room so that you either lock up (inside of<br>your room) or bring with you anything you don't want anyone else to see.<br><br>I assumed that you are still below the age where you are renting an<br>apartment; in other words, I assumed that you are still a child living<br>at home. However, it may be that you are renting an apartment with<br>others and you have shared space and private space. If you are, you are<br>absolutely able to have completely private space. In that case, you<br>should change the door knob to one with a better lock that actually uses<br>a key, and make sure the landlord has a copy of the key so they can get<br>in to do maintenance.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>**Anybody in my house can unlock my bedroom door from the outside<br>without a key when its locked, and I get no privacy because of this.
