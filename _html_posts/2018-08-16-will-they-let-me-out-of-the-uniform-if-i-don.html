<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Will they let me out of the uniform if I don\'t like the U.S. Army's<br>basic training?**<br><br>There are a lot of answers here, and most of them are wrong.<br><br>You most certainly can be discharged from the military during the first<br>180 days of your military service. It's called an *Entry Level<br>Separation*. It is given to people who are in "entry level status,"<br>which generally means within the first 180 days of military training.<br><br>The [[GI Rights<br>Hotline](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=a83eb4&url=https://girightshotline.org/en/military-knowledge-base/topic/entry-level-performance-and-conduct-discharge-entry-level-separa){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="girightshotline.org"}]{.qlink_container} explains it this<br>way:<br><br>> The military has its own way of life, with its own standards of<br>> conduct, unique customs and traditions, and different pressures and<br>> expectations. As a new recruit, you must learn to think differently<br>> about yourself and others. You face difficult training programs, an<br>> abundance of rules and regulations, and lose many of the freedoms you<br>> enjoyed as a civilian. If you have not adapted to the military world<br>> and demonstrate that you are not succeeding within it, **you may be<br>> eligible for an entry level performance and conduct discharge**. It is<br>> available only if you are still in entry level status.<br>><br>> Consider seeking an entry level performance and conduct discharge if<br>> you:<br>><br>> - believe you made a mistake enlisting in the military,<br>> - are not willing or able to complete your training,<br>> - experience emotional distress,<br>> - or have difficulty coping with military life.<br>><br>> In-aptitude, failure to adapt to the military environment, failure to<br>> progress satisfactorily in a required training program, lack of<br>> effort, psychological or stress-related symptoms, lack of<br>> self-discipline, or minor disciplinary infractions are all examples of<br>> grounds for this separation. If the member is requesting separation<br>> for dependency/hardship or conscientious objection, the member may<br>> receive an entry level separation if the application or request is<br>> submitted while the member is in entry level status.<br><br>An ELS carries no characterization with it (i.e. it's not an honorable<br>or dishonorable discharge). Your status will be as if you never enlisted<br>in the first place. You will also not be considered a military veteran.<br><br>This sort of separation says, "You had the best intentions in mind, but<br>not everyone is a good fit for military service, and some people only<br>learn this once they get there."<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
