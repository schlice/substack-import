<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>> *Question Details:*<br>><br>> *He got out of a car twice and approached me. I warned him both times.<br>> The second time he ignored me and got within arms reach just barely.<br>> Seemingly to throw my warning in my face. No direct verbal threats or<br>> arm actions. But HIGHLY angry, shouting and approaching me VERY<br>> aggressively. Proof burden?*<br><br>As with all legal questions, the answer is "it depends."<br><br>In general, in "stand your ground" states, there is no duty to retreat<br>from aggressive people. Obviously, the best choice is to do so, *if you<br>can*. If the aggressive person is blocking your path, then retreat may<br>not be an option.<br><br>In such a case, you must still believe that there is a threat of<br>*imminent use of unlawful force* before you can respond with non-lethal<br>force in order to prevent that assault. This is the part which varies<br>wildly from state to state. Some states say that an assault must occur<br>first; others say that the threat of assault is enough.<br><br>TL;DR: Check your state laws on assault and your ability to defend<br>against it before you go popping some aggressive person in the nose and<br>getting arrested for assault yourself.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>If a highly aggressive person invades my personal space (arms length)<br>after I\'ve repeatedly warned them not to am I legally allowed to strike<br>first?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
