<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What are your thoughts on Trump naming the 17 Republicans who voted to<br>impeach him and said that the GOP needs to \"get rid\" of them during<br>his CPAC speech?**<br><br>1.  Trump has every right to say whatever he feels about those 7<br>    Republican Senators. and 10 Republican House Representatives.<br>2.  The GOP (a private organization) can conduct itself exactly as it<br>    chooses. They do not take orders from Trump.<br>3.  The public should understand that Trump is a former president, and<br>    his word carries exactly as much weight as that of a former<br>    president.<br>4.  His past words inform us about what we should think about his<br>    current words. Which means we take everything he says with a HUGE<br>    SCOOP of salt.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
