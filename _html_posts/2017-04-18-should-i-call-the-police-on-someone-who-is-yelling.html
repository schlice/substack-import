<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>At most, it's a nuisance. If he does it after hours (i.e. after 11 pm),<br>he can be cited for violating noise ordinances, but there usually isn't<br>a law preventing someone from being a nuisance. If you do think it<br>warrants a call, please call the non-emergency number and explain the<br>situation to the operator.<br><br>If he lives in an area controlled by an HOA, there's a good chance they<br>have rules against nuisances. Better to take it up with them.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
