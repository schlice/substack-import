<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>In this particular case, Disney was the first to violate the higher<br>statute (Federal immigration law) which specifically says that you can't<br>replace positions currently held by Americans directly with H1B<br>employees.<br><br>The part you're referring to has to do with termination clauses.<br>Normally, when you are terminated, you are offered a severance package.<br>Think of it as "X number of months that we'll continue to pay you as if<br>you're an employee, even though you're fired." They can then add a<br>clause in that termination agreement which says, "If you take this deal,<br>you can't talk to anyone about this issue, and you can't sue the company<br>over your termination." If you do (talk or sue), you forfeit your<br>package and you owe them the money they paid you. You can still sue, but<br>you can't keep the money.<br><br>This is legal, as you are generally an "at-will" employee. You weren't<br>under "contract" before, so the company is free to fire you at any time<br>and they owe you nothing. If they give you something, it's generally<br>going to come with strings attached. No rights are being denied; you are<br>still free to file suit against the company. However, if you do, and<br>your termination agreement contained a "can't sue/can't talk" clause,<br>you can't keep any money from the severance package.<br><br>In this case, Disney did not include that particular clause in the<br>termination agreement, so these fired workers are free to keep their<br>severance package and still participate in a lawsuit claiming<br>wrongful termination under Federal law.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
