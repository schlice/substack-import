I still don't<br>understand why it got so much attention. I also don't understand what<br>drove its popularity. I wasn't first to the party, but I guess to the<br>folks that look at that category, they liked it. I was just trying to<br>provide some useful information regarding Private Browsing / Incognito<br>Mode and why one might use it. Instead, I hit on my most upvoted answer.<br><br>[[Bill Stein\'s answer to Someone prank calls 911. They send police to<br>my address, it is 1 am, and I am sleeping. I injure/kill the cop<br>thinking he is a criminal. What happens? The cop/cops didn\'t yell<br>\"Police!\" when coming into my<br>property.](https://www.quora.com/Someone-prank-calls-911-They-send-police-to-my-address-it-is-1-am-and-I-am-sleeping-I-injure-kill-the-cop-thinking-he-is-a-criminal-What-happens-The-cop-cops-didnt-yell-Police-when-coming-into-my-property/answer/Bill-Stein)]{.qlink_container}<br><br>This answer has 940k views. Again, I have no idea what caused this<br>answer to get so much attention. Even weirder, even though it is my most<br>viewed answer, it only has 721 upvotes. I have plenty of other answers<br>with more upvotes, but my most viewed answer has less than 1k upvotes.<br><br>[[Bill Stein\'s answer to If an unidentified passenger plane flew into<br>the American mainland and ignored all attempts at communicating with it,<br>how would the military<br>respond?](https://www.quora.com/If-an-unidentified-passenger-plane-flew-into-the-American-mainland-and-ignored-all-attempts-at-communicating-with-it-how-would-the-military-respond/answer/Bill-Stein)]{.qlink_container}<br><br>This is one of my favorite answers, because it deals with NORAD, where I<br>used to work while I was on Active Duty. It's something I'm passionate<br>about, so it was easy to write about. And what do I get for my passion?<br>Only 66,8k views, and 449 upvotes. Sheesh.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
