<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>It is difficult to assess the actual hard numbers, and there is far more<br>nuance than it may initially appear.<br><br>The WHO estimates that 13% of maternal mortality is due to unsafe<br>abortion, but challenges with measurement and data quality still exist.<br>As far as we can reliably determine, no systematic assessment of the<br>validity of studies reporting estimates of abortion-related mortality<br>exists.<br><br>Additionally, many of the factors that made unlicensed abortions unsafe<br>in the past have since been rectified. In other words, even unlawful<br>abortions (colloquially called "back-alley abortions" in order to<br>inflame the reader) have gotten safer.<br><br>Finally, some abortion options which are "generally considered as safe"<br>are *massively increasing* the harms done to women, and in this case I<br>am primarily referencing abortifacient drugs. It is estimated that<br>about 50% of abortions in the United States are done chemically. Ever<br>since COVID, abortion activists have used the smokescreen of the<br>pandemic and social distancing to increase the penetration and<br>availability of mail-order abortifacient drugs such that in many cases,<br>a doctor's visit and pre-abortion evaluation is no longer necessary to<br>obtain them. This is immensely dangerous, as when these drugs are used<br>improperly (i.e. when an ectopic pregnancy exists, or the patient is<br>post-10 weeks pregnant), the drugs can induce incredibly bad outcomes,<br>such as internal bleeding and death. Think about that for a second. All<br>you'd need to do is improperly calculate the beginning of your pregnancy<br>and you could die by taking these drugs. ER visits from pregnant women<br>taking abortifacient drugs received through the mail have *spiked*. All<br>of this is to say that not all access improvements have reduced unsafe<br>abortions.<br><br>This is why it is very difficult to come up with solid numbers.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
