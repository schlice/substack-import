<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The air rifle is absolutely quieter than the .22.<br><br>If your only concern is noise, go with the air rifle, but understand<br>that you\'re less likely to kill the pest every time; you may only wound<br>them, or just piss them off (most likely scare them away temporarily).<br><br>If you hope to kill the pests every time, the rimfire is the way to go.<br>38 grain copper-plated rimfire goes 1260 fps (and the slug itself is<br>heavier), so you\'re way more likely to kill with the rimfire than you<br>are with the air rifle.<br><br>My FIL uses an air rifle with a big-azz scope on it to scare off the<br>wolves from his land. He specifically doesn\'t want to kill them, so he<br>uses the air rifle with a scope at a lower air pressure to just piss<br>them off and hopefully scare them away. It does the trick pretty<br>effectively. He might wound them, but the air rifle doesn\'t kill them,<br>and this is at a distance of 50-150 yards.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
