<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>You asked if the *Court's* decision was justified. The answer is it 100%<br>is justified. The Justices even published a document explaining the<br>justification for their decision.<br><br>But it doesn't sound like you're actually asking about the Court and<br>their justification for what they ruled.<br><br>\<br><br>Let's start with the Supreme Court. To do that, we have to go back to<br>the beginning.<br><br>The President signed an Executive Order directing the Secretary of<br>Education to dismantle the Department of Education, but keep only<br>essential functions as required by law. Lawsuits filed by states, school<br>districts, and employee unions argued that the administration\'s actions<br>were an illegal attempt to close the department without congressional<br>approval and that the massive layoffs would prevent the department from<br>fulfilling its statutory duties, such as supporting special education,<br>distributing financial aid, and enforcing civil rights laws.<br><br>A Circuit court agreed with the plaintiffs and filed an injunction<br>preventing the administration's actions from proceeding.<br><br>The administration appealed to the Supreme Court, who repealed the<br>injunction and allowed the administration to move forward with its<br>dismantling of the Department of Education.<br><br>The administration argued that these actions were about efficiency and<br>that the president\'s authority to manage federal agencies includes<br>determining the necessary workforce. The majority opinion of the Court<br>held this view.<br><br>The minority opinion of the Court emphasized the lack of unilateral<br>presidential authority to eliminate departments established by Congress<br>and the potential for significant harm to students and educational<br>opportunities.<br><br>This isn't the first time that there has been a dispute about an agency<br>*created by Congress* but *given to the Executive* to run. Who has more<br>authority? The Court has been attempting to balance this duality for<br>many decades.<br><br>What *is* clear is that the President and Congress are going to have to<br>work together to determine what to do with the remainder of the<br>Department.<br><br>\<br><br>But I feel like that may not have been your question. Instead, you may<br>have been asking if *dismantling the Department of Education in the<br>first place* was justified.<br><br>And that is a *political* question, not a *legal* one.<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-febfce86ef73151a4b6bdfba32c1cd4f){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-febfce86ef73151a4b6bdfba32c1cd4f"<br>master_w="1024" master_h="1024"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>Consider this. Before 1979, the United States public education system<br>(which was almost entirely run by state and local governments) was<br>widely regarded as the best in the world. Today, the United States is<br>ranked 28th in the world in math and 36th in literacy. One in four<br>eighth graders lacks a basic proficiency in math. One in three are not<br>reading at grade level. Only 13% are proficient in US history. In some<br>US cities, the numbers are truly appalling. For example, in Chicago, 22<br>schools didn't have a single student who was proficient in reading<br>comprehension, and 33 schools didn't have a single student who was<br>proficient in math.<br><br>It's certainly not because of a lack of funding. According to the most<br>recent numbers, the United States spends \$17,000 per student. In<br>Chicago, it's \$29,000.<br><br>So what happened between then and now? There are lots of reasons. Some<br>of them include too much screen time, and not engaged-enough parents.<br>But there is one thing of which we can be certain: the federal<br>Department of Education did not help. In fact, it may have actually made<br>things *worse*.<br><br>Again, this certainly isn't a money problem. Last year, the DOE had a<br>\$268 billion budget. So where did all that money go? Did it go to<br>students in the classroom? In any state?<br><br>To answer that question, we have to go back to President Jimmy Carter in<br>1979.<br><br>Carter had a pretty full plate. The 1980 election was closing fast and<br>Carter's chances were not looking good. Beset by the Iran Hostage<br>Crisis, crippling inflation, and gasoline shortages, Carter's approval<br>ratings had plummeted to a dismal 28 percent. He needed a big push. He<br>found it in the National Education Association, the largest labor union<br>in the country. The NEA really wanted a Cabinet-level department for<br>education, but frankly, no one else did. But this wasn't about schools<br>or students, it was about *politics*. So politics being what they are,<br>Carter created a new Cabinet-level Department of Education and staffed<br>it with his newfound best friends from the NEA. They got everything they<br>wanted: a Cabinet level department with control over every school<br>district in the country and a big budget to dangle over their heads in a<br>stick-and-carrot mode (do what we tell you or you don't get this big bag<br>of money) and a big bureaucracy, which they could fill with NEA members<br>and partisans.<br><br>Congress knew this was a bad idea. One anonymous House Democrat admitted<br>as much at the time: "The idea of an Education Department is really a<br>bad one. But it\'s NEA\'s top priority. There are school teachers in<br>every congressional district, and most of us simply don\'t need the<br>aggravation of taking them on."\[1\](#regJF){#cite-regJF<br>.citation_link}<br><br>From that moment on, the needs of the students took a back seat to<br>the desires of the DOE. The Department was never designed to help<br>students. It was purely designed as a political gift to the largest<br>labor union in the country. Its employees (almost all Democrats) make a<br>very good living and a big chunk of them (over 2,500) are doing really<br>well for themselves, making well over \$100,000 a year. The Department<br>dispenses about \$80 billion to schools across the country for<br>educationally questionable initiatives like "teacher development,"<br>"diversity training," "critical theory studies" and "climate change<br>awareness." Seriously, the things they fund are a little out of pocket.<br>Here's just one example of many we can cite: under the Biden<br>Administration, the Department gave Framingham State University \$1.3<br>million to write a textbook for high school students that "provides a<br>lens for understanding the evolving definition of 'family' through<br>socially constructed and ecological theory frameworks." You read that<br>right: \$1.3 million to write a textbook about *that* (whatever it<br>means).<br><br>Does *any* of its money go to actual classroom instruction? It doesn't<br>go to pay teachers' salaries. It doesn't pay for curriculum or textbooks<br>or school buildings (your local tax dollars pay for that). The DOE is<br>free to spend its money on its own special interests. So the DOE is<br>absolutely perfect for the NEA: The union get the jobs and the goodies.<br>The Democrats get the votes (the NEA has endorsed every Democratic<br>presidential nominee since Carter) and a vehicle to push their ideas on<br>America's youth. But is it perfect for *literally anyone else?* It<br>certainly does not appear to be.<br><br>\<br><br>So is closing it *justified*? It would seem so. If all it does is<br>distribute money, *any* agency can do that. You don't need a separate<br>DOE bureaucracy to do that. And if you say, "No, don't close it,<br>*reform* it," how do you reform a federal agency into something it was<br>never meant to be?<br><br>It appears that all the DOE has ever been is a taxpayer money dispensary<br>for education administrators and the teacher's union, and as a pipeline<br>to deliver radical educational experimentation directly to our students.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-regJF){.citation_index} [[Why Do We Have a Department of<br>Education?
