<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Thank you. In thinking about it, I really hung on to her too long. When<br>she got the tumor on her brain stem, I probably should have put her down<br>at that point. She had periods of lucidity where I could see her<br>personality come through, but she was never really the same after that.<br>I held on to her more for myself than for her, and as much as I beat<br>myself up for keeping her alive during that time, I have to not do that<br>because it was my first experience with such a thing.<br><br>And while I will never forget her, and I will always miss her (next to<br>my wife, she was my best friend), our new friend just turned one, and<br>she has her own unique personality, and she is finding her place in our<br>home. It's cool watching her carve out her little niche in our family.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/What-did-you-do-after-the-death-of-your-service-dog/answer/Rick-Bruno-1<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
