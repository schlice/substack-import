<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [You\'ve denoted two different types of checkpoints: border<br>checkpoints (which include interior checkpoints) and state/county/local<br>checkpoints.\<br>\<br>Border checkpoints are the ones along the national border and within 100<br>miles of the border. Those checkpoints are manned by Customs and Border<br>Patrol.\<br>\<br>At the border, CBP doesn\'t need reasonable suspicion or probable cause<br>to search your vehicle; all persons entering into the United States are<br>subject to search, and you crossing the border constitutes your implicit<br>consent to search.\<br>\<br>Interior border checkpoints (within 100 miles of the border) are a<br>little different. To stop your vehicle, they need \"reasonable<br>suspicion\" that you\'re involved with something related to the border<br>that you shouldn\'t be (and this is usually more than a \"hunch\" or a<br>\"guess\"). To search your vehicle, they need \"probable cause\" that<br>you are involved in illegal border activity (smuggling or harboring<br>border jumpers). Note that frequently these rules are ignored, as CBP<br>isn\'t generally well-trained on their responsibilities and the legal<br>limits of their authority, and supervision is thin at best. In practice,<br>they tend to apply their rights from the actual border to the interior<br>border checkpoints, which is not valid. According to the ACLU,<br>Constitutional rights are frequently violated at these interior<br>checkpoints, and innocent people (US citizens) are routinely the<br>victims.\<br>\<br>DUI checkpoints (or sobriety checkpoints) are conducted by State or<br>local police or county sheriffs offices. They are a great way for<br>officers to check your tags and get a quick whiff of your breath or the<br>inside of your vehicle. Your rights apply at a DUI checkpoint just as<br>they do with any other traffic stop; they are absolutely no different.<br>Officers have to have probable cause to search your vehicle and they<br>have to have a reasonable suspicion that you have been drinking before<br>they can stop you, or you consent to a search.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
