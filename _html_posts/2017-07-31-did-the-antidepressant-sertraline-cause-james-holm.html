<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>In my humble opinion, the foundational issues to Holmes' psychotic<br>behavior were the *two* drugs he was on: Zoloft and Klonopin (sertraline<br>is the generic version of Zoloft).<br><br>Holmes was on Zoloft, which has a *black box warning* stating that it<br>can increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Other side<br>effects of Zoloft can include, but are not limited to, agitation,<br>irritability, anxiety, hostility, aggressiveness, hallucinations, mania,<br>impulsivity, delusions and apathy.<br><br>He was also on Klonopin. Klonopin is a benzodiazepine. This means it is<br>essentially a tranquilizer. It is a *short-term* medication (no more<br>than a week) used to control epilepsy or some anxiety disorders. It is<br>not meant for long-term use. It's a hallucinogen, and the potential side<br>effects of Klonopen are almost identical to the potential side effects<br>of Zoloft. It's unknown just how long Holmes was taking Klonopin<br><br>Holmes was also abusing alcohol at the same time. Alcohol increases the<br>side effects of these drugs<br><br>So you have two drugs whose side effects would magnify each other, along<br>with alcohol. This is a potentially toxic and deadly combination. I<br>believe that it was these drugs that were the foundation that led a<br>promising neurologist down the road of schizophrenia, psychosis, and<br>disinhibition, eventually leading him to premeditated murder.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
