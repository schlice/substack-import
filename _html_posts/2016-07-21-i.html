<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Current military policy allows transgender persons to serve openly in<br>the Armed Forces, but specific guidance has yet to come out. In some<br>units where transgenders have come out to their commanders, the<br>commanders (who have no specific guidance about how to handle the<br>situation) have often told co-workers to continue to refer to the<br>transgender servicemember using the wrong gender. In some cases, careers<br>have been put on hold because there is no policy, and the military is<br>unsure how to handle the transgender servicemember.<br><br>This is a tough one; I don't think I can give you appropriate guidance.<br>I'd love to tell you, "Go for it! Damn the torpedoes, full speed ahead!"<br>but I'm concerned for you. The military is in flux right now, and<br>sending you in there guns blazing may not be the best thing for you.<br><br>I want you to serve, and I want you to serve in the gender in which you<br>feel most comfortable, but I'm afraid the military doesn't know how to<br>handle you yet.<br><br>Think about this. What if the Department of Transportation issued a<br>ruling that said that under some circumstances, you are now allowed to<br>turn left on red, but didn't provide the circumstances? There would be<br>mass chaos as some people tried to follow the new guidance, but without<br>knowing exactly when and where, there were accidents all over the place.<br>Tempers were raised, feelings were hurt, and in some cases, people were<br>hurt as well.<br><br>This is exactly what Secretary Carter did when he said transgenders may<br>serve openly, but we don't yet have guidance for military commanders to<br>follow regarding transgender servicemembers.<br><br>You already know the choices you have available to you in this<br>situation: either stay in the closet and serve as a woman, or come out<br>to your commander and let the chips fall where they may. I just don't<br>feel comfortable telling you which you should do, and thus throwing you<br>to the wolves right now when there is no clear guidance on how to handle<br>transgender servicemembers. The military needs to get its collective act<br>together. I understand the military's concern as well: this has nothing<br>to do with the execution of the mission, and they'd be right. But they<br>have received guidance that transgenders may serve openly, so at the<br>very least, the individual service should come up with a policy, instead<br>of sitting around waiting for the administration to do it. Even if their<br>policy eventually gets changed, at least they will be doing *something*<br>to assist commanders. As it is, they're all just flapping in the wind.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
