<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>First of all, it's because pro-choice people are not concerned about<br>whether or not societal coercion exists. They just want to have the<br>ability to kill an unborn baby, full stop. They never talk about the<br>fact that some women (maybe a majority of women) feel pressured to abort<br>their babies *because* pro-choice people have ensured that some states<br>have unfettered access to abortion.<br><br>Is this pressure always from the baby's father? No, not always, but<br>that pressure indeed is there. But there are other pressures.<br><br>- Deceptive or even coercive counseling<br>- Employment discrimination against pregnant women<br>- Housing discrimination against pregnant women<br>- Pregnancy or abortion related violence<br><br>And none of that is to mention the issues *after* abortion (which<br>pro-choice people love to discount, but they do exist), such as women<br>who have aborted showing symptoms of trauma, are four times more likely<br>to die after an abortion, and suicide rates are six times higher for<br>women in their first year following an abortion.<br><br>But let's focus on the pre-abortion coercion for just one moment. Here's<br>the sad statistics:<br><br>- 64% of women reported feeling pressured to abort.<br>- Most felt rushed or uncertain, yet 67% weren't counseled.<br>- 79% weren't told of available resources.<br>- 84% weren't sufficiently informed before abortion.<br>- Pressure to abort can escalate to violence.<br>- Homicide is the leading killer of pregnant women.<br>- Clinics fail to screen for coercion.<br>- Women nearly 4 times more likely to die after abortion.<br>- Suicide rates 6 times higher after abortion.<br>- 65% of women suffer trauma symptoms after<br>  abortion.\[1\](#uxaDF){#cite-uxaDF .citation_link}<br><br>\<br><br>Cue the pro-choicers to tell me why these statistics are wrong in<br>3....2....1.......<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-uxaDF){.citation_index}<br>[https://www.theunchoice.com/pdf/\...(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=5a8d04&url=https://www.theunchoice.com/pdf/FactSheets/ForcedAbortions.pdf){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="theunchoice.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
