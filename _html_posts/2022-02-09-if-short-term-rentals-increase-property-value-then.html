<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Because home values are not the only thing that homeowners are concerned<br>about. As others have said, homeowners are really only terribly<br>concerned about home values when they are planning on selling. They're<br>not overly concerned day-to-day with home values.<br><br>Homeowners like to keep their neighborhoods livable. Generally, this is<br>done through the use of restrictive covenants and rules/regulations<br>which govern home use, especially the exterior of the home. And also<br>generally, short term rental guests are not really concerned with<br>following the neighborhood rules. Short term rental guests are less<br>concerned with "pissing off the neighbors" because they don't live<br>there, they're just staying there temporarily. So it's not just the<br>NIMBY factor, it's the fact that short term rental guests do not<br>maintain the same pride of ownership as a permanent resident or<br>long-term renter. This means that home exteriors may suffer, and the<br>overall neighborhood aesthetic may change.<br><br>There's also the increase in traffic at a short-term rental, and the<br>fact that you never know who is in the neighborhood, a crucial part of<br>neighborhood security. Being able to identify an unknown vehicle in your<br>neighborhood would be important to neighborhood security; short term<br>rentals obviate the ability to do so.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>If short-term rentals increase property value, then why do local<br>homeowners complain about them?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
