<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>How is gun violence comparable to drunk driving?<br><br>The only way in which they are comparable is that people die, and the<br>subject tools (guns or cars) are involved.<br><br>That's it.<br><br>Everything else about them is different.<br><br>First of all, "gun violence" is a stupid term. Gun violence is no<br>different than knife violence or baseball bat violence or shovel<br>violence or chainsaw violence. It's all violence. The only difference is<br>the tool. And gunshot wounds don't demonstrably kill faster or more<br>certainly than knives or chainsaws. Knives cause far more damage to<br>human flesh than bullets, and can induce death at least as certainly, if<br>not more certainly, than bullets.<br><br>Nevertheless, despite the stupid term, when a person uses a gun to<br>commit violence, it is a deliberate act. The operator of the gun<br>physically points it at a human and pulls the trigger. This is an<br>intentional, purposeful act which has the potential to take a life. In<br>contrast, drunk driving does not involve someone deliberately getting<br>behind the wheel and aiming the car at a person. It is an<br>unintentional act.<br><br>Additionally, drunk drivers kill *orders of magnitude* more people than<br>are killed with guns.<br><br>Gun violence and drunk driving are *totally different.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
