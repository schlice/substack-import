<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Thanks for the A2A.\<br>\<br>I think the NRA can sometimes be misguided, because I don\'t necessarily<br>agree with all of their policies.\<br>\<br>For example, I don\'t think that we should have \"constitutional<br>concealed carry.\" I think there should be some licensing and training<br>that one should have in order to carry a concealed weapon. Carrying is<br>very, very safe, if it is done correctly. Weapons are designed to only<br>fire when the trigger is pulled, therefore the trigger needs to be<br>protected while you carry, safeties only work if you use them, etc. I\'m<br>all for \"shall issue\" laws. I\'m completely against \"may issue\"<br>laws.\<br>\<br>Also, I think technology has advanced to the point where we can (and<br>should) make some common-sense storage requirements for guns in homes.<br>We can still store guns safely while still being able to get to them in<br>a hurry. One safe I saw used a RFID chip in a wristband to unlock \-- no<br>combo necessary (but it also has a backup combo and key). I wear wrist<br>items all the time, wearing one with an embedded RFID chip to pop open<br>my gun safe is nothing to me. I think advocating against those items is<br>wrong-headed. I think advocating for more widespread (read: mandated)<br>use of such devices will only cause the technology to become more<br>hardened, more advanced, and more safe. As always, there are trade-offs.<br>There will be that one case where an armed intruder bests a homeowner<br>who couldn\'t get his safe open because it malfunctioned. There are<br>always edge cases when we do something as sweeping as mandatory storage<br>requirements. But I think the time is right to move forward with them.<br>The anti-theft aspect alone should be enough to convince people that<br>it\'s the right thing to do.\<br>\<br>But, my misgivings about some of their policies aside, the NRA is one of<br>the most powerful lobbies that the Second Amendment has, and one of its<br>strongest allies. Without them, the vast majority of gun owners would<br>crumble against the legislative tactics used by the very small but vocal<br>anti-gun minority. You\'ve seen what minorities can do to the country<br>unopposed (or more correctly, not strongly opposed). Having a powerful<br>ally to advocate your position is very helpful indeed.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
