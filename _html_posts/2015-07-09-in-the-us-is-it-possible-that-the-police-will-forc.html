<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [In interrogation techniques, we know that when you apply<br>too much pressure, people will say anything to make the pressure stop,<br>including incriminating themselves. So being \"overly coercive\" is<br>illegal because it is usually ineffective at actually getting the truth.<br>We prefer the truth to a lie just to make the questioning stop.\<br>\<br>There are much better interrogation techniques which can be employed<br>which are far more successful at actually extracting the truth than<br>coercion.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
