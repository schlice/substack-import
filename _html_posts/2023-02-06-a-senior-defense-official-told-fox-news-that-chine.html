<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>While it's certainly possible for the government to "cover up" a news<br>story, it's really hard to hide a big white weather balloon as it lazily<br>floats across the sky. People on the ground were taking videos of the<br>most recent weather balloon, the most notable was a video taken in<br>Billings, Montana, as it was visible with the naked eye.<br><br>So how, pray tell, did Trump not only kill the news story about the<br>Chinese spy balloons during his administration (because the media was<br>*so compliant* and never actually wanted to publish anything negative<br>about Trump that they would universally be willing to kill a story<br>merely at his request), but simultaneously *make the balloon disappear?*<br><br>So you tell me: who is telling the truth? Why did no one see the<br>mysterious weather balloons during Trump's administration? Is it more<br>likely that Trump was able to hide the actual balloon, or is it more<br>likely that the balloon didn't exist at all?<br><br>We report, you decide.<br><br>(EDIT) I did read some news reports claiming that the Chinese balloons<br>in question which were, supposedly, during Trump's presidency were<br>balloons that crossed the ADIZ but never made it over land. This<br>apparently happened in Florida and Texas (surprising that it only<br>happened off the coasts of some of the reddest states in the country),<br>and apparently also may have happened over Hawaii and Guam.<br><br>It's fascinating. China already presumably has this same technology in<br>spy satellites which are already flying overhead. Using balloons like<br>this is clunky and doesn't provide anything more than what they already<br>get. Perhaps what they were testing was not intelligence, but our<br>response to the balloons.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
