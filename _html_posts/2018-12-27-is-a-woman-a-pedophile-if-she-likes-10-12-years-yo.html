<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Is a woman a pedophile if she likes 10-12 years younger guys as her<br>boyfriend and husband?**<br><br>The answer is no, a woman is not automatically a pedophile if she wants<br>a man who is 10 years younger than her as a boyfriend or a husband.<br><br>- If the woman is 30 and the man is 20, this does not make the woman a<br>  pedophile.<br>- If the woman is 20 and the boy is 10, this *does* make the woman a<br>  pedophile.<br><br>*Pedophilia* literally means "love of children." It is a mental disorder<br>in which an adult finds a pre-pubescent child sexually attractive.<br><br>Whether or not the woman is a pedophile is not determined by the<br>*difference in age between the two*. It is determined by the age of the<br>person to whom she is attracted.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
