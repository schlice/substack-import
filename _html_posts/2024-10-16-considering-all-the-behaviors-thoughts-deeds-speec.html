<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Things don't "qualify" as sins. They either are sinful, or they are not.<br><br>Are we, as fallible humans, always committing some kind of sin? Well,<br>depending on how aware we are of our own behavior patterns, we may be.<br><br>But the truth is that regardless of the frequency, we are all sinners.<br>We have all "fallen short of the glory of God" (Romans 3:23). We all<br>sin, in our thoughts and in our words, in what we have done, and what we<br>have failed to do. We are living in sinful bodies in a fallen, sinful<br>world, so sin is virtually inevitable for us.<br><br>If we are ignorant of our sin, then we haven't done the work necessary<br>to reveal those sins, and if we haven't done that, have we truly<br>repented?<br><br>The good news is that we can discover our sin! The Holy Spirit can help<br>to reveal those sins to us, *if we ask*. So pray to have your sin<br>revealed to you, the sin that you may have committed that you aren't<br>even aware of. Prepare yourself for the surprise of revelation.<br><br>But then, *repent* of that sin. And keep it in mind so that you can<br>*avoid* that sin in the future.<br><br>Then, repeat this exercise to make sure you're catching it all.<br><br>We shouldn't allow unrepented sin to exist in our lives. We should be<br>making an effort to discover that sin and to repent of it.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
