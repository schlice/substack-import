<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Depends on what you mean by "unlocking."<br><br>If you're talking about a "carrier lock" so you can use it on another<br>network, there are no cons at all.<br><br>If you're talking about "rooting" your device, there are the standard<br>warnings about rooting your device. You make your device more unstable,<br>you risk opening up security holes, and you also won't be able to<br>upgrade your firmware automatically (only non-rooted phones get OTA<br>upgrades).<br><br>What you get in return is big though. You unlock the full capabilities<br>of the hardware. You can do things in the hardware you never could do<br>before. You have full control over the CPU and how it works. You have<br>full control over all of your applications; when they run, when they<br>die, etc. You can tweak your radio settings to get better signal<br>strength. You can add utilities like f.lux and other hacks and tweaks to<br>your phone to make your phone look and work the way you want it. You can<br>remove system packages and carrier bloatware. You can schedule reboots,<br>and tools like Tasker and Titanium Backup become infinitely more usable.<br><br>Note that some of this can be done with apps, but that's a lot of<br>disparate software packages to maintain for little individual functions.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
