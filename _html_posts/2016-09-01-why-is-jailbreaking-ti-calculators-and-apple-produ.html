<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Basically, jailbreaking TI calculators (presumably to load programs in<br>non-volatile memory) and Apple products is hard because TI and Apple<br>don't want you doing it. If they wanted you to be able to do it, it<br>would be easy. Like installing an app easy. It's difficult because they<br>don't want you to do it.<br><br>There are several reasons they don't want you to do it.<br><br>- Reputation. TI calculators are known for the ability to be able to<br>  clear the running memory of any user-installed programs with a key<br>  combination (2nd-Clear IIRC). The screen then displays "MEMORY<br>  CLEARED". This is the instructor's indication that the user-accessible<br>  portion of the memory has been cleared and you have no applications<br>  installed on the calculator that would give you an "unfair advantage"<br>  such as storage of formulas you're supposed to memorize. Jailbreaking<br>  the calculator may allow you to install applications in the<br>  *non-volatile* portion of the memory, such that you can clear the user<br>  portion and the application will remain, or you can generate a fake<br>  "MEMORY CLEARED" message, or change the function of the Clear button.<br>  If jailbreaking a TI calculator was easy, classrooms would not require<br>  their use since it was so easy to bypass security and gain unfair<br>  advantage.<br>- User Experience. Apple, on the other hand, is trying to create the<br>  most user-friendly product it can. Ensuring that your experience is<br>  best-in-class means ensuring you cannot make changes that would<br>  negatively affect that experience. Remember that Apple is primarily a<br>  hardware company. They also make software that will operate their<br>  hardware, and only their hardware, no one else's. One of the things<br>  that makes Apple products so appealing is that their stuff "just<br>  works." There are no hardware compatibility issues to deal with, no<br>  operating system limitations that don't allow you to fully utilize<br>  your hardware, and no hardware functions that can't be properly or<br>  fully utilized due to incompatibility with the software. Note that<br>  this is in stark contrast to Android, which runs on a wide variety of<br>  hardware.<br>- Security. Jailbreaking your devices and making changes to them may<br>  introduce security vulnerabilities. This may not be a big deal to you,<br>  but if you store your bank's information or a credit card on your<br>  phone, security vulnerabilities are a big deal to them. Oftentimes,<br>  it's for this reason that electronic pay software (like Apple Pay,<br>  Samsung Pay or Google Wallet) will not run on jailbroken (or rooted)<br>  devices. The devices will report to the software whether or not they<br>  are jailbroken (or rooted) and the software will decide on its own<br>  whether or not it can be used.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
