<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Could the impeachment allow criminal proceedings against Trump to<br>begin after he leaves office?**<br><br>Impeachment is a political action. Criminal proceedings are a judicial<br>action.<br><br>One does not have any relation to the other, other than the fact that a<br>president really can't be indicted while in office; he would have to be<br>impeached *and removed from office* in order to be indicted for a crime.<br><br>Regardless of how the President leaves office (either by being impeached<br>*and removed*, or by leaving office at the end of his term), he can be<br>indicted and charged. The impeachment has no bearing on that.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
