<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Since I can only answer for myself, the worst feeling I have ever<br>experienced when I was younger was watching my mother cry.<br><br>She was crying because someone stole her engagement ring, part of the<br>burglary that occurred at my childhood home.<br><br>I came home from school one day to find police cars at my house. This<br>was nothing new; my dad was a cop. There were routinely police cars at<br>my house. This time was a little different, though. There was a<br>higher-than-average number of police cars at my house. There was also a<br>CSI van at my house. *That's a little unusual*, I thought, but still<br>thought nothing of it. I was rarely surprised at the types of police<br>vehicles I'd come home to find in front of my house. As I approached<br>further, I found officers walking in and out of my house, and the front<br>door propped open. That's about the time that my thought process started<br>to turn from *This is a little unusual but no big deal* to *Something<br>about this scenario is very wrong.*<br><br>Upon entering the house, I was placed on the living room couch, while a<br>crime scene unfolded around me. My dad checked in once, but he was very<br>busy with the investigators. My mom was nowhere to be found.<br><br>At right about that time, she made her presence known. She walked out of<br>her bedroom and fell into my dad's arms, sobbing, "They took my<br>engagement ring!"<br><br>I will never get that image out of my head. Despite how my current<br>feelings about them may have changed, that image still makes me well up.<br>It was such a feeling of helplessness. I felt violated, and despite the<br>presence of half the police force at my house, I still felt defenseless.<br>My mom was tough as nails in my eyes, and anything that could make her<br>cry was obviously tougher than her, which scared the daylights out of<br>me. I was visibly shaken.<br><br>They also stole my dad's service revolver, our two TVs, our turntable,<br>our stereo, and our speakers. Surprisingly, they left the 8-track<br>player, and my *Meat Loaf - Bat Out Of Hell* 8-track. Small victories...<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
