You could download a camera app that support<br>direct saving to SD.\<br>\<br>Even if you didn\'t want to do that, you could create a Tasker app that<br>transfers any picture file to the SD card when it is placed in a<br>specific folder. Tasker is great for automating simple tasks like this;<br>definitely look into it.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
