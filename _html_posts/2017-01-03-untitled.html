<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>iPhones have a feature which will only allow the original account holder<br>to re-image the phone. They are able to do this because Apple controls<br>the hardware and the software. With Apple, you buy the hardware and they<br>supply (bundled) software to run that hardware (iOS)<br><br>Android phones do not have this feature, since Google does not control<br>the hardware on which you load Android. The hardware allows you to<br>re-load the software without checking. This is a downside to having an<br>Android operating system which functions on many different hardware<br>platforms.<br><br>If this feature is a concern for you, I suggest getting an iPhone. Once<br>you have one, you can log in to<br>[iCloud.com(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=f30a9e&url=http://iCloud.com){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="icloud.com"}]{.qlink_container} to find your phone and<br>remotely lock and wipe it. Stolen iPhones are much harder to re-sell<br>since you need the original account to wipe the device. Not impossible,<br>but much harder.<br><br>Additionally, there are plenty of software packages which perform a<br>similar "SIM-change alert" function like what was built in to your<br>Symbian-based phone. Take a look at Lookout Mobile Security for Android<br>or iOS, one feature of which is SIM change alerts.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/My-Galaxy-S5-has-been-stolen-I-had-Find-My-Mobile-enabled-If-the-perpetrator-wipes-out-my-phone-or-do-a-hard-reset-Will-that-feature-still-work/answer/Bill-Stein<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
