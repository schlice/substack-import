<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What percentage of guns used by criminals were acquired from an<br>acquaintance or family member who themselves were "legal owners"?**<br><br>This data is very difficult to come by. First of all, not all transfers<br>from legal owners would have been illegal at the time of the transfer.<br>This means that this data only tells us where the weapon came from. It<br>says nothing about whether or not the transfer was legal at the time it<br>took place.<br><br>That said, it's a very low percentage of crimes committed with firearms<br>acquired legally (i.e. through legal purchases). Experts say that it's<br>somewhere between 3 and 11%. This data is acquired through interviews<br>with prison inmates who used a gun during the commission of their crime.<br>11% of these inmates said they legally purchased their guns. 37%<br>acquired their guns from a friend or family member, and about 40% of<br>these inmates said they bought the gun on the black market or stole<br>it.\[1\](#gHdjF){#cite-gHdjF .citation_link}<br><br>Again, this only tells us where the gun came from. It doesn't tell us<br>whether or not the acquisition was legal when it happened.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-gHdjF){.citation_index} [[MSNBC\'s Joe Scarborough: Tiny<br>fraction of crimes committed with legal<br>guns](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=8e4a5a&url=https://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2015/oct/05/joe-scarborough/msnbcs-joe-scarborough-tiny-fraction-crimes-commit/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="politifact.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
