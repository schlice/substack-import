<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [You would like your phone to automatically switch profiles<br>based on time.\<br>\<br>I would absolutely wholeheartedly endorse [[Sound<br>Profile.](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=75def8&url=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id%3DOrion.Soft){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="google.com"}]{.qlink_container} It is a fantastic app that<br>allows you to customize your sound profiles and then kick them off by<br>time. The Pro version extends the number of profiles you can have and<br>adds some neat other features, like using location services to kick off<br>profiles (i.e. mute your phone when you arrive at work, unmute when you<br>leave, etc).\<br>\<br>I have gone so far as to schedule my church time and my other regularly<br>scheduled meeting times so I never have to set my phone to vibrate at<br>those times; the scheduler does it for me.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
