<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>1.  If you live in a community with an HOA, you will have to pay your<br>    dues. If you don't, they will charge you late fees on top of the<br>    dues you owe, and eventually they will send your account to the<br>    association attorney, who will place a lien on your house for the<br>    unpaid dues and late fees, and then will add their lawyer fees on<br>    top of that. When you have accumulated enough debt, they will<br>    foreclose on their lien, selling your house out from under you to<br>    pay for your debt. Short answer: don't refuse to pay your HOA dues.<br>2.  The other way to stop paying HOA dues is to sell your house and move<br>    to an area where there is no HOA.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
