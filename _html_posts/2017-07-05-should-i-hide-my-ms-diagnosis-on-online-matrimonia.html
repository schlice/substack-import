<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>This sounds less like a question about MS and more like a question about<br>online dating and when is a good time to tell someone about your<br>conditions.<br><br>As I see it, you have a few choices:<br><br>1.  Be completely up-front about it. This would involve putting your MS<br>    diagnosis in your online profile, and letting the chips fall where<br>    they may.<br>2.  Be completely discrete about it. I can't really say how in a<br>    "completely discrete" scenario you would ever tell your significant<br>    other that you have MS, so let's just cut to the chase and say this<br>    option is a really bad idea.<br>3.  I think the middle-ground here (and perhaps the wisest possible<br>    choice) is to go on a few dates and see if they appear promising,<br>    and then reveal that you've been diagnosed with MS, and proceed to<br>    explain it.<br><br>I think that the smartest choice here is to leave it off of your profile<br>and see how the dates go. If you find someone kind-hearted, open, and<br>understanding (i.e. someone who is also looking to find a long term<br>relationship as you are), then the ultimate test will be to tell them<br>about your diagnosis, explain how it has affected you, and how it will<br>potentially affect you in the future.<br><br>How they react to the news will tell you whether or not you should<br>continue dating.<br><br>I don't recommend putting your diagnosis on your profile. I don't<br>believe, first of all, that it's anyone's business but yours what<br>illnesses you have (unless they are contagious --- MS is not). Secondly,<br>you have MS. You are not *defined by* the fact that you have MS. It's<br>like "I have thinning hair" or "I have 20 pounds more weight than I<br>want." Granted, the potential repercussions of MS are more severe than<br>thinning hair or a little too much weight, but the philosophy is the<br>same. You have a disease; you are not defined by a disease. You only<br>confide about your disease when you find someone who is *worthy* of<br>receiving that bit of trusted information. What they do with it, and how<br>they handle it, is up to them.<br><br>Keep in mind that they may take some time to process the information, as<br>you did when you were diagnosed. But if they're the right one, they will<br>accept it and move forward with you.<br><br>It won't be easy, and yes some people will not accept you because you<br>have MS. It's the ugly truth about people. But when the right one comes<br>along, you'll know. And it will be special.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
