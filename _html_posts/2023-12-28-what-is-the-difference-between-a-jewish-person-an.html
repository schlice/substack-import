<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Depends on how you define the word "Zionist." These days, Zionism is an<br>ideology that supports \"the development and protection of the State of<br>Israel,\"\[1\](#WwwNy){#cite-WwwNy .citation_link}or someone who<br>advocates for an independent Jewish state where Jews can live safely.<br>Its original meaning, though, was the advocacy of establishing Jewish<br>control of Jerusalem, which is currently in the territory controlled by<br>Hamas. Zionism is used derisively today as advocation of the destruction<br>of the Arabs in the region.<br><br>Not all Jews live in Israel. There is a significant population of Jews<br>in the United States as well. Jews exist in many countries around the<br>world, not just Israel. But to many religious Jews, Israel is "the<br>promised land." However, you don't have to be a religious Jew to want to<br>see a country where Jews can live in safety and freedom.<br><br>Many people, especially Palestinian Arabs, don't see a difference<br>between "Jew" and "Zionist." The very presence of this question shows<br>just how much people misunderstand the difference between "Jew" and<br>"Zionist." Most Jews don't even live in Israel. And not all Jewish<br>Israelis are "settlers" or "occupiers" who want to take over more and<br>more Palestinian land. Some openly advocate for the "two-state solution"<br>where Israel and Palestine live side by side in peace.<br><br>TL;DR: Not everyone who is Jewish advocates for the destruction of<br>the Palestinian state, and not everyone who argues for the destruction<br>of the Palestinian state is Jewish. Judaism and Zionism are not the<br>same.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-WwwNy){.citation_index} [[Zionism -<br>Wikipedia](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=942c5d&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zionism){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
