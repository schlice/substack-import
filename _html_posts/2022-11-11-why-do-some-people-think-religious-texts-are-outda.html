<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>> Why do some people think religious texts are outdated?<br><br>Because they're listening to atheists who fill their heads with things<br>like "The Bible was written by men" and "The Bible is so old, it doesn't<br>apply to us today."<br><br>What an utter waste of a sentiment.<br><br>Are they saying that history is useless? Is history "outdated?" I say<br>that just because something is *old* doesn't mean that it isn't<br>*authoritative*.<br><br>We know that the Bible is reliable, and we can show that it is true<br>beyond a reasonable doubt. And since God has not provided any new<br>revisions of the Bible, I think it's safe to say that it still applies<br>to us today.<br><br>> Do they think God's expectations of us have changed since the books<br>> were written?<br><br>I don't know what they're thinking. We actually have proof of the<br>Bible's authenticity and trustworthiness, as opposed to...what? What do<br>they have that proves that God's expectations have changed? What do they<br>have that shows anything of use?<br><br>> Why would God change his mind on what is right and wrong?<br><br>He would not. God is timeless and changeless. He cannot "change His<br>mind," as that would indicate that God is bound by time. There would<br>have to be a time before when God thought something, and then a time<br>after when God thought something else, and this is impossible for<br>God.<br><br>So if God is timeless and changeless, why would anyone think that the<br>word of God is somehow subject to change?<br><br>TL;DR: The words and the teachings of the Bible are as timeless and<br>changeless as God is. Just because *society* changes does not imply that<br>the Bible should change with it.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
