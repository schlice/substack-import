<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I did address that, since most departments have policies about what you<br>can and can't do in uniform.<br><br>For example, the military says that you are certainly allowed to attend<br>political meetings and rallies, but you cannot do so in uniform, because<br>the *perception* would be one of military sponsorship of that activity.<br><br>The problem with police officers is that they are *always* police<br>officers, 24x7, and they *never* do not have their authority as police<br>officers, whether or not they are "on duty." The only real way to<br>determine, therefore, whether or not an officer is "on duty" is the<br>presence of the uniform. The uniform signifies the office and that the<br>officer is acting under authority of the office.<br><br>As I said, most major departments have addressed this in policy. Small<br>town departments may not address this, since everyone already knows who<br>the police officer is, uniform or not.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/Is-it-illegal-or-unethical-for-a-police-officer-to-attend-an-Alcoholics-Anonymous-meeting-in-uniform-as-an-observer/answer/Bill-Stein<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
