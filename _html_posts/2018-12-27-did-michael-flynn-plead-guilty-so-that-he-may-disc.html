<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Did Michael Flynn plead guilty so that he may disclose secrets of<br>wrongdoing that he cannot disclose due to NDA and State secrets<br>privilege?**<br><br>No.<br><br>Non-disclosure agreements are considered to be unenforceable if they<br>conceal criminal activity. Therefore, even if criminal activity was<br>covered under an NDA, it would not be unlawful to discuss it, as the NDA<br>would not apply. Flynn plead guilty to lying to the FBI, not to<br>committing any other crimes. The guilty plea does not remove any valid<br>non-disclosure agreements that may be in place. If he violates any such<br>agreements, he is still liable for whatever penalties were specified in<br>those agreements (unless, as I said, the agreement was designed to<br>prevent the disclosure of criminal acts). Remember: NDAs impose civil<br>penalties, not criminal ones.<br><br>In fact, the standard boilerplate of most NDAs includes language that<br>exempts the agreement for disclosures required by law.<br><br>To that end, if an NDA is attempting to prevent you from disclosing<br>information about criminal activity, the NDA doesn't apply.<br><br>State secrets probably doesn't apply, since this is more related to<br>things like human intelligence operations which require secrecy, or the<br>inability to publish certain classified information, or the use of<br>classified information in criminal cases. It's unlikely that Flynn was<br>involved in classified dealings while part of the *campaign*. He was<br>more likely to be involved with classified material while part of the<br>*transition team*, after the election. Flynn's investigation was about<br>his time *before* the election.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
