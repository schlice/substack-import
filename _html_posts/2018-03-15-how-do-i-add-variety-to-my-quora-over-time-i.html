Over time I\'ve noticed fewer and<br>fewer different authors on my feed. Is there a way to make Quora less<br>personalized, and avoid getting stuck in an echo chamber?**<br><br>Search for and follow some new topics.<br><br>Search for a topic you're interested in, and read a few answers. If you<br>find them interesting, go ahead and follow the topic. You'll start to<br>see more answers from that topic show up in your feed.<br><br>Similarly, if you're getting tired of seeing a particular bent of<br>question, unfollow those topics which contribute stories of that bent.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
