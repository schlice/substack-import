<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [This is a great question, and a great suggestion. It\'s<br>clear that parents are not teaching kids that cops are their friends. So<br>if cops can do that in school, that is a great plan.\<br>\<br>We do have to have the right cops filling that role. Cops should<br>*volunteer for* that job, the city should not have to pay for that.<br>Heck, I\'d volunteer my time for that.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
