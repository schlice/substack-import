<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If using Tails OS and maintaining proper Opsec, what would be the<br>chances of being de-anonymized by the FBI and NSA?**<br><br>TAILS (The Amnesic Incognito Live System) has as its primary purpose<br>leaving no trace on the host computer. It also can communicate over TOR<br>networks using a TOR Browser. You don't need TAILS to be anonymous<br>online. Using the TOR Browser and being careful with what you access is<br>all you need for anonymous browsing.<br><br>Using the [[TOR<br>Browser](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=fc2a38&url=https://www.torproject.org/download/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="torproject.org"}]{.qlink_container} is simple enough.<br>Install and go. Watching where you log in to is more critical. For<br>example, if you use TOR to log in to your Gmail account, then they at<br>least know you logged in to your Gmail account. They may not know from<br>where, but they do know you logged in. So the OPSEC you discuss in your<br>question is critical. In other words, you're more likely to be<br>de-anonymized by the site you visit than you are by having your TOR<br>circuit back-traced. At best, they can tell you connected to a TOR entry<br>node, but even that packet is encrypted, so what you said and where you<br>went from there is still a mystery.<br><br>There was talk for a while about the NSA having sleeper nodes in the TOR<br>network, but even a sleeper node would still need to decrypt the entire<br>packet, and you'd only be able to do that if you had the private keys of<br>all three nodes in the circuit. Since you randomly generate a circuit<br>(and can do so again at any time), having all three private keys is<br>highly unlikely.<br><br>As I said at the beginning, the primary purpose of TAILS is to be able<br>to use any computer and leave no trace. Indeed, you can do this with<br>nearly any version of Linux which has a Live installer, such as Ubuntu.<br>What sets TAILS apart is that it has security inbuilt, so it boots into<br>a live session, AND uses a TOR circuit by default, AND communicates over<br>a TOR Browser. It also cleans memory and ensures that nothing is ever<br>communicate to the local hard drive at all. And unless you specifically<br>enable it, nothing is written to the USB stick either.<br><br>So to answer the question: **If using Tails OS and maintaining proper<br>Opsec, what would be the chances of being de-anonymized by the FBI and<br>NSA?**<br><br>If you did each one of those things perfectly, *virtually zero*. I'm in<br>Tech Support and I know better than to assure you that it will never<br>happen (remember, nothing is foolproof to the talented fool), but it is<br>so unlikely that it is *effectively* zero.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
