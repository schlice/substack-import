<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Is it illegal to press your penis against the front window of your own<br>house?**<br><br>As with all legal questions, the answer is "it depends."<br><br>And in this case, it depends on three things:<br><br>- Your age<br>- The state in which your front window is located<br>- The current state of your penis<br><br>In most states, display of genitals is considered to be "indecent<br>exposure." Many states have multiple statutes at different levels of<br>offense. For example, Colorado has a Petty Offense called Public<br>Indecency and a Misdemeanor called Indecent Exposure. Colorado does<br>not consider simple nudity to be either. The exposure must be done<br>in a way designed to sexually arouse someone else in order to be<br>considered indecent. For example, you would have to be touching yourself<br>"in a lewd manner" (according to the statute) for the exposure to be<br>indecent. The statute for Public Indecency also includes "a knowing<br>exposure of the person's genitals to the view of a person under<br>circumstances in which such conduct is likely to cause affront or alarm<br>to the other person." Pressing your penis against a window might<br>qualify. Simply being naked inside your home might not.<br><br>This leads in to the second point. If the penis is erect, you are likely<br>in violation of the indecent exposure law, which says that a person is<br>guilty if he or she "knowingly exposes one\'s genitals in view of<br>another in a way likely to cause alarm or offend with the intent to<br>arouse or to satisfy the sexual desires of anyone."<br><br>So the takeaway here is that in most circumstances, in most states,<br>pressing your penis up against your front window (presumably in full<br>view of the outside) is most likely in violation of one or more of your<br>state's indecency statutes. Even in states as permissive as Colorado,<br>you can still be charged. And if you happen to expose yourself to a<br>child, you're now "contributing to the delinquency of a minor" and now<br>you're a registered sex offender. Well done, penis presser. Well done.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
