<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Absolutely zero legal implications.<br><br>Regardless of how many neighborhoods are owned by a developer, each<br>association is bound by its own Governing Documents, and each has its<br>own Board of Directors. The developer can choose to enact whatever<br>Governing Documents he chooses for each neighborhood he owns, in<br>accordance with state law.<br><br>Once the homes in the neighborhood are all sold, the developer has no<br>further stake in the Association (unless given so by the Governing<br>Documents), and the Board can change that when the Board transitions<br>from developer control to homeowner control.<br><br>In other words, when the developer is done developing, the Board shifts<br>to homeowner control and becomes independent of the developer.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>What are the legal implications of having different rules for two<br>homeowners associations that are owned by the same developer but have<br>different board members?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
