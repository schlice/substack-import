Even if they take a picture<br>of someone visible from an open window. Also usually, the legality of<br>the photograph comes down to what the shooter intends to do with it. If<br>they want to use it to point out to the landlord that the maintenance<br>worker is violating company policy, or acting or behaving in a way<br>contrary to what the company would expect of a maintenance worker,<br>usually this would be acceptable.<br><br>**I feel my privacy was invaded\.\ I don't feel safe knowing she<br>watches inside my apartment.**<br><br>*Nothing says that it is illegal for you to close your blinds.* If you<br>wanted to exercise your right to privacy, it would have behooved you to<br>close your blinds. Otherwise, it's quite possible that someone could<br>claim that you did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy with<br>open windows visible to public areas.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
