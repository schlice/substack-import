<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If Trump pardons someone on a federal charge, can that same charge be<br>made at a state level, under state law?**<br><br>I see a lot of incorrect answers here. The correct answer is *yes,*<br>a state can charge someone for violation of the state crime even after<br>the Federal government has completed its prosecution, and this does not<br>violate the "double jeopardy" clause of the 5th Amendment.<br><br>The legal theory under which this can take place is called "*dual<br>sovereignty*." If two overlapping sovereigns (Federal and state) have<br>laws which make something illegal (let's use murder as an example), both<br>sovereigns can separately charge that crime and it is not considered to<br>be double jeopardy.<br><br>Therefore, to answer the question, if Trump pardons someone from a<br>Federal charge, a state is free to charge that person for the same crime<br>if it can be charged under state law. Very few of these individual<br>charges are chargeable at both the Federal and state levels; taxes are<br>paid separately to the Federal government and the state, so if you<br>failed to pay state tax appropriately, you can be charged by the state,<br>but the Federal government can't charge you for failing to pay state<br>taxes, so it's not the same charge.<br><br>If, however, one of Trump's staff were charged with murder, and that<br>murder could also be charged by the state, then a Federal pardon would<br>not exonerate the person at the state level.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
