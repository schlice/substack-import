<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Sexual assault is terrible. The fact that it has gone on for so long in<br>this country is deplorable. We need to start having more, open, and<br>honest conversations about sexual assault and affirmative consent in<br>this country.<br><br>However, today's trend of *accusers destroying men's lives with nothing<br>more than an accusation* is disturbing. We have shifted the burden *way*<br>too far towards the accuser, and have removed much of the recourse of<br>the accused. And this sometimes (not always, but sometimes) leads to<br>some people *taking advantage* of that imbalance.<br><br>In fact, some of Trump's accusers have been accused of lying about their<br>accusations. Some have even been accused of being *paid* to lie. We<br>don't yet know whether or not this is true, but if it is, it is just as<br>abhorrent as sexual assault.<br><br>So, the \$64,000 question (yes, I just dated myself): *How do we address<br>this?*<br><br>Perhaps this is a good time in this country to talk about some<br>*alternative remedies* to this problem.<br><br>- Perhaps it's time to hand this problem over to the courts. Yes, it<br>  will increase the workload on the court system, but perhaps this is<br>  the time to do it. We could do this by increasing the statute of<br>  limitations on sexual assault crimes. Aren't sexual assaults just as<br>  important to address as rape? Or murder? If you think so (and the<br>  national attention currently being given to these stories seems to<br>  agree), then maybe you should suggest some real change by increasing<br>  the statute of limitations on sexual assault crimes.<br>- Perhaps it's time to have a discussion about affirmative consent laws.<br>  Maybe we should start pressuring our state legislatures to enact some<br>  solid affirmative consent laws. Some states have already started to do<br>  so, but the laws are patchy around the country, and don't cover every<br>  situation. Some states have elected to address the issues on college<br>  campuses, while making no changes to the laws covering the remainder<br>  of their populations.<br><br>I think we could really make some positive changes rather than gutting<br>our own legal check-and-balance systems as we are.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
