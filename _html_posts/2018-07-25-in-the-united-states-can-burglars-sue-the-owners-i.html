<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**In America why is it that someone can jump your fence, break a window<br>and climb into your house, and if they hurt themselves while robbing<br>your house they can sue you? They were trespassing and breaking and<br>entering, why can they sue you?**<br><br>In the *vast* majority of states, you cannot. This is mostly urban<br>legend.<br><br>There are very very few cases where this has ever happened in the United<br>States, and only perhaps one or two fit your scenario.<br><br>The oft-cited case is *Bodine v. Enterprise High School,* where Ricky<br>Bodine climbed onto the roof of a gymnasium to either steal a floodlight<br>or to redirect it so he and his friends could play basketball. Whether<br>or not he was a thief is not at issue. He was a trespasser.<br>Nevertheless, Bodine, while walking on the roof of the high school gym,<br>stepped onto a skylight which had been painted over. He fell down to the<br>gym floor and injured himself fairly substantially (some accounts say he<br>broke his neck and is now a quadriplegic). He sued for \$8 million in<br>damages, and apparently settled out of court for \$260,000 plus \$1,200<br>per month for life.<br><br>Whether or not this case is actually true is not relevant. What is<br>relevant is how courts determine the cause of an accident, and how<br>courts determine who is at fault for that accident. Simply being a<br>trespasser does not alleviate the property owner of liability. For<br>example, even if I was an invited guest into your home, if I<br>accidentally go the wrong way and end up in an area I was not allowed to<br>go, I'm a trespasser. If I'm looking for the manager and I wander into<br>an employee-only area, I'm a trespasser. I'm not a burglar looking to<br>steal your stuff. I'm an innocently lost patron.<br><br>But the reason is really irrelevant. The question: *is the property<br>owner alleviated of liability simply because the injured person does not<br>belong there?*<br><br>And depending on the state (and the rules it uses to determine fault and<br>cause), you may still be liable for a person's injuries if the injury<br>was caused by something that you, as a property owner, could have<br>foreseen might injure someone.<br><br>The question comes down to negligence. If the property owner was<br>negligent, and it causes injury to another person, the injured person<br>can recover economic and non-economic damages which flow from that<br>negligence.<br><br>In order to determine who is negligent and to what degree, courts use<br>the "proximate cause" definition to determine "legal fault." This is<br>different from "actual cause" or the "cause in fact," which is the<br>actual event which caused the injury.<br><br>There are a few tests that states use to determine proximate cause. The<br>one that most states use is called the *"But For"* test. This test is<br>used to determine whether or not the injury would have happened at all<br>but for the defendant's negligent action or omission.<br><br>There are other states which use the *"Substantial Factor"* test to<br>determine proximate cause. A substantial factor is one that contributes<br>materially to the occurrence of an injury. An action contributes<br>materially when its causative effects are in operation until the moment<br>of injury.<br><br>In either case, the court must make a finding of proximate cause, and<br>then determine the level of negligence on the part of the defendant.<br><br>In the case of the skylight, the injured party would sue the school for<br>negligence, and the school would counter-sue the injured party for<br>trespassing. The trespassing would limit the school's liability for the<br>negligence (and if the details of the case are to be believed, they<br>did). They settled out of court for a modified amount which took both<br>parties' level of fault into consideration.<br><br>(EDIT) I have personal experience with this level of fault finding. My<br>wife was involved in a car accident (she was rear-ended). In Colorado,<br>rear-end accidents are *always* the fault of the driver behind. She<br>faced significant medical costs and rehabilitation time from her<br>injuries, and our lawsuit was designed to recoup some of those costs.<br>The actual cause of her injuries was being struck from behind. The<br>proximate cause of the accident was the woman who turned into the wrong<br>lane into oncoming traffic which caused traffic to come to a sudden and<br>complete stop which precipitated the accident. This was one factor which<br>reduced the driver behind's liability. The second factor was the fact<br>that she got hit so hard from behind that it sent her into the car in<br>front of her. Because she also hit the car in front of her (albeit with<br>far less force), the court was unable to say exactly how much of her<br>injuries were caused by the driver behind, and how much of her injuries<br>were caused by her impact with the vehicle in front. Clearly, if we were<br>using a "substantial factor" test in Colorado, the vehicle behind would<br>have been the substantial factor, but whatever. Because she impacted the<br>vehicle in front, she received a ticket for following too closely. And<br>because she got a ticket along with the person behind, and because the<br>driver behind was not completely at fault for the accident, the driver<br>behind's liability was limited, as was our award for damages.<br><br>It's not as black and white as you think.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
