<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [It\'s not legal to force anyone to have sex, ever.\<br>\<br>The law says that all sex must be consensual, and anyone can say NO or<br>STOP at any time, even while in the middle of the act, and it must stop<br>immediately, or it is considered rape.\<br>\<br>Both parties to the sex must consent. Both parties must be of a mental<br>state in which they can consent (i.e. not high or drunk out of<br>coherence). If any of this is not true, it\'s rape.\<br>\<br>Both parties must be of the age of majority in order to consent. In this<br>situation, regardless of whether or not there is verbal consent, it is<br>considered \"statutory rape\".]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
