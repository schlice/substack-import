<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [The sharp edges are called \"chines\" and are part of the<br>SR-71\'s design from the A-4 through A-6 models of the aircraft. The<br>main reason that this was added was to reduce the radar cross section<br>(RCS) of the aircraft. Besides the radar-absorbent material (RAM) which<br>is painted over the entire aircraft, early studies in stealth<br>technologies found that a shape with flattened, tapering sides would<br>reflect most radar energy away from the beam\'s origin location.\<br>\<br>They did find that the chines added additional lift, acting as<br>leading-edge extensions which also created turbulent (vs laminar)<br>airflow over the wings at high angles-of-attack (AOA), which helped to<br>prevent stalls. So besides creating a smaller RCS, it also helped the<br>plane fly better.\<br>\<br>Modern aircraft may use foreplanes called \"canards\" instead of<br>chines.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
