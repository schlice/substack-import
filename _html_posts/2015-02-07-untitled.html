<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: [*So\...If I can\'t see it and there is no proof that means<br>it does exist because lack of proof and evidence is what makes things<br>real in reality.*\<br>\<br>As Ron White said, \"You can\'t fix stupid. Stupid is forever.\" That\'s<br>not what I said *at all.* Go back and read it again. But in case my<br>answer was too confusing for you, I\'ll try to dumb it down a bit.\<br>\<br>What I said was that you cannot prove that God does not exist.\<br>\<br>I also said that I cannot prove that God does exist.\<br>\<br>Then, I said that you and I *both* operate on *faith*.<br>Since you cannot prove that God does not exist, **you are therefore<br>speaking on the basis of *faith* when you say that he does<br>not.**\<br>\<br>Similarly, I am speaking on *faith* **when I say that God does<br>exist.**\<br>\<br>Finally, I said that your leap of faith was much bigger than mine.<br>Former atheist Lee Strobel said, \"Essentially, I realized that to stay<br>an atheist, I had to believe that nothing produces everything, non-life<br>produces life, randomness produces fine-tuning, chaos produces<br>information, unconsciousness produces consciousness, and non-reason<br>produces reason. Those leaps of faith were simply too big for me to<br>take\.\\"\<br>\<br>He also said that the Christian worldview better accounted for the<br>totality of the evidence than the atheistic worldview.\<br>\<br>But that\'s a very in-depth discussion which is not suitable for this<br>forum.\<br>\<br>Plus. I don\'t think you\'ll get it. You are not in a state of mind to<br>be able to listen and try to comprehend. So I\'ll save my metaphorical<br>breath.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/Should-blasphemy-and-authoritarian-laws-be-written-out-of-the-Bible/answer/Bill-Stein<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
