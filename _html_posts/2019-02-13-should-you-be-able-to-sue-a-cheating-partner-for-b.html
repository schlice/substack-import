<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Should you be able to sue a cheating partner for breach of marriage<br>contract?**<br><br>If you signed a marriage contract, then sure, feel free to sue for<br>breach of contract.<br><br>But the "marriage contract" isn't a real contract. You do realize that,<br>right? Unless you have a contract that you signed and notarized, it's<br>not really a contract in the legal sense.<br><br>Marriage is two things. Primarily (and originally), it was a union<br>ordained by the church. The state co-opted the religious form of<br>marriage for a specific reason: *sex between men and women routinely<br>produces children.*<br><br>*Why would the state care about that?*<br><br>The state cares because the state has a compelling interest in the<br>welfare of children. To that end, the state encourages men and women to<br>structure their lives in the way which provides children the *best*<br>chance for success. Now before all the single mothers pounce, I said the<br>*best* chance for success, not the *only* chance for success. There are<br>excellent single parents out there who have done an absolutely Herculean<br>job raising their children. Some of them are my friends and I have<br>enjoyed watching them do what they do. They are simply amazing to me.<br>Despite their excellent examples, the best research we have today tells<br>us that children have the best chance for success when they are raised<br>by their biological parents in a common household.<br><br>Therefore, the state provides incentives when people structure their<br>lives in a way that would best support children (whether they have them<br>or not). This is why the state recognizes marriage.<br><br>Ever since the state made it no longer illegal to cheat on your spouse,<br>the whole theory of a "marriage contract" kinda disappeared. Because our<br>nation is moving away from religion anyway, marriage became this<br>state-sponsored tax break program which is entered into, and remains in<br>place, at the agreement of the partners.<br><br>Therefore, there is no "contract" in marriage any longer. It is an<br>arrangement of convenience. You can leave the arrangement at any time.<br>Just hire an attorney and you can dissolve your marriage.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
