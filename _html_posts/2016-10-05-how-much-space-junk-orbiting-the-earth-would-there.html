<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I always hesitate to add anything to an answer that [[Robert<br>Frost](https://www.quora.com/profile/Robert-Frost-1)]{.qlink_container}<br>has already answered, because it's hard to add any credibility after<br>him, but I do have one relevant piece of information.<br><br>I worked in NORAD.<br><br>Why, perchance, is that relevant?<br><br>As part of NORAD's Space Control mission, the Space crew maintains the<br>SCAT (that's pronounced "S - Cat", not "scat") The SCAT is the "space<br>catalog" which contains tens of thousands of pieces of cataloged space<br>junk down to the size of a baseball. We regularly maintain the SCAT by<br>ensuring the pieces of space junk are in their correct orbits and we<br>know where they are (i.e. their orbits have not changed significantly,<br>and have not decayed).<br><br>We have the SCAT in a big database which can actually be represented<br>graphically (not to scale, of course). It's actually quite beautiful<br>when represented that way.<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-5850a4f8fbb9bea725aa2013088a5675){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-5850a4f8fbb9bea725aa2013088a5675" master_w="998"<br>master_h="471"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>*(Image courtesy*<br>[*ComSpOC*(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=d1b42a&url=https://comspoc.com/spacebook/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="comspoc.com"}]{.qlink_container}*)*<br><br>When the Shuttle was flying (when I was there, it was), we would insert<br>the shuttle's actual flight path into the database, draw a 10 meter<br>"box" around the shuttle, and fly it forward in time, about 36 hours<br>forward to be precise. We would then have the computer tell us if there<br>was to be any "convergence" between the box and any debris in the SCAT.<br>If there was, we'd call whoever was controlling that Shuttle mission and<br>advise them of the convergence. I know that our input has prompted<br>several course corrections during the course of the Shuttle program.<br><br>I would not be surprised in the least if we do the same thing with the<br>ISS today.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
