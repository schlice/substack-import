<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Do they have the right to take you to the police station? As part of<br>fulfilling their duties, indeed they do. They have the right to ask you<br>to do anything they like. For example, they can ask you to do the<br>chicken dance on the sidewalk. Or they could ask you to take your hat<br>off. There are a million things they could ask you to do. But that's not<br>the question you should be asking.<br><br>The question you *should* be asking is whether or not you should do<br>what they ask.<br><br>The answer to *that* question is a little more complex. You must<br>determine whether or not you must go with them, or if it's just a<br>suggestion. That's harder for someone your age to do, especially without<br>a parent or guardian's assistance.<br><br>Let's say you ask them, "Are you detaining me?" or "Are you arresting<br>me?" If they say that you are not under arrest, you then have to<br>determine whether or not you feel comfortable going with them, or<br>whether or not you should just go home and talk to your parents about<br>it.<br><br>The bottom line: **if you are not being detained, you do not have to<br>stay! You can say "no thank you" and leave. You could also run, although<br>I would suggest walking.** If it's legal for you to leave, then the<br>speed at which you leave is irrelevant.<br><br>If they are not detaining you, you can ask for a card from the officer<br>and you can bring it home to your parents. They can then call the police<br>station and find out why the police thought it would be a good idea to<br>take a minor for a ride who was not being detained and who was without<br>parental supervision.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
