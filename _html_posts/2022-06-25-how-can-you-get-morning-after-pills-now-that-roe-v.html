<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Um, go to the store?<br><br>The morning after pill (or Plan-B) prevents the fertilized egg from<br>implanting in the womb, so an abortion technically never happens.<br><br>Our grocery store sells them. You can pick them up right at the Customer<br>Service counter, and this is in Florida, where abortion is illegal after<br>15 weeks.<br><br>Even in states which have completely banned all abortions, you should<br>still be able to buy Plan-B pills, because it's technically not an<br>abortion.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>How can you get morning after pills now that Roe v.
