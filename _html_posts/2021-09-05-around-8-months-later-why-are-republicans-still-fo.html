<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>1.  It's really hard to prove that Trump was "inciting a riot" when he<br>    intentionally included those two words in his speech. If he was<br>    directing his followers to try to take over the government, using<br>    the words "peacably and patriotically" would have gone against what<br>    you purport he was doing. So it kinda destroys the argument that he<br>    was fomenting the crowd into some kind of political takeover.<br>2.  Political speech is supposed to be inflammatory. It's supposed to<br>    spur people to action. That's actually a hallmark of an effective<br>    political speech. Can you see a Biden speech evoking the same kind<br>    of reaction? Doesn't that tell you something?<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Around 8 months later, why are Republicans still focused only on two<br>words (peaceably and patriotically) from Trump's 2 hour long<br>inflammatory \'fight\" speech on January 6th?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
