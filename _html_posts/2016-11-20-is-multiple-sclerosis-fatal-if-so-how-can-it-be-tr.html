<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Multiple sclerosis itself is not fatal. Patients can die from<br>complications caused by MS. For example, you could die from asphyxiation<br>caused by swallowing difficulties. But the disease itself does not cause<br>death.<br><br>In fact, with modern medications used to treat MS, lifespans of MS<br>patients nearly equal the lifespans of those without the disease. We<br>don't know what causes MS so we don't have a cure, but current<br>medications can slow down the disease progression and lessen its<br>effects.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
