This means the police can treat it<br>just as they do any other arrest warrant. Depending on the reason the<br>warrant was issued, they may not immediately serve the warrant. In such<br>a case, it can sit and wait until the next time you have an interaction<br>with police.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
