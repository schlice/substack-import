<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>> **Should we take the KJV as the official word of God or should we<br>> accept that it can sometimes cause misunderstandings due to literal<br>> translating?**<br><br>The short answer is no, we should not take the KJV as "the official<br>word of God," but not necessarily because of anything special regarding<br>the KJV.<br><br>The longer answer: there are two reasons why the answer is no:<br><br>- There is no one *best* translation of the Bible, but some come closer<br>  to the original words than others.<br>- The KJV has some well-known translation errors which have caused a<br>  great deal of confusion to believers.<br><br>There is no one best translation of the Bible. For completeness,<br>let's discuss how we translate the Bible, and why there are differences<br>in methodology when we do translations.<br><br>First, not all languages are created equal. Hebrew, as a language, has<br>fewer words than English, so each word has multiple meanings. So a<br>word-for-word translation would actually translate the word, but the<br>sentence may not convey the same meaning, because the author writing in<br>Hebrew may have meant one of the other meanings of the words. We have<br>exactly the opposite problem when translating from Greek. For example,<br>our word "love" in English has no fewer than *six* different words in<br>Greek. So when we say "love," which one of the six words in Greek are we<br>referring to?<br><br>Therefore, when doing a Bible translation, there are three different<br>philosophies that the translator can follow:<br><br>- Word-for-word<br>- Thought-for-thought<br>- Paraphrase<br><br>Each philosophy has its own advantages and disadvantages. Word-for-word<br>translations translate the words accurately, but sometimes miss the<br>thoughts. When you move up a level to thought-for-thought translations,<br>the translator will read an entire sentence in the source language and<br>then write it in the target language. It may not preserve the original<br>words, but it preserves the original thoughts. A paraphrase translation<br>doesn't worry about retention of words or thoughts, but it intentionally<br>*re-states* the paragraph, often adding many words in order to fully<br>describe what the original author was trying to say.<br><br>Here's a handy chart you can use to see where the various translations<br>land on the scale, from most word-for-word accuracy, to most<br>understandable in terms of what the author was trying to say.<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-6318b071f7b5cf5baf42863acee2fb10){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-6318b071f7b5cf5baf42863acee2fb10" master_w="730"<br>master_h="417"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>*(Source:* [*\[Infographic\: Types of Bible<br>Translations*](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=73e41f&url=https://www.ucg.org/vertical-thought/infographic-types-of-bible-translations){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="ucg.org"}]{.qlink_container}*)*<br><br>According to this, the most accurate word-for-word translation is the<br>New American Standard Bible (NASB), followed closely by the Amplified<br>Bible (AMP).<br><br>The problems with the KJV. The main problem with the King James<br>Version of the Bible is that the manuscripts the translators were using<br>were very few in number and contained many copy errors.<br><br>We need to understand that while these translations were being created,<br>we were continually finding more manuscripts, and so our ability to<br>error-check them continually improved over time. This means that older<br>translations of the Bible contain more errors than newer ones, since we<br>had fewer manuscripts at the time that some translations of the Bible<br>were being written.<br><br>Since the production of the King James version, many more manuscripts<br>were discovered which allowed us to error-check the earlier manuscripts<br>and come to better consensus as to the original text. This lack of<br>abundant manuscripts at the time of KJV's creation has induced some<br>well-known issues with its translation, including the false inclusion of<br>[[1 John<br>5:7--8](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=342adb&url=https://ehrmanblog.org/problems-with-the-king-jame-version-what-were-the-translators-translating/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="ehrmanblog.org"}]{.qlink_container}, which ended up being<br>included in the Latin Vulgate, and the KJV, but not later translations.<br>Another well-known issue with KJV is [[*the translation of the word<br>rasah in the Ten<br>Commandments*](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=9da804&url=https://www.gotquestions.org/you-shall-not-kill-vs-murder.html){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="gotquestions.org"}]{.qlink_container}. KJV translates the<br>word as "kill" and renders the Sixth Commandment: "Thou shalt not kill,"<br>but this translation of that word does not match the context nor the<br>usage of the word throughout the rest of the Bible. Subsequent<br>translations correctly translate the word as "murder" and the<br>Commandment is rendered: "You shall not murder."<br><br>> **With this said, should I follow a newer translation such as the NKJV<br>> or stick with the KJV?**<br><br>We do not consider any one specific translation of the Bible to be the<br>"gold standard" of God's Word. The gold standard is the very first<br>writing, the majority of which have been lost to history. The best we<br>can do is to reconstruct the actual words from manuscripts, and the more<br>manuscripts we discover, the better we can reconstruct and error-check<br>the original text, and the closer we come to a true representation of<br>the original text.<br><br>The KJV has some well-known errors, and was produced at a period of<br>history when the quantity of manuscripts, and the overall quality of<br>those manuscripts, was low.<br><br>In other words, there are better translations. I would not rely on KJV<br>as my sole source of Biblical understanding.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
