<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>So let's answer the question: should mobiles be banned for people<br>under age 18?<br><br>In order to answer that question, we have to determine if there is any<br>appreciable harm caused by mobile phones to people under 18.<br><br>You would also have to determine if there are any *benefits* provided by<br>mobile phones to people under 18.<br><br>If the harm outweighs the benefits, then maybe you have something there.<br>Maybe you can convince your lawmakers in your state to make it illegal<br>to possess mobile phones by those under 18.<br><br>But as with most things for people under 18, it is normally left up to<br>their parents to determine what is in their best interest. The only<br>time that this is not true is if something is detrimental to the public<br>at large, or it is so inherently dangerous that *even parents* should<br>not be allowed to approve their U18s to possess or use it.<br><br>So I think that passing a law is probably not the way to go, as there<br>are definitely benefits provided by mobile phones (as many of my<br>colleagues here have already answered). Therefore, it is probably in<br>everyone's best interest to keep allowing parents to make those<br>decisions.<br><br>However, you might think instead of mounting a public service campaign<br>to inform parents about the dangers of teen mobile phone use. Note that<br>you'll probably get a lot of pushback from the mobile phone industry,<br>which will release counter campaigns to show just how beneficial a phone<br>in the hands of a teen can be. I bet their ads will include the rape<br>scenario thwarted by a mobile phone. Heck, my phone even has an SOS<br>feature (if I enable it) that allows me to click the power button three<br>times in rapid succession and send a text message to 911 with my<br>location.<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-109c73996aa303dfd0fdfa4a52639ff8){.portrait .qtext_image<br>.zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-109c73996aa303dfd0fdfa4a52639ff8"<br>master_w="1440" master_h="2560"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>I think you'll have a difficult time getting any traction on your<br>proposal.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
