<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What is the purpose of the law prohibiting you from placing traps on<br>your property or tampering with your food to catch a thief? Are there<br>any morally wrong scenarios that it prevents?**<br><br>Setting traps which can harm someone in order to catch lawbreakers is<br>immoral because the traps are indiscriminate. They can harm a lawbreaker<br>exactly the same way they can harm a paramedic responding to a call for<br>service. They can harm a trespasser in exactly the same way that they<br>harm a child retrieving a lost ball. The food trap can harm your lunch<br>thief in exactly the same way as it harms the foreigner who doesn't<br>understand that the fridge in the break room is not community property.<br><br>On the legal side (not the moral side), bodily harm is not the<br>punishment for breaking the laws in question. You can't be sentenced to<br>be caught in a trap for breaking a boundary rule. You can't be sentenced<br>to hospitalization for a petty theft. Punishments are determined by a<br>court, not by an alleged victim.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
