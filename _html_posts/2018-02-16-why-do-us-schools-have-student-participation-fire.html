<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Don't know what schools you are discussing in the US, but they all have<br>active shooter drills.<br><br>The school calls them "lockdown" drills.<br><br>In fact, schools in my area are routinely put on "lockdown" when there<br>is police activity in the area of that school. For example, if there is<br>a manhunt in a local neighborhood near a school, the school is put on<br>lockdown.<br><br>Students are barricaded in classrooms and the classroom doors are locked<br>from the inside (cannot be opened from the outside). Students stay away<br>from the windows and hunker down in place.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
