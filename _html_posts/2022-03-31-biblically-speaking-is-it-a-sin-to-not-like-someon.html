<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Is it a sin to not like someone?<br><br>Don't confuse the biblical *love* for liking someone, or being friends<br>with them. Mark 12:28--31 says:<br><br>> One of the teachers of the law came and heard them debating. Noticing<br>> that Jesus had given them a good answer, he asked him, "Of all the<br>> commandments, which is the most important?"<br>><br>> "The most important one," answered Jesus, "is this: 'Hear, O Israel:<br>> The Lord our God, the Lord is one. Love the Lord your God with all<br>> your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all<br>> your strength.' The second is this: 'Love your neighbor as<br>> yourself.' There is no commandment greater than these."<br><br>The Hebrew word for love used in the bold is *agapÄ“seis,* the root of<br>which is<br>[*agape*(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=388322&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agape){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}*,* which is "love of<br>mankind." It is "the highest form of love" that the Hebrew language<br>could express. It's the kind of love God has for his people. So Jesus is<br>commanding us to love our neighbor with the same kind of love that God<br>has for his people, and also the same kind of love we have for<br>ourselves.<br><br>But *agape* doesn't mean you have to like them. It doesn't even mean you<br>have to be friends with them. Indeed, if you love them and you have an<br>issue with them, you should be trying to working it out. If you love<br>them and they are sinful, you are to show them through your love that<br>there is a better way to live.<br><br>Is it also biblical to love the sinner but hate their ways?<br><br>Absolutely. In fact, if you love the sinner (you should), you should<br>"hate" their sinful ways. This doesn't mean you can't be friends with a<br>sinner. Hello, we're *all* sinners. But that doesn't mean we must accept<br>their "sinful ways." We love the sinner, we don't love the sin. If I<br>wasn't friends with sinners, I'd have zero friends. We're all sinners.<br>This doesn't mean we condone their sin, though. We don't have to accept<br>it. We have to *love them through it.*<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Biblically speaking, is it a sin to not like someone? I am not talking<br>about hate or bitterness, but just having an issue with them. Is it also<br>biblical to love the sinner but hate their ways? Where in the Bible is<br>this true?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
