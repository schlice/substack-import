<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**In extreme circumstances, would you ever support defamation being a<br>crime in the US?**<br><br>I don't think "extreme" circumstances are necessary. I do think<br>"appropriate" circumstances are necessary. Those circumstances exist<br>when the traditional civil relief for libel or slander do not, and<br>cannot, adequately address the harm caused by the action.<br><br>For example, in the "ripped from the headlines" department, I would<br>support criminal defamation in the case where an accuser knowingly lies<br>about a sexual assault accusation. In today's society, an accusation of<br>sexual assault brings incredible harms to the accused, even without<br>evidence and without any presumption of innocence. The accused can lose<br>his job and his livelihood. An accusation can destroy marriages and<br>families, and even leads some to suicide, and all without evidence.<br><br>If this were to happen maliciously or falsely, a civil penalty could<br>never be enough to undo the damage done.<br><br>Sexual assault is a horrible crime and should be punished to the fullest<br>extent of the law. I don't want to take anything away from victims, and<br>the majority of women who claim they were assaulted actually were. But<br>we know from some recent high profile cases that not all women always<br>tell the truth, and some women use the accusation as a club to inflict<br>harm instead of as a tool for justice. I have no problem making false<br>allegations of sexual assault a crime of criminal defamation.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
