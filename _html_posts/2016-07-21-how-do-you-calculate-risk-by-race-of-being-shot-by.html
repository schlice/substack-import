<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>*How do I expose the flaw in logic claims that blacks only make up 13%<br>of the total population and whites 60% so blacks are twice as likely to<br>get shot?*<br><br>\<br><br>Short answer: While statistically you can make the claim that as a<br>percentage of society blacks are twice as likely to get shot by police,<br>those statistics are disingenuous because they ignore ***incidence of<br>crime*, or *situational factors* (the why** behind police<br>shootings).<br><br>Longer answer: The simple statistic that shows that blacks are twice as<br>likely as whites to get shot assumes that ***all police encounters are<br>equal.*** It's assuming that an officer pulling up on a disabled<br>motorist fixing a flat tire is equal to an officer pulling up on a<br>gunfight. The situation matters! The criminal activity (or lack thereof)<br>matters! The compliance of the suspect matters! Show me the YouTube<br>video that goes like this:<br><br>OFFICER: Step out of the car\<br>SUSPECT: \<steps out of car\>\<br>OFFICER: Put your hands on your head\<br>SUSPECT: \<puts hands on head\>\<br>OFFICER: BANG BANG BANG<br><br>You cannot show me this video because it does not exist. The risk of<br>being shot is determined by *what you do* during a police encounter,<br>not solely who you are. Combining *what you do* with *your race*<br>is what people are trying to come up with. They are claiming that two<br>people who do exactly the same things during a police encounter have<br>different risks of being shot simply because of their race.<br><br>This, by the way, is a figure you will never be able to compute, because<br>it has no basis in fact. It's not an objectively measurable figure.<br><br>You can calculate percentage of a particular race shot by police. You<br>can calculate percentage of a particular race in society. But there is<br>no logical comparison between those two numbers, because that essential<br>factor of *situational* *factors* will always be involved in<br>whether or not an officer pulls the trigger.<br><br>But if you look at the statistics, you'll find that the central thesis<br>of the Black Lives Matter movement --- that police pose the greatest<br>threat to young black men --- is an indictment that does not contain<br>*any* element of truth. In 90% of black homicide deaths, the shooter<br>is another young black man, not a cop. And in 95% of those cases, the<br>police are not even involved.<br><br>Since 2015 has complete statistics, we'll use those. According to the<br>[[Washington<br>Post](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=daba35&url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/national/police-shootings/?tid%3Da_inl){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="washingtonpost.com"}]{.qlink_container}, the police killed<br>990 people in 2015. 494 were white, 258 were black. That means that<br>police killed twice as many white people as they did black people.<br>According to these numbers, whites should be twice as nervous about<br>being killed by police than blacks.<br><br>But these numbers all ignore the blaring elephant in the room:<br>*incidence of crime*. In Chicago, blacks were 72 percent of all stop<br>subjects during a four-month period in 2014, reported the ACLU, whereas<br>whites were 9 percent of all stop subjects. But blacks and whites each<br>make up roughly 32 percent of the city's populace. Therefore, the police<br>are racially profiling. Right? Isn't that what these numbers say? But<br>add in incidence of crime, and you get a different picture. Blacks in<br>Chicago made up 79 percent of all known nonfatal shooting suspects, 85<br>percent of all known robbery suspects, and 77 percent of all known<br>murder suspects, according to police department data. Whites were 1<br>percent of known nonfatal shootings suspects in 2014, 2.5 percent of<br>known robbery suspects, and 5 percent of known murder suspects, the last<br>number composed disproportionately of domestic<br>homicides.\[1\](#AnFcd){#cite-AnFcd .citation_link}<br><br>So put those two together and you find that police stop blacks ***eight<br>times as often*** as whites (because they commit crimes eight times as<br>often as whites), but they die *half as often as whites* at the<br>hands of police. So statistically, if you're black, you're far more<br>likely to be stopped, but you're far less likely to be killed, by a cop<br>as your white counterpart.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-AnFcd){.citation_index} [[Chicago on the<br>Brink](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=965f54&url=http://www.city-journal.org/html/chicago-brink-14605.html){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="city-journal.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
