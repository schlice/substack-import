<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Can police arrest a suspicious looking man carrying two knives openly<br>in a public place? What would happen to the man?**<br><br>Let's break this down:<br><br>*Can police arrest a suspicious looking man?* Arrest requires **probable<br>cause**. This is a *reasonable belief* that a crime was committed or is<br>about to be committed. So long as the police have a reasonable belief<br>that this man committed a crime, they can arrest him and charge him with<br>that crime. But "looking suspicious" isn't a crime. So only because he<br>looks suspicious, he can't be arrested.<br><br>*Carrying two knives openly in a public place*: Describe "openly." Does<br>this mean openly on his belt in scabbards, or openly in his hands? The<br>difference is huge, as most places that allow people to carry knives<br>require that they be in sheaths. There are also blade length<br>restrictions. Assuming he meets all of those, he would be perfectly<br>fine. If, however, the knife blades were too long to carry, or if by<br>"carrying openly" you meant "in his hands," there would probably be a<br>bigger problem as the man would clearly be perceived as a threat and<br>could be arrested.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
