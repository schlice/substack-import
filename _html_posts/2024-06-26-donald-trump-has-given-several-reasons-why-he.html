<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>As far as I can find, Trump never said that he would lose. What he *has*<br>done is backed off of his usual rhetoric of Biden being a "low-IQ<br>individual" who is "the worst, most incompetent, and most corrupt<br>president" in the nation's history.<br><br>Last I heard, when he was on the *All In* podcast, he did soften his<br>rhetoric on Biden. "I assume he's going to be somebody that will be a<br>worthy debater," he said. "I don't want to underestimate him.\"<br><br>"Maybe I'm better off losing the debate,\" Trump commented in an<br>interview with *Real America's Voice* earlier this month. "I'll make<br>sure he stays. I'll lose the debate on purpose, maybe I'll do something<br>like that."<br><br>He also commented during the *All In* podcast about Biden's debate with<br>Paul Ryan in the run-up to the 2012 presidential election: "Well, all I<br>can say is this: I watched him with Paul Ryan, and he destroyed Paul<br>Ryan," said Trump. "So I'm not underestimating him. I'm not<br>underestimating him. It is what it is. We'll see what happens."<br><br>The rhetoric may be toned down, but the advice is correct. He's walking<br>into the lion's den, into a debate moderated by the anti-Trump network<br>CNN. He rightly posited, "I'll be debating three people instead of one<br>half of a person," at a rally in Racine, Wisconsin last week.<br><br>Legacy media sources read this situation as Trump setting up excuses in<br>the event he does poorly. But this may very well be because some<br>concerns have been raised by some in his party that he has set the bar<br>so low for Biden that he is sure to exceed it. And it underscores the<br>stakes for both men in a race that has appeared largely static for<br>months.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
