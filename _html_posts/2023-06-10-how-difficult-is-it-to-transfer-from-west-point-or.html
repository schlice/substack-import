<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I imagine it's pretty incredibly difficult, because I have never heard<br>of it being done, or possibly in extraordinarily exceptional<br>circumstances (like pro athletes or something). Entrance into a service<br>academy is not at all like acceptance into a university. Not only do you<br>have to be accepted, you also need to be nominated by a Congressman, a<br>Senator, or the President or Vice President. Those nominations<br>themselves are not easy to get. In other words, you work 100 times<br>harder to get in to a service academy than you do to get into a<br>university, which implies that you're pretty committed to your choice.<br><br>That said, there are some folks who, after attending their service<br>academy, decide that a career in another branch of the service would be<br>more appropriate for them. Maybe (like one guy in my class) he always<br>wanted to be a Marine but his Congressman didn't have any USNA slots, so<br>he came to USAFA, but man, he was a Marine.<br><br>What you can do in that case is called cross-commissioning. At<br>graduation, you accept a commission in another branch of service. When I<br>graduated, we had about ten folks accept commissions in other branches<br>of service, mostly from Air Force to Navy (Marines). Some went to Army.<br>We generally have just as many cross-commissioning into the Air Force<br>from other service academies.<br><br>Now, cross-commissioning is not guaranteed. The needs of the service<br>come first, and there must be an available commission in the gaining<br>service. But every year, somewhere around 1% of graduates will accept a<br>commission in another service.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
