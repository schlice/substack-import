<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Would it be ethical for police enforcement to identify potential<br>future offenders by creating baits and honeypots?**<br><br>No, because you don't identify potential future offenders by offering<br>them an opportunity to offend. That's entirely unethical and the<br>absolute wrong way to find offenders.<br><br>But word your question a little better and you'll get a better answer:<br><br>Would it be ethical for police enforcement to identify *current*<br>offenders by creating baits and honeypots?<br><br>Yes, baits and honeypots are most definitely ethical.<br><br>Baits and honeypots do not provide *motivation* to commit crime.\<br>Baits and honeypots do not provide *incentive* to motivate an otherwise<br>law-abiding citizen to commit crime.\<br>Baits and honeypots do not *entice* otherwise law-abiding citizens to<br>commit crime.<br><br>The only people *enticed, motivated, or incentivized* to commit crime in<br>the presence of a bait or a honeypot are *those who would have committed<br>crime anyway.*<br><br>Therefore, ethically, using baits and honeypots is acceptable.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
