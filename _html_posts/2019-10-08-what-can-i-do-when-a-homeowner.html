<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What can I do when a Homeowner\'s Association pops up in my<br>neighborhood? I purchased my home years ago and I specifically wanted<br>somewhere that a HOA didn\'t exist. Is my only option to move? The rules<br>have already been making an impact.**<br><br>The first thing you have to do is check that massive stack of paper you<br>signed when you bought your house. Make sure that there is no covenants<br>in it. Covenants that you signed when you bought your house would<br>indicate that there was actually an HOA in place.<br><br>**As long as you did not sign anything when you bought your house that<br>joins you to an HOA, and you did not sign anything while you owned your<br>house that added you to an HOA, then you are not part of an HOA.** The<br>only time you don't have to be part of an HOA is when it is formed<br>*after* you have purchased your home.<br><br>As long as you are 100% sure that you signed nothing to indicate that<br>you are part of the HOA, then you are fine. Ignore the rules. Ignore the<br>letters they send telling you they're going to sue you. If they do sue,<br>simply tell them you are not part of the HOA, and make it up to them to<br>prove that you are. They won't. If they say that 75% of the homeowners<br>can make rules that affect 100% of homeowners, they are wrong, and the<br>court will invalidate any rule or portion of the covenants that says so.<br>See my bolded statement above. If you were not part of an HOA **when you<br>bought your home** and the neighborhood decides to create one, you are<br>under no obligation to join it unless you choose to do so.<br><br>If you do sell your house, then the *next* buyer can join the HOA.ยน<br><br>But not you.<br><br>If you still feel uncomfortable ignoring the letters and the threats<br>from the HOA, I would suggest retaining an attorney. You would be<br>looking for a real estate attorney in your local area who specializes in<br>homeowner's association laws.<br><br>Good luck!<br><br>ยน Understand that there is a difference between a mandatory and a<br>voluntary HOA. In order for the Association to be mandatory, in<br>most cases you must have 100% participation from all the homeowners.<br>Some states do not require 100% agreement to create a mandatory HOA;<br>check your state laws to be sure. If you do not have the state-required<br>level of participation, the Association cannot be mandatory; it can only<br>be voluntary. A voluntary HOA cannot place liens on homes and cannot<br>force compliance with rules. It also cannot force any members to join.<br>It's more like a voluntary community club than an association. So for<br>instance, your voluntary HOA could fund improvements on a walking trail,<br>or fund cleanup of a lakeshore. You can choose to join the HOA or not;<br>it won't affect your access to the walking trail or the lake. Voluntary<br>HOAs are also sometimes called *affinity groups.*<br><br>A voluntary HOA can become mandatory, with the state-required<br>participation of current homeowners. **Of course, your mileage may vary.<br>Some states (i.e. Georgia) do not permit voluntary HOAs to become<br>mandatory HOAs. Check your state laws before taking any action.**<br><br>You cannot have a mixed association; you're either 100% mandatory or you<br>are voluntary; you cannot have both.<br><br>New construction HOAs are set up by the developer before any of the lots<br>are sold, so they are mandatory, as the developer has spoken for all<br>lots.<br><br>\<br><br>*DISCLAIMER:*<br><br>*STATE LAWS VARY. Check with your state before you use this information<br>to make any changes.
