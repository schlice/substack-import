<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Not really. Because while you can *conceive* of an infinite number of<br>things, you can't actually *have* an infinite number of things.<br>Infinity, in this context, is outside of the realm of the physical.<br><br>For example, you can conceive of an infinite number of points between<br>two bookends, but you can't put an infinite number of books between<br>those bookends. That's the difference between the abstract (which we can<br>conceive in our imagination) and the concrete (what we have on earth).<br><br>This, by the way, forms the basis of the *Kalam Cosmological Argument*<br>which proves that the universe had a beginning:<br><br>1.  An infinite number of days has no beginning and no end.<br>2.  But today is the end of history (history being a collection of all<br>    days).<br>3.  Therefore, there was a beginning to history (i.e. there were not an<br>    infinite number of days before today).<br><br>Because the timeline has an end, it must have had a beginning. The Law<br>of Noncontradiction says that something is either eternal, or it is not<br>eternal. Because our timeline has an end point, it is not eternal.<br>Additionally, you cannot add anything to an infinite number, but we will<br>add another day to history tomorrow. Therefore, logically, history is<br>not infinite.<br><br>The mind of God is even more difficult to conceive of. While again, we<br>can conceive of an infinite number of points on a mathematical line, we<br>simply cannot conceive of an infinite mind, one which knows everything<br>and is wholly complete.<br><br>Our human minds cannot grasp what an infinite mind must be like. We can<br>*imagine*, but even what we can conjure up in our imagination *pales in<br>comparison* to God's actual infinite mind.<br><br>The Bible echoes this thought:<br><br>> "For my thoughts are not your thoughts,\<br>> neither are your ways my ways,"\<br>> declares the Lord.\<br>> "As the heavens are higher than the earth,\<br>> so are my ways higher than your ways\<br>> and my thoughts than your thoughts." --- Isaiah 55:8--9 NIV<br><br>We simply cannot fathom the infinite mind of God.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
