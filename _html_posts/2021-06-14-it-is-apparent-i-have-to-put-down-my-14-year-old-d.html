<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>My vet, who saw this dog from the day she was 6 months old until the day<br>we transitioned her on to the next life, cried with us. She loved my dog<br>as much as I did. She pushed the injection in, and had to leave the room<br>because of her tears.<br><br>There is no shame in shedding a tear for ones who touched our lives as<br>intimately as our pets do. It shows you're human and you actually care.<br>That's a good thing. Vets are totally understanding. Modern vet<br>facilities even have a special room set aside for when we have to send<br>our pets on, and it has its own dedicated exit so you don't have to<br>traipse back through the lobby blubbering like a baby. This is a very<br>new design trend, and it hasn't totally caught on yet, so don't be<br>surprised if your vet doesn't offer this. But they should.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>It is apparent I have to put down my 14 year old dog soon. I'm not a<br>person who thinks pets as people. I am a realist, but I am having a<br>harder time than I thought. I dont want to cry in front of the vet,<br>techs, but the thought makes me tear up. Why?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
