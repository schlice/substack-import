<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>(US answer only)<br><br>As with all legal questions, the answer is "it depends."<br><br>First of all, we must distinguish who is doing the locking.<br><br>The Federal government has no authority to order states to lock down.<br>There is nothing in the Constitution which allows them to do so. This<br>means that not only can the Federal government not lock down people in<br>states, but Federal agencies also do not have authority to implement<br>lockdowns. So the CDC cannot issue a "lockdown order" which the states<br>would be required to follow. The CDC could create "guidance" which the<br>states "could" follow at their discretion, but they have no independent<br>authority to force any state to lock down.<br><br>Similarly, as court cases are consistently finding, the Federal<br>government has no authority to order state businesses to vaccinate all<br>of their employees against their will, or to condition continued<br>employment on receiving a vaccine against their will. The Federal<br>government may have authority over Federal contractors and the military,<br>but they do not exercise the same authority over businesses which are<br>registered to a state.<br><br>In contrast, states do have the authority to issue lockdowns, under<br>their police power. Indeed, the SCOTUS case everyone is quoting,<br>*Jacobson v. Massachusetts*, was a case where a city implemented<br>mandatory vaccinations, and it was upheld because of the state's police<br>power. Lockdowns would follow the same authority as vaccinations.<br><br>However, the lockdowns would face scrutiny, as it would be argued<br>whether or not the conditions exist to necessitate such Draconian<br>measures. Data would be analyzed and the decision to implement a<br>lockdown would be weighed against the relative risk to the public. There<br>would have to be a compelling state interest and a clear and present<br>danger in order to justify such measures. And lockdowns are not without<br>their own concomitant harms. There are absolutely harms to individuals,<br>groups, and businesses from lockdowns. Children, in particular, face<br>outsized harm from lockdowns. This is part of what the Court would have<br>to weigh to determine whether or not the lockdown was appropriate and<br>legal.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Are the coronavirus lockdowns unconstitutional?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
