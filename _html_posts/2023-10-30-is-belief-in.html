<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Original sin is central to the understanding of why we need Christ in<br>the first place.<br><br>Original sin is **the state of sin into which every human being is<br>born**. The doctrine states that humans inherit a tainted nature with a<br>tendency to sinful conduct. The biblical basis for the belief is found<br>in Genesis 3, the story of the expulsion of Adam and Eve from the Garden<br>of Eden. The garden was established for Adam and Eve to live in, and<br>they could eat from the fruit of any tree, *except for the two trees in<br>the middle of the garden.* When Eve took fruit from the tree of the<br>knowledge of good and evil (and gave some to Adam to eat), they<br>committed a sin: they broke God's commandment.<br><br>From that moment on, mankind inherited a sin nature. This eternally<br>separated man from God.<br><br>And it remained this way until God intervened, sending His Son to earth<br>to die as a penal sacrifice to atone for our inherited sin.<br><br>Without that original sin, we would not need a Savior.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
