<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I think it would just save everyone a lot of time if your sign instead<br>read:<br><br>THERE ARE NO GUNS IN THIS HOME!\<br>PLEASE COME ROB US, YOU ARE GUARANTEED TO NOT GET SHOT.<br><br>The whole point of not knowing who is armed is that criminals don't<br>know, either. They could walk into a house and get away scot-free, or<br>they could walk into a house and get shot. Their job is to minimize that<br>risk so that they have the greatest chance of being able to get away<br>without getting killed.<br><br>Handing them exactly the information they need will not make you, your<br>neighbors, or anyone else, safer. It will simply make you *a bigger<br>target.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
