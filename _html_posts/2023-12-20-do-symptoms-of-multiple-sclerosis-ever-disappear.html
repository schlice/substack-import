<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>In Relapsing-Remitting MS (RRMS), the most common form of MS, symptoms<br>get worse (a "relapse"), and then over time, gradually get better (a<br>"remission"). But just because the symptom improves doesn't mean the<br>disease has lessened. MS is still there, because the demyelination of<br>the nerve never goes away.<br><br>Over time, some people with RRMS may see their disease course change<br>into Secondary-Progressive MS (SPMS). SPMS is "secondary" because it<br>only occurs in people who have experienced Relapsing Remitting MS first.<br>In SPMS, symptoms will appear and will not go away; they will just<br>gradually worsen over time. SPMS can also be described as active<br>(with relapses and/or evidence of new MRI activity during a specified<br>period of time) or not active, as well as with progression<br>(evidence of more disability over time, with or without relapses or new<br>MRI activity) or without progression.<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-3b8d025cece7ca0fd243a56aff296b6c){.portrait .qtext_image<br>.zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-3b8d025cece7ca0fd243a56aff296b6c" master_w="331"<br>master_h="436"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>*(Image courtesy* [[*National Multiple Sclerosis<br>Society*](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=542f92&url=https://www.nationalmssociety.org/What-is-MS/Types-of-MS/Secondary-progressive-MS){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="nationalmssociety.org"}]{.qlink_container}*)*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
