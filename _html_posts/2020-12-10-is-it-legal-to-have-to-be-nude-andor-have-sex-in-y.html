<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Is it legal to have to be nude and/or have sex in your backyard, hence<br>on your property, if others (the neighbors) could clearly see from their<br>two story house?**<br><br>*(US Answer Only)*<br><br>I've already answered the question about whether or not you can be nude<br>in your backyard.<br><br>[[Bill Stein\'s answer to Can one get arrested for being nude in one's<br>backyard?](https://www.quora.com/Can-one-get-arrested-for-being-nude-in-one-s-backyard/answer/Bill-Stein)]{.qlink_container}<br><br>The question about having sex in your backyard is a little bit more<br>clear-cut, but still difficult to define for the United States. Each<br>state classifies it a little bit different, but to answer your specific<br>question, the fact that you have a neighbor who can see you from their<br>two-story house makes this a bit easier to say whether or not it's<br>legal.<br><br>In most cases, you would be committing what is known as lewd acts.<br>Again, each state is different, but in most cases, this covers all sex<br>acts committed in public. Clearly, the difference becomes what<br>constitutes "in public" and states are all over the map on this point.<br>In most cases, "visible by others" constitutes "in public." Check your<br>state and local laws to see how they define lewd acts.<br><br>You can also be charged with indecent exposure. Check my previous<br>answer about being nude in your own backyard with regards to the<br>differences between the states on indecent exposure.<br><br>These are not felonies. They are usually misdemeanors, which mean they<br>carry a fine, and possible jail time of up to a year, although in<br>practice it would be less than that.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
