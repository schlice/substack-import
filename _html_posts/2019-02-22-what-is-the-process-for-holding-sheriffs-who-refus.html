Can elected sheriffs only be removed by the people?**<br><br>In most cases, you will have to wait for the next election cycle to<br>remove a sheriff. Very few states have recall or impeachment processes<br>for the position of sheriff. You will have to check with the laws in<br>your state to see if there is a process for removing a sheriff from<br>office.<br><br>As your article mentions though, law enforcement has broad discretion<br>when determining when to enforce a particular law. The problem arises,<br>of course, when a sheriff opposes a law for political or ideological<br>reasons and makes those reasons into policy for his department. This is<br>where discretion collides head on with politics, but ultimately it comes<br>down to elections and state laws.<br><br>If enough people disagree with the sheriff's politics, perhaps a new<br>sheriff can be elected.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
