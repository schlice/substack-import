<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [As everyone else said, it won\'t completely eradicate mass<br>shootings.\<br>\<br>There is no silver bullet (no pun intended) that will eradicate mass<br>shootings.\<br>\<br>But it\'s a start.\<br>\<br>Many mass shooters have, in their manifestos or interrogations, praised<br>and idolized the mass shooters who went before them: Klebold and Harris<br>from Columbine, the Sandy Hook shooter, the numerous college campus<br>shooters. We do know that the publicity these shooters have garnered had<br>been a source of admiration (and sadly, emulation) for their progeny.\<br>\<br>If we send the message that you will get no fame or publicity, no one<br>will know you were the shooter, you will never be publicly vindicated,<br>and that \"anonymous shooter\" at X college campus is universally<br>vilified, this may remove some of the incentive some of these shooters<br>feel when performing their own copycat shooting<br>sprees.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
