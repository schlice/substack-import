<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>This is an interesting question, and a very specific one.<br><br>Basically, the only research we have shows that, unsurprisingly, homes<br>where firearms exist have higher rates of suicide, and higher likelihood<br>of homicide, using a firearm.\[1\](#tQNOT){#cite-tQNOT<br>.citation_link}\[2\](#DWWpF){#cite-DWWpF .citation_link}<br><br>I almost think that goes without saying, but if there are guns in a<br>house, there is an increased risk of those guns being used for either<br>homicide or suicide. Homes where guns are not present have a decreased<br>risk of homicide or suicide which involves a firearm.<br><br>Note that there was no correlation made between a home with firearms and<br>*non*-firearm homicide or suicide. Therefore, we cannot tell if this<br>is a *correlation* or a *causation*. Remember, firearms make killing<br>*easier*, they don't make killing *possible*.<br><br>What can we do about this? There are a few things.<br><br>- Better mental health services. Suicide prevention is the number one<br>  thing we can do to stop this, because if someone is committed to<br>  suicide and/or homicide, the presence or absence of a firearm will not<br>  deter them. This is a cry for help, and we need to do a much better<br>  job of answering that cry.<br>- Safe storage laws. Look, we know there is an incompatibility between<br>  accessibility of a firearm and being able to rapidly employ that<br>  firearm to use to defend your home. But I think that home safes have<br>  come far enough technologically that they qualify as safe storage, yet<br>  allow for rapid access. We need to do better in both providing public<br>  funding so people can have safe storage, but advance the safe storage<br>  technology to the point where it is both rapidly accessible, and still<br>  safe.\<br>  \<br>  We must be careful here though, simply mandating safe storage will be<br>  found to be unconstitutional, so this must be done gradually, with<br>  public funding, in order to not infringe on the right to keep and bear<br>  arms. Make no mistake: **the desire to curtail murder-suicides is not<br>  justification enough to infringe on a Constitutional right.**<br>- Smarter gun owners. If you know that someone in your home is suicidal,<br>  you had better remove access to firearms from them. Lock them up. Be<br>  smart about being a gun owner.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-tQNOT){.citation_index}<br>[https://ajph.aphapublications.or\...(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=e1ef30&url=https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/full/10.2105/AJPH.2013.301409){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="aphapublications.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>\[2\](#cite-DWWpF){.citation_index}<br>[https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/\...(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=1dcb84&url=https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/m13-1301){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="acpjournals.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
