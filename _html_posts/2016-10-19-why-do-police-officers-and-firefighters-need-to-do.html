<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>> *Why do police officers and firefighters need to do fund-raising*<br><br>Short answer: they don't.<br><br>You asked why the need to do fundraising. They don't need to do<br>fundraising. They want to do fundraising.<br><br>The money they raise does not go to their operating budget. It doesn't<br>buy trucks, hoses, boots, air tanks, cars, uniforms, or ballistic vests.<br>The fundraising that police and firefighters do go to projects that are<br>important to them.<br><br>Famously, firefighters do a [[**Fill The<br>Boot**](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=afbe49&url=https://www.mda.org/get-involved/fill-the-boot){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="mda.org"}]{.qlink_container} campaign to raise money for the<br>Muscular Dystrophy Association (MDA).<br><br>The most common fundraiser conducted by police agencies are fundraisers<br>designed to provide money to families of officers killed in the line of<br>duty. These are not as spirited or as widespread as the Fill The Boot<br>campaign, but again, they do not go into the operating budgets of the<br>departments. Tax dollars fund their operations.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
