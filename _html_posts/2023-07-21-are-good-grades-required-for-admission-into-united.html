<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Yes, good grades are required. I'm going to speak specifically about the<br>Air Force Academy, but you can apply this same guidance generally across<br>all the Service Academies.<br><br>While there isn't a specific GPA you need to achieve in order to be<br>accepted, the recent entrants into the Air Force Academy have averaged<br>in the top three percent of their high school classes.<br><br>Here's the minimum of what you need out of high school in order to be<br>academically competitive for an appointment to the Academy:<br><br>- Four years of English (with a college preparatory class in<br>  writing)<br>- Four years of math\<br>  Strong background in geometry, algebra, trigonometry and precalculus.<br>  A solid foundation in algebra is more important that exposure to<br>  calculus.<br>- Four years of science\<br>  Lab-based and should include biology, chemistry and physics<br>- Three years of social studies (to include a course in U.S.<br>  history)<br>- Two years of a modern foreign language\<br>  We look for modern foreign languages with an emphasis on strategic<br>  languages such as Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, Spanish, German, French,<br>  Portuguese and Russian. While not a modern foreign language, Latin is<br>  acceptable. American Sign Language is not an acceptable course.<br>- One year of computer study\<br>  Computer Science course or related courses that focus on coding,<br>  programming and web development<br><br>\<br><br>You'll also need to take the SAT and/or ACT. Again, while there aren't<br>specific minimums you must hit to be accepted into the Air Force<br>Academy, students who score below 620 Evidence-based reading and writing<br>or below 580 math on the SAT reasoning test and below 24 English/reading<br>and 25 math/science on the ACT normally will not be competitive for an<br>appointment *directly* into the Academy.<br><br>If you're not competitive for an appointment *directly* into the<br>Academy, you may be considered for an appointment to the Prep School.<br><br>\<br><br>Don't forget that academics are just one part of the overall package you<br>need to bring to the Academy for admissions.<br><br>If you're interested in applying to the Air Force Academy, read up on<br>what's required at the Admissions website:<br><br>[https://www.academyadmissions.com/(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=60e33c&url=https://www.academyadmissions.com/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
