<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>You're headed in the right direction, and it sounds like your mind is in<br>the right state, so I'm afraid I don't have any constructive advice for<br>you other than keep doing what you're doing. You've found what doctors<br>found, surprisingly, not too long ago, that exercise and muscle-building<br>exercises actually improves MS symptoms, where just 15 to 20 years ago<br>(not all that long at all, medically speaking) doctors were advising MS<br>patients to work out less, because they were more concerned about the<br>after-effects of heating up the body. Thankfully, they've learned what<br>we already know: working out makes you feel *better*, not worse.<br><br>I'd also consider adding a nutritionist to your care team. So many<br>people don't have a registered dietitian as part of their care team, and<br>I think they miss a fundamental function by not including that aspect as<br>well. It might be something you could benefit from. Your physical<br>therapist, unless they are quite unique, probably won't fill the bill.<br><br>I actually added an eastern medicine-trained chiropractor to my care<br>team. He has added acupuncture and hyperbaric oxygen therapy to my<br>treatment plan, along with some, er, interesting herbal choices, but<br>it's a great addition to my plan. His holistic approach balances out the<br>very western medicine-oriented remainder of my care team.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/Im-a-female-weight-lifter-with-multiple-sclerosis-What-changes-to-my-diet-exercise-routine-will-help-me-become-lighter-and-faster/answer/Bill-Stein<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
