<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>To reliably root your phone, you need to use a computer and Samsung\'s<br>software loading tool called "Odin."<br><br>There are sites that claim to be able to load a kernel to your phone<br>without a computer, but they are sketchy at best, and virus laden at<br>worst.<br><br>Once you are rooted, you can flash kernels to your phone from the phone<br>itself. But without root, the only way to do this reliably is with a<br>computer. Find a friend with a PC if you must, but that first root needs<br>a PC.<br><br>You should look into PingPongRoot which will avoid tripping Knox. If you<br>don\'t know what that is or why it\'s important, perhaps you should look<br>into why you want to root in the first place.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
