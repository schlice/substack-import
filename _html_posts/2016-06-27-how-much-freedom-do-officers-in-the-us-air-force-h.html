<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>When you're not working at your job, you can do whatever you choose with<br>your off-duty time. The regions where Air Force bases are quite diverse<br>and within a few hours' drive or train ride of any of them, you can<br>reach nearly every corner of the world.<br><br>Each job is different, and the requirements in each position in which<br>you find yourself could limit how far away from your duty station you<br>can go. But each one of those requirements is different depending on the<br>position you are billeted to.<br><br>You should discuss those restrictions with your immediate supervisor<br>when you get to your duty station. The transition office at each Air<br>Force base has all sorts of information on what you can do on and off<br>base.<br><br>Hopefully this is what you were asking. If not, please add some more<br>description to the Question Comments, and I'll revise.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
