<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>As a former Board member in a Florida HOA, I can tell you that while the<br>HOA does have the authority to restrict on-street parking on public<br>streets within the neighborhood they control, it is very difficult in<br>practice to do so, and their remedies are limited.<br><br>If your Governing Documents say that you can't park on the street, what<br>will happen if you do? The Board sends you a letter telling you to not<br>park on the street. If you do it again (or whatever the requisite amount<br>of times needed to trigger action), **the only remedy the HOA has is to<br>fine you**.<br><br>They can't tow your car. They can't boot your car. They can only issue a<br>fine. And this is perfectly legal, despite what any government agent may<br>tell you. **It's only the opinion of your HOA's attorney that matters<br>here.**<br><br>Florida HOAs are indeed legally authorized to fine you for breaking<br>their rules, even if what you are doing is controlled by another<br>government entity.<br><br>For example (our board in Colorado faced this problem), the state says<br>you can park no closer than four feet from a fire hydrant. The county<br>says you can park no closer than six feet from a fire hydrant. The HOA<br>followed the county's rule. But can you park four feet from the fire<br>hydrant because the state said so? No, because the county made a<br>*stricter* rule than the state.<br><br>The general rule is that the smaller component organization can make<br>*stricter* rules than the larger organization, but not *looser* rules.<br><br>So if the state said you can park no closer than six feet, but the<br>county said you can park no closer than four feet, this would be<br>unlawful because the county would be making the state law more lax.<br><br>Here's another example. The state says you can have as many flags on the<br>outside of your house as you like. The HOA says you can only have two.<br>The HOA has the stricter rule, so it's legal.ยน<br><br>In general, this applies to HOAs, which are registered<br>quasi-governmental entities. So the county can allow street parking and<br>the HOA can disallow it, and this is legal.<br><br>But as we've pointed out, their remedies are limited. And in practice,<br>it's really difficult for an HOA to enforce. How do they know which<br>homeowner owns which cars? Run license plates? The HOA attorney or the<br>managing agency can do this, but it's usually about \$50 per plate to do<br>it. It's a slow process, and what happens if the person to whom the car<br>is registered is not an owner in the neighborhood? You can't collect any<br>fine money from that person, so that \$50 goes to waste.<br><br>In practice, in Florida, we had a "no street parking ever" rule, but the<br>County also enforced single-side street parking, and all streets had No<br>Parking signs on one side of the street (they were narrow streets). So<br>as a Board, we did not enforce the "no street parking ever" rule against<br>anyone (which is legal), and we referred all parking issues to the<br>county. But in Colorado, there were no street parking restrictions, and<br>the HOA said no street parking ever, and we enforced it. We had at least<br>one resident who didn't like that rule so much that she sold her house<br>and moved. Meh, can't please 'em all.<br><br>TL;DR: Yes, Florida HOAs can enforce "no street parking" rules<br>through fines, but it is time consuming and expensive to do so, so many<br>do not.<br><br>ยน There are some rules that the HOA cannot violate; for example, some<br>states mandate that you are permitted to have a flagpole to fly the<br>American flag and that no one can restrict that rule. So even if a lower<br>component entity wanted to restrict flagpoles, they would be unable to<br>do so.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
