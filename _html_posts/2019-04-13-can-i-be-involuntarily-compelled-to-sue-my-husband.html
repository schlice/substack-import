You can't be compelled to sue your lawful spouse. First of all, at<br>    common law, you can't sue your spouse because legally, a married<br>    couple is considered a single entity. This is referred to in common<br>    law as "spousal immunity." While some states have laws against suing<br>    your spouse, most states only carve out exceptions where spousal<br>    privilege doesn't apply.<br>2.  You can't be compelled to sue anyone. Whether or not you sue is up<br>    to you. There is no legal mechanism that can compel you to file a<br>    lawsuit against someone, and I can't find any relevant case law<br>    where someone was compelled to sue someone else against their will.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
