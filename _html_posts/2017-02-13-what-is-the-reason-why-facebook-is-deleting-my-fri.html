<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Short answer: Facebook does not delete your friends.<br><br>Longer answer: There are a number of reasons why friends may be missing<br>from your friend list, and most of them are not nefarious or suspicious.<br><br>1.  **You may have been unfriended, or you may have unintentionally<br>    unfriended someone.** When someone unfriends you, you are not<br>    notified. The friend simply is removed from your list. You may have<br>    actually unfriended the person. This can happen unintentionally when<br>    you remove other friends.<br>2.  The friend's account may have been deleted. If the friend<br>    deleted his or her account, it will also similarly disappear from<br>    your friend list. You can search for the friend, but if you get<br>    nothing in search, the account is either gone or the new account has<br>    its privacy settings set so that it cannot be found in search.<br>3.  Your account may have been compromised. Facebook says that if a<br>    large number of your friends are missing, your account has likely<br>    been compromised. At the very least, you should immediately change<br>    your Facebook password. For better security, consider using<br>    two-factor authentication either with an authenticator app,<br>    using SMS, or using the Facebook Authenticator, which is part of the<br>    mobile app. You can find these settings under *Security* from<br>    Facebook's settings. Never give out your Facebook password and<br>    always ensure you are logging in to Facebook\'s main page,<br>    [www.facebook.com(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=58131e&url=http://www.facebook.com){.external_link<br>    rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>    onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>    qt-tooltip="facebook.com"}]{.qlink_container}, to avoid unknowingly<br>    logging in to a scam website. Don't follow links to Facebook; log in<br>    yourself and then find what you are looking for. If you are using a<br>    public computer (such as in an internet cafe or at the library),<br>    make sure you use "incognito mode" or the "private browsing"<br>    function (if the browser offers it) so that none of your history is<br>    saved on the local system, and make sure you log off at the end of<br>    your session.<br><br>But let's assume that none of the above are true, and a friend simply<br>disappeared from your friend list. Is it true that "Facebook deleted<br>your friend?" This implies intent on Facebook's part to willfully remove<br>that friend from your friend list, and with the volume of Facebook<br>users, it's highly unlikely that they went into your friend list and<br>flicked a few names off. If none of the other reasons listed fit your<br>scenario, it's quite possible that there is a bug in Facebook's friend<br>system that removes friends with no intervention on your part. It would<br>be worth a call to Facebook Technical Support in such a case.<br><br>**TL;DR: It's far more likely that it is a software glitch in Facebook's<br>software causing your friends to be automatically unfriended than any<br>malicious intent on Facebook's part.**<br><br>\<br><br>Hi readers!
