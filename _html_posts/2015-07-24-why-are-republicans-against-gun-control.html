<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [[[Jeff<br>Dege](https://www.quora.com/profile/Jeff-Dege)]{.qlink_container} is<br>spot on, and the assumption in your question is quite offensive.\<br>\<br>Republicans are not against gun control. Republicans are against passing<br>more laws which will do nothing other than restrict the rights of<br>law-abiding gun owners (of which it is estimated there are over<br>100,000,000 in the US) when doing nothing to stop actual criminals from<br>acquiring guns.\<br>\<br>There are sensible laws that we can pass, and sensible things we can do.<br>Primarily, we can start cutting down on the places from which a criminal<br>can get a gun:\<br>]<br><br>- Colorado recently required that all private transactions of firearms<br>  must be reviewed by a FFL (a dealer with a Federal Firearms License)<br>  so that the buyer can be vetted to ensure he meets Federal<br>  requirements to buy a gun, and the seller meets Federal requirements<br>  to sell a gun. It doesn\'t add much time to the process, and it<br>  certainly doesn\'t add much cost to the process. Plenty of local FFLs<br>  provide the background certificate, so it\'s not a huge inconvenience,<br>  and it ensures that transfers between private parties are tracked. I<br>  would love to see that system expanded.\<br>- I will still continue to assert that technology has advanced to a<br>  point where we can start requiring some sensible in-home secure<br>  storage requirements for firearms, reducing theft of legally-owned<br>  firearms.<br>- The government, for its part, needs to start cracking down on illicit<br>  FFLs who facilitate illegal sales. The ATF is woefully inadequate for<br>  the task, in both funding and manpower. Many FFLs go up to ten years<br>  between audits, and when 1% of FFLs sell guns that end up in over 60%<br>  of guns found at crime scenes and traced to dealers, it seems a fairly<br>  easy issue to tackle. But they are so behind on inspections that<br>  they\'ll never be able to catch up, and they very rarely revoke FFLs<br>  even when the dealer is found to be in violation. ATF really needs to<br>  clean house.\<br><br>Now, I know my gun-rights colleagues will counter that this barely puts<br>a dent in the flow of illegal guns; indeed, it actually increases the<br>popularity and the business in the black market (which is anyone who<br>doesn\'t follow the law, as well as illegal importers of guns and<br>strawman purchasers). But let\'s start with the low-hanging fruit.<br>Sensible storage requirements can help to curtail in-home accidental<br>shootings and thefts of privately-owned guns. It\'s certainly not the<br>largest source for guns used illegally, but it\'s a start. Enforcing the<br>laws we already have (looking at you, ATF) is another way we can start<br>to make inroads into the illegal transit of weapons.\<br>\<br>But silly laws like limiting magazine capacity or restrictions on scary<br>colors or scary attachments do nothing at all to stop criminals.<br>Republicans are wholly against laws like those. Limiting magazines to<br>reasonable sizes (which can be determined by croudsourcing: look at the<br>most popular magazine sizes in sales, and you\'ll find your answer) is<br>appropriate. Drum magazines should not be sold (and no one would use<br>them anyway as they are prone to jamming \-- just ask James Holmes).<br>Existing restrictions on military weapons should remain. Not<br>military-looking weapons, military weapons like automatic weapons and<br>anti-personnel weapons (grenades, mines, etc).<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
