<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What exactly is involved in the \"universal background checks\" that<br>gun control advocates want?**<br><br>Look at Colorado, which recently implemented universal background checks<br>at the state level.<br><br>Basically, universal background checks means **any time a firearm<br>changes ownership, a background check must be performed, no<br>exceptions.**<br><br>Buying or selling a private firearm? Background checks. We didn't need<br>to do this previously under state law, so this might be the only area<br>where such a law is beneficial. Private party sales. But we'll come back<br>to the only potentially useful scenario later.<br><br>However, implementing UBCs without exceptions opens up a whole series of<br>problems.<br><br>- Gifting a firearm to a family member? Background checks. That's right,<br>  if I bought that pretty pink M&P Shield for my wife, I have to do a<br>  background check on her. Or if I bought a Henry rifle for my son on<br>  his 18th birthday, I have to do a background check on him. Does this<br>  sound reasonable?<br>- One year while I was living in Colorado, my house was placed under<br>  pre-evacuation orders due to wildfire. I gave my firearms to my friend<br>  to place in his gun safe for safe keeping, which worked out great.<br>  Incidentally, I did the same for him when his own house was under<br>  evacuation orders for a different wildfire. Under the UBC law, I would<br>  have to do a background check on him before he can take my firearms to<br>  store them, even in an emergency.<br><br>Administratively, this becomes a nightmare. How long do I have to retain<br>the record of the background check? How long do I have to retain the<br>record of the sale? Who gets punished if the background check wasn't<br>done? Who is going to follow up on all of these violations of the law?<br>The police? Sure, they've got plenty of extra time to take care of that.<br>And finally, I can't do background checks on my own; I need someone with<br>a Federal Firearms License (FFL) to do the check for me. Great for<br>business for local FFLs, but now any gun sale costs me more because I<br>have to do a background check, and FFLs charge money to do a background<br>check. Which means that all guns now cost incrementally more, which<br>means we put the burden on the segment of society that needs cost<br>increases the least: the poor. This law effectively may price the poor<br>out of the gun market, which means that the law effectively denies them<br>the ability to exercise their rights.<br><br>State data for the states which have implemented universal background<br>checks shows that the checks have done nothing to stem the rise in<br>homicides. Delaware saw a significant increase in background checks, but<br>also saw its homicide rate significantly increase as well; from 4.4 in<br>2013 to a 30-year high of 6.6 in 2015, before dropping slightly to 5.9<br>in 2016. Colorado saw a modest increase in background checks, but also<br>saw an increase in homicides, 3.3 to 3.7. In all the states studied<br>which implemented universal background checks, they saw increases in<br>homicide rates.\[1\](#NebqW){#cite-NebqW .citation_link}<br><br>It's almost as if background checks had no effect at all.<br><br>Maybe it's because the people who are complying with background checks<br>are not the people committing crimes. Criminals aren't buying their guns<br>from people who are going to conduct background checks. Instead of<br>focusing our time on getting tougher on gun crimes and the people who<br>commit them, we instead go after people who are already following the<br>law. Does that seem right to you?<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-NebqW){.citation_index} [[Evidence That Universal<br>Background Checks Are A Universal<br>Failure](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=7ad332&url=https://bearingarms.com/tom-k/2017/10/18/evidence-universal-background-checks-universal-failure/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="bearingarms.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
