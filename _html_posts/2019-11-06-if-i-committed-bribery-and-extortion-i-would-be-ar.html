They are crimes.<br><br>If evidence of bribery and/or extortion is present, that evidence should<br>be taken immediately to the FBI so that it can be investigated.<br><br>So if someone had actual evidence that Trump had committed the crimes of<br>bribery or extortion, that evidence should go to the FBI and the US<br>Attorney's Office for action.<br><br>The lack of these actions indicates that there is no evidence that<br>either of those two crimes has taken place.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
