<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The real answer is \"it depends.\"<br><br>There are many definitions of the beginning and the end of a river.<br>Sometimes, to find the source of a river requires defining the end of<br>the river. Some definitions of the end of a river:<br><br>- greatest distance away<br>- greatest drop in altitude<br>- a lake with many inflows but only one major outflow<br><br>And probably the oddest definition<br><br>- the place where people stop using the river\'s name<br><br>The Top Gear crew took a rather dubious postulation, following the<br>\"lake with one outflow\" definition, and stated that the mouth of the<br>Nile was not actually in Alexandria, but at the other end of the<br>Mediterranean, at the Straits of Gibraltar. This allowed them to define<br>other sources farther west which feed the Med, leading them to find a<br>source southwest of Lake Victoria.<br><br>Also, keep in mind that there is no one source of a river. There are<br>many bodies of water that feed a river. A combination of definitions can<br>lead you to find a source of a river, or selectively including/excluding<br>certain definitions can lead you to another source.<br><br>So if you use a more loose definition of what a river is (assuming that<br>the Mediterranean is actually part of the river), then the Top Gear crew<br>may have found a source.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
