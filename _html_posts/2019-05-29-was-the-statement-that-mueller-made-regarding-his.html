<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Why is the lie that Mueller declined charging the president with<br>obstruction due to OLC precident being spread?**<br><br>Because it's not a lie.<br><br>He really failed to do his job because he truly believed that a OLC<br>policy told him he couldn't. Which really makes no sense: why would the<br>DOJ ask him to investigate obstruction if he couldn't charge<br>obstruction?<br><br>So instead, he did a legal side-step. He said that he did not render a<br>decision because he thought it wouldn't be fair to recommend charging<br>someone who couldn't be charged. But he also said that Congress has<br>another method by which you accuse a sitting president of wrongdoing.<br><br>In case you weren't sure what exactly was going on here: ***Mueller teed<br>up the ball for Congress to hit an impeachment home run.***<br><br>Basically, Mueller set the stage for Congress to impeach the President.<br>He's practically begging them to do it. He gave them all the evidence<br>they need to move forward *today* with Articles of Impeachment. All the<br>legwork has already been done. Now, Congress needs to *grow a spine*<br>and actually impeach. If they're brave enough. Which they're not.<br><br>They won't impeach because they know that impeachment proceedings now<br>will be a guaranteed victory for Trump in 2020.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
