<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Well [[David<br>D](https://www.quora.com/profile/David-D-960)]{.qlink_container}, you<br>either have the strangest-sounding girl's name, or you need to do a<br>better job creating a fake account, which incidentally has not added any<br>other content to Quora (like, literally none) except for this question.<br>PRO TIP: if you're going to claim you are a 23 year old female, you<br>should have a name which could reasonably be construed to be a 23 year<br>old female (and maybe find a random picture on the Internet to be your<br>account picture; it might make the lie more believable).<br><br>As if this particular troll question actually needs an answer, but I<br>feel compelled to nip this little desperate attempt to fulfill a sexual<br>fantasy in the bud.<br><br>In nearly every country in the world, masturbation or any other sex act<br>is not a covered health care service. No health care worker who wants to<br>keep their job would ever masturbate a patient. Think about it. A paid<br>worker providing sex services is not a health care worker. She is a<br>prostitute. Maybe prostitution is legal in your country; in that case,<br>maybe you could hire a prostitute to help the boy out, if he can legally<br>receive those services in your country.<br><br>But health care workers cannot perform sex acts on their patients. That<br>is the stuff of the evening news, not a proper health care service.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
