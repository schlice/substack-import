<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Will the Trump defense team request dismissal of the impeachment for<br>lack of showing constitutional cause after the house managers present<br>their case?**<br><br>Again, this all goes back to the fallacy that this is a trial.<br><br>*THIS IS NOT A TRIAL*.<br><br>The Senate will not function as a courtroom. I know it gets confusing<br>because the Chief Justice will be presiding as the chair, but that's<br>only because it would be a conflict of interest for the President of the<br>Senate to preside. In case you missed Constitution 101, the President of<br>the Senate is the Vice President. The last time we had an impeachment<br>"trial" in the Senate, Chief Justice Rehnquist admonished the Managers<br>to not refer to Senators as "jurors," because they are specifically not<br>jurors, and this is not a trial.<br><br>To that end, the defense team can ask the Senate to immediately vote to<br>dismiss the impeachment, but it's unlikely that the Senate will do that.<br>Why? The Senate could have done that already, without having to go<br>through the rigmarole of setting up the hearing and waiting for the<br>House to get off of its arse and send over the Articles.<br><br>The Senate is going to allow the hearing to move forward.<br><br>The Managers who present in the President's defense will undoubtedly use<br>that line of reasoning while they present their case.<br><br>It's unlikely that anything the Managers say will have any sway on any<br>Senator in that room. I suspect the vote will come out exactly as we<br>suspect: the President will not be removed from office.<br><br>End of impeachment. Everyone go back to your lives. And hopefully<br>Congress can get back to work fixing the nation's ills.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
