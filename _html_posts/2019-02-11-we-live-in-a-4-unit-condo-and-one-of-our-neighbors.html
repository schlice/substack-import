What should we do?**<br><br>As with all legal questions, the answer is "it depends."<br><br>Depending on how the person is spying on you will determine whether you<br>go to the police (if a crime is being committed) or if you hire a<br>private investigator to establish enough proof that spying is happening<br>and that you have been financially impacted.<br><br>This kind of thing is really outside the purview of the HOA, as this is<br>first and foremost a legal issue between tenants.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
