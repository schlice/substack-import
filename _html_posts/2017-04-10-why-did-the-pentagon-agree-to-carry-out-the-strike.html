<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>1.  *Why did the Pentagon agree to carry out the strike on Syria, if the<br>    US Constitution requires the approval of Congress for such military<br>    action?\<br>    \*<br>    The Pentagon agreed to carry out the strike because they are not<br>    Congress, and they are not the Supreme Court. It's their job to be<br>    the military, not Congress or the courts. The Commander-in-Chief<br>    issued an order, and they followed it. They are exceptionally good<br>    at following orders.\<br>    \<br>    Also, the Constitution does not require Congressional approval<br>    before military action can be conducted. In fact, during Korea and<br>    Vietnam, Congress was worried that the President was operating<br>    essentially unchecked. They signed a joint Congressional Resolution,<br>    called the War Powers Resolution (50 U.S.C. 1541--1548). It was<br>    intended to be a check on Presidential powers, and in fact was<br>    passed with 2/3 majority in Congress, overriding a presidential<br>    veto. It states that the President can only conduct military<br>    operations for 60 days without Congressional approval (either an<br>    Authorization for the Use of Military Force \AUMF\, or a<br>    declaration of war), and that any military action must cease and any<br>    deployed troops must be withdrawn within 90 days if no approval has<br>    been granted. Since we are well within 60 days (the attack was over<br>    within a few hours), the President still has upwards of two months<br>    to conduct more operations before he must have approval from<br>    Congress.<br>2.  *\M\any world leaders approve the strike although it has still not<br>    been proved that the chemical attack were effected by the Syrian<br>    government. Why ?\*<br>    \<br>    Intelligence sources from around the world confirmed that the<br>    aircraft which bombed the city originated from the airfield in<br>    question. US intelligence released radar "traces" which actually<br>    showed the flight path the suspect aircraft took. Unless foreign<br>    governments are operating on Syrian military bases using Syrian<br>    military aircraft, it's extremely unlikely that this attack was<br>    *not* carried out by Syria. Additionally, the Al-Assad regime has<br>    not denied that they carried out the attack. They denounced the US<br>    response (as expected), but they did not deny the attack.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
