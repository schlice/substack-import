<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Can apps record you without consent?<br><br>The device (either iOS or Android) must request permissions before it<br>can start accessing certain hardware features of your phone. On Android,<br>apps must ask you explicit permission before it uses:<br><br>- Camera<br>- Microphone<br>- Location<br>  - While the app is running<br>    - Precise location<br>    - Approximate location<br>  - In the background<br>- Phone<br>- Contacts<br>- Internal device storage<br>- Control vibration<br>- Network access<br>- View Wi-Fi connections<br>- Receive data from Internet<br><br>(Note that these are broad sections of the device that it must ask for;<br>there are a few more precise functions within these headings that it<br>must ask for, but they all fall under these headings)<br><br>So the application must ask you permission before it uses any of these<br>parts of your phone.<br><br>Once you grant it access, while the app is running, it can use those<br>features.<br><br>**Whether or not it records you in the background without your<br>knowledge would be something that is part of its Privacy Policy**<br>and its Terms of Service. Presumably, you would expect it to be<br>doing this (i.e. the app is a fitness tracker, so recording your precise<br>location while the app is running would be expected). The app should not<br>be doing something unexpected (i.e. you wouldn't expect your fitness<br>tracker to be accessing your camera). You should understand every<br>permission you grant to your apps and you should only provide that<br>access to apps you trust.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
