<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Should an amendment to the US Constitution define elements of<br>presidential abuse of power for future presidential impeachment<br>investigations?**<br><br>It's probably unnecessary to make a Constitutional amendment.<br><br>*Congress can just pass a law making abuse of power a crime.*<br><br>They just have to specifically define what acts constitute the new crime<br>of abuse of power. And it can't simply be that you did something legal,<br>but with "corrupt intent," because simply having a mens rea (a<br>guilty mind) isn't enough, you must also commit an actus reus (a<br>guilty act) to commit a crime.<br><br>Once they do this, and they override the inevitable Presidential veto<br>(which means you need 2/3 of Congress to vote for this law), then a<br>President can be impeached for committing the crime of abuse of power.<br><br>And then once he is removed from office, he can be prosecuted for that<br>crime.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
