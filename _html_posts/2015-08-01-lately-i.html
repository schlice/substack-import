<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Let\'s play a hypothetical game. Let\'s say you could<br>communicate with a baby in the womb. How would you describe the things<br>it is going to see when it is born? Would you say, \"Hey, baby, there is<br>this stuff called air, and it smells wonderul, except when it doesn\'t,<br>and there are these things called trees, and they\'re fun to climb on,<br>but I know you don\'t understand fun, or climbing, but it\'ll all make<br>sense when you get out here. And don\'t get me started on chili dogs.\"\<br>\<br>Could you imagine how difficult it would be to try to explain concepts<br>like this to a baby in the womb? The baby would literally have no<br>understanding of anything you\'re talking about. Similarly, Isaiah 55:9<br>explains God\'s dilemma when trying to explain concepts like Heaven to<br>us: \"As the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher<br>than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts.\" God\'s mind is so,<br>so far greater than ours that we can\'t even begin to hope to understand<br>His ways.\<br>\<br>So with that understanding, how can we possibly know what God is<br>thinking? How can we even hope to know what His plans for us are? He is<br>so much higher in thinking than we are that we can\'t even comprehend<br>the plans he has.\<br>\<br>Who are we to say that God is unfair? By whose standards? Ours? Are we<br>in charge here? Are we to be so presumptuous that we say, \"God, you are<br>totally unfair, I want you to fix it!\" The thought borders on the<br>blasphemous.\<br>\<br>We don\'t run the show, God does. We\'re not in charge here, He is. We<br>can never hope to understand His plans until we see Him face to face and<br>He enlightens us.\<br>\<br>The best we can do is to pray for more understanding. It reminds me of<br>when Kennedy quoted Phillips Brooks and he said, \"Don\'t pray for an<br>easy life, pray to be better men.\" Don\'t get angry with God because<br>you don\'t understand His plan; you can never hope to. Pray for more<br>tolerance and understanding of His ways.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
