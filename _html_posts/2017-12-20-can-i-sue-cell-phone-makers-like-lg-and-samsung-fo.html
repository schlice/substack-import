<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Can I sue cell phone makers like LG and Samsung for being the reason<br>for my bad posture, which eventually lead to my cervical degeneration?**<br><br>In the United States, you can sue anyone for anything.<br><br>So to answer your question, yes, you can sue cell phone makers for<br>your bad posture.<br><br>But also in the United States, it is up to you to prove your case, as<br>the court system works on an "innocent until proven guilty" basis.<br>Therefore, it will be up to you to prove with a preponderance of<br>evidence that the mobile phone manufacturers actually caused your bad<br>posture.<br><br>And *that* will be a tough row to hoe. In fact, there's a good<br>chance that there is correlation between poor posture and mobile<br>phone use, but there is no causation. This means that while some<br>people slouch when using their mobile phones, it is not the phone that<br>is causing you to slouch. In fact, the phone will work equally as<br>well if you sit properly as it will if you slouch. Just from this<br>reasoning alone, there is a fair chance that the phone is not actually<br>causing you to slouch, but your improper posture while using a phone is<br>the proximate cause of your cervical degeneration.<br><br>Therefore, it is exceedingly unlikely (almost like the fate of the<br>snowball in Hell) that you would prevail in such a lawsuit.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
