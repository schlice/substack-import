<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>There is some research around microchimerism and MS in twins.<br><br>[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/\...(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=853b67&url=https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16843535/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="nih.gov"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>But the research hasn't gone far enough to suggest that chimerism is the<br>cause of MS.<br><br>And then I read this:<br><br>[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/\...(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=55b643&url=https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17531842/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="nih.gov"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>And the abstract is telling (emphasis mine):<br><br>> Scientific advances have demonstrated that autoreactive cells are a<br>> component of the healthy immune repertoire. If we define autoimmunity<br>> as an active induction of autoreaction, the solution should be an<br>> active induction of self-tolerance, and may indicate the direction to<br>> explore the future therapies. Microchimerism (MC) refers to the<br>> presence of a limited number of nonhost cells in the body of an<br>> individual. These cells can enter via blood transfusion and organ<br>> transplantation or naturally through pregnancy. **Chimeric cells<br>> engraft in the host body, develop, proliferate, and are accepted by<br>> the immune system as self.** These include stem cells that enter the<br>> maternal body during fetal stages. These stem cells are also<br>> postulated to be helpful reservoirs in protecting the host body. **MC<br>> has been considered a risk factor in autoimmune disease induction.<br>> However, today we know it is a natural phenomenon.** MC can be<br>> considered a natural model of successful transplantation, the earliest<br>> engrafting cells being fetal mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). MSCs have<br>> two notable features. They have an immunosuppressive quality when<br>> encountering the adoptive immune system and they display<br>> repair-inducing potential within damaged tissues.<br><br>So the first thing we learned:<br><br>**Chimeric cells engraft in the host body, develop, proliferate, and are<br>accepted by the immune system as self.**<br><br>Therefore, your theory of microchimeric cells as viewed by the immune<br>system as invaders and thus as a trigger for disease process is<br>incorrect.<br><br>The next thing we learned:<br><br>**MC has been considered a risk factor in autoimmune disease induction.<br>However, today we know it is a natural phenomenon.**<br><br>It's even considered to be a "natural model" of successful<br>transplantation.<br><br>So microchimeric cells are indeed being studied, but not exactly in the<br>way you thought. They are definitely being studied in conjunction with<br>mesenchymal stem cells to investigate mostly if treatments like HSCT<br>might be beneficial for people with MS.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
