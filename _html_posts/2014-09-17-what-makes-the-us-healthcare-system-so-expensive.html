<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [So clearly, wading through all the answers here we<br>established that the largest driver in healthcare costs is the insurance<br>companies that are supposed to be paying for our care. We have a<br>healthcare system controlled by insurance instead of by doctors.\<br>\<br>Why can insurance demand such high prices? There are many reasons why<br>insurers charge such high dollar premiums:\<br>\<br>1. Lack of competition. Since insurance companies can\'t compete across<br>state lines, they essentially hold mini-monopolies within their states,<br>driving up costs. We need to fight for opening up insurance markets<br>interstate to ensure competition, better access, and better coverage.\<br>\<br>2. Pharmaceutical costs. Regulations have hamstringed the pharmaceutical<br>industry in such a way that competition has effectively been eliminated<br>and costs have been allowed to artificially increase. We need to get<br>back onto Big Pharma and get those drug costs back under control. The<br>advent of generics was a good start, but cost controls must continue.<br>Since insurance pays for drugs, the high cost of drugs contributes to<br>the high cost of insurance and the high cost of healthcare.\<br>\<br>And I understand that R&D is expensive, but when your R&D is so<br>expensive that my drug retails for more than \$10,000 for a 3-month<br>supply (MS drugs, I\'m looking at you), something is not right. Without<br>insurance, who could afford that?\<br>\<br>3. Liability insurance for doctors is very very expensive. We must do<br>better at tort reform to control the exorbitant cost of what doctors<br>have to pay to practice.\<br>\<br>There are many things that could be done without having to take 25% of<br>the US economy and creating a massive new government bureaucracy to<br>administer it.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
