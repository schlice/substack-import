<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>As with all legal answers, the answer is "it depends." And what it<br>depends on is the remedies laid out in the HOA's Governing Documents. An<br>HOA is, in most cases, a 501(c)(4) nonprofit corporation. As such, it<br>has the ability to file lawsuits against individual members.<br><br>In most cases, however, **lawsuit is not the normal course of action for<br>an HOA to recoup unpaid fees.**<br><br>Normally, in the vast majority of HOAs around the United States, the<br>unpaid fees will accumulate on the homeowner's account until they have<br>gone unpaid after multiple attempts to get the homeowner to explain why<br>they are unpaid, and then to work out a payment plan, or to just pay<br>them. When the requisite time has passed (either controlled by the<br>Governing Documents or by state law), the HOA will turn the account over<br>to the attorney. The attorney will attempt to get the account paid, and<br>will also add his or her own fees to the running total of fees plus late<br>fees.<br><br>Again, after the attorney has tried for several months to engage with<br>the homeowner and get payment or work out a payment plan, the attorney<br>will place a *lien* on the property. A lien is a legal claim on the<br>property that gives the HOA the right to adjudicate that property if the<br>owner doesn\'t repay a debt. Liens are a common way for creditors to<br>collect what they\'re owed. A lien prevents the property from being sold<br>until the debt is paid off. If the debt isn\'t paid, the lien will be<br>*foreclosed* and the house will be sold out from under the homeowner.<br>The proceeds from the house sale will be used to pay off the debt.<br><br>**TL;DR: if you can find an attorney who will sue someone with no<br>evidence, then sure, even HOAs can sue people without evidence, but in<br>most cases, that's not how HOAs collect unpaid fees.**<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
