<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [You have a basic contract. The contract doesn\'t ask<br>anyone to do anything illegal, so there is nothing illegal about the<br>contract.\<br>\<br>The reason you wrote the contract is irrelevant. Even if the assault is<br>no longer legally actionable, it doesn\'t change the nature of the<br>contract.\<br>\<br>You have a contract which states \"Person X is to pay person Y a certain<br>amount of money over the course of the following timeframe\...\"\<br>\<br>Since the contract was initiated in Taiwan, you will likely have to file<br>your suit there, but I\'m unsure on that point. You may be able to file<br>in South Africa since that\'s your current residence. I\'d check with<br>the courts there first, but this should be a pretty simple breach of<br>contract case. Did you have any provisions in the contract for what<br>would happen if he fails to pay, such as late fees? If not, you can<br>probably only get the money he owes you.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
