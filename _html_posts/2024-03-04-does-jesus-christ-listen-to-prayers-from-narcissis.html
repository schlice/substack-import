And hearing<br>> this*,* Jesus said to them, "It is not those who are healthy who need<br>> a physician, but those who are sick; I did not come to call the<br>> righteous, but sinners." --- Mark 2:16--17 ESV<br><br>That said, Jesus hears prayers from everyone. He seeks to help those who<br>pray for the wrong reasons.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
