<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [No, the arrest in and of itself is not a violation of the<br>Universal Declaration of Human Rights. You do not have a right to be<br>free from arrest for crimes which the State believes you have committed.<br>You have a right to be treated fairly and humanely while you are<br>incarcerated by the State. You have the right to food, clean water, and<br>medical care. You have the right to humane living conditions.\<br>\<br>If the State makes a law that says that simply being a \"thief in law\"<br>is illegal, not actually performing some other criminal act, then the<br>act of arresting you for being a thief in law is not a violation. It is<br>a law, and the State is carrying out the law. However, if the State<br>treats you inhumanely while you are incarcerated, that is a violation of<br>the Universal Declaration.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
