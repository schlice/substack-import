<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>How hard is it to get the nomination required for the Naval Academy?<br><br>Nominations for any service academy are similar. You apply with the<br>nominating official (usually your Congressman), complete an application,<br>and be interviewed in front of a review board.<br><br>It's not that the process is difficult, it's that you're usually up<br>against quite a bit of competition. When I applied, there were roughly<br>100 applicants from my district. I was one of two selected by my<br>Congressman, as he had two slots available at USAFA. So that year, I<br>literally had a 2% chance of getting a nomination, all else being<br>equal.<br><br>So it's not a difficult process, but it is a very narrow gate through<br>which you must pass.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
