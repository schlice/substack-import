<br><br><h2>Space Submission</h2><br><div><br><br>Space name: Nikki Haley 2024<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>It's distasteful to make a profit off of someone else's health. As if<br>some greedy fat-cat banker tycoon is reclining in his million-dollar<br>mansion funded by the deaths of innocent people.<br><br>That's the image. It's certainly not the reality. But in reality, profit<br>driving a hospital's medical decisions is a distasteful topic. People<br>don't want their healthcare decisions dictated by a hospital's<br>cost/benefit calculation.<br><br>It can be done (with proper rules and oversight/regulation), but people<br>still find the whole notion distasteful. And they are concerned about<br>abuses in the name of profit.<br><br>Just take a look at the one segment of the healthcare industry which<br>remains unregulated: air ambulances. Just look what happens when a<br>Federal law says you can't regulate the costs of the service:<br><br>[https://youtu.be/3gdCH1XUIlE(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=338b6b&url=https://youtu.be/3gdCH1XUIlE){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>The video is relatively long in YouTube terms (\~22 minutes), but if you<br>really want to understand why our air ambulance system is broken, watch<br>this video.<br><br>The brief upshot of the video: air ambulance providers successfully<br>lobbied to classify their business as an airline rather than as an<br>ambulance. What difference does this make? Federal deregulation of<br>airlines (thanks to the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978) *removed<br>Federal controls over fares*.<br><br>When you're the only game in town, and Federal law cannot intervene on<br>your pricing, and your air ambulance is owned by a group of investors<br>and not by a group of doctors, prices necessarily increase far above the<br>cost of running the service to whatever health insurance will pay.<br><br>If it is going to be done at all, it must be done carefully and with<br>proper controls in place before people will accept it.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Why are so many people in the US against a ban on for-profit hospitals?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
