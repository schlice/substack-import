<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Now that the GSA has formally acknowledged Biden as the<br>president-elect, will this force Republicans like Mitch McConnell to<br>speak out against Trump\'s efforts to overturn the election?**<br><br>I'm sorry, I think I missed in the Constitution where you officially<br>become president-elect when the GSA formally acknowledges you. Can you<br>refresh my memory and tell me where that's located?<br><br>The media, you, the GSA, heck even Biden himself, can refer to him as<br>the president-elect, but he won't actually be president-elect until he<br>has been elected.<br><br>And despite what you may have heard, *he hasn't been elected yet*.<br><br>That's right, when you declare that Trump is trying to "overturn the<br>election," you are mistaken. We haven't had the Presidential election<br>yet, so there is nothing to "overturn."<br><br>And no, I'm not talking about the election that took place on November<br>3rd, because that was just the General Election used to select the slate<br>of electors who will actually vote for the President, which doesn't<br>officially take place until December 14th. Even though the votes won't<br>actually be officially counted until the joint session of Congress on<br>January 6 (after the new Congress is seated), it is fair to say that you<br>can begin calling the elected person "president-elect" after<br>that.\[1\](#SOEQW){#cite-SOEQW .citation_link}<br><br>\<br><br>*Sorry, no comments on this one.*<br><br>*If you don\'t like what I wrote, tough shit. If my answer is<br>grammatically low-quality or is un-cited opinion masquerading as fact,<br>downvote it. If you think I\'m wrong, write your own answer. But Quora<br>is a question-and-answer site, not a debate site. If you were simply<br>going to comment to tell me \"ackshually, you\'re wrong,\" then you're<br>the reason why I disable comments. Well done, Karen. You ruined it for<br>everyone.*<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-SOEQW){.citation_index}<br>[https://crsreports.congress.gov/\...(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=b3f1c5&url=https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF11641){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="congress.gov"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
