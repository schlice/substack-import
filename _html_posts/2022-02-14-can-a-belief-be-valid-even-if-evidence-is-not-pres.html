<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>In order to answer this question, we have to determine what we believe<br>in, and I think we can take as a basic premise that we believe in what<br>is true. However, what is truth? How do we determine truth?<br><br>So first of all, does truth exist? I think we can say quite plainly that<br>truth does exist, and it is undeniable and absolute. You cannot say<br>"truth cannot be known" because that is a self-defeating statement which<br>claims to be a *known,* *absolute truth*.<br><br>So what are the processes by which we discover truth? We can start with<br>what we call the "[[First<br>principles](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=6cc14a&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_principle){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}." They are called the<br>First Principles because nothing is used to prove them. They are true<br>based on the nature of reality. They are what we call "self-evident." A<br>few of those truths are the [[Law of<br>noncontradiction](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=b63cdd&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_noncontradiction){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container} and the [[Law of the<br>excluded<br>middle](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=b3564e&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_excluded_middle){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}. The Law of the excluded<br>middle says that something either *is* or it *is not*. There is no third<br>alternative. For example, either God exists, or he does not. We use the<br>FIrst Principles to discover all other truths. Just as you need eyes in<br>your head to see, you need First Principles in your mind in order to<br>learn and understand all other truths about reality.<br><br>Beyond the First Principles, we generally determine truth by using<br>observation and then drawing conclusions based on what we observe. This<br>is a process called *induction*. This is different from *deduction* in<br>that deduction is taking a series of premises and drawing a conclusion<br>from them, while induction is the process of determining whether the<br>*premises themselves* are true.<br><br>Most of the things you know by induction are not 100% certain, but are<br>usually *highly certain*. For example, do you know with 100% certainty<br>that gravity will pull all dropped objects to the earth? The answer is<br>no, because you have not observed every object which has been dropped.<br><br>So if the things we know by induction are not 100% certain, can they be<br>*trusted*? Yes, with varying levels of certainty. Because none of us<br>possess unlimited knowledge, it is true that some of our inductions<br>could be wrong. But even when we are not 100% certain, we usually have<br>enough information to make *reasonably certain* conclusions about most<br>questions in life. So back to our example, can we be *reasonably sure*<br>that gravity will pull all dropped objects to the earth? Since nearly<br>every dropped object has been pulled to the earth, our conclusion that<br>all dropped objects will be pulled to the earth can be considered **true<br>beyond a reasonable doubt**. It's 99+% sure. It's not beyond *all*<br>doubt, but it's beyond *reasonable* doubt.<br><br>So even if we can't see something (since this is what most people call<br>"evidence"), we can use inductive reasoning, logic, and scientific<br>principles to determine the truth of the premise beyond a reasonable<br>doubt.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Can a belief be valid even if evidence is not presented?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
