<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I'm a theist and that's the stupidest statement I've heard yet today<br>(but the day is still young).<br><br>Atheists do not believe in God. However, I will argue that **atheism is<br>a religion**.<br><br>Just as they accuse theists, atheists believe *with zero proof* that<br>there is no God. They cannot *prove* beyond a reasonable doubt that<br>God does not exist, yet they have *faith* that He does not.<br><br>So just like the theists, atheists have belief and faith. And just like<br>theists, they have *dogma* (the inerrant nature of what they consider to<br>be science) and *exclusivity* (you must believe as they do in order to<br>join their club --- theists are not welcome).<br><br>Even the courts have recognized that atheism is, in a certain sense, a<br>religion, because it is covered by the Establishment Clause. The 7th<br>Circuit said, "when a person sincerely holds beliefs dealing with issues<br>of ultimate concern that for her occupy a place parallel to that filled<br>by \... God in traditionally religious persons, those beliefs represent<br>her religion." The Circuit said, therefore, the establishment clause is<br>equally applicable to the nonreligious and even the anti-religious.<br>"\A\theism may be considered, \only\ in this special sense, a<br>religion."\[1\](#auhiC){#cite-auhiC .citation_link}<br><br>So while the statement in the question is clearly wrong, a statement<br>which is at least an arguable one is, "**No one is more religious than<br>an atheist.**"<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-auhiC){.citation_index}<br>[Atheism(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=a7e1ba&url=https://www.mtsu.edu/first-amendment/article/1318/atheism){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="mtsu.edu"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
