<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>What they really mean when they say "mandatory evacuations" is that<br>services will not be available during the evacuation period.<br><br>If you call the police, they will not come. If you call the fire<br>department, they will not come. If you call for an ambulance, you're not<br>getting one.<br><br>Officials declare a mandatory evacuation when they cannot safely provide<br>essential services in the evacuation zone. They want you to move to a<br>place where they can provide you with essential services.<br><br>So do you have to leave during a mandatory evacuation? Can you be<br>arrested if you stay? No. You can choose to "ride it out" if you want.<br>But the point is that if you do, you're on your own.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Why do states like Florida pretend to order \'mandatory evacuations\'<br>when in fact they lack the authority to force people off their land?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
