<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What would Republicans have thought of Obama if he had admitted to<br>paying porn stars hush money in the run up to his election? Would it<br>have been okay if it had been his own money?**<br><br>You're not asking the right question.<br><br>The right question would have been, "What would *Democrats* have<br>thought of Obama if he had admitted to paying porn stars hush money in<br>the run up to his election?"<br><br>If Democrats say that it was fine for Obama to have paid off women with<br>whom he had affairs, then it's equally fine that Trump did the same<br>thing.<br><br>But all must be equal: Obama needs to have been a rich businessman<br>well-known for having much-vaunted (by him) affairs with many women.<br><br>Then all things would be equal.<br><br>*Republicans* wouldn't have though much better of Obama if that were<br>true. They already didn't like his big-government policies; this<br>wouldn't have changed their opinion of him, other than to add to their<br>dislike of him, on a personal level rather than political.<br><br>While I disagreed with Obama *politically*, I liked him *as a person*.<br>He appeared to be a decent family man, and I can respect that. I think I<br>would have enjoyed spending personal time with him. If he admitted<br>paying off porn stars to keep them quiet about his dalliances, it would<br>have changed my *personal* opinion of him.<br><br>Trump is the exact, polar opposite of Obama. I have less than zero<br>respect for Trump *as a person,* but I can respect him *politically.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
