<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**When driving in traffic and someone behind you is following closely,<br>like they are in your trunk, what is your reaction?**<br><br>The correct answer is to increase the distance between you and the car<br>in front of you. This gives you more reaction time to slow down<br>gradually should traffic in front of you come to a rapid stop. If you<br>fail to leave extra space in front of you, you may end up having to<br>brake hard, and the guy behind you is very likely going to end up<br>actually in your trunk.<br><br>The douche-y answer is to slow down to exactly the speed limit, or maybe<br>five miles an hour or so under the speed limit. Nothing says I have to<br>do the speed limit, and if I'm not being a hazard, oh well. I've had<br>angry drivers go on to the shoulder to get around me when I do that.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
