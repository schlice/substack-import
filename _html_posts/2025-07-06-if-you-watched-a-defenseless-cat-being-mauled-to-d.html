<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>First of all, under United States law, pets are not people, they are<br>property. If one house caught another house on fire and you didn't grab<br>a garden hose, do you get saddled with the cost to rebuild the house?<br><br>As sad as it sounds when you talk about pets (because everyone loves<br>their pets), that's the truth.<br><br>Second, there is no duty to protect in US law.<br><br>Let's get away from cats and dogs for a second and get to a place where<br>we at least have a general idea about when we should help. Let's say you<br>came upon a bad guy mercilessly beating a little girl, and you took out<br>your phone and recorded the whole thing, including right up to the point<br>where the little girl actually died. Would you be responsible for the<br>little girl's death because you failed to stop it?<br><br>No, you would not. Again, there is no "duty to protect" in the United<br>States. You cannot be held responsible for failing to act (certain very<br>specific instances notwithstanding). If you simply stand on the<br>sidelines and do nothing, you did not contribute to the death, so you<br>are not responsible for the death.<br><br>\<br><br>*Disclaimer**:*<br><br>*I am not a lawyer, and this answer is not a substitute for professional<br>legal advice or a solicitation to offer legal advice regarding specific<br>facts.
