<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**By what authority is Donald Trump choosing Jerusalem as Israel\'s<br>capital?**<br><br>Trump is not *choosing* Jerusalem. Congress *recognized* Israel's<br>sovereign right to name their own capital city in 1995, when they passed<br>the Jerusalem Embassy Act. Trump is merely fulfilling the law which,<br>incidentally, three presidents failed to fulfill: Clinton, Bush 43<br>and Obama.<br><br>If Congress has heartburn with this, they should repeal their own law. I<br>doubt this will happen though.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
