<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Short answer: yes.<br><br>Longer answer: In 2003, the Youth Criminal Justice Act was passed by<br>Parliament. It says that the minimum age of criminal culpability in<br>the country is 12. This means, effectively, that a person under 12<br>cannot be charged with a crime. Those between 12 and 18 *can* be charged<br>with a crime, but deference is given to their age, and an emphasis on<br>rehabilitation over incarceration is given.<br><br>There is no national standard for youthful offenders (i.e. those below<br>age 12). It is therefore left to provincial guidelines. These are often<br>highly restricted, and grossly inadequate, as they cannot restrict the<br>liberty of the child, force the child to participate in his or her own<br>rehabilitation or obtain psychological treatment for any meaningful<br>length of time.<br><br>The Youth Criminal Justice Act recognizes that it is up to the community<br>to work with the justice system to prevent youth crime. They do this by<br>addressing the underlying causes of youth crime, and providing support<br>and guidance to communities.<br><br>But this is not perfect, and it is often incomplete and totally<br>unregulated. Most often, the youngest of the youthful offenders, the<br>ones who need the most intervention, are woefully underserved, and not<br>addressed by the law.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>I just learned about a Canadian law called the Youth Criminal Justice<br>act, and it says that the minimum criminal responsibility age is 12, yet<br>does that mean that 11-year-olds can walk free without any criminal<br>responsibility?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
