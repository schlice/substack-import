<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [I can tell you from personal experience that the traits<br>which make one an effective cop are the same traits which make one an<br>effective criminal.\<br>\<br>There is a *line* that officers don\'t cross, but remember, it\'s a<br>*line*, not a *wall*. It is a line of morality and adherence to the law.<br>Every person approaches that line throughout their lives. Officers<br>routinely approach that line throughout their careers. People who have a<br>skewed sense of right and wrong can routinely cross that line and feel<br>no remorse for doing so. Thankfully, most officers do the job because<br>they have a very strong sense of right and wrong, and a very strong<br>sense of justice and morality. They can approach that line and walk<br>away, and be no worse for wear from doing it.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
