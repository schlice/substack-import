<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>He lets you go as far as He wants to let you go. Because even in letting<br>you move forward with your own plans, He is fulfilling His plan.<br><br>Ultimately, there is no scenario in which He does not fulfill His plan<br>for you, regardless of how far you go, and how long you live, with your<br>own plans.<br><br>The question becomes: **how long are you going to fight against His<br>plans for you?**<br><br>Doesn't it just make sense to submit to His will *now*?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
