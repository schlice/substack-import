<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The HOA can certainly drop insurance on common property, even on limited<br>common property. The CC&R should state somewhere that insurance coverage<br>must be continued on common property. If it does not, then that<br>oversight must be corrected immediately.<br><br>We know that it is oversight because for the majority of states, an HOA<br>failing to maintain insurance is usually illegal under that state's HOA<br>laws. You can immediately retain an attorney and file for an injunction<br>requiring the HOA to maintain the insurance, or reacquire it if they do<br>not currently have an active policy.<br><br>If they fail to do so, the HOA can be found to be in violation of state<br>law, and the state can forcefully disband the HOA and replace it with<br>state agents until state law is fulfilled, ensure that the Governing<br>Documents match state law, and then return it to residents.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
