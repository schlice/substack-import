<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>To fully answer the question, we need to define "fake."<br><br>If, by "fake," you mean filling out an application with fraudulent or<br>incorrect information, it's nearly impossible to apply to University<br>with a "fake" application. [[Alice<br>Baker](https://www.quora.com/profile/Alice-Baker-31)]{.qlink_container}<br>already detailed that in her answer, so I won't re-hash that here.<br><br>If, however, by "fake," you actually mean "your true information, but<br>you have no intention of actually attending the school you're applying<br>to," then the calculus shifts slightly.<br><br>While it's not *illegal* to apply to a school for which you have no<br>intention of attending, it would be considered *wrong* to do so.<br>Remember, the University does a non-trivial amount of work processing<br>your application. Teams of reviewers pore over your records, determining<br>whether or not you will be a good fit. And that's before we get to<br>*financing*, which is a big deal in and of itself. Because when it comes<br>to financing, government gets involved, with all of its grants and<br>student aid programs.<br><br>To do all that work and then to be potentially accepted when you have no<br>intention of attending the school accomplishes little but wasting the<br>time of the people at the university, and they'll likely remember that<br>when you *are* ready to attend the college.<br><br>Maybe, instead of filing a "fake" application, you could reach out to<br>the Admissions department of the university in question and work with<br>them (on their time, of course) to see if your application package is<br>strong enough to be considered when you are ready to attend university.<br>They may be able to give you some pointers to strengthen your<br>application package, which could give you a leg up when it's time to<br>actually attend. And your efforts won't go unnoticed at that university,<br>and may actually help you when it comes time to actually apply.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
