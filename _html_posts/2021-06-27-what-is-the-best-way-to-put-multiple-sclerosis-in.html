<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>This is a really tough question. In truth, there is nothing *proven* to<br>put MS in reverse, yet. Anecdotally, there are many examples of people<br>doing just that, either with a combination of drugs and diet, or even<br>diet alone. Just take a look at [[Dr. Terry<br>Wahls](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=172475&url=https://terrywahls.com/about/about-terry-wahls/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="terrywahls.com"}]{.qlink_container}, who overcame her own MS<br>through a very strict diet called [[the Wahls<br>Protocol](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=d5f415&url=https://terrywahls.com/the-wahls-protocol/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="terrywahls.com"}]{.qlink_container}. And there are some<br>therapies which promise to stop or even reverse the disease. One such<br>promising therapy is called<br>[HSCT(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=118598&url=https://www.nationalmssociety.org/Research/Research-News-Progress/Stem-Cells-in-MS/Bone-Marrow-Stem-Cell-Transplant-%25E2%2580%2593-HSCT){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="nationalmssociety.org"}]{.qlink_container}.<br><br>Now, I must caution you: **we do not advocate stopping your MS therapy<br>drugs to go on a diet.** We know that diet and exercise can help you<br>feel better, have more energy, and generally live a better life with MS,<br>but **using diet alone to control your MS has not yet been proven to be<br>effective**. Maybe someday it will be, and Dr. Wahls and others like her<br>will be vindicated, but today, there is no diet out there (and there are<br>several specifically targeted for MS) that have been proven to control<br>the disease process.<br><br>And as far as HSCT is concerned, it is still being evaluated for its<br>benefit in stopping MS, as it is not 100% effective in all cases, and<br>the protocol comes with *significant* risk. The treatment has already<br>been approved in the US, but not for MS. There is growing evidence that<br>HSCT is not for everyone (as I said, it's not 100% effective in stopping<br>the disease), and research today is focusing on which MS patients might<br>benefit the most from the treatment. Initially, it appears to be very<br>effective for a certain subset of patients.<br><br>So for now, our advice remains the same today as it did ten years ago:<br>eat right, exercise, and take an approved MS therapy drug. This<br>gives you the best chance to control the disease, reduce the duration<br>and severity of relapses, and to live the best life you can with MS.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>What is the best way to put multiple sclerosis in reverse or remission?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
