<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>An excellent question!<br><br>The Bible is unclear about where exactly Jesus was for the three days<br>between His death and resurrection. Peter talks about it briefly:<br><br>> For Christ also suffered once for sins, the righteous for the<br>> unrighteous, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the<br>> flesh but made alive in the spirit, in which he went and proclaimed to<br>> the spirits in prison, because they formerly did not obey, when God's<br>> patience waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was being prepared,<br>> in which a few, that is, eight persons, were brought safely through<br>> water. --- 1 Peter 3:18--20 ESV<br><br>So in Peter's account, Jesus went to the "prison for spirits," which<br>would be hell or Hades. He "proclaimed" to them there. We don't know<br>what He proclaimed (because they died in disobedience to God so they are<br>not saved). He probably told them that He would soon triumph over death,<br>and that He will eventually cast Satan into Hell.<br><br>Ephesians 4:8--10 also has some clues:<br><br>> Therefore it says, "When he ascended on high he led a host of<br>> captives, and he gave gifts to men." (In saying, "He ascended," what<br>> does it mean but that he had also descended into the lower regions,<br>> the earth? He who descended is the one who also ascended far above all<br>> the heavens, that he might fill all things.)<br><br>In this passage, Paul says that Jesus "led a host of captives." What<br>most people believe is that Jesus brought Abraham, David, Joshua,<br>Daniel, the beggar Lazarus, the thief on the cross, and everyone else<br>who had previously been justified by faith, and led them from Hades (the<br>abode of the dead in general) to their new spiritual home.<br><br>Other than that, the Bible is mostly silent on what Jesus did between<br>His death and resurrection. The Bible is, though, abundantly clear on<br>where Jesus and all believers were (and will be) after His resurrection.<br>*Paradise.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
