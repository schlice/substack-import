<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Well, yes and no. It still needs power, so you\'ll still have to get it<br>that power.<br><br>If you find the right camera, you may be able to find one with a<br>built-in battery that you can manually recharge periodically. Nest<br>Indoor, Ring and Blink indoor cameras allow this. In fact, Blink cameras<br>(owned by Amazon) run off off AA Lithium batteries and will run for<br>about two years on a single pair of batteries. Or perhaps you may find a<br>camera which can be powered by an external battery bank, maybe that will<br>meet your needs. The small Blink indoor cameras can do this. Or perhaps<br>you could install the camera and add an external solar panel and mount<br>the panel on a window. Camera offerings from Ring and eufy can be<br>powered by solar panels.<br><br>There are others, but those are some of the more popular offerings.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
