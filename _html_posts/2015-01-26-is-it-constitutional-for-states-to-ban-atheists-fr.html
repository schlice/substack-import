<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [It does, actually.\<br>\<br>The Constitution also says that there will be no \"tests\" for holding<br>public office. A \"religion\" test is therefore also a violation of the<br>Constitution, as well as a violation of the First Amendment.\<br>\<br>I would suppose that an atheist would have to apply to run for office,<br>and then be denied, in order to bring a Constitutional objection to the<br>law.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
