<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Oops, you made a typo in your question. Let me fix that for you.<br><br>Why are *FOREIGN ACTORS* **calling in bomb threats to schools<br>and municipal buildings in Springfield Ohio, what are they trying to<br>accomplish with these violent acts?**<br><br>There. Fixed it for you.<br><br>And it's happening because JD Vance called out the very real problem of<br>the influx of mostly temporary Haitian immigrants in Springfield.<br><br>According to the AP (not known to be very right-leaning), here's what is<br>happening there:<br><br>> Springfield shed manufacturing jobs and its population decreased<br>> significantly as a result toward the end of the last century. But the<br>> city has made a concerted effort to lure employers and Haitian<br>> immigrants have helped meet rising demand for labor in factories and<br>> warehouses. Word spread, and Haitians began arriving in greater<br>> numbers over the last few years.<br>><br>> Haitians in Springfield and elsewhere came to the U.S. to flee<br>> violence in their home country. Many Haitians are here under a federal<br>> program called Temporary Protected Status, which allows them to<br>> temporarily live and work in the U.S. because conditions are<br>> considered too dangerous for them to return to<br>> Haiti.\[1\](#Sqqhb){#cite-Sqqhb .citation_link}<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-Sqqhb){.citation_index} [[What to know about the threats<br>in Springfield, Ohio, after false claims about Haitian<br>immigrants](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=45472d&url=https://apnews.com/article/springfield-ohio-haitian-immigrants-threats-key-details-7594bae869fb05dc6f106098409418cc){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="apnews.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
