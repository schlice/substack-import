<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Marion county (FL) sheriff just banned his deputies and visitors from<br>wearing masks. Why can\'t President Trump ban face masks in the US?**<br><br>People: Trump is acting like a dictator! He's worse than Putin!<br><br>Also people: Why can't Trump act like a dictator and order the country<br>to not wear masks?<br><br>The reason why questions like this come up is because our education<br>system has failed us. The reason why President Trump can't ban face<br>masks in the US is because he is not a king and he is not a dictator. He<br>is the head of the Executive Branch. He can direct the entire Executive<br>Branch to not wear masks in their places of work if he chose, but he<br>cannot similarly direct states to do the same. States still have rights.<br>States still have governors who run those states and determine policy<br>for the state based on what's best for the state.<br><br>So conceivably, the state governor in Florida could direct the Marion<br>County Sheriff's Office to wear masks and override the Sheriff's order<br>(since the Sheriff gets his authority from the Governor), but Trump does<br>not have similar authority over the governance of a state.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
