<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>There are several reasons why your phone may not have received the<br>Wireless Emergency Alert.<br><br>1.  You were not connected to a cell tower which was capable of<br>    transmitting the WEA signal.<br>2.  Your phone is not capable of receiving a WEA signal. Some older<br>    handsets are not capable of receiving WEA signals.<br><br>In either case, you should call your carrier's Customer Service number<br>(usually 611 from your phone) and inform them that you did not receive<br>the WEA signal, and let them assist you with troubleshooting. Let them<br>know where your exact physical location was from approximately 2:15 PM<br>EDT to 3:15 PM EDT today (3 Oct 2018) so they can research the cell<br>tower to which you were connected. They should also have this<br>information themselves, but it helps the process move a little quicker<br>if they can pinpoint the tower(s) to which you were connected.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
