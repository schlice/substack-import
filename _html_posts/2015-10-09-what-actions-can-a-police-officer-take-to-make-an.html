<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [I think the premise of the question leads you to believe<br>that you\'re asking if a police officer should be a father figure to a<br>fatherless child (which clearly doesn\'t apply to female police<br>officers, sorry<br>[I.L.Mitchell(https://www.quora.com/profile/I-L-Mitchell)]{.qlink_container}).<br>The question also doesn\'t explain whether or not the child was the<br>*perpetrator* or an *innocent bystander*, as this would help to<br>determine whether or not the police officer needs to address the child<br>*at all.*\<br>\<br>I think, if you look at the question at face value, you\'re trying to<br>ascribe a trait to a police officer that is not only unwarranted, but<br>inappropriate. A police officer *should not* be a parental fighre to a<br>child, regardless of that child\'s familial situation. A police officer<br>should always be approachable, and should always use an appropriate tone<br>when speaking with anyone, be it adult or child. The police officer<br>should not be stepping into any family situation whatsoever.\<br>\<br>However, assuming the child is an innocent bystander and the officer is<br>male, really all you can do is reassure the child that everything will<br>work out and that this is not the end of the world (assuming that it\'s<br>not; if their remaining parent was a murder suspect, or if they were<br>killed, this might indeed be the end of the world for that child).\<br>\<br>To wit: a recent car accident claimed the lives of this little girl\'s<br>parents. The Colorado State trooper stepped in, removed the girl from<br>the situation, and sang to the girl to distract her from the horror of<br>what was happening just behind them. A candid shot of when that actually<br>occurred:\<br>\<br>]<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-373b762bb9c71fd5b689f12b34427822){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-373b762bb9c71fd5b689f12b34427822" master_w="962"<br>master_h="724"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>\<br>If there is any description of how the police might act as a father<br>figure to a child in need, you\'re looking at it.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
