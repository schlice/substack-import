<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**My ex's stimulus money was deposited into my bank. What legal trouble<br>could I get in if I don't give it back?**<br><br>Stimulus checks are distributed based on your filing status from your<br>last tax return. Your current marital status (which clearly changed<br>since you filed your last tax return) is not taken into consideration.<br><br>Money you are required to give to your ex is directly related to your<br>divorce decree. If you don't know, I suggest you contact your lawyer and<br>ask what to do.<br><br>\<br><br>*This answer is not a substitute for professional legal advice.
