<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What is guaranteed to happen to you, if you trespass on private<br>property and get caught?**<br><br>Nothing in life is guaranteed. What happens to you is very<br>situation-dependent.<br><br>Let's not forget that the definition of "trespassing" doesn't really<br>encompass the motivation behind that unlawful presence. Trespassing only<br>means that you are physically present in an area in which you don't<br>belong. Let's consider that these are also technically trespassing:<br><br>- You get invited to a friend's house for a party. You wander into an<br>  area in which you have not been granted permission to be.<br>- You are searching your favorite store for an employee to assist you,<br>  and you accidentally wander into an "Employees Only" area.<br><br>In these situations, you are also technically trespassing on private<br>property, and what happens to you then is certainly not guaranteed.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
