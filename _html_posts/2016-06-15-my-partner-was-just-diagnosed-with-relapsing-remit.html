<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>A2A<br><br>If she was just diagnosed, she will be beginning her journey through the<br>5 stages of grief: denial, anger, depression, bargaining, and<br>acceptance. Remember, everyone grieves in their own way. Not everyone<br>experiences all five stages, and not everyone experiences them in the<br>same order. Grieving is a personal process. There is no time limit.<br>There is no "right" way to grieve.<br><br>Denial  is only temporary. We do it to protect ourselves from<br>that first big wave of pain caused from the realization that your life<br>will never be the same, your life will never work out the way you<br>originally thought or dreamed it would, and that you have an incurable<br>disease that will cause you grief and become a new and totally unwanted<br>facet of your daily life, but could also land you in a wheelchair (or<br>worse) when you're older. Denial may only last a few days, and along<br>with bargaining, may be one of the quickest phases to go through.<br><br>Anger is what happens when the denial wears off. The reality of the<br>situation hits us, and we're wholly unprepared to deal with it. We<br>deflect the pain away from ourselves, and it is manifested as anger. The<br>anger is caused by the helplessness and the vulnerability we feel when<br>we learn we have MS. Be aware, *you* may be the target of that anger.<br>Please, please know it is not personal. She is not attacking you. She is<br>releasing her pain because she is protecting herself from it.<br><br>When we find that medications may slow down the disease progression, but<br>nothing will ever cure us of the disease, depression sets in. Almost<br>everyone with MS has experienced some level of depression throughout the<br>course of the disease. Some research claimed that injectable therapy<br>carried a risk of depression, but I truly believe that the association<br>is anecdotal. I believe that in the course of progressing through the<br>grieving process, we come to the inevitable realization that *we will<br>have MS until the day we die, and potentially, MS could make that happen<br>sooner.* There is simply no way that depression would not follow that<br>realization. Sometimes, depression is caused by fear of the unknown, or<br>fear of the practical complications of the disease. "Will I be able to<br>walk my daughter down the aisle?" "Will I be able to throw a baseball<br>with my son ever again?" (That one was mine, since my first symptom was<br>optic neuritis, and suffice it to say that for six months anything<br>moving toward or away from me at any reasonable speed gave me double<br>vision. I couldn't catch a baseball). I actually started letters to my<br>children titled "Read this in case of my untimely death" but I couldn't<br>get through them because the grief was so strong, and the tears fell so<br>freely.<br><br>There is a second type of depression that more often occurs with<br>terminal diseases (of which MS is not), but still occurs with MS with<br>some regularity, and that is the realization of our mortality and the<br>preparation for death. We silently and subconsciously push others away<br>from us to insulate them from our pain. We protect them because we love<br>them and we don't want to see them hurt. My wife would say things like,<br>"Are you deliberately trying to push me away?" I wasn't *deliberately*<br>doing it, I was *subconsciously* doing it. Don't feel bad if you start<br>to feel that your partner is pushing you away. She doesn't know she's<br>doing it. Perhaps she just needs a hug. Perhaps she just needs to know<br>that despite her pain, you're not going away.<br><br>Bargaining follows the helplessness and vulnerability, as we seek a<br>way to control the uncontrollable. Lots of "if only" statements are<br>made. "If only we hadn't gone to Bermuda and gotten those horrible<br>sunburns, I wouldn't have skin cancer now." "If only I would have found<br>out sooner, I could have gotten ahead of this." In the case of MS, "If<br>only my vitamin D levels were straightened out before I turned 15, I may<br>have prevented this" (fwiw, the prophylactic effects of vitamin D in<br>early childhood are still being investigated). Deals with God often<br>happen during this phase, but are just another line of defense against<br>the pain.<br><br>While bargaining or making deals, what we are actually doing is<br>*experimenting* with strategies to cope with the disease. "Maybe I can<br>exercise more, to make myself healthier and potentially stave off some<br>of the muscle effects caused by the disease." This<br>bargaining/experimenting phase is what starts lifting us out of<br>depression. Be supportive of your partner during this phase. She may<br>have some crazy-sounding ideas, but she's toying with the ways to cope<br>with the disease, and starting into the next stage:<br><br>Acceptance. This is the point we reach when we realize that we<br>*have* MS, we *are not* MS. We are not our disease. With proper disease<br>management, we can live as full and active a life as someone without the<br>disease. With modern medicine, mortality rates among MS patients nearly<br>match those of people without the disease. And no one can ever predict<br>the sudden turns the disease may take, but they are no more or less<br>sudden and unexpected in their onset than being involved in a car<br>accident. Worrying about them will not make the disease progress more<br>slowly, so worry is a wasted emotion. For me, one of my great tools of<br>acceptance is Quora (and other Q&A and medical community sites). I get<br>to help others who are recently diagnosed, or who are struggling to come<br>to grips with a disease that is eminently beyond understanding or<br>prediction. Being a patient advocate means I know what it's like to be a<br>patient, because I am one (I'm not only the Hair Club president, but I'm<br>also a client) (If you don't know that one, look it up. I may have just<br>shown my age).<br><br>Make sure you give your partner space to grieve, but not so much space<br>that she feels like you're pulling away from her because she has a<br>disease. Be there for her, but don't smother her. She needs reassurance<br>that you're not going away, but she needs time alone to work through her<br>grief.<br><br>*Keep being her best friend*. Don't let MS change that. Ever.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
