<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>> Question details:<br>><br>> After running my ID, police said it "popped up in their database that<br>> I\'m a recovering heroin addict" so they needed to search my car. How<br>> would they know that? I\'ve never been arrested for anything, I\'ve<br>> never even been around anyone arrested for drugs. & Rehabs can\'t<br>> share that info. So wtf?<br><br>Regardless of whether or not the police somehow had information<br>indicating that you were a recovering addict (congratulations, by the<br>way, keep on fighting), being such does not remove any rights you have<br>under the Constitution.<br><br>There are a scant few scenarios in which you get rights removed.<br>Primarily: if you are accused of domestic violence in some states, you<br>have been adjudicated as a "mental deficient," you have been convicted<br>of a felony, or you are a parolee. There are probably a few others, but<br>I can't think of them off the top of my head. Basically, if you have had<br>your Constitutional rights curtailed, you would know it, because it<br>would have been a judge who told you about it.<br><br>Beyond that, being in rehab doesn't remove any Constitutional rights.<br>The police did not have the right to search your car. If this happened<br>recently, and the police found something in your car that they are<br>planning on using against you, I would suggest enlisting the services of<br>a civil rights attorney.<br><br>If they didn't find anything, just remember for next time: being an<br>*addict* doesn't make you a *criminal*. It makes you a<br>*patient*. You have a disease of the system in your brain which<br>controls choice. This is why you have to abstain from all drugs,<br>including alcohol. It doesn't make you a bad person. Know that.<br><br>*(Full disclosure: I've spent many years in the rooms of Nar-Anon, so I<br>have second-hand experience, so to speak)*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
