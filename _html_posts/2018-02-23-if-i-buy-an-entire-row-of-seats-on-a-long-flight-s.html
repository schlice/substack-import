<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**I\'mIf I buy an entire row of seats on a long flight so no one is next<br>to me, can the airline sell one of my empty seats to someone or will<br>they respect the fact that the empty seats are mine to do as I please<br>with?**<br><br>- You don't actually buy "seats" on a plane. You buy a "contract of<br>  carriage" which says the airline will take you from your origin city<br>  to your destination city.<br>- Each contract (affectionately known as a "ticket") needs to be<br>  assigned to a person. So you can't buy an entire row of seats without<br>  assigning actual passengers to those seats.<br>- Additionally, airlines frequently "oversell" airplanes, which means<br>  that they sell more "tickets" than there are seats on a plane. This is<br>  generally done because there are always a certain percentage of<br>  passengers who simply don't show up for the flight.<br><br>You check in to your flight and are assigned a seat at check-in. For<br>most airlines and in most scenarios, this process is "first come, first<br>served." There are some exceptions, such as frequent flyer status, but<br>for economy passengers, time of check-in determines who gets assigned<br>seats. Everyone else who has bought a ticket for that flight gets put on<br>a "standby" list to see if anyone doesn't show up.<br><br>When the airline's appointed time has passed (usually some time before<br>the flight is scheduled to depart, anywhere between 15 and 25 minutes<br>before), any passengers who have not checked in are "bumped" and the<br>airline can assign the remaining seats to other paid passengers holding<br>tickets for that flight, who are waiting on the "standby" list.<br><br>This allows the airline to be as efficient as possible and not fly empty<br>planes. It also prevents you from buying up a whole row of seats and<br>putting no one in them.<br><br>This means that if you buy a bunch of tickets, it is entirely up to the<br>airline whether or not they assign you those seats.<br><br>(EDIT) The airlines saw my answer and apparently in an effort to make me<br>look foolish, changed their business model. Okay, they may have changed<br>their business model to adapt to customer demands and to take advantage<br>of "better" seats, but whatever.<br><br>Now, most airlines allow you to buy *specific seats* on the airplane,<br>pay for them, and reserve them. So you can, in fact, buy an entire row<br>of seats.<br><br>However, since the airline "oversells" some flights, they can actually<br>seat people in those seats if they choose, as you must claim your seat<br>by 15 minutes before the flight or the airline can seat passengers in<br>those seats. You can't buy a whole row of seats, leave them open, and<br>then expect that in no way would the airline ever seat someone in those<br>seats. If there's no occupant of that seat (a cello, a cat, a car seat,<br>etc), they can seat someone there. At best, they'd refund you the price<br>of your ticket because they seated someone else there. At worst, you're<br>out of luck because you forfeited the seat by not having someone or<br>something in it.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
