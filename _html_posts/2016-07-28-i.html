<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>A2A<br><br>I like [[Justin<br>Styles](https://www.quora.com/profile/Justin-Styles-1)]{.qlink_container}'<br>answer and the way he phrased it. "\T\he Army has entrance standards<br>that are ...*different*. Not lower, per se, but their mission allows for<br>them to accept a wider range of candidates."<br><br>That's putting it mildly.<br><br>Because of their mission type, the Army must admit multiple times the<br>number of people that the Air Force must admit. The Air Force can<br>therefore be more selective in their recruitment, necessarily therefore<br>admitting a higher-scoring component of admissions criteria. So while it<br>may be untrue, it's worth noting: perception is reality. Because of the<br>differences in admissions standards, the Army is perceived to be the<br>"dumber" service. Right or wrong, that's the way it is. There are some<br>incredibly smart people in the Army, and I take nothing away from them,<br>but the reality is that perceptions are what they are.<br><br>If you have a choice, go for the Air Force. Quality of life is<br>better, treatment of personnel is better, living conditions are better,<br>facilities are better, the list goes on.<br><br>> \T\he food is much better in the Air Force than in any other<br>> service. No disrespect to any of my other-service colleagues, but it<br>> just is.<br>><br>> The Air Force is the youngest service, only being around since 1947.<br>> The Army, Navy, and Marine Corps have been around as long as the<br>> country has been around. The Air Force is smaller, leaner, and<br>> generally less encumbered by \"the way things have always been done\"<br>> than any of the other services. The Air Force is generally more<br>> technologically advanced, followed closely by the Navy, and flies all<br>> of the reconnaissance aircraft and satellites, so much of their work<br>> is directly tied to intelligence.<br>><br>> It is true that physical fitness standards, and how they are exercised<br>> and measured, are different between the services. But this is<br>> primarily due to their missions. The Army and the Marine Corps are the<br>> most physically fit, and exercise regularly, together as a unit. Their<br>> missions involve them fighting, physically, hand-to-hand, on the<br>> ground. The Air Force has physical standards that must be maintained<br>> (body fat percentage, physical standards in sit ups, push ups, pull<br>> ups, and aerobics), but they allow their personnel to work out on<br>> their own. Their mission is not directly tied to the physical fitness<br>> of their personnel (except for some career fields), but physical<br>> fitness is emphasized to a lesser degree than the other services. The<br>> mission comes first.<br>><br>> It\'s a study in irony: it\'s called the Air Force, but only 13% of<br>> the people who work in it can actually fly airplanes. UAVs change that<br>> number, as more people who are traditionally not pilot-qualified can<br>> still fly. In stark contrast, everyone in the Marine Corps is a<br>> Rifleman first and foremost, and then can have a different career<br>> field from there.<br>><br>> That said, the career field offerings in the Air Force are some of the<br>> most technologically challenging (and necessary) career fields in the<br>> known world. The people who work there are some of the smartest, most<br>> driven individuals you will ever hope to meet, who love their country<br>> dearly, and would give their lives in her defense (as the members of<br>> any of our military branches would do).<br>><br>> We do like to do a lot of good-natured teasing of the other services<br>> (for example, our names: grunts, squids, jarheads and zoomies), but we<br>> are all there for the same purpose: to support and defend the<br>> Constitution against all enemies, foreign and<br>> domestic.\[1\](#jtYYs){#cite-jtYYs .citation_link}<br><br>If you have your choice, I would highly recommend the Air Force.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-jtYYs){.citation_index} [[Bill Stein\'s answer to What are<br>good reasons for joining the Air Force rather than the Army or the<br>Navy?](https://www.quora.com/What-are-good-reasons-for-joining-the-Air-Force-rather-than-the-Army-or-the-Navy/answer/Bill-Stein)]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
