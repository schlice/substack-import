<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I assume you are referring to the McDonald\'s case pending in Seattle.<br><br>[[McDonald's Sues Seattle Over \$15 Minimum Wage, Cites Fourteenth<br>Amendment](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=6b1ade&url=https://thebillfold.com/mcdonald-s-sues-seattle-over-15-minimum-wage-cites-fourteenth-amendment-a394d9d55a9%23.ko2ed8bys){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="thebillfold.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>The information about the original lawsuit comes from Fortune magazine:<br><br>> Shortly after \Seattle Mayor Ed Murray\ signed the ordinance into<br>> law, lawyer\<br>> Paul Clement sued the city of Seattle on behalf of the International<br>> Franchise Association, which claimed that the \$15 per hour law will<br>> irreparably harm franchisees and put them at a competitive<br>> disadvantage. The lawsuit, which was filed in Seattle federal court,<br>> takes aim at the provision of the minimum wage law that treats hotel<br>> and fast food franchises differently than other small, local<br>> businesses simply because they're associated with big corporations. As<br>> it stands now, franchisees must adopt the \$15 minimum wage within<br>> three years --- the same time frame required of large employers. Other<br>> small businesses, meanwhile, have seven years to reach the \$15 per<br>> hour threshold.<br>><br>> In a motion for preliminary injunction that Clement filed earlier this<br>> month, he argues that the ordinance violates the interstate commerce<br>> clause of the Constitution and the equal protection clause of the<br>> Fourteenth Amendment. Its "discriminatory" nature, the filing says,<br>> "crosses the constitutional line."<br><br>The plaintiffs argue that they are being discriminated against because<br>they are simply associated with big corporations (even though they are<br>franchisees, and so they pay their employees out of their own profits,<br>so in that respect, they are no different from any other small<br>business). They are using a 14th Amendment argument because they are<br>being treated differently from other businesses, which have seven years<br>to comply with the new law, as opposed to franchisees, which are only<br>given three years to comply.<br><br>The<br>[brainchild(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=c63751&url=https://medium.com/@NicoleDieker){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="medium.com"}]{.qlink_container} who wrote the article over<br>at The Billfold is incensed that McDonalds would attempt to use the 14th<br>Amendment and claim that a business should be treated as a person, and<br>that McDonalds is so rolling in cash that it\'s just beyond the pale<br>that they couldn\'t see paying \$15 an hour to their employees from<br>their vast coffers of money.<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-bebd5aa7df72b29e325a3c1426ba0e8a){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-bebd5aa7df72b29e325a3c1426ba0e8a" master_w="300"<br>master_h="225"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>I know we\'ve detailed this before, but I can\'t seem to find it at the<br>moment. So I\'ll just re-iterate a few bullet points.<br><br>1.  McDonald\'s is only one franchisee being represented by the<br>    International Franchise Association, but it seems to be the one<br>    everyone is singling out. Nevertheless, McDonalds, like so many<br>    other corporations, is not a person. It is a group of individual<br>    people, all making salaries, all sharing profits, all paying for<br>    inventory and food and production, together. A very large group, but<br>    a group nonetheless. However, the government feels that a<br>    corporation (a legal construct, not a person) should be taxed.<br>    However, it is people that pay taxes, not legal constructs, since<br>    only people can actually \"make\" money. Therefore, it is the<br>    government, through its incessant taxation of corporations, that<br>    have chosen to make corporations into \"people.\"<br>2.  If a corporation is treated as a person under the law, it has the<br>    full protection of the Constitution, and the 14th Amendment should<br>    apply.<br>3.  Franchisees are not their parent company. They are independent<br>    businesses, owned and operated by a person who buys a \"license\"<br>    from the corporation. They make their own individual profits, and<br>    they pay licensing fees back to the corporation. In turn, the<br>    corporation provides the licensee with raw products and the means to<br>    turn them into licensed products that they can then sell. **The<br>    corporation would not be paying the higher wages; the franchisees<br>    would**. They can\'t afford that any more than any other business.<br><br>As for the \$15 an hour minimum wage law, the objections to it have<br>nothing to do with greedy corporations who want workers to suffer, or<br>any other deluded sort of conspiracy theory related to unchecked<br>capitalism. In fact, I don\'t even have to explain it. A man who knows<br>the true value of a dollar, Mike Rowe, from *Dirty Jobs* fame, was asked<br>the same question about McDonald\'s and the \$15 an hour minimum wage.<br>He was asked what he thought might happen to the price of a Big Mac<br>should this law go into effect.<br><br>> Hi Mike,<br>><br>> The federal minimum wage is \$7.25 and hour. A lot of people think it<br>> should be raised to \$10.10. Seattle now pays \$15 an hour, and the<br>> The Freedom Socialist Party is demanding a \$20 living wage for every<br>> working person. What do you think about the minimum wage? How much do<br>> you think a Big Mac will cost if McDonald's had to pay all their<br>> employees \$20 an hour?<br>><br>> Darrell Paul<br><br>Here is his answer:<br><br>> Hi Darrell<br>><br>> Back in 1979, I was working as an usher for United Artists at a<br>> multiplex in Baltimore. The minimum wage was \$2.90, and I earned<br>> every penny.<br>><br>> When I wasn't tearing tickets in half and stopping kids from theater<br>> hopping, I was cleaning out the bathrooms, emptying the trash, and<br>> scrapping dubious substances off the theater floor with a putty knife.<br>> I wore a silly outfit and smiled unnaturally, usually for the entirety<br>> of my shift. I worked 18 hours my first week, mostly after school, and<br>> earned \$62.20. Before taxes. But I was also learning the importance<br>> of "soft skills." I learned to show up on time and tuck my shirt in. I<br>> embraced the many virtues of proper hygiene. Most of all, I learned<br>> how to take shit from the public, and suck up to my boss.<br>><br>> After three months, I got a raise, and wound up behind the concession<br>> stand. Once it was determined I wasn't a thief, I was promoted to<br>> cashier. Three months later, I got another raise. Eventually, they<br>> taught me how to operate a projector, which was the job I wanted in<br>> the first place.<br>><br>> The films would arrive from Hollywood in giant boxes, thin and square,<br>> like the top of a card table, but heavy. I'd open each one with care,<br>> and place each spool on a separate platter. Then, I'd thread them into<br>> the giant projector, looping the leader through 22 separate gates,<br>> careful to touch only the sides. Raging Bull, Airplane, The Shining,<br>> Caddyshack, The Elephant Man - I saw them all from the shadowy comfort<br>> of the projection booth, and collected \$10 an hour for my trouble.<br>> Eventually, I was offered an assistant manager position, which I<br>> declined. I wasn't management material then, anymore than I am now.<br>> But I had a plan. I was going to be in the movies. Or, God forbid, on<br>> television.<br>><br>> I thought about all this last month when I saw "Boyhood" at a theater<br>> in San Francisco. I bought the tickets from a machine that took my<br>> credit card and spit out a piece of paper with a bar code on it. I<br>> walked inside, and fed the paper into another machine, which beeped<br>> twice, welcomed me in a mechanical voice, and lowered a steel bar that<br>> let me into the lobby. No usher, no cashier. I found the concession<br>> stand and bought a bushel of popcorn from another machine, and a<br>> gallon of Diet Coke that I poured myself. On the way out, I saw an<br>> actual employee, who turned out to be the manager. I asked him how<br>> much a projectionist was making these days, and he just laughed.<br>><br>> "There's no such position," he said. I just put the film in the slot<br>> myself and press a button. Easy breezy."<br>><br>> To answer your question Darrell, I'm worried. From the business owners<br>> I've talked to, it seems clear that companies are responding to rising<br>> labor costs by embracing automation faster than ever. That's<br>> eliminating thousands of low-paying, unskilled, entry level positions.<br>> What will that mean for those people trying to get started in the<br>> workforce? My job as an usher was the first rung on a long ladder of<br>> work that lead me to where I am today. But what if that rung wasn\'t<br>> there? If the minimum wage in 1979 had been suddenly raised from<br>> \$2.90 to \$10 an hour, thousands of people would have applied for the<br>> same job. What chance would I have had, being seventeen years old with<br>> pimples and a big adams apple?<br>><br>> One night, thirty-six years ago, during the midnight showing of The<br>> Rocky Horror Picture Show, I sat in the projection booth and read a<br>> short story by Ray Bradbury called "A Sound of Thunder." It was about<br>> a guy who traveled back in time to look at dinosaurs, but against<br>> strict orders, ventured off the observation platform and accidentally<br>> stepped on a butterfly. When he returned to the present, everything in<br>> the world had changed. "The Butterfly Effect" is now an expression<br>> that describes a single event that leads to a series of unanticipated<br>> outcomes, resulting in a profoundly unintended consequence.<br>> (Ironically, it\'s also a movie with Ashton Kutcher, which I had to<br>> pay to see 30 years later.)<br>><br>> Anyway, I'm not an economist or a sociologist, but I'm pretty sure a<br>> \$20 minimum wage would affect a lot more than the cost of a Big Mac.<br>> Beyond the elimination of many entry-level jobs, consider the effect<br>> on the skills gap. According to the BLS, they're about three million<br>> available positions that companies are trying to fill right now. Very<br>> few of those jobs require a four-year degree, but nearly all require<br>> specific training. And all pay more than the current minimum wage. If<br>> we want a skilled workforce, (and believe me, we do,) should we really<br>> be demanding \$20 an hour for unskilled labor?<br>><br>> Last year, I narrated a commercial about US manufacturing, paid for by<br>> Walmart. It started a shitstorm, and cost me many thousands virtual<br>> friends. Among the aggrieved, was a labor organization called Jobs<br>> With Justice. They wanted me to know just how unfairly Walmart was<br>> treating it's employees. So they had their members send my foundation<br>> over 8,000 form letters, asking me to meet with unhappy Walmart<br>> workers, and join them in their fight against "bad jobs."<br>><br>> While I'm sympathetic to employees who want to be paid fairly, I<br>> prefer to help on an individual basis. I'm also skeptical that a<br>> modest pay increase will make an unskilled worker less reliant upon an<br>> employer whom they affirmatively resent. I explained this to Jobs With<br>> Justice in an open letter, and invited anyone who felt mistreated to<br>> explore the many training opportunities and scholarships available<br>> through mikeroweWORKS. I further explained that I couldn't couldn't<br>> join them in their fight against "bad jobs," because frankly, I don't<br>> believe there is such a thing. My exact words were, "Some jobs pay<br>> better, some jobs smell better, and some jobs have no business being<br>> treated like careers. But work is never the enemy, regardless of the<br>> wage. Because somewhere between the job and the paycheck, there's<br>> still a thing called opportunity, and that's what people need to<br>> pursue."<br>><br>> People are always surprised to learn that many of the subjects on<br>> Dirty Jobs were millionaires - entrepreneurs who crawled through a<br>> river of crap, prospered, and created jobs for others along the way.<br>> Men and women who started with nothing and built a going concern out<br>> of the dirt. I was talking last week with my old friend Richard, who<br>> owns a small but prosperous construction company in California.<br>> Richard still hangs drywall and sheetrock with his aging crew because<br>> he can't find enough young people who want to learn the construction<br>> trades. Today, he'll pay \$40 an hour for a reliable welder, but more<br>> often than not, he can't find one. Whenever I talk to Richard, and<br>> consider the number of millennials within 50 square miles of his<br>> office stocking shelves or slinging hash for the minimum wage, I can<br>> only shake my head.<br>><br>> Point is Darrell, if you fix the wage of a worker, or freeze the price<br>> of a thing, you're probably gonna step on a few butterflies. Doesn't<br>> matter how well-intended the policy - the true cost a \$20 minimum<br>> wage has less to do with the price of a Big Mac, and more to do with a<br>> sound of thunder. Frankly, it scares the hell out of me.<br>><br>> Mike<br>><br>> PS I looked into the Freedom Socialist Party and their demand for a<br>> universal, \$20 an hour living wage. Interesting. You\'re right -<br>> they\'re serious. But not long after they announced their position,<br>> they made the interesting decision to advertise for a web<br>> designer\....at \$13 an hour. Make of that what you will\...<br>> ([http://www.huffingtonpost.com/.../socialist-13-hour_n_6008432...(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=811cc3&url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/10/18/socialist-13-hour_n_6008432.html){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="huffingtonpost.com"}]{.qlink_container})<br><br>I can\'t argue with the logic and wisdom of the great one, Mike Rowe.<br>Instead of focusing on paying unskilled employees more, unskilled<br>workers should *get a skill* and make themselves worth more.<br>Government subsidies? Let\'s subsidize trade schools, so that people can<br>learn a trade, a marketable skill. Remember when schools used to teach<br>that stuff? It all went away when we started to think of school as<br>nothing more than \"college prep.\" Once we got that mindset (that<br>college is the end-all, be-all of life), we \"overlooked\" skilled-labor<br>jobs.
