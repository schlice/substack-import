<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The problem with CFPB comes with the interpretation of the Vacancies<br>Reform Act, and its text which states that it is the \"exclusive means\"<br>for authorizing the appointment of an acting head unless another statute<br>expressly designates a particular officer to serve in that acting<br>capacity.<br><br>The legal battle is over the wording "exclusive." The administration<br>argues that the authors of the law would not have said that the VRA is<br>"exclusive" if it wasn't meant to be the overriding law, despite other<br>statutes. A statute can't be both "exclusive" and "subservient to<br>another law." The opposition states that where the VRA says "another<br>statute expressly designating a particular officer" means that<br>Dodd-Frank (which established CFPB and its chain of succession) is that<br>"other statute," so VRA doesn't apply. The administration says that if<br>other laws are to take precedent, then the VRA would have been worded to<br>say, "Any other law that names a succession takes precedence. In the<br>absence of such law, the VRA can be used." However, it does not say<br>that; it says that it is the "exclusive means" for appointing an acting<br>head. The word "exclusive" is the one that the administration claims<br>makes it supersede any other law.<br><br>So far, the courts have sided with the administration, refusing to<br>institute an injunction against the president installing an interim head<br>of the CFPB until a permanent head can be designated and make it through<br>Senate confirmation hearings.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
