<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Some people may believe without evidence, but most people believe in God<br>with very good evidence. It's just not the evidence that you're<br>thinking. It's not science, because you can't use science tools to find<br>an immaterial God. We have to use other tools to provide the evidence of<br>God's existence.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
