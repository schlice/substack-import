<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Why don\'t the Democrats capitalize on all the lies Trump said in his<br>SOTU?**<br><br>Oh, don't worry, they'll try.<br><br>*But at this point, who will believe them?*<br><br>First it was Russia, then it was Ukraine, and the final nail in the<br>coffin is the failed partisan impeachment. Trump beat them all. And he<br>came out of it with better public opinion than when he was elected.<br><br>I can remember Jerry Nadler saying, clear as a bell, that he was in<br>possession of actual evidence that proved Trump and Russia. Lie.<br><br>I can remember Adam Schiff spinning a bard's tale about Trump's phone<br>call, on the record, in the House, to make a point. Another lie.<br><br>They literally discredit themselves every time they speak.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
