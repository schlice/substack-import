<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Do you think your homeowners association is necessary?<br><br>As a past president of a homeowner's association, I can tell you that no<br>HOA is absolutely necessary.<br><br>If *all* of the homeowners in a particular area would get together on a<br>regular basis, they could literally do everything that an HOA does, and<br>probably more efficiently. They could seek group discounts for services<br>like trash removal. They could work together to control what people do<br>to the exterior of their homes, knowing that while I am unconcerned with<br>what you do to your house, I also am aware that what you do affects your<br>neighbors, and their home values. Each individual homeowner could temper<br>their own desires for their own homes, and take into consideration what<br>those actions might mean for their neighbors. You can have volunteers<br>who can take ownership of common areas on behalf of everyone and<br>maintain them, sharing the costs equally.<br><br>The problem, of course, is that the above scenario *never happens.* No<br>matter how small your association may be, there are always some<br>homeowners who *steadfastly refuse to cooperate*. I wish it were not<br>true, but it is. There is always a percentage of homeowners who either<br>refuse to cooperate for refusal's sake, or who are actually<br>participating in illegal activity and don't want anyone else impinging<br>on their criminal enterprise. They will use the guise of "it's my<br>property and I'll do what I want on it" to forestall any corrections to<br>their own bad behavior.<br><br>So **while HOAs may not be absolutely necessary in a perfect world, they<br>are absolutely needed in this one.**<br><br>You need a governing body which can act on behalf of all of the<br>homeowners and pressure the ones who simply refuse to play along, either<br>because they don't care or they are doing their own illegal stuff and<br>don't want to be troubled by your "rules." You need a body that can act<br>on behalf of a large group of homeowners and put pressure on the local<br>government to enact changes.<br><br>It is only an HOA, that everyone signs on to when they purchase their<br>homes, and that actually has some "skin in the game" to pressure<br>recalcitrant homeowners, which can do this.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
