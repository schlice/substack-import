<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If God really blesses people and helps them through life, then why<br>does he let some kids get raped by their weird uncle Jim?**<br><br>Totally contradictory, right? Why would an all-powerful God allow<br>anything bad to happen to anyone?<br><br>In other words, *why do bad things happen to good people?*<br><br>I've already answered this question once before, but I'll copy my answer<br>here for your reading pleasure:<br><br>\<br><br>> First of all, **if you believe that somehow God is obligated to<br>> explain Himself to us, you ought to do a better job reading the<br>> Bible**. Proverbs 25:2 says, "It is the glory of God to conceal a<br>> matter." Isaiah 45:15 says, "Truly You are a God who hides Himself."<br>> First Corinthians 2:11 says, "No one knows the thoughts of God except<br>> the Spirit of God." Deuteronomy 29:29 says, "The secret things belong<br>> to the Lord our God" (NKJV). Ecclesiastes 11:5 says, "As you do not<br>> know the path of the wind, or how the body is formed in a mother's<br>> womb, so you cannot understand the work of God, the Maker of all<br>> things." Isaiah 55:8--9 says, "'For My thoughts are not your thoughts,<br>> neither are your ways My ways,' declares the Lord. 'As the heavens are<br>> higher than the earth, so are My ways higher than your ways, and My<br>> thoughts higher than your thoughts.'"<br>><br>> It appears as if the Bible is telling us we don't have the capacity to<br>> understand God's infinite mind or the plans He has for us. It's<br>> arrogance for us to believe we have the ability to understand the mind<br>> of God. It's like you standing over a pregnant mother's womb and<br>> trying to explain what life is like on the other side, in such a way<br>> that the baby in the womb would understand. That baby simply doesn't<br>> yet possess the capacity to understand. Paul told the believers in<br>> Corinth, "Now we see but a poor reflection; then we shall see face to<br>> face. Now, I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I am fully<br>> known" (1 Cor. 13:12). Paul was basically saying that we may not ever<br>> gain full understanding while we are alive on earth, and we probably<br>> need to learn to accept that.<br>><br>> Secondly, **no one ever said that being a Christian would mean a<br>> problem-free life**. If you've ever looked into any of the lives of<br>> the great men and women of the Bible, their lives were not the most<br>> glamorous. Look at Joseph. His brothers and sisters hated him so much,<br>> they sold him into slavery. When in Egypt, he was thrown in prison,<br>> falsely accused of rape, and threatened with execution. During the<br>> entire ordeal, there is no indication in the Bible that God explained<br>> His plan to Joseph. He was simply expected to live out his life in<br>> less-than-complete understanding, as you and I are. *What pleased God<br>> was Joseph's faithfulness when nothing else made sense*. Stephen was<br>> stoned because he proclaimed God's name. James was put to death with a<br>> sword for his faithfulness. Paul was persecuted, stoned, flogged, and<br>> beheaded in a Roman prison. During their lifetimes, they never knew<br>> God's great plan for them. Jesus said that life wouldn't be easy. He<br>> said, "I have told you these things, so that in me you may have peace.<br>> In this world, you will have trouble. But take heart! I have overcome<br>> the world" (John 16:33).<br>><br>> Throughout the Bible, it tells us not only that bad times can happen,<br>> but that we should *expect* bad times to come because they will.<br>> Yet somehow, we still expect God to take away all of our problems,<br>> spearheading our walk through life with his massive Godly leaf-blower,<br>> clearing our path of any trials, hardships, or pain. This causes a<br>> great deal of anxiety, even among long-time faithful, because life is<br>> hard.<br>><br>> The Bible tells us to not bother trying to understand, not to bother<br>> trying to make all the pieces fit together. "Trust in the Lord, lean<br>> not on your own understanding" (Prov. 3:5). We are not told to not try<br>> to understand, just don't "lean on" your understanding, which means<br>> don't make it an ultimatum. "God, you'd better explain yourself, or<br>> I'm outta here!" That would be "leaning" on your own understanding,<br>> and we are admonished against that.<br>><br>> So what does this all mean? Basically, expect trouble in life, and<br>> expect that there will be situations we do not understand. Faith is<br>> the point at which logic stops making sense. We must have faith that<br>> God will keep His promises, and that everything we go through in this<br>> life has a purpose, even though our minds do not have the capacity to<br>> understand it.\[1\](#ytfuP){#cite-ytfuP .citation_link}<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-ytfuP){.citation_index} [[If is there a god out there why<br>\"it\" wont protect all these full of dreams victims in the terror<br>attacks?](https://www.quora.com/If-is-there-a-god-out-there-why-it-wont-protect-all-these-full-of-dreams-victims-in-the-terror-attacks)]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
