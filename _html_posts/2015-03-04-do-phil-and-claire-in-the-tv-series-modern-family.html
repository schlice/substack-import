<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Phil and Claire\'s parenting style is *dramatized*.\<br>\<br>Have you ever seen the front of a cereal box where it shows you an<br>extreme close-up of the cereal? It always has some fine print in the<br>corner which says something along the lines of \"Enlarged to show<br>texture.\"\<br>\<br>As if you didn\'t know that the actual nugget of cereal was much smaller<br>than the one pictured on the box (who knows, some may).\<br>\<br>When you see the parenting style on TV, it is dramatized. That means it<br>is exaggerated to point out the texture. It is aggrandized to splay out<br>the nuances, the foibles, and the tribulations of parenting. We laugh as<br>parents because we\'ve all felt that way at one time or another.\<br>\<br>We have felt that way; we don\'t act that way.\<br>\<br>Most parents in the US do not act the way that Phil and Claire do, but<br>they can sympathize because they feel as if they\'ve been there at least<br>once in their lives.\<br>\<br>That\'s what makes television *engaging*; you can relate to what you\'re<br>seeing.\<br>\<br>But it also makes television dramas (or comedies) a *poor reflection of<br>reality*.\<br>\<br>I think sometimes, television may be a fairer reflection of reality than<br>we may admit. But most of the time, television is a dramatization of<br>reality, and doesn\'t accurately reflect how most people<br>live.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
