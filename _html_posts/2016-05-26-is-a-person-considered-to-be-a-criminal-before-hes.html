<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>If a person is not under arrest, he or she is not considered to be<br>anything other than a citizen. He may be a "person of interest" but<br>beyond that, he has no special consideration. He is not considered to be<br>a "criminal" because "criminal" is not a legal designation. It's an<br>adjective, meaning "someone who has committed a crime." If you've ever<br>broken the speed limit, even unknowingly, you technically could also<br>rightly be called a "criminal," so that's not a word that is normally<br>used. It's too broad a term to be used in law enforcement. Notice the<br>difference: if you are not in custody, you are free to go; you are not<br>being "detained."<br><br>Once a person is arrested, he is a "suspect" whether he has been<br>formally charged or not. The formal arrest means that the officer has<br>enough evidence to present a "charge" to the judge.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
