<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>What in the world are you talking about? Any baritone worth his salt can<br>sing this in its traditional key of Ab. I sing it routinely. I was a<br>singer for the Sky Sox a few seasons ago in Colorado Springs, and I sang<br>Opening Day for the Sox. Tons of fun. I also sang for military events.<br><br>Secondly, the other verses do not involve slavery. I wonder if you're<br>worried about the first line in the fourth verse: "Oh thus be it ever,<br>when freemen shall stand". "Freemen" was less about African slaves and<br>was more about indentured servants who were released from their<br>financial obligations. And even at the time, it had little to do with<br>slavery; it was a condition to vote:<br><br>> In the Massachusetts Bay Colony, a man had to be a member of the<br>> Church to be a freeman; in neighboring Plymouth Colony a man did not<br>> need to be a member of the Church, but he had to be elected to this<br>> privilege by the General Court. Being a freeman carried with it the<br>> right to vote, and in Plymouth only freemen could vote by<br>> 1632.\[1\](#tmhOI){#cite-tmhOI .citation_link}<br><br>Regardless, it expresses an idea about people, not a condoning of<br>slavery. There is no need to change the word.<br><br>The song is derived from a poem written by Francis Scott Key while he<br>was on a ship watching the attack on Fort McHenry on September 14, 1814.<br>Come the morning light, he was relieved to see that the American flag<br>was still waving over the Fort: the British were unable to take the<br>fort. His joy at seeing the flag still waving inspired him to pen the<br>poem. The poem was printed in newspapers, and yes, it was eventually set<br>to music, a popular English drinking tune called "To Anacreon in Heaven"<br>by composer John Stafford Smith. Nevertheless, the song stuck, and<br>people started calling it "The Star-Spangled Banner" and in 1916,<br>President Woodrow Wilson declared that it would be performed at all<br>official events. Congress adopted it as our national anthem on March 3,<br>1931.<br><br>Many things we did as early colonists are holdovers from our time as<br>British subjects, and many of our popular cultural ideas of the time<br>were similarly holdovers from British times. For example, "My Country<br>'Tis Of Thee," the *de facto* National Anthem until The Star Spangled<br>Banner was adopted in 1931, is set to music that was or is used around<br>the world as national anthems:<br><br>- \"[[God Save the<br>  Queen](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=25b1e4&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_Save_the_Queen){.external_link<br>  rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>  onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>  qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}\"<br>- \"[[Heil dir im<br>  Siegerkranz](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=517a58&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heil_dir_im_Siegerkranz){.external_link<br>  rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>  onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>  qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}\"<br>- \"[Kongesangen(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=84f90b&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kongesangen){.external_link<br>  rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>  onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>  qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}\"<br>- \"[[Oben am jungen<br>  Rhein](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=694666&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oben_am_jungen_Rhein){.external_link<br>  rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>  onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>  qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}\"<br>- \"[[The Prayer of<br>  Russians](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=1a6aca&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Prayer_of_Russians){.external_link<br>  rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>  onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>  qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}\"<br>- \"[[Rufst du, mein<br>  Vaterland](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=42d37c&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rufst_du,_mein_Vaterland){.external_link<br>  rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>  onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>  qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}\"<br><br>Part of the reason that we're not going to replace it follows the same<br>logic by which we're not going to remove "In God We Trust" from our<br>money, or remove it as our national motto. We've reaffirmed the motto<br>several times. Congress has passed several laws reaffirming our national<br>motto, most recently in 2006. The courts have ruled that it does not<br>violate the separation of church and state, calling it "ceremonial<br>Deism." It's part of our national heritage.<br><br>Similarly, "The Star-Spangled Banner" is part of our national heritage,<br>warts and all (if there are any).<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>**Isn\'t it time that America replaces it\'s national anthem? First,<br>almost no one has the vocal range to sing it. Second, the music is a<br>purloined British drinking song. Third, the other verses involve<br>slavery.**<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-tmhOI){.citation_index} [[Freeman (Colonial) -<br>Wikipedia](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=ae0ff2&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freeman_(Colonial)){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
