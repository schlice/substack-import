<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>As with any legal question, the answer is "it depends." Laws on when a<br>guardian can be removed vary by state.<br><br>Here in Florida, there are 21 reasons a guardian can be removed:<br><br>1.  Fraud in obtaining her or his appointment.<br>2.  Failure to discharge her or his duties.<br>3.  Abuse of her or his powers.<br>4.  An incapacity or illness, including substance abuse, which renders<br>    the guardian incapable of discharging her or his duties.<br>5.  Failure to comply with any order of the court.<br>6.  Failure to return schedules of property sold or accounts of sales of<br>    property or to produce and exhibit the ward's assets when so<br>    required.<br>7.  The wasting, embezzlement, or other mismanagement of the ward's<br>    property.<br>8.  Failure to give bond or security for any purpose when required by<br>    the court or failure to file with the annual guardianship plan the<br>    evidence required by s. 744.351 that the sureties on her or his bond<br>    are alive and solvent.<br>9.  Conviction of a felony.<br>10. Appointment of a receiver, trustee in bankruptcy, or liquidator for<br>    any corporate guardian.<br>11. Development of a conflict of interest between the ward and the<br>    guardian.<br>12. Having been found guilty of, regardless of adjudication, or entered<br>    a plea of *nolo contendere* or guilty to, any offense prohibited<br>    under s. 435.04 or similar statute of another jurisdiction.<br>13. A material failure to comply with the guardianship report by the<br>    guardian.<br>14. A failure to comply with the rules for timely filing the initial and<br>    annual guardianship reports.<br>15. A failure to fulfill the guardianship education requirements.<br>16. The improper management of the ward's assets.<br>17. A material change in the ward's financial circumstances such that<br>    the guardian is no longer qualified to manage the finances of the<br>    ward, or the previous degree of management is no longer required.<br>18. After appointment, the guardian becomes a disqualified person as set<br>    forth in s. 744.309(3).<br>19. Upon a showing by a person who did not receive notice of the<br>    petition for adjudication of incapacity, when such notice is<br>    required, or who is related to the ward within the relationships<br>    specified for nonresident relatives in SS. 744.309(2) and 744.312(2)<br>    and who has not previously been rejected by the court as a guardian<br>    that the current guardian is not a family member and subsection (20)<br>    applies.<br>20. Upon a showing that removal of the current guardian is in the best<br>    interest of the ward. In determining whether a guardian who is<br>    related by blood or marriage to the ward is to be removed, there<br>    shall be a rebuttable presumption that the guardian is acting in the<br>    best interests of the ward.<br>21. A bad faith failure to submit guardianship records during the audit<br>    pursuant to s. 744.368. (Fl. Stat 744.474)<br><br>At least in Florida, guardianship can only be removed for one of these<br>reasons.<br><br>If you still believe that you need to have your guardianship removed,<br>you will need to talk to a licensed attorney in your area.<br><br>\<br><br>*This answer is not a substitute for professional legal advice or a<br>solicitation to offer legal advice regarding specific facts.
