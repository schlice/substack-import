<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**A question for those who believe in God. Are you sure that He is good?<br>Why or why not?**<br><br>That's an interesting question. I'd ask a follow-on question so that I<br>could properly answer the question.<br><br>*What is good?*<br><br>Who gets to define what is good? This, of course, will lead you to<br>understand whether or not God is good.<br><br>Those who do not believe in God probably define goodness themselves. And<br>God's choices for your life may not necessarily fit your definition of<br>"good."<br><br>For those of us who believe in God, the answer is simple. God is good,<br>because he *is* the embodiment of goodness. He is the very definition of<br>good. Everything that he does simply qualifies as good, just because he<br>does it.<br><br>We may not like his choices. But that doesn't change whether or not they<br>are good.<br><br>For example, we may not like spinach, but it is good for us. Therefore,<br>it's hard to argue that spinach isn't ultimately good (even though we<br>may dislike it while we're eating it).<br><br>God is the same. We may not agree with, or even like, what he tells us<br>to do. He may take our lives down some very difficult paths. But<br>ultimately, what he does with our lives is good for us as a whole. It's<br>good for the furtherance of the church. It's good for advancing his plan<br>to gather more of his people back to him. And it's hard for us to see<br>that what he does with our lives is ultimately good, especially while<br>we're going through the unpleasant times (or the times we wouldn't<br>necessarily categorize as "good"). This doesn't change the fact that<br>what he does is ultimately good.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
