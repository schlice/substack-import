<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>It's not evil at all. Confucianism isn't a religion, so it shouldn't be<br>drowned out by religious talk. Confucianism is a system of social and<br>ethical philosophy, not a religion.<br><br>Some of the values of Confucianism include:<br><br>- Filial piety: The idea that humans are indebted to their parents<br>  and should honor them.<br>- Jen: The idea of being internally good, empathetic, and<br>  compassionate toward all people.<br>- Hsiao: The idea of emphasizing family and the mutual love between<br>  members.<br>- Yi: The idea of virtuous character, where one would sacrifice<br>  themselves for their principles.<br>- Xin: The idea of being honest with oneself and others.<br><br>I think that there isn't anyone who could argue with the virtues of<br>these values. Any society which fully adopts these virtues would be<br>doing quite well for itself.<br><br>But are people *forced* to adopt these virtues? By whose authority? And<br>if they are *compelled* to do so, is there truly free will?<br><br>And of course, that's the ultimate issue. In order for Confucianism, or<br>any belief system to truly work to reform society, the entire society<br>needs to fully adopt it and internalize it. But free will says<br>otherwise. Free will says that I have the freedom to either adopt<br>Confucianism or to reject it for my own value system, or no value system<br>at all.<br><br>The only way for any belief system, religion, or value system to be<br>truly moral is to allow people free will to choose to either participate<br>or not.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
