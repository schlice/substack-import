<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Not even close.<br><br>In fact, the more we investigate neo-Darwinist "evolution," the more we<br>find that the mechanisms that Darwin and his progyny propose is<br>insufficient to account for the diversity of species. In other words,<br>the more information we learn about life, the less that Darwinism fits<br>the evidence.<br><br>**The (growing) mountain of evidence strongly argues against evolution<br>and argues for an intelligent creator.**<br><br>We don't say that intelligence created the first life because we lack<br>understanding of the natural cause. It's because we have *positive,<br>empirically-detectable* evidence of intelligence in the design of life.<br><br>First, a message (specified complexity) is empirically detectable. When<br>we detect a message like DNA, we know that it must come from an<br>intelligent being because all of our observational experience tells us<br>that messages come only from intelligent beings. Every time we observe a<br>message, it comes from an intelligent being. We couple this data with<br>the fact that we never observe natural laws creating messages, and we<br>know an intelligent being must be the cause. That's a valid scientific<br>conclusion based on observation and repetition. It's not an argument<br>from ignorance, nor is it based on any "gap" in our knowledge. Darwin<br>had no idea that DNA existed, and DNA poses an incredible problem for<br>Darwinistic evolution, in many ways. But for now, I'm limiting my<br>discussion to the "message" resident in DNA.<br><br>Second, Intelligent Design scientists are open to *both* natural and<br>intelligent causes. They are not opposed to continued research into a<br>natural explanation for the first life. They're simply observing that<br>all known natural explanations fail, and all empirically detectable<br>evidence points to an intelligent Designer. The neo-Darwinists deny *a<br>priori* that an intelligent cause is even possible, so they never even<br>consider it.<br><br>Third, the Intelligent Design conclusion is *falsifiable*. In other<br>words, ID could be disproven if natural laws were someday discovered to<br>create specified complexity. However, the same *cannot* be said about<br>the neo-Darwinist position. Neo-Darwinists don't allow falsification of<br>their "creation story" because, as I just mentioned, they don't allow<br>any other creation story to be considered. Their "science" is not<br>tentative or open to correction; it's more closed-minded than the most<br>dogmatic church doctrine the neo-Darwinists are so apt to criticize.<br><br>Finally, it's actually the neo-Darwinists who are committing a God-of<br>the-Gaps fallacy. Darwin himself was once accused of considering natural<br>selection "an active power or Deity" (see chapter 4 of *Origin of<br>Species*). But it seems that natural selection actually *is* the deity<br>or "God of the Gaps" for the neo-Darwinists of today. When they are<br>totally at a loss for how irreducibly complex, information-rich<br>biological systems came into existence, they simply cover their gap in<br>knowledge by claiming that natural selection, time, and chance did it.<br><br>The ability of such a mechanism to create information-rich biological<br>systems runs counter to the observational evidence. Mutations are nearly<br>always harmful, and time and chance do the neo-Darwinists no good. At<br>best, natural selection may be responsible for minor changes in living<br>species (what we call "microevolution"), but it cannot explain the<br>origin of the basic forms of life (what we call "macroevolution"). You<br>need a living thing to start with for any natural selection to take<br>place. Yet, despite the obvious problems with their mechanism,<br>neo-Darwinists insist that it covers any gap in their knowledge.<br>Moreover, they willfully ignore the positive, empirically detectable<br>evidence for an intelligent being. This is not science but the dogma of<br>a secular religion.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
