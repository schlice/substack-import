<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [If you are not interfering with the officer, and you are<br>both in a public place (like on a sidewalk), you can record the police.<br>There are some restrictions in some jurisdictions, but for the most<br>part, if you are a safe distance away and not interfering with the<br>officer\'s duties, you are free to record away.\<br>\<br>If you record an officer telling you that you can\'t record him, I would<br>take that video to his supervisor and remind them that you are permitted<br>to record the police, show them that you weren\'t obstructing the<br>officer, and advise them to get their officers training on the current<br>state of the law.\<br>\<br>If they don\'t do a good enough job teaching their officers about the<br>law, I would take the videos to the local TV station. Let their<br>\"investigative reporters\" grill the police chief about why they can\'t<br>get their officers trained in current law.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
