<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Is the job of the Vice President all that important? It seems to me<br>like VP\'s don\'t do very much besides take trips around the world.**<br><br>As long as you think that it's important that we never have a lapse in<br>having a warm body in the office of the President, then the Vice<br>President's role is vital.<br><br>The entire purpose of the Office of the Vice President is to be<br>available to take over as the President as needed.<br><br>It's kinda like the understudy in a play. The understudy never performs<br>the part, so long as the casted actor is available. But if the actor<br>falls ill or otherwise can't play the part, the understudy must step in<br>and immediately fill the role.<br><br>That's the Vice President.<br><br>The Vice President is *President Pro-Tempore* of the Senate. If there is<br>a tie in the Senate (since there are 100 Senators), the Vice President<br>casts the tie-breaking vote.<br><br>Other than sitting around waiting for the President to die, and serving<br>as the President Pro-Tempore of the Senate, there are no other<br>Constitutional roles for the VP.<br><br>But that raises the question: *What else does the VP do?*<br><br>The answer is that the VP will do *whatever the President tells him to<br>do.* The President can assign a task to the VP to perform as his<br>representative. He often assigns several tasks to the VP to perform as<br>the representative of the office of the President.<br><br>The VP is also the President's cheerleader and ambassador. He will<br>travel to foreign countries and speak on the President's behalf. In this<br>day and age, the President needs to mobilize and maintain public support<br>for his priorities. The VP helps the President in that effort.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
