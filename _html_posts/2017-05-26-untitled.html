<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>In MS, more so than other diseases, you are in a partnership with your<br>care team. You don't "take direction" from your doctor.<br><br>One of the most important things I advise new MS patients is that you<br>must "work with" your neurologist; you don't "work for" your<br>neurologist. If you don't like what your neurologist is telling you, get<br>a second opinion, or find another neurologist. If you don't feel like<br>you "click" with your neurologist, please find another one with whom you<br>do! I know some people don't have lots of options when it comes to the<br>number and quality of neurologists in their area. I'm fortunate that I<br>live in Colorado Springs and we have the Rocky Mountain MS Center in<br>Denver at the University of Colorado. It is an incredible research<br>facility with top-notch doctors who continue to work on the forefront of<br>MS research, and they are able to pass that directly on to me.<br><br>You can live well with MS, but you have to start by working well with<br>your neuro. I hope he takes our advice and discusses this with his<br>doctor. The cure should not be worse than the disease. And there are<br>enough options out there that you don't need to feel like you are forced<br>to compromise your health in order to get MS meds. There are other<br>options.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-symptoms-of-multiple-sclerosis/answer/Bill-Stein<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
