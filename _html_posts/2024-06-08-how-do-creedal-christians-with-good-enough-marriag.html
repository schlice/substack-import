<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>So I'm going to take the "Creedal Christians" terminology to mean any<br>Christian who is united by the Creeds: the Nicene Creed and the<br>Apostle's Creed.<br><br>And if I'm understanding your question, another way to say it is *how do<br>we reconcile the fact that we're not going to be married after death<br>even though we want those marriages to continue after death?*<br><br>We reconcile it the same way we reconcile any difference between what<br>*we want* versus what the *Bible says*.<br><br>> At the resurrection people will neither marry nor be given in<br>> marriage; they will be like the angels in heaven --- Matthew 22:30 ESV<br><br>It may also help our reconciliation to understand what the Bible tells<br>us is the purpose of marriage on earth. God instituted marriage so that<br>we can procreate, and that we should not be lonely. Remember that God<br>created Eve to be Adam's helper, and to ensure *that he would not be<br>lonely*.<br><br>> The LORD God said, 'It is not good for the man to be alone. I will<br>> make a helper suitable for him" --- Genesis 2:18 ESV<br><br>In Heaven, though, things will be different.<br><br>Heaven is not populated by procreation. The people who go there go<br>because of faith in Christ, not because they were born there. Also,<br>there is no loneliness in Heaven, and no need for helpers. We will be<br>surrounded by believers and angels, so the need for a helper and a<br>companion will not exist in Heaven.<br><br>That doesn't mean that we won't recognize our spouses in Heaven, or that<br>we won't have a close relationship with them in Heaven. It simply means<br>that we won't be married in Heaven *because there is no need for<br>marriage in Heaven.*<br><br>No other doctrine or understanding is necessary, because no other<br>doctrine is needed. If we "feel like" we need to be married in Heaven,<br>we need to get better acquainted with things not necessarily lining up<br>with how we "feel."<br><br>If you've watched the series *The Chosen*, you'll understand what I'm<br>about to say. If you haven't, it's a great way to spend your online<br>screen time and grow your faith. In the show, at the point where Jesus<br>tells Matthew (the tax collector) to follow Him, Simon (not yet Peter)<br>protests, and says that Jesus calling Matthew is "different" from when<br>Jesus called him.<br><br>Jesus very simply tells Simon, "get used to different."<br><br>With regard to this topic, I tell you the same: **get used to<br>different.**<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
