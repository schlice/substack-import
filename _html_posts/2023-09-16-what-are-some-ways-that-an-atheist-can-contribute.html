<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>- Be a good human. Treat everyone with respect, despite the fact that<br>  some of those religious people wrongly don't treat you with respect.<br>  It is a sad fact of modern religious practice that many religious<br>  people overlook the person and see the sin (remember, they see atheism<br>  as a sin).<br>- Along those same lines, don't denigrate the whole because of the<br>  actions of a few. Those few will definitely sour you to the whole<br>  group of theists as a whole. The religion itself is not to blame;<br>  people's understanding of the religion is what causes that distaste.<br>  And I can understand it: even being a religious person, I see their<br>  actions and it is disappointing to me too.<br>- Don't get frustrated when the religious try to convert you. They will,<br>  but they are quite ham-handed about the whole thing, because most of<br>  them have never had any formalized training on evangelism. They do<br>  what they think is right without any knowledge, so please be patient<br>  with them. Their intentions are noble even if their actions<br>  are...questionable.<br>- Along the same "be a good human" lines, participate when you can. If<br>  there are volunteer efforts ongoing (run by the religious), volunteer<br>  if you can. You don't have to be religious to demonstrate what it<br>  means to be a good person.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
