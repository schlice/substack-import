<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [You can file a police report any time you like. It\'s<br>called an \"informational report\" and you can go fill one out at any<br>time.\<br>\<br>Criminally, most states have between a one and two year statute of<br>limitations on assault, so it\'s unlikely that your assailant will be<br>arrested. If the assault was a felony assault, some jurisdictions allow<br>up to three years for prosecutors to file charges, where misdemeanor<br>assault statutes of limitations expire, generally, within one to two<br>years. You will have to check the laws of your jurisdiction to see<br>whether or not you can talk to an attorney and pursue criminal charges.\<br>\<br>However, to bring a civil lawsuit for assault, the statute of<br>limitations is generally much longer. You generally will have more time<br>to file a civil suit than to pursue criminal charges.\<br>\<br>Bear in mind, regardless of what you intend to do with said report,<br>because the assault happened two years ago, memories will be fuzzy, and<br>it will be harder to make your case after such time has passed.\<br>\<br>As always, seek the advice of an attorney, especially one who offers<br>free consultations.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
