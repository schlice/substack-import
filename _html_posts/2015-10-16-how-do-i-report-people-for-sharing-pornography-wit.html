I warned them that I would report them, and they have since<br>> removed me and banned me from the group. The group has users from age<br>> 15-20(That\'s only the few in the group who\'ve told me. There are<br>> probably younger). How do I go about reporting these sickening<br>> people?I live in Louisiana USA. They\'re probably scattered around the<br>> map.*<br><br>You have to provide the usernames of these individuals to Kik Support.<br><br>To send a report about someone in Kik, you can do it from within the<br>chat itself:<br><br>- Open the chat with the user you want to report<br>- Tap their profile picture<br>- Tap your Menu button (usually three vertical dots)<br>- Tap Report.<br><br>If you don\'t have a chat with a person you wish to report, use this<br>form to [[submit a request for<br>assistance.](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=018ba2&url=https://kikinteractive.zendesk.com/anonymous_requests/new){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="zendesk.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
