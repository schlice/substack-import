<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Will the Supreme Court overturn Roe v. Wade?<br><br>If they're smart, they will.<br><br>They will do so because they made a mistake when they ruled the first<br>time, on both *Roe v. Wade* and *Griswold v. Connecticut.*<br><br>There is no right to privacy in the Constitution. Not even in the<br>"emanations and penumbras" of the Constitution. You don't squint real<br>hard and turn your head sideways while you read the Constitution to try<br>to see things that simply aren't there. It's either there, or it's not.<br>And there is no right to privacy in the Constitution.<br><br>If there is some *other* reason that abortion should be a protected<br>right, then they should say so.<br><br>But a right to privacy? No, no such right exists in the Constitution.<br><br>That doesn't mean that abortion should therefore be illegal. It<br>*does* mean that it simply should not be a Constitutional right.<br><br>(EDIT) And for those of you thinking that *Roe* is "settled law:"<br><br>1.  There is no such thing as "settled law." There is only good law, and<br>    bad law. Good law is challenged and easily overcomes the challenge.<br>    Bad law is challenged and is overturned because it cannot stand up<br>    to legal challenge.<br>2.  Don't forget that *Plessy v. Ferguson* was "settled law" for over 60<br>    years before the *Brown v. Board* decision was written (along with a<br>    few others) and *Plessy* was essentially overturned.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
