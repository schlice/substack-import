<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>So I'm curious how, in your hypothetical situation, the officer came to<br>be inside your house.<br><br>Did the officer break in? Did he hold you at gunpoint?<br><br>Or did he knock on the door and you let him in?<br><br>The difference is important.<br><br>If you let the officer in, and he sees the dead body on the floor (i.e.<br>he doesn't have to touch anything or move anything in order to see the<br>body), it is covered under the *plain sight* doctrine. Anything that is<br>in plain sight when the entry was legal is admissible.<br><br>Now, if the officer forced his way into your house, there would be only<br>one circumstance under which the dead body would be admissible: the<br>forced entry was under *exigent circumstances*. This means that, through<br>evidence (hearing screams or cries for help) or prior knowledge, the<br>officer reasonably believes that a person's life is in imminent danger,<br>or someone is injured and requires assistance. That belief must be<br>reasonable in order for the exigency to be valid. If the officer enters<br>under exigent circumstances and sees the dead body, it would also be<br>admissible.<br><br>Any other warrantless search that found the body would render the<br>evidence inadmissible, under the *fruit of the poisonous tree* doctrine.<br>This says that if the initial entry was unlawful, any evidence<br>discovered during the unlawful entry would be inadmissible. The only<br>possible counter to this would be the doctrine of *inevitable<br>discovery*, which says that because of another investigation or<br>preponderance of evidence that the police legally acquired unrelated to<br>the unlawful entry, the discovery of the body was going to happen<br>anyway.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
