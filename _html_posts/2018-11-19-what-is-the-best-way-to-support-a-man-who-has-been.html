<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What is the best way to support a man who has been recently diagnosed<br>with Multiple sclerosis?**<br><br>Thanks for the A2A.<br><br>He is going through a lot right now. The diagnosis of a lifelong<br>incurable disease which has the potential (however slight) to leave you<br>wheelchair-bound at some unknown time in the future is pretty<br>frightening for anyone. The most frightening part about the whole thing<br>is the unknown aspect of it. So much about MS is unknown, but most<br>especially is the timing of everything. I still wake up in the morning<br>wondering which body part is going to quit working and when.<br><br>There are good things to hang on to though. First of all, *MS is not<br>fatal*. There are always complications, and yes there are some famous<br>people who have died from complications from MS, but those cases are<br>extremely rare. With modern medicine (which most of those people did not<br>have access to during the active portion of their disease), we should be<br>able to stave off the worst of the disease until you're literally "too<br>old to care." Lifespans for people who take one of the approved MS<br>medications nearly match those unaffected by the disease, so prognoses<br>for the disease are very good.<br><br>Also, *our medications have come about as far as they can without curing<br>this disease.* We can control the relapses: we can reduce the severity,<br>the duration, and the frequency of relapses. We can reduce the formation<br>of new lesions, which is the number one indicator of disease activity.<br>It would be great if medication could completely eradicate relapses, but<br>we're not quite there yet. It does come pretty darn close though. We can<br>monitor disease progression using modern tools like the MRI. We can see<br>if the disease is progressing, whether or not symptoms are present.<br>We've progressed from only injectable medication to a few oral pills,<br>and a few infusions done at infusion centers on a periodic basis. The<br>injectables are still available, and they're still pretty good, but<br>there are other options available too. Point is, as long as you get on<br>one of the approved MS therapy drugs, you can (somewhat) control aspects<br>of the disease, even if it's not cured.<br><br>So how best to support him? Be there for him. Take your cues from<br>him. He's going to be frightened about the future; we all were at some<br>point. Don't push him; let him work through his grief on his own time.<br>Make sure though that he keeps moving forward. He doesn't want to get<br>caught up in invalid thoughts or self-defeating thinking. Depression is<br>also very common at the onset of the disease, and the cause of part of<br>that depression is learning about having the disease. Being there for<br>him means working through his depression as well. This is really the<br>best thing you can do for him now.<br><br>If possible, you may want to look into support groups in your area. He's<br>not going to want to go on his own; you'll probably have to go with him.<br>But there are groups available to talk to. Contact [[your local MS<br>Society<br>chapter](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=2ebc99&url=https://www.nationalmssociety.org/Chapters){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="nationalmssociety.org"}]{.qlink_container} to find support<br>groups in your area. Of course, I just assumed you were in the US; if<br>you're somewhere else I can help you find resources in your local area.<br><br>Do make sure he has a neurologist who is well-versed in MS. Make sure<br>his diagnosis has been confirmed, and make sure he's planning on<br>starting one of the approved MS therapy drugs.<br><br>Good luck, and thanks for caring.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
