<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The Bible is *about* one tribe in one region. But it wasn't *written* by<br>one tribe in one region. In fact, the writings about that one tribe in<br>that one region were written *hundreds of years before* the existence of<br>that one tribe in that one region. And then, the things that were<br>written about that one tribe in that one region...actually happened, in<br>exactly the way that those ancient writings foretold.<br><br>This is called prophesy. It is one of the miracles which prove<br>that the Abrahamic God (the more proper term for what you called the<br>Hebrew God) is the one and only God.<br><br>Then, as if that wasn't enough evidence, more ancient writings foretold<br>the coming of a man who would *actually be God.* This man-God, it<br>was foretold, would be born in a particular city from a particular<br>bloodline, suffer in a particular way, die at a particular time, and<br>rise from the dead to atone for the sins of the world. Immediately after<br>the predicted time, multiple eyewitnesses proclaimed and later recorded<br>that those predicted events had actually occurred. Those eyewitnesses<br>endured persecution and death when they could have saved themselves by<br>denying the events. Thousands of people in Jerusalem were then converted<br>after seeing or hearing of these events, and this belief swept quickly<br>across the ancient world. Ancient historians and writers allude to or<br>confirm these events, and archaeology corroborates them.<br><br>This is more prophesy, and is yet another illustration of the<br>miracles which are *signs* of God which authenticate the *message*<br>of God.<br><br>Given the prophesy, the eyewitness testimony, the willingness of the<br>eyewitnesses to suffer and die, and the corroborating testimony of the<br>other writers as well as the archeological finds, it becomes very<br>difficult to believe that this was just a case of really good human<br>writers. This type of thing can only be an example of something with<br>*supernatural* (i.e. outside of the natural) origin.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
