<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>What you are referring to are weapons which are heavily controlled under<br>the National Firearms Act of 1934 and the Firearms Owners Protection Act<br>of 1986. These are colloquially called "NFA Weapons."<br><br>Most states do not provide additional restrictions on top of Federal<br>requirements to own automatic weapons. It's actually shorter to list the<br>states which restrict NFA weapons:<br><br>CA, DE, DC, HI, IL, MA, MN, NJ, RI, WA, WI<br><br>Most of these states restrict all automatic weapons, some have some<br>other restrictions. New Jersey, for example, allows automatic weapons:<br>"Possession of a machine gun requires a state license, which is granted<br>on a 'may issue' basis by a county superior court judge. Machine gun<br>licenses are extremely difficult to obtain."\[1\](#QRAKF){#cite-QRAKF<br>.citation_link}<br><br>If you do live in a state which allows automatic weapons, you must<br>possess a Type 1 Federal Firearms License as well as a type 3 (Often<br>confused with class 3) SOT (Special Occupation Tax) to sell if you're a<br>gun dealer (private sellers do not need a FFL to sell an individual item<br>that they legally own), and an ATF Form 4 with \$200 tax stamp to<br>purchase. This makes it *expensive* to qualify a person to purchase<br>an automatic weapon.<br><br>In addition, no new automatic weapons can be registered for private<br>ownership that have been manufactured since 19 May 1986, so fully<br>automatic weapons are *very expensive,* upwards of \$10,000 and<br>more.<br><br>But to answer the question, only that list of states above prohibits<br>automatic weapons, but most states allow them when their owners are in<br>compliance with Federal regulations.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-QRAKF){.citation_index} [[Gun laws in the United States by<br>state](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=586b67&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_laws_in_the_United_States_by_state%23New_Jersey){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
