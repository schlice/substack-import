<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**After the Parkland High School shooting (the sixth school shooting of<br>the year), how can Second Amendment advocates continue to claim that<br>senseless shootings like these are the price of the freedom to own<br>firearms?**<br><br>You phrased your question incorrectly. Instead of saying "senseless<br>shootings," say "senseless murder using a gun."<br><br>When you say it that way, you emphasize that it is the murder that<br>is senseless, not the use of the gun.<br><br>Do you realize that more teens died in teen-related car accidents than<br>in school shootings on February 15th? We rightly call those "senseless<br>deaths using a car" but we don't call for bans on teen driving.<br><br>Terrorists used a pressure cooker to create a bomb and kill people at<br>the Boston Marathon. We rightly call that "senseless murder using a<br>pressure cooker" but you don't see any calls to regulate pressure<br>cookers.<br><br>Terrorists used rental trucks to mow down large crowds of people. We<br>rightly call those "senseless murder using a rental truck," but you<br>don't see any calls to limit civilian usage of rental trucks.<br><br>It is a given that Constitutionally-protected, easy access to firearms<br>will allow someone to use that tool to commit murder, just as easy<br>access to rental trucks allows terrorists to rent one and mow down a<br>crowd of pedestrians, or easy access to pressure cookers allows<br>terrorists to get one and build a bomb.<br><br>The common thread is murder. The tool is ancillary.<br><br>So **yes, the fact that we have relatively easy access to firearms means<br>that murderers can use those tools to commit murders. *Taking the<br>tool away will not stop the murder. It will just modify the choice of<br>tool.***<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
