<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The way we reach herd immunity when people will not vaccinate: The<br>people who refuse to vaccinate will contract COVID-19, and they will<br>either get better (and thus have natural immunity), or they will die and<br>you won't need to worry about them infecting everyone around them.<br><br>But everyone gets to choose their own path in life. Take the vaccine if<br>you want to avoid COVID. Don't take the vaccine if you think you can<br>survive being infected. But ultimately, what you do is your choice.<br><br>It absolutely fascinates me that this pandemic has literally caused<br>everyone to forget how to live in the United States of America.<br><br>- Is it *really* medically necessary for everyone, regardless of age and<br>  prior infection status, to get the vaccine?<br>- Shouldn't Americans have the freedom to decide if they want to get a<br>  shot that remains unapproved by the FDA, has no long term studies to<br>  indicate any possible health effects, and is known to cause serious<br>  complications in some?<br><br>The public health apparatus in this country has failed us. It<br>politicized the virus. It politicized the vaccine. It has destroyed<br>trust in public health.<br><br>Why didn't we just present the facts, present the hard evidence about<br>for whom the vaccine would be beneficial, who might suffer the most by<br>being infected, and then treat people like adults and allow them to make<br>their own decisions?<br><br>Instead, we have this push toward mandates and coercion which will<br>further erode trust in public health.<br><br>With this mad push toward forced vaccinations, you would think that<br>there is some sort of grave risk of mortality from the disease (you<br>know, like the Black Plague that literally killed half of Europe or<br>something) which would necessitate everyone, young and old, getting<br>vaccinated. But is that what the medical evidence shows?<br><br>"There is a thousand-fold difference in the risk of mortality from the<br>disease from the oldest to the youngest," says Dr. Jay Bhattacharya,<br>professor of medicine at Stanford University. "Give people the<br>information, the solid, good scientific information, let them make their<br>own choice. And that is how public health gains trust. That's how public<br>health becomes effective. And that's how the pandemic actually ends,<br>not with coercion, but with good medicine conveyed by trustworthy people<br>treating \the public\ like adults as opposed to serfs."<br><br>*But what about the people who have already been infected with COVID and<br>survived? Don't they need the vaccine?*<br><br>\"Natural immunity is quite effective at preventing you from<br>reinfection,\" Bhattacharya said. \"100 million people \[in the U.S.<br>have been\] infected, at least. And yet we have very few<br>\re\infections. It protects you against the variants as well \... I<br>read the scientific evidence around natural immunity \... If you had<br>COVID and recovered from it, then you\'re protected against that just as<br>much as you would be if you had the vaccine.\"<br><br>Bhattacharya went on to express his puzzlement at why this is not being<br>acknowledged by the leading public health officials. \"\It\'s\ a very<br>odd denial of natural immunity \... I don\'t understand it,\" he said.<br>\"It\'s as if the only valid immunity is vaccine induced immunity \...<br>If you\'ve had the virus and recovered, you have natural immunity. There<br>are an enormous number of studies in prominent journals that have<br>established this. I don\'t really understand why the public health<br>community has not incorporated \this\ into their thinking in a deep<br>way.\"<br><br>Bhattacharya also underscored another important aspect of the debate<br>that doesn\'t seem to be getting any attention: why isn\'t the vaccine<br>being distributed to those most in need? \"There are tens of millions of<br>older people worldwide who have not had the vaccine,\" he noted. \"Why<br>are we discussing vaccinating a population of people, younger people who<br>face very low risk if they were to get infected, while still tens of<br>millions of people worldwide have not had the protection of the vaccine?<br>Just because they don\'t live in a rich country doesn\'t mean they<br>don\'t deserve to have this kind of medical care available to<br>them.\"\[1\](#SAqUr){#cite-SAqUr .citation_link}<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>*A majority of unvaccinated adults in the U.S. don\'t plan on getting<br>vaccinated. Considering compliance issues with voluntary mask wearing,<br>how can we reach herd immunity and stay ahead of the variants with the<br>fewest human and economic casualties*<br><br>\<br><br>*Sorry, no comments on this one.*<br><br>*If you don't like what I wrote, tough shit. If my answer is<br>grammatically low-quality or is un-cited opinion masquerading as fact,<br>downvote it. If you think I'm wrong, write your own answer. But Quora is<br>a question-and-answer site, not a debate site. If you were simply going<br>to comment to tell me "ackshually, you're wrong," then you're the reason<br>why I disable comments. Well done, Karen. You ruined it for everyone.*<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-SAqUr){.citation_index} [[Fear and Misinformation Drive<br>the COVID<br>Debate](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=917fad&url=https://www.frc.org/get.cfm?i%3DWA21G23%26f%3DWU21G09){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);" qt-tooltip="frc.org"}<br>]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
