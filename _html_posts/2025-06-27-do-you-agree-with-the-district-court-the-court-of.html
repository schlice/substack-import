<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Only the district courts and their respective Courts of Appeals have<br>opined that Trump's Executive Order is "likely unconstitutional." The<br>Supreme Court today absolutely did not state that the definition of<br>birthright citizenship proffered by the President in his Executive Order<br>is "likely unconstitutional." In fact, the Supreme Court today didn't<br>even address the issue.<br><br>The majority opinion, written by Justice Amy Coney Barrett, didn\'t rule<br>on whether President Trump\'s executive order violates the 14th<br>Amendment or the Nationality Act. Instead, it focused on **whether<br>federal courts have the power to issue nationwide injunctions.** Today's<br>ruling says that they do not.<br><br>\"Universal injunctions likely exceed the equitable authority that<br>Congress has given to federal courts,\" the conservative majority said.<br>\"The Court grants the Government\'s applications for a partial stay of<br>the injunctions entered below, but only to the extent that the<br>injunctions are broader than necessary to provide complete relief to<br>each plaintiff with standing to sue.\"<br><br>This means that the only relief which can be granted by the Court of<br>Appeals is to the person who sued, not the entire nation, and can<br>only be as broad as necessary to provide that person "complete relief."<br>To that end, these cases go back to their respective Courts of Appeals<br>to reconsider their broad rulings in light of the Supreme Court\'s<br>opinion and otherwise \"with principles of equity.\"<br><br>However, to the original question of birthright citizenship, the Court's<br>opinion said the Executive Order can\'t take effect for 30 days from<br>today's opinion, which allows more time for these legal challenges to be<br>processed.<br><br>Attorney General Pam Bondi noted that the merits of the birthright<br>citizenship order haven\'t been litigated yet and declined to answer<br>questions about how it would be implemented and enforced.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
