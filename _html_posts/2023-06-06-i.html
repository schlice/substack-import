<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>For the benefit of others who may read this thread, let's discuss what<br>the *unpardonable sin* is.<br><br>In Mark 3:28, Jesus says, "Truly I tell you, people can be forgiven all<br>their sins and every slander they utter." But then, He adds one<br>exception: "Whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will never be<br>forgiven; they are guilty of an eternal sin" (v29).<br><br>According to Jesus, the *unpardonable sin* is a unique sin, one which<br>can only be done by blaspheming the Holy Spirit, but doing so in the<br>context of the Spirit's work in the world directly through the person of<br>Jesus.<br><br>The people who committed this sin were a group of Pharisees who accused<br>Jesus, while He was present on earth, of being possessed by Beelzebul.<br><br>> But when the Pharisees heard it, they said, "It is only by Beelzebul,<br>> the prince of demons, that this man casts out demons." --- Matthew<br>> 12:24 ESV<br><br>These Pharisees *knew* that Jesus was the Messiah. They knew that He<br>was sent by God. They saw the miracles with their own eyes. They heard<br>His words, directly from His own mouth. And yet, while knowing all of<br>this, they *intentionally attributed those acts to Satan instead of to<br>God.* They intentionally slandered the Holy Spirit, visibly acting<br>through God's own Son.<br><br>*That* was the unpardonable sin.<br><br>As you may have noticed, Jesus is not currently on the earth performing<br>miracles. Therefore, no one can attribute the direct actions of the Holy<br>Spirit, which they personally witness, through the person of Jesus, to<br>Satan, thus no one can commit this unpardonable sin.<br><br>Today, the only sin which is "unpardonable" would be *to die without<br>faith in Christ*. There can be no forgiveness for someone who dies<br>without faith in Christ.<br><br>You've been praying for a sign that you haven't committed the<br>unpardonable sin. The simple fact that you are actually praying to God<br>and asking for forgiveness means that there is a good chance you have<br>faith in Christ. Therefore, as Mark 3:28 says, people can be forgiven of<br>all of their sins and every slander they utter.<br><br>Ask, and you shall receive. Knock, and the door will be opened for you.<br>Seek, and you shall find. If you are seeking, you *will* find. If you<br>are asking, you *will* receive. Take comfort in that truth. The only<br>person who is not pardonable is the person who affirmatively,<br>intentionally rejects Christ, because there is no other avenue for<br>salvation other than through Christ.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
