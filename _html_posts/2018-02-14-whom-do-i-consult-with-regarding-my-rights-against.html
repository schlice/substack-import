I<br>do not want my blood removed.**<br><br>If you don't want to be embalmed, there are only a few things that can<br>be done with your corpse after you are dead. Your best bet is to talk to<br>an estate planning attorney and draw up a funeral plan which specifies<br>what you would like done with your body after you die. The plan should<br>be given to the executor of your estate, your spouse, your attorney, and<br>close loved ones. You might also think about working with a mortuary or<br>a funeral home to determine what can be done and what aligns with your<br>wishes. Your attorney can assist with this.<br><br>Why not add all of this to your will? Wills aren't read, in many cases,<br>until weeks or sometimes months after you die. You need to ensure that<br>the people who would carry out your instructions are fully informed and<br>can act on your decisions as soon after you die as possible. If these<br>people are not informed, there may be legal requirements for handling a<br>corpse that kick in after a certain time period, and your wishes would<br>not be fulfilled.<br><br>Bottom line, you should work with an estate planning attorney to draw up<br>an appropriate funeral plan.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
