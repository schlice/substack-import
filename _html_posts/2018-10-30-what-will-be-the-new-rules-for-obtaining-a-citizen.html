Trump\'s new plan is going to be implemented?**<br><br>Immigration and naturalization will not be changed.<br><br>Birthright citizenship will only be granted to children who have at<br>least one parent who is a citizen of the United States. City clerks will<br>be required to record the birth certificates of the parents and the<br>birth certificates of the children in order to prove birthright<br>citizenship, a simple one-time process which can be done any time,<br>either before or after the birth, but must be done before the child<br>enters public school.<br><br>Of course, we'd have to grandfather in all existing birth certificates<br>certified by the state.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
