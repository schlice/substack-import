<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I can generally deconstruct the Young Earth theory using the Scopes<br>trial.<br><br>The Bible says that the earth was formed on the first, second, and third<br>days, but the Bible also says the sun was set in the sky on the fourth<br>day. Couldn't it be that those first three days lasted longer than 24<br>hours? There was no sun, no way to measure the day from the night, and<br>there is no indication how long the day and the night lasted. So<br>couldn't that first three days have taken 4 billion years? I personally<br>don't see why not.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/Why-is-there-the-flat-Earth-debate/answer/Robert-Frost-1<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
