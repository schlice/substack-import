<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Should we go back to a sixty vote threshold requirement for Supreme<br>Court Justices?**<br><br>We should go back to a 60 vote threshold for all Federal post nominees.<br><br>But not yet.<br><br>We're at a point in history where liberals have decided that they don't<br>have to accept half a loaf on legislation when they can press the issue<br>through the courts and get the whole loaf. Conservatives have similarly<br>realized that two can play at that game, and are trying to stack the<br>court. This is why the Kavanaugh fight is so pivotal over a SCOTUS seat<br>which should not be as powerful as it is.<br><br>When the legislature can get back to working together to pass<br>legislation that neither of them likes very much but actually reaches<br>*compromise*, then we can talk about raising the nomination<br>threshold back to 60 votes.<br><br>But in today's political climate, where Congress has shirked its<br>responsibilities and has asked the President and the courts to take over<br>where they should have reached compromise, we'd never get any nominees<br>confirmed at 60 votes.<br><br>We have to fix the underlying problem first.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
