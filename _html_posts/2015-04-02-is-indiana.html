<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [There are businesses that think that it\'s okay to<br>discriminate against a class of people because of their own religious<br>beliefs.\<br>\<br>This is patently illegal, and no state law will ever legalize it.\<br>\<br>The law only allows a business to claim a religious exemption from<br>government programs. It has nothing to do with individual actions.\<br>\<br>It has everything to do with the government placing restrictions on a<br>business that violate the business owners\' religious beliefs.\<br>\<br>It has nothing to do with legalizing discrimination (although I\'m sure<br>that some business owners wanted it to do that).\<br>\<br>The Federal law was successfully used to defend Hobby Lobby from<br>provisions in the Affordable Care Act which violated the business<br>owners\' religious beliefs, and they were granted an exemption from<br>those provisions.\<br>\<br>There was some question that Indiana\'s RFRA might be a law that<br>legalizes discrimination because of some words in the law which were<br>slightly different from the Federal statute. It is very clear from what<br>the legislature and the governor said that this is not the spirit of the<br>law. These laws have existed for over 20 years, and it\'s very unlikely<br>that such an interpretation of this law would ever be made.\<br>\<br>If such a thing were to happen, I would hope that the entire state (if<br>not the entire country) came down on the governor and made sure that he<br>repealed the law (which he pledged to do if it was<br>misused).]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
