<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>First of all, atheists don't believe that God exists, so they're not<br>thinking about salvation at all. But let's assume for a second that<br>somehow an atheist who did good deeds died, and then discovered that<br>there was indeed a god, you're asking if this "good person" atheist<br>would somehow be rewarded with eternal life simply because they were a<br>good person.<br><br>If this were true, then this would mean that *you earn your own<br>salvation* by your own good deeds, and God is not necessary. I bet even<br>the atheist sees the flaw in this logic.<br><br>If it's God's afterlife, you kinda have to play by God's rules.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Will good atheists who did good deeds be rewarded in the afterlife even<br>though they rejected God? Why or why not?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
