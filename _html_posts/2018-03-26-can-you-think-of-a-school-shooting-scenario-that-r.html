<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Can you think of a school shooting scenario that requiring clear<br>backpacks would plausibly prevent?**<br><br>When you think that it's okay for clear handbags (and no X-ray machines)<br>to be acceptable when entering an airport, then it will be acceptable<br>for securing a school.<br><br>We've been successfully creating gun-free areas (in the business, called<br>"sterile areas") in airports for decades. Have you ever been to a<br>courthouse? Have you ever entered a government building? Have you taken<br>a tour of the White House? You virtually cannot get guns into those<br>places.<br><br>Why is securing a school seemingly so difficult?<br><br>It's because *there is no will to do it*. Parents, ***DESPITE<br>PARKLAND***, still cry, "Schools are not jails! We don't want our<br>students going to school in a jail!"<br><br>So until people get over themselves, nothing will change.<br><br>And no, clear backpacks won't do anything other than to make money for<br>the clear backpack industry.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
