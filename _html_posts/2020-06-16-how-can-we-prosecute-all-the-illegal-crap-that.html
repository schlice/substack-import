Once Trump<br>is no longer president, he can be prosecuted for any criminal activity<br>he may have committed while president.<br><br>But good luck finding any actual crimes with enough evidence to make a<br>solid case, and good luck making them stick.<br><br>And hopefully you've got *lots of money*, because Trump will have the<br>best attorneys money can buy.
