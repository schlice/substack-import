<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>You can *read* both texts. You can only *follow* one.<br><br>Why? Because the core beliefs they espouse are different.<br><br>There are five main beliefs written in the Christian Bible which are<br>highly opposed by the Quran:<br><br>1.  The Bible states that there is one God in three persons - Father,<br>    Son, and Holy Spirit. The Quran says that there is only one god and<br>    that god has no parents, no children, or no equals.<br>2.  The Bible states that Jesus is the Word made flesh, conceived by the<br>    power of the Holy Spirit. The Quran says that Jesus was merely one<br>    of Allah's prophets.<br>3.  The Bible states that Jesus was crucified and rose from the dead.<br>    The Quran says that Jesus was not crucified, nor did he rise from<br>    the dead; Christians were only deceived to believe such claims.<br>4.  The Bible states that the Holy Spirit is one of the three persons of<br>    the Trinity. The Quran says that the angel Gabriel is actually the<br>    Holy Spirit, not God; he is a messenger of Allah.<br>5.  The Bible records many miracles and hundreds of prophecies. The<br>    Quran records no miracles or prophecies; the Quran is a miracle in<br>    itself.<br><br>These core beliefs are so diametrically opposed that you cannot believe<br>both books are true. You can only truly believe in the claims of one<br>book.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
