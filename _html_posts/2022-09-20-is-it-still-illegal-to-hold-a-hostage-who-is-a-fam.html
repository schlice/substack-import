<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Let me re-write your question:<br><br>> Is it still illegal to hold a hostage<br>><br>> *(Explanation: who is a family member of a criminal and force the<br>> criminal to surrender if the criminal also hold your family as<br>> hostage)*<br><br>You can explain *why* you are taking a hostage until the day you stand<br>before your maker, but those are all *excuses*. Nothing makes taking a<br>hostage legal. I checked the statute, and there is nothing in there<br>which says "It is a crime to take a hostage **except when it's a family<br>member of a criminal....**"<br><br>Taking a hostage is *multiple* crimes, regardless of why you do it. **AT<br>BEST**, you can use your excuse to try to limit your punishment after<br>you are convicted for, at a minimum, false arrest and extortion.<br>Hopefully the court will have mercy on you because of your explanation.<br>But none of that makes it legal.<br><br>Sometimes, the hypothetical questions on this site go off the rails.<br><br>And for everyone reading, if you ever encounter a situation where a<br>criminal is holding your family hostage, call the police.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Is it still illegal to hold a hostage who is a family member of a<br>criminal and force the criminal to surrender if the criminal also hold<br>your family as hostage?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
