<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The homeowner in possession of the title deed to the property (or the<br>named individual on the mortgage) retains ownership of the property<br>while the claimant hires an attorney and attempts to make a claim on the<br>property. The process works its way through the courts until either the<br>claimant or the title holder is successful.<br><br>If the claimant is found to be the rightful owner, the current deed will<br>be declared null and void, and new lawsuits will ensue because the<br>current residents have been paying for a property which they are not<br>entitled to own, and they will want just compensation for that error.<br>The two parties will work out a suitable arrangement which will allow<br>the current residents to vacate the property in a reasonable amount of<br>time.<br><br>If the title holder is found to be the rightful owner, the claimant goes<br>away.<br><br>\<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*This answer is not a substitute for professional legal advice or a<br>solicitation to offer legal advice regarding specific facts.
