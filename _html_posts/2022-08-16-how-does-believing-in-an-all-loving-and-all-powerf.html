<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>*Where did you get the idea that believing in God will make your life<br>easier?*<br><br>Seriously, where did this idea come from? Because it's not the Bible,<br>that's for sure. Have you ever seen how those people lived? Even the<br>giants of the faith suffered tremendously during their lives and either<br>died in isolation or captivity, or were killed horrifically.<br><br>Jesus even told his followers to *expect* suffering.<br><br>> "I have told you these things, so that in me you may have peace. In<br>> this world you will have trouble. But take heart! I have overcome the<br>> world." --- John 16:33 NIV<br><br>So if the Bible tells us to expect suffering, where do we get this idea<br>that God will take away all of our pain? Frankly, as Christians go, we<br>don't advertise well that there are going to be times in your life when<br>things don't make sense, when circumstances just don't add up. For<br>example, Campus Crusade for Christ distributes a pamphlet entitled, "The<br>Four Spiritual Laws." The first of these laws is, "God loves you and has<br>a wonderful plan for your life." This is true, but it implies that the<br>believer will always understand and approve of that plan, which is not<br>always true.<br><br>Because sometimes, that "wonderful plan" includes childhood cancer. And<br>while it may be part of God's plan, I don't understand why he allows it,<br>and if I had my way, I'd not have that child get cancer.<br><br>But even in the most horrible of circumstances, God's plan is<br>"wonderful" because anything that is in accordance with his will<br>ultimately "works for the good of those who love him, who have been<br>called according to his purpose." (Romans 8:28 NIV).<br><br>So God *does* have a plan, even if we can't comprehend it. And we can't.<br><br>> \"For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my<br>> ways,\" declares the LORD. \"As the heavens are higher than the earth,<br>> so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your<br>> thoughts." --- Isaiah 55:8--9<br><br>So what are we to do with this? How are we supposed to proceed? The<br>Bible tells us, and it's through the story of Joseph. Hated by his<br>siblings, Joseph was sold into slavery (which was a shade better than<br>their first plan, which was to kill him). While in Egypt, he was<br>arrested, and falsely accused of rape by Potiphar's wife, and threatened<br>with execution. There is no indication in the Bible that God revealed<br>his plan to Joseph. He was just expected (as you and I are) to live out<br>his life, one day at a time, in something less than complete<br>understanding. However, what pleased God was Joseph's faithfulness<br>*even when nothing made sense.*<br><br>So what does all this tell us?<br><br>1.  God has a plan.<br>2.  We're not always going to understand that plan.<br>3.  But that plan is wonderful, as it works for his will.<br>4.  We are expected to be faithful *even when circumstances don't make<br>    sense,* because he loves us and he keeps his promises.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>How does believing in an all-loving and all-powerful god make life<br>easier during periods of pain and suffering like childhood cancer?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
