<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I would make only one correction to your answer.<br><br>You said:<br><br>*Politicians, especially those granted great power are supposed to be<br>suitable for their roles.*<br><br>In short, no they are not.<br><br>If they were "supposed to be suitable," there would be a test for<br>suitability built into the Constitution. In fact, it is quite the<br>opposite. The requirements to become President are:<br><br>- A natural born citizen<br>- at least 35 years old<br>- and has lived in the United States for at least fourteen years.<br><br>Other than that, there are no other requirements for being President,<br>and that includes any suitability requirement.<br><br>What this means is that suitability is *subjective* and is left up to<br>the voters. The voters have determined that Trump is suitable enough for<br>the job (or that his opponent was wholly unsuitable, depending on your<br>viewpoint) that they elected him.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/Are-liberals-and-democrats-attacking-Donald-Trump-just-for-him-not-being-politically-correct/answer/Jon-Mixon-1<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
