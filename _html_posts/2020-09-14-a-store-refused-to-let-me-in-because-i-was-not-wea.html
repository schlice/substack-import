How can<br>I sue them?**<br><br>You can sue anyone for anything in America. But you're going to have a<br>really hard time winning, especially in this case.<br><br>First, you have to show that you are legally permitted to bypass the law<br>in your area, which probably says that you have to wear a mask into a<br>store. This means that you must be claiming to be a member of a<br>protected class that cannot wear a mask. I presume, therefore, that you<br>were wearing a face shield. No? Then you were probably in violation of<br>the law yourself, and you'll have a really hard time making your case<br>that the store wouldn't allow you to violate the law.<br><br>But let's presume you live somewhere where there is not a local<br>requirement to wear a mask. There are a few states in the US where masks<br>are simply encouraged, not required. In those cases, can a business<br>refuse to let you in if you are not wearing a mask?<br><br>The answer is yes, a business (on private property) can require you<br>wear a mask, and can refuse to let you in if you are not. Business<br>transactions are *mutual*: you have the right to determine what stores<br>you will frequent, and the store has the right to either do business<br>with you or not. As long as the business is enforcing the rule in a<br>non-discriminating way (i.e. they make everyone wear masks, no<br>exceptions), the business is allowed to enact a mask policy, and they<br>are allowed to refuse to let you in if you choose to not wear one.<br><br>Before the pandemic, stores (especially food stores and local<br>restaurants in our beach towns, especially right along the beach) would<br>routinely have signs posted which read, "No shirt, no shoes, no<br>service." This means you had to be wearing a shirt and shoes before you<br>could enter. Would you similarly sue those stores for not allowing you<br>to enter shirtless and barefoot? The store is usually doing these things<br>for health and safety reasons...just as they are for the mask policy.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
