<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Can I ask a tenant's association to reimburse property damage by<br>rain?**<br><br>Under normal circumstances, you shouldn't have to.<br><br>The condo should have insurance that covers common areas, and you should<br>have an individual insurance policy that covers everything inside your<br>unit, such as walls, floors, and contents.<br><br>First thing to do is to conclusively determine where the water came<br>from. If the water came from a common area (like the roof on top of the<br>condo), file a claim with the insurer of the master building policy. If<br>you have a unit over top of you, it gets more tricky. If the tenant<br>above you caused the damage which led to the water incursion, neither<br>insurance (your personal insurance or the building insurer) may cover<br>it, and you'll have to resort to litigation.<br><br>But in all cases, address the water first. Make sure you fix the damage<br>in your unit. Unaddressed water can lead to toxic mold growing, and no<br>one wants that. Fix the problem first, then chase down who is going to<br>pay.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
