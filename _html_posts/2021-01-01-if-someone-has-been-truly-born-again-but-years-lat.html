<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If someone has been truly born again but years later succumbs to an<br>addictive sin on such a consistent basis that they have lost their close<br>connection with God, do you think it possible that the Lord would<br>withdraw his salvation from them?**<br><br>First, let's start with some clarification. Can God withdraw his<br>salvation? For any question which begins with "Can God..." the answer is<br>always yes, God can. There is literally nothing that God cannot do.<br><br>The question, therefore, is *would God withdraw his salvation from<br>anyone?* And the answer to that question is **No, God would not withdraw<br>his salvation from anyone. Ever.**<br><br>The reason: **salvation is a "one and done" thing, but sanctification is<br>a lifelong process which we will never complete until we meet him face<br>to face.**<br><br>If a person is truly saved, he has given over his life to God. Jesus<br>paid for *all* sin on the cross; past, present, and future. All sin is<br>forgiven, not just sin before you were saved.<br><br>Once you are saved, God begins working in your life to make you more<br>like Jesus. It is not an instantaneous process, as we are indeed human.<br>It is a lifelong process, a process we call *sanctification.* God works<br>in me every day to make me more like Jesus.<br><br>I struggle every day, as I am indeed human. *But God expects progress,<br>not perfection.*<br><br>\<br><br>Now, here's the thing about addiction. Addiction is a powerful<br>dysfunction of the brain which causes a person to succumb to the<br>addiction *over their free will*. In other words, the addiction is so<br>powerful in the brain that it overrides our will to stop it.<br><br>Yes, addictions result initially from a bad choice, a choice that we<br>were free to make. We made a bad one.<br><br>As humans, we continually struggle to follow God and to do what is<br>right. We are imperfect in this pursuit. But we need to bring our<br>failings and our concerns to him, not run away from him in shame.<br><br>> *For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our<br>> weaknesses, but we have one who has been tempted in every way, just as<br>> we are -- yet was without sin. Let us then approach the throne of<br>> grace with confidence, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to<br>> help us in our time of need. --- Hebrews 4:15--16 NIV*<br><br>Addiction doesn't change any of this. If anything, it becomes even<br>more of a shameful struggle, as we are powerless to resist the<br>addiction. It is a very destructive cycle, especially for someone who<br>has been saved.<br><br>But there is help, and there is hope. Get help for the addiction, and<br>the rest will follow.<br><br>But always know this: God will never abandon you. God will never forsake<br>you. Only we can turn away from him; he will never turn away from us.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
