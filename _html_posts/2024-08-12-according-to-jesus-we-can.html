<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>> **According to Jesus, we can\'t be a Christian if we don\'t leave<br>> everything we have.**<br><br>This isn't quite accurate. Remember, the Bible can be either<br>*descriptive* or *prescriptive*. Not everything *described* in the Bible<br>is a rule for us.<br><br>It's interesting that you key in on Luke 14:33:<br><br>> So therefore, any one of you who does not renounce all that he has<br>> cannot be my disciple. \-- Luke 14:33 ESV<br><br>So when we focus on *this verse,* it appears to say that in order to be<br>a *disciple* of Jesus, we must renounce all that we have. But is Jesus<br>telling us that in order to be Christian, we can have no possessions?<br>Considering the fact that Jesus' disciples did, in fact, have<br>possessions during their time of discipleship, then this must mean<br>something else.<br><br>In Bible exegesis, if we don't see the significance of the verse, we<br>expand out to the chapter, and then expand out to the book, to help us<br>explain the verse. In this case, simply expanding out beyond just the<br>verse to the few verses around it explains exactly what Jesus was<br>talking about.<br><br>> Now great crowds accompanied him, and he turned and said to them, "If<br>> anyone comes to me and does not hate his own father and mother and<br>> wife and children and brothers and sisters, yes, and even his own<br>> life, he cannot be my disciple --- Luke 14:25--26 ESV<br><br>If you had a problem with Luke 14:33, you must *really* have a<br>problem with Luke 14:25--26, right? Becuase now, it appears that to be a<br>disciple, you have to hate your mother and father! You have to<br>hate your wife and children! You have to **hate your brothers and<br>sisters!**<br><br>So put all these things together. What we're reading is that in order to<br>be Jesus' disciple, you need to:<br><br>- Hate your mother and father<br>- Hate your wife and children<br>- Hate your own life<br>- Sell all your possessions<br><br>Clearly, if you know anything about Jesus' teaching, He would never<br>teach any of these. So why did He say this?<br><br>Jesus is being *intentionally hyperbolic* here. He isn't providing<br>*conditions* to following Him. He is talking about *allegiance* to Him.<br><br>You can see it a little more clearly if you look at the parallel<br>recording of this teaching from Matthew:<br><br>> Whoever loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me, and<br>> whoever loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me. \--<br>> Matthew 10:37 ESV<br><br>Where Luke uses the more inflammatory language, Matthew seems to be<br>focusing on *allegiance* to Jesus. Jesus must be our primary<br>allegiance, even above our family, or our possessions. When you look at<br>Luke's writing in *that* light, what he recorded makes sense.<br><br>In addition, the word "hate" is used in the Bible to indicate preference<br>or allegiance rather than "the opposite of love" (cf Deuteronomy<br>21:15--17 and Genesis 29:30-31).<br><br>Ultimately, what does this mean? Jesus is not calling his followers to<br>hate their families or sell all their possessions. Instead, he calls for<br>undivided loyalty to himself above family loyalties, and complete<br>allegiance above desire to store and retain possessions. **Jesus desires<br>your primary allegiance.**<br><br>The stark language tends to be very off-putting, but that's by design.<br>Being a disciple of Jesus is not easy, nor is it low-cost. Jesus must<br>become the center of your life, and that means other things (family,<br>possessions) will have to move to the periphery. Not that they are not<br>important, but they are not the most important. And when people<br>place possessions foremost in their lives, they will find it difficult<br>to not only follow Jesus, but also to gain salvation.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
