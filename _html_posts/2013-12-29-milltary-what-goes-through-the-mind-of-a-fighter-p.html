<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Maybe its because I come from a different mindset that I<br>don\'t understand the question. Those of us who wear, or wore, the<br>uniform, have all at one point had to come to grips with the possibility<br>that they were going to carry out their sworn duty. This goes for the<br>military and the police as well. We all know when the uniform gets put<br>on that we may have to make that ultimate decision.\<br>\<br>This is not something that just comes up because of a contingency. We<br>have to be ready for this kind of thing all the time, so there should be<br>no surprises.\<br>\<br>Doesn\'t make the prospect any easier.\<br>\<br>The military is the \"barking dog on a leash\". Loosing the leash will<br>not change the demeanor of the dog; he\'s going to attack with the same<br>ferocity that he was attempting to do while on the leash. The military<br>is always either in war or preparing for war. That\'s our job. So<br>contingency or not, we have to be ready to make those decisions when our<br>country requires us to do so.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
