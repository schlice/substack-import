<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The catechism is infallible insofar as it is interpreted by the Pope in<br>whatever form he chooses to do that. Once the Pope interprets the<br>catechism (or re-interprets it), it is infallible.<br><br>That said, the catechism of the church has indeed changed, most notably<br>during the<br>[Counter-Reformation(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=cbd059&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter-Reformation){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}. This was a response to<br>the Reformation and the schism between Catholic and Protestant religions<br>through Martin Luther's 95 Theses.<br><br>During the Counter-Reformation, some practices were upheld<br>(transubstantiation, salvation through grace *and* works, etc), and some<br>were changed (Mass from Latin to English, priest with his back to the<br>congregation to facing front, some formerly apocryphal books of the<br>Bible were added, the adoption of the Nycene Creed, etc).<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
