Comments are<br>superfluous and are only permitted at the whim of the answerer.<br><br>**While the community owns questions, I own my answer and any/all<br>comments on it.ยน** I can enable them or disable them. I can accept them<br>and then delete any I don't think enhance my answer. My answer, my<br>comments.<br><br>Sometimes, an answer can become more contentious than it was originally<br>thought to be, and the comments section becomes too overwhelming to<br>maintain, so some answerers will just shut it off. In the cases where I<br>had to do that, I'd go and edit my answer and add some sort of note<br>saying "I had to shut off comments because the Neanderthals among you<br>can't be civil" or some such wording.<br><br>\<br><br>ยน The major exception is Spaces, which can have their own rules about<br>disabling/deleting comments.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
