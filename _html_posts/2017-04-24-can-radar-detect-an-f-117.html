<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The radar cross section (RCS) of a target is defined as the effective<br>area intercepting an amount of incident power which, when scattered<br>isotropically, produces a level of reflected power at the receiving<br>station which is equal to that from the target.<br><br>- The RCS of an F-15 (which was not designed with any stealthy<br>  characteristics) is 25 square meters.<br>- The RCS of an F-117 is 0.003 square meters.<br><br>So above background noise, the F-117 is effectively invisible to radar.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
