<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>If the police handcuff someone, this amounts to a *detention*. The<br>ability to detain someone temporarily is permitted under *Terry v.<br>Ohio*, sometimes just called a *Terry stop*. *Terry* stops can take<br>place when the officer has a reasonable suspicion that the person is<br>involved in criminal activity.<br><br>If the police were to handcuff someone (thus detaining them) without<br>having a reasonable suspicion that the person is involved in criminal<br>activity, this would constitute an *unlawful restraint,* which is a<br>violation of Texas Penal Code ยง 20.02.<br><br>If you feel this has happened to you, you should contact a lawyer in<br>your jurisdiction to see if an unlawful restraint case is a possibility.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Is it illegal for an officer to handcuff someone without probable cause<br>or reasonable suspicion that the person committed an offense or crime<br>under Texas law?<br><br>\<br><br>*This answer is not professional legal advice, nor is it a substitute<br>for professional legal advice, or a solicitation to offer professional<br>legal advice.
