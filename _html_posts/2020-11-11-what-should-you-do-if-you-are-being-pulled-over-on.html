<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What should you do if you are being pulled over on a dark stretch of<br>road, you haven't been speeding or driving recklessly, and it doesn't<br>appear safe? Can you call the emergency line or non-emergency number to<br>verify there's an officer in that area?**<br><br>Slow down, turn on your flashers, and call 911. Tell the dispatcher that<br>there is a "police car" behind you and ask them if there is an officer<br>in this area pulling a car over.<br><br>- If they say yes, you must stop, even if you feel unsafe.<br>- If they say no, keep driving. Drive to the nearest police station<br>  and go inside.<br><br>Most jurisdictions do not have any exceptions to their vehicle and<br>traffic law which allow you to do this, but most jurisdictions also<br>understand the environment in which we live today, and will understand<br>if a motorist chooses to verify the authenticity of the officer before<br>stopping.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
