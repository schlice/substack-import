<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Not likely.\<br>\<br>LTA (lighter-than-air) airships are great at certain things, two of<br>which are heavy lifting and surveillance. They are less efficient at<br>things like passenger transport and as weapons platforms. They can\'t<br>move nearly as fast as a traditional aircraft, and subsequently won\'t<br>work as well as an airliner for passenger transport.\<br>\<br>Airships might see a resurgence if the world\'s helium supply suddenly<br>blossomed.
