<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The answer is "it depends" and it depends on what specifically you are<br>talking about.<br><br>If you're talking about firearms, I would say that most people who<br>have concealed carry permits practice at a range more frequently than<br>police officers are required to re-qualify, so it would be easy for a<br>civilian to become more proficient on their firearms than is minimally<br>required by the police. Most departments require at least a semi-annual<br>or an annual recertification. My local department requires a quarterly<br>re-certification, which, from my anecdotal research, is on the high side<br>for departments. Most permit holders I know of shoot far more frequently<br>than that.<br><br>This does not mean that an officer can't use his free time and his own<br>funds to buy ammunition and practice at the range himself. In fact, our<br>county public range offers a discount to law enforcement, and one whole<br>section of the range is closed to the public and only allows law<br>enforcement during daylight hours Monday to Friday. So officers can<br>indeed practice more frequently than they are required to do so, but the<br>question didn't ask if someone can be better trained than *every* police<br>officer; the question asked if it is possible to be better trained than<br>the police. In this scenario (a private citizen spending every weekend<br>down at the range, compared to a police officer only shooting when<br>required by the department), then yes, you can be better trained on<br>firearms than the police.<br><br>If you're talking about driving, not likely unless you're a<br>professional driver. You can't get the kind of driving training that the<br>police get anywhere but from the police, or from professional driving.<br><br>If you're talking about classroom knowledge, you could likely learn<br>as much about the law as police officers know. But in order to learn<br>about police procedures, and all of the other minutiae about the job,<br>you would have to be trained directly by the police.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
