<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Yes. They need to be granted arrest powers by the Governor of the state.<br>Generally, this happens when they are sworn as law enforcement officers.<br><br>Oh, did you mean that they'd need approval of a supervisor every time<br>they make an arrest? No, no they don't. They already have the authority<br>granted to them by the Governor when they receive their badge. They<br>don't have to get "extra permission" to perform a lawful arrest.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
