<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>There are a few issues that Christians should watch out for.<br><br>- As long as the married couple is using their own eggs and sperm, there<br>  are no issues regarding activities outside of the bonds of marriage.<br>- The other would be related to unused embryos. This should be avoided<br>  at all costs, as Christians believe that babies are human beings from<br>  the moment of conception. Destruction of unused fertilized eggs should<br>  be completely avoided.<br><br>Therefore, if IVF is used by a married couple, and if care is taken to<br>prevent the intentional destruction of fertilized eggs (embryos), then<br>it is a morally good action that pleases God because it violates no<br>scriptural guidelines, achieves the moral good of overcoming<br>infertility, and brings the blessing of children to yet another family.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
