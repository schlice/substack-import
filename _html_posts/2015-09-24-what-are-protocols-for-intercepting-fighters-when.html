<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [What happens in any given situation is up to the NCA<br>(National Command Authority) and is highly dependent on the situation.<br>Many factors will determine what will happen during a hijacking. What<br>are the hijacker\'s demands? Does he want safe passage? Is he<br>communicating? If he\'s communicating and he stays on course, he<br>probably won\'t be shot down. But he\'s not \"getting away\" as it were,<br>because even hijacked planes have limited fuel reserves and will<br>eventually have to stop for gas somewhere.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
