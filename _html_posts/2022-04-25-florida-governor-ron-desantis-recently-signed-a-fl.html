<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>"A moment of silence" has always been permitted. A moment of silence is<br>not tied to a religion. Students *can* pray if they are so inclined.<br>Students who do not pray can merely remain in silence for a moment.<br>There is no imposition of religion at all in a moment of silence.<br><br>What has *not* been permitted is the school *leading children in<br>prayer*. Schools have tested this in the past, and they have lost in<br>court.<br><br>\<br><br>What is most disappointing is that the legislature of a state feels that<br>they only way it can compel its own Department of Education to allow<br>students their religion-neutral moment of silence is to write a law.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
