<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>It depends on your neighborhood.<br><br>For the sake of discussion, I'll also assume we're talking about an HOA<br>consisting of single-family homes, not a condo.<br><br>If you live in a gated community, then your community owns everything<br>inside the gates, including the roads. Your HOA can boot and tow cars<br>for violating parking rules.<br><br>If you do not live in a gated community, your HOA does not own the<br>roads. Your local government (city, county, etc) owns the roads. The HOA<br>cannot boot or tow cars unless they are parked on HOA property (so, for<br>example, if you have a clubhouse owned by the HOA, cars can be towed<br>from that parking lot). The only remedy for parking violations in a<br>non-gated community is fines.<br><br>But that becomes a rather expensive proposition, because you first must<br>prove the car belongs to a resident or a guest of a resident, which<br>means the HOA has to pay to run the plates. If the car can't be linked<br>to a resident, then the money to run the plates is wasted. The HOA can<br>only enforce fines against homeowners, residents and their guests, and<br>if you can't positively ID the owner of the car as one of those, you<br>don't know who to fine.<br><br>In short, in a non-gated community, parking rules are extremely<br>difficult to enforce. Your best bet is to contact the local government<br>if the parked car is in violation of city or county parking laws (i.e.<br>parked in a No Parking Zone).<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Can I have my neighbor\'s vehicle towed if they are violating the<br>neighborhood parking rules and restrictions in my community?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
