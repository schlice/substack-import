<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The best way to answer this is *in context.*<br><br>Let's read 2 Cor 12 7--10:<br><br>> Therefore, in order to keep me from becoming conceited, I was given a<br>> thorn in my flesh, a messenger of Satan, to torment me. Three times I<br>> pleaded with the Lord to take it away from me. But he said to me, "My<br>> grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in<br>> weakness." Therefore I will boast all the more gladly about my<br>> weaknesses, so that Christ's power may rest on me. That is why, for<br>> Christ's sake, I delight in weaknesses, in insults, in hardships, in<br>> persecutions, in difficulties. For when I am weak, then I am strong.<br>> --- 2 Cor 7--10 NIV<br><br>One way of looking at this reveals that *my* strength, *my* power, must<br>take a back-seat so that *God's* power can shine through. Another<br>interpretation is more broadly targeted at the whole passage. And it is<br>summed up in God's statement to Paul in the first part of verse 9:<br><br>**My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in<br>weakness.**<br><br>What exactly does that mean?<br><br>As Christians, we should be content with God's grace, even when we go<br>through the trials of our life. God brings us difficulty so that we<br>don't think that we are too powerful or too capable. We remember that<br>God is from whom our power flows, it is not our own hands by which we do<br>these great things. In this way, God receives the glory from the work of<br>our hands, not us.<br><br>Our weaknesses (or our diseases) don't need to be taken away in order<br>for us to showcase God's glory. Our weaknesses don't need to be taken<br>away for us to be happy. We are happy knowing we have God's grace and<br>salvation, and he can accomplish so much more through us, in spite of<br>our weaknesses.<br><br>It is God's power which allows us to say "I can do all things through<br>him who gives me strength" (Phil 4:13).<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>What does 2 Corinthians 12:9 mean to you?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
