<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If I set a password to my PC on startup, does it encrypt the hard<br>disk?**<br><br>The answer is "it depends."<br><br>In most cases, your "password to your PC on startup" is what we call a<br>BIOS password. This password prevents the motherboard from booting<br>the hard disk until a password is entered. In general, this *does not*<br>encrypt the hard drive. It simply prevents the disk from being booted.<br><br>There are several methods by which you can encrypt your hard drive so<br>that it is protected during boot, and many of them require on-board<br>hardware called a Trusted Platform Module (TPM). Using Microsoft<br>operating systems in conjunction with a TPM can provide you with full<br>device encryption as well as pre-boot authentication and decryption<br>before boot.<br><br>Later versions of Windows can also provide encryption without using a<br>TPM by encrypting the user partition separately from the boot partition.<br>The unencrypted boot partition starts first, then the user<br>authentication occurs, and that allows access to the encrypted user<br>partition.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
