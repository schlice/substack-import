<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>How can you stop tremors from MS happening?<br><br>(NOTE: I originally wrote an answer about tremors and spasticity. While<br>the conditions are similar, I decided to re-focus my answer on tremors<br>only).<br><br>"Tremor" in MS is the involuntary shaking of muscles. Tremor can affect<br>arms and legs, head, body, or the muscles needed for sexual function.<br><br>There are two basic types of tremor:<br><br>- Gross tremor, or wide back-and-forth movement of muscles, usually in<br>  the arms and legs<br>- Intention tremor, or action tremor, occurs usually when a person<br>  reaches for something.<br><br>Severe tremor can interfere with daily function such as speaking,<br>writing, walking, or eating.<br><br>Tremor is primarily treated using occupational therapy. If tremor<br>affects speech, a Speech and Language Pathologist (SLP), or a speech<br>therapist, can help with techniques to make speech clearer.<br><br>There is a whole host of medications which can be used to treat tremor:<br><br>- Hydroxyzine (Atarax, Vistaril®) Antihistamine that can help minor<br>  tremor worsened by stress<br>- Clonazepam (Klonopin®) Anti-anxiety agent with sedative effect<br>- Propranolol (Inderal®) Beta-blocker with modest relief for some tremor<br>- Buspirone (Buspar®) Anti-anxiety agent with some antitremor effect<br>- Ondansetron (Zofran®) Anti-nausea medication with anti-tremor effect,<br>  but very expensive<br>- Primidone (Mysoline®) Anti-epileptic medication with some antitremor<br>  effect in low doses; sedating effect<br>- Acetazolamide (Diamox) Diuretic; some help for postural tremor<br>- OnabotulinumtoxinA (Botox®) Neurotoxin that temporarily paralyzes<br>  targeted muscles; may be effective for tremor in the arms and hands<br><br>Other medications that may be tried include gabapentin (Neurontin®),<br>isoniazid (Laniazid, in the US; Isotamine in Canada); and<br>trihexyphenidyl (Artane). Some gross tremor can also be treated with<br>baclofen, which is primarily an agent for treating spasticity.<br><br>More invasive treatment may include deep brain stimulation, which was<br>originally developed to treat tremor in Parkinson's patients.<br><br>Bottom line: if you are experiencing MS tremor, see your neurologist. He<br>or she can assist you with the appropriate referrals to specialists,<br>help you start on occupational therapy or help get you started on some<br>trial medications to see if it can help. MS tremor is treatable and we<br>can manage the symptoms. It will take time, and it's not easy to find<br>the exact right strategy every time. Keep trying until you hit the sweet<br>spot.
