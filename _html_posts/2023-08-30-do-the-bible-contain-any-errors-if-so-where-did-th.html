<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>First of all, you can prove logically that the Bible is inerrant. The<br>logic goes:<br><br>1.  God cannot err.<br>2.  The Bible is the word of God.<br>3.  Therefore, the Bible cannot err.<br><br>This is a valid syllogism, so if the premises are true, then the<br>conclusion must be true. The Bible clearly declares itself to be the<br>Word of God, and we have strong evidence that it is. The Bible also<br>informs us several times that God cannot err, and we know this from<br>general revelation as well. So the conclusion is inevitable. The Bible<br>cannot err. If the Bible erred in anything it affirms, then God would be<br>mistaken. But God cannot make mistakes.<br><br>So what happens when we find an "error" in the Bible? First, we have to<br>define what an "error" is. Some have estimated there are about 200,000<br>errors in the New Testament manuscripts. First of all, these are not<br>"errors" but variant readings, the vast majority of which are strictly<br>grammatical (i.e., punctuation and spelling). Second, these readings are<br>spread throughout nearly 5,700 manuscripts, so that a variant spelling<br>of *one* letter of *one* word in *one* verse in 2,000 manuscripts is<br>counted as 2,000 "errors."<br><br>Textual scholars Westcott and Hort estimated that only *one in sixty* of<br>these variants has significance. This would leave a text 98.33 percent<br>pure. \[1\](#XcHAz){#cite-XcHAz .citation_link}Philip Schaff<br>calculated that, of the 150,000 variants known in his day, only 400<br>changed the meaning of the passage, only fifty were of real<br>significance, and *not even one* affected "an article of faith or a<br>precept of duty which is not abundantly sustained by other and undoubted<br>passages, or by the whole tenor of Scripture<br>teaching."\[2\](#MZUZC){#cite-MZUZC .citation_link}<br><br>So when we say that the BIble contains no errors, we are talking about<br>errors which would materially change "an article of faith or precept of<br>duty." In other words, **an error would be something that changes the<br>religious understanding of a passage.**<br><br>There are indeed none of those errors.<br><br>The part about that statement which is so amazing; indeed, supernatural,<br>is the fact that the Bible is not one book but 66 books written in three<br>languages by about forty different authors on three continents over the<br>span of about 1500 years. And with all of that time and space between<br>them, there is complete unity in the message, and there are, indeed,<br>zero errors (of the kind we identified already).<br><br>There is absolutely no way that such a thing could be accomplished by<br>the exertions of humans.<br><br>**That's why the Bible has zero errors: because the Bible writers were<br>divinely inspired.** In fact, the lack of errors is indeed a hallmark of<br>this divine inspiration.<br><br>\<br><br>On the topic of contradictory statements, because Jesus' authority is<br>well established by the evidence, we reasonably give the benefit of the<br>doubt to the Bible when we come across a difficulty or question in the<br>text. In other words, when we run across something inexplicable, we<br>assume that we, not the infinite God, are making an error. In other<br>words, it's more likely that we are ignorant than that the Bible is<br>wrong.<br><br>However, that doesn't mean we believe there's absolutely no possibility<br>for Bible errors. After all, there's always a chance that our<br>conclusions about inerrancy are wrong---for *we* are certainly not<br>inerrant. In fact, our conclusion on inerrancy would be falsified if<br>someone could trace a real error back to an original scroll.ยน But to<br>this day, after nearly 2,000 years of looking, no one has found such an<br>irreconcilable problem. This is truly amazing when you consider that the<br>Bible is really a collection of documents instead of just one big book.<br>Where could you find such agreement on a variety of issues from 40<br>authors who all live today, much less over a 1,500-year period?<br><br>\<br><br>ยน Copyist errors have been found in manuscripts, but they are easily<br>identified and known not to be in the original by comparing the many<br>manuscripts in existence. While no Bible originals have yet been found,<br>earlier manuscripts of other works have survived. So it is possible that<br>a Bible original may someday be discovered.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-XcHAz){.citation_index} [[Baker Encyclopedia of Christian<br>Apologetics;Baker Reference Library: Geisler, Norman L.: 9780801021510:<br>Amazon.com:<br>Books](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=b4afad&url=https://www.amazon.com/Encyclopedia-Christian-Apologetics-Reference-Library/dp/0801021510/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="amazon.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>\[2\](#cite-MZUZC){.citation_index} [[A Companion to the Greek<br>Testament and the English Version: Schaff, Philip: 9781017403817:<br>Amazon.com:<br>Books](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=3ba51d&url=https://www.amazon.com/Companion-Greek-Testament-English-Version/dp/1017403813/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="amazon.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
