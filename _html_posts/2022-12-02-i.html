<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The most common timeframe for someone to develop MS is between the ages<br>of 20 and 50. So you're right on the edge of the most common time to<br>develop the disease. Although MS can occur in much younger people<br>(called "pediatric MS") or much older people (called "geriatric MS"),<br>those cases are much less common.<br><br>But if you are "afraid that you might have MS," don't be. First, see a<br>doctor and discuss your symptoms. You may be referred to a neurologist<br>to run some tests which may include an MRI to look for evidence of MS.<br><br>Don't be afraid, be informed.<br><br>\<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*This answer is not professional medical advice, nor is it a substitute<br>for professional medical advice.
