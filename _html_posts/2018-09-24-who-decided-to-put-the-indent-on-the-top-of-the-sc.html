<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Who decided to put the indent on the top of the screen of the iPhone<br>X?**<br><br>Ah, the "notch," oh how we love thee...<br><br>To answer your specific question, phone manufacturers have two competing<br>priorities: create an edge-to-edge display, and also cram in a<br>front-facing camera and other components like retina scanners and<br>front-facing camera lights (and in Apple's case, all of the components<br>required for FaceID, like a dot projector).<br><br>So you have two choices: retain a bezel at the top of the screen (as the<br>Pixel and Galaxy series did), or incorporate a "notch" at the top of the<br>screen, like the iPhone X did (and the Essential Phone before it).<br><br>So why did Apple go with the notch? The notch approach allows the<br>manufacturer to claim a larger screen size, as Apple does. However, the<br>"notch and ears" look is cringeworthy from a design perspective. I'm<br>sure that if Apple could have done it, they would have hidden the<br>camera, the dot projector, and the face sensor underneath the display.<br>Indeed, they have a patent for hiding elements behind a touchscreen.<br>Apple tried to put their fingerprint sensor behind the display, but it<br>didn't work reliably, and they couldn't get it to work reliably in time<br>for the launch of the iPhone X. So they opted for the only other choice<br>that would leave them with the edge-to-edge display they had already<br>committed to, and still get the best screen-to-body ratio they could<br>achieve: move to FaceID and incorporate a notch for its sensors.<br><br>I am certain that in the future, we will see all of the elements hidden<br>behind a full edge-to-edge touchscreen. The Galaxy S10 will have an<br>in-glass fingerprint reader, so we are already headed in that direction.<br>For the iPhone X, the technology just wasn't there to support it.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
