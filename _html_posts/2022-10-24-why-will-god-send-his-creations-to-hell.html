<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>God doesn't send anyone to hell. **Those who go actively choose to go<br>there.**<br><br>God didn't create hell for us. God created hell for Satan and his<br>minions, since He needed someplace that was not going to be His, a place<br>completely devoid of His presence. A wasteland. Some places in the Bible<br>call it "a lake of fire."<br><br>However, man's disobedience and betrayal of God caused sin to enter into<br>the human condition, and caused Satan to become the (current) ruler of<br>the world. Thanks to Adam's sin, we inherited a fallen world, and we<br>live in sinful, fallen bodies. We know pain, we know disease, we know<br>suffering, and we know death, because of that one action.<br><br>But there is hope, and it is God who gives us that hope. In fact, the<br>entire theme of all 66 books of the Bible is the story of God's<br>creation, the fall of man, and God's work to redeem mankind to himself.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
