<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If a 16 year old and a 17 year old are dating, and the 17-year-old<br>turns 18, while the 16 years old turns 17, would it be illegal to have<br>sex?**<br><br>As with all legal questions, the answer is "it depends."<br><br>Some states have what are called "close in age" exemptions (also known<br>as "Romeo and Juliet" clauses) for their statutory rape laws which state<br>that in order for statutory rape to apply, the two participants must be<br>more than a set number of years apart in age. That number varies by<br>state.<br><br>But not all states have this "close in age" clause. In the US, just over<br>half the states have a "close in age" exemption on their books. Check<br>the laws regarding statutory rape in your jurisdiction.<br><br>Best advice: wait a year and avoid the problem altogether.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
