<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Bible translators believed they had a calling to translate the Bible<br>into as many languages as possible in order to spread the Gospel message<br>to the entire world. So yes, the Bible writers felt like they *did* have<br>permission to translate the Bible.<br><br>But you didn't ask about translating the Bible. You asked about changing<br>the name "Yeshua" to "Jesus." Why did they do that?<br><br>Well, they didn't really. It just happened as a matter of translation.<br><br>First off, the name isn't "Yeshua." It's יֵשׁוּעַ. Can you pronounce that?<br>Unless you can read Hebrew, no you can't. So a translator will listen to<br>it in Hebrew and then use the letters of the target language to most<br>closely match the sounds of what they hear. That's called<br>"transliteration." In Greek (the language in which the vast majority of<br>the New Testament was written), the transliteration of יֵשׁוּעַ is Ἰησοῦς<br>(which would be transliterated as "Iesous." There is no "sh" sound in<br>Greek, so it was simply replaced with an "s" sound instead.<br><br>In Latin, the word Ἰησοῦς would be transliterated as IESVS or "Iesvs."<br>But the Latin tranlators would often write "IESVS" with a J (instead<br>writing JESVS) because the "j" in Medieval Latin had the same sound as<br>the Greek letter "iota," or "I." The "j" in Latin had a "y" sound, just<br>like the "i" in Greek. The English transliteration of "JESVS" or "IESVS"<br>(which had the same sound) from Latin became "Jesus."<br><br>So there you have it. Well-intentioned translation and transliteration<br>turned "יֵשׁוּעַ" into "Jesus."<br><br>And ultimately, it doesn't matter. What's more important than<br>transliterating His name correctly is what He did for you.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
