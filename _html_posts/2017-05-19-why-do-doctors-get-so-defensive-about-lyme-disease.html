<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Let me see if I can help de-mystify why some doctors get so weird about<br>Lyme.<br><br>Lyme disease is caused by a bacteria called *Borrelia burgdorferi* which<br>is usually transmitted by a bite from the deer tick. In the early stages<br>of infection (i.e. within one month of infection), antibiotics are<br>usually effective at eliminating the active bacterial infection.<br><br>And that's about the limit of effective knowledge we have about Lyme.<br><br>From this point, there are two schools of medical thought. The doctors<br>who follow the American Medical Association's guidance say that the<br>bacteria is only active for a month, and after that month, it is no<br>longer present or causing issues. They feel there is no such thing as<br>"late-stage Lyme disease" because the Western Blot and ELISA tests they<br>use to find Lyme disease come back negative.<br><br>There is another school of thought around Lyme disease, and it is<br>currently being spear-headed by an organization called the<br>[[International Lyme and Associated Disease Society<br>(ILADS)](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=e1eab2&url=http://www.ilads.org){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="ilads.org"}]{.qlink_container}. This organization is spread<br>across 22 countries and "promotes understanding of Lyme and its<br>associated diseases and strongly supports physicians and other health<br>care professionals dedicated to advancing the standard of care for Lyme<br>and its associated diseases."<br><br>Take these facts, for example:<br><br>> 1.  **Lyme disease is transmitted by the bite of a tick, and the<br>>     disease is prevalent across the United States and throughout the<br>>     world.** Ticks know no borders and respect no boundaries. A<br>>     patient\'s county of residence does not accurately reflect his or<br>>     her Lyme disease risk because people travel, pets travel, and<br>>     ticks travel. This creates a dynamic situation with many<br>>     opportunities for exposure to Lyme disease for each individual.<br>> 2.  Lyme disease is a clinical diagnosis. The disease is caused by<br>>     a spiral-shaped bacteria (spirochete) called *Borrelia<br>>     Burgdorferi*. The Lyme spirochete can cause infection of multiple<br>>     organs and produce a wide range of symptoms. Case reports in the<br>>     medical literature document the protean manifestations of Lyme<br>>     disease, and familiarity with its varied presentations is key to<br>>     recognizing disseminated disease.<br>> 3.  **Fewer than 50% of patients with Lyme disease recall a tick<br>>     bite.** In some studies this number is as low as 15% in<br>>     culture-proven infection with the Lyme spirochete.<br>> 4.  Fewer than 50% of patients with Lyme disease recall any rash.<br>>     Although the erythema migrans (EM) or "bull's-eye" rash is<br>>     considered classic, it is not the most common dermatologic<br>>     manifestation of early-localized Lyme infection. Atypical forms of<br>>     this rash are seen far more commonly. It is important to know that<br>>     the EM rash is pathognomonic of Lyme disease and requires no<br>>     further verification prior to starting an appropriate course of<br>>     antibiotic therapy.<br>> 5.  The Centers For Disease Control And Prevention (CDC) surveillance<br>>     criteria for Lyme disease were devised to track a narrow band of<br>>     cases for epidemiologic purposes. **As stated on the CDC website,<br>>     the surveillance criteria were never intended to be used as<br>>     diagnostic criteria**, nor were they meant to define the entire<br>>     scope of Lyme disease.<br>> 6.  **The ELISA screening test is unreliable. The test misses 35% of<br>>     culture proven Lyme disease (only 65% sensitivity)** and is<br>>     unacceptable as the first step of a two-step screening protocol.<br>>     By definition, a screening test should have at least 95%<br>>     sensitivity.<br>> 7.  **Of patients with acute culture-proven Lyme disease, 20--30%<br>>     remain seronegative on serial Western Blot sampling.** Antibody<br>>     titers also appear to decline over time; thus while the western<br>>     blot may remain positive for months, it may not always be<br>>     sensitive enough to detect chronic infection with the Lyme<br>>     spirochete. For "epidemiological purposes" the CDC eliminated from<br>>     the Western Blot analysis the reading of bands 31 and 34. These<br>>     bands are so specific to *Borrelia Burgdorferi* that they were<br>>     chosen for vaccine development. Since a vaccine for Lyme disease<br>>     is currently unavailable, however, a positive 31 or 34 band is<br>>     highly indicative of *Borrelia Burgdorferi* exposure. Yet these<br>>     bands are not reported in commercial Lyme tests.<br>> 8.  **When used as part of a diagnostic evaluation for Lyme disease,<br>>     the Western Blot should be performed by a laboratory that reads<br>>     and reports all of the bands related to *Borrelia<br>>     Burgdorferi*.** Laboratories that use FDA approved kits (for<br>>     instance, the Mardx MarblotÂ®) are restricted from reporting all of<br>>     the bands, as they must abide by the rules of the manufacturer.<br>>     These rules are set up in accordance with the CDC\'s surveillance<br>>     criteria and increase the risk of false-negative results. The<br>>     commercial kits may be useful for surveillance purposes, but they<br>>     offer too little information to be useful in patient management.<br>> 9.  There are 5 subspecies of ***Borrelia Burgdorferi*, over 100<br>>     strains in the USA, and 300 strains worldwide.** This diversity is<br>>     thought to contribute to the antigenic variability of the<br>>     spirochete and its ability to evade the immune system and<br>>     antibiotic therapy, leading to chronic infection.<br>> 10. **Testing for Babesia, Anaplasma, Ehrlichia and Bartonella (other<br>>     tick-transmitted organisms) should be performed.** The presence of<br>>     co-infection with these organisms points to probable infection<br>>     with the Lyme spirochete as well. If these coinfections are left<br>>     untreated, their continued presence increases morbidity and<br>>     prevents successful treatment of Lyme disease.<br>> 11. A preponderance of evidence indicates that active **ongoing<br>>     spirochetal infection with or without other tick-borne<br>>     coinfections is the cause of the persistent symptoms in chronic<br>>     Lyme disease**.<br>> 12. **There has never been a study demonstrating that 30 days of<br>>     antibiotic treatment cures chronic Lyme disease.** However there<br>>     is a plethora of documentation in the US and European medical<br>>     literature demonstrating by histology and culture techniques that<br>>     short courses of antibiotic treatment fail to eradicate the Lyme<br>>     spirochete. Short treatment courses have resulted in upwards of a<br>>     40% relapse rate, especially if treatment is delayed.<br>> 13. **Most cases of chronic Lyme disease require an extended course of<br>>     antibiotic therapy to achieve symptomatic relief.** The return of<br>>     symptoms and evidence of the continued presence of *Borrelia<br>>     Burgdorferi* indicates the need for further treatment. The very<br>>     real consequences of untreated chronic persistent Lyme infection<br>>     far outweigh the potential consequences of long-term antibiotic<br>>     therapy.<br>> 14. **Many patients with chronic Lyme disease require prolonged<br>>     treatment until the patient is symptom-free.** Relapses occur and<br>>     retreatment may be required. There are no tests currently<br>>     available to prove that the organism is eradicated or that the<br>>     patient with chronic Lyme disease is cured.<br>> 15. **Like Syphilis in the 19th century, Lyme disease has been called<br>>     the great imitator** and should be considered in the differential<br>>     diagnosis of rheumatologic and neurologic conditions, as well as<br>>     Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, Fibromyalgia, Somatization Disorder and<br>>     any difficult-to-diagnose multi-system<br>>     illness.\[1\](#mVQRH){#cite-mVQRH .citation_link}<br><br>Finally, the doctors who fall into the "medically acceptable" camp scoff<br>at the other doctors, shun and ostracize them for their "radical"<br>beliefs, and generally "poo-poo" their ideas and treatments.<br><br>That said, you can't argue with results. The AMA doesn't produce<br>consistent results. The ILADS doctors do. Eventually, when the science<br>catches up with the treatment, ILADS will be vindicated. For now, they<br>are villified.<br><br>Why do doctors get defensive about this? Maybe they feel like they know<br>that something is wrong with the way the AMA prescribes diagnosing and<br>treating Lyme, but they feel their hands are tied. Maybe they are afraid<br>of being called a quack for believing that there may be another way to<br>treat Lyme.
