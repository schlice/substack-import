<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What will happen if you offer 500\$ to the police officer in the USA<br>when he stops you for infringement of the rules of road traffic?**<br><br>We've answered this already but I can't find the other question at the<br>moment.<br><br>You will be arrested and sent to jail for attempting to bribe a public<br>official. Bribery is a far more serious offense than whatever you were<br>charged with in the first place, so you should just accept the ticket,<br>pay the fine, and move on. Don't attempt to bribe the officer.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
