<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The McCloskeys know that there is never a "slam dunk" case in court. In<br>fact, there's lots of things that they did very wrong during the<br>incident, and most of them involve *how* they were handling their<br>weapons. Mrs. McCloskey pointed her weapon at people, with her finger on<br>the trigger. This alone is a criminal assault. Mr. McCloskey, while<br>maintaining good trigger discipline, also failed to keep his muzzle<br>pointed in a safe direction until such time that he needed to bring his<br>weapon to bear against a threat.<br><br>The prosecutor, Mark said, "dropped all the felony charges, all the gun<br>charges, and charged me with a crime that said I purposely placed other<br>people in apprehension of imminent fear of physical injury." He was<br>charged with a a Class C misdemeanor of fourth-degree assault. His wife<br>pleaded guilty to a Class A misdemeanor of second-degree harassment.<br>They will pay fines of \$2000 and \$750 for those offenses, and will<br>avoid jail time. And in a political stunt that surprises no one (but was<br>done to placate the fomenting masses who want the McCloskey's heads on<br>pikes), they were also forced to relinquish the two firearms used in the<br>assault.<br><br>Mr. McCloskey called the fine the equivalent of "a parking ticket." When<br>talking about his actions, he said, "\I\f that's a crime in Missouri,<br>I did it, and I'll do it again\.\"\[1\](#kUxIW){#cite-kUxIW<br>.citation_link}<br><br>\<br><br>*For the time being, I have re-enabled comments on selected answers.<br>Some people like to comment. Some people like to engage with me in a<br>civil manner, and I did kinda miss that\...a little. But do not<br>misunderstand, I take this step very cautiously, and I have no tolerance<br>for harassing or inane behavior. If you don\'t like what I wrote, tough<br>shit. If my answer is grammatically low-quality or is un-cited opinion<br>masquerading as fact, downvote it. If you think I\'m wrong, write your<br>own answer. But Quora is a question-and-answer site, not a debate site.<br>If you are simply commenting to tell me \"ackshually, you\'re wrong,\"<br>don\'t be surprised if I quietly delete your comment. Put anything<br>vaguely harassing in there, and your deletion will be followed by a<br>block/mute, and a BNBR report. I will do this immediately and with no<br>compunction. You have been warned. Be nice.*<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Why were the McCloskeys even charged? How is it illegal to hold your<br>weapon on your own property to deter rioters?
