<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [I hesitate to answer, because I don\'t find the question<br>truthful.\<br>\<br>Two options:\<br>\<br>1. If your account of the story is 100% accurate, and you\'re not<br>obfuscating anything at all, I suggest you contact DPD directly and file<br>a complaint against the officer, or sue him for assault.\<br>\<br>2. Post your video to YouTube, append the link to your question\'s<br>comments, and let us comment on the actual video. Otherwise, the<br>\"facts\" you\'ve presented don\'t really engender a lot of belief in<br>the veracity of your claims.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
