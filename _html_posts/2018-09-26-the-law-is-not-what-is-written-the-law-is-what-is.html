<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**"The law is not what is written, the law is what is revealed to you<br>when you follow your conscience." To what extent do you agree/disagree<br>with this statement?**<br><br>I fully and wholeheartedly disagree with this statement.<br><br>The law *exactly is* what's written, it can't be any other way, and it<br>can't because **when I follow my conscience, and when you follow your<br>conscience, we may not arrive at the same place.**<br><br>Following your conscience is great. Having a sound moral compass is a<br>feature of a well-fashioned life. But not everyone has that feature in<br>their lives, and *basing a system of law on following conscience means<br>that there is no common baseline* for people to point to.<br><br>In short, follow your conscience, but the law is the law, and it can<br>only be what is written, so that it applies equally and similarly to all<br>people.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
