<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Besides the tidbit that WTC7 is the first known steel<br>building that collapsed purely because of uncontrolled fire, most<br>Americans are *far*, far more concerned about what happened to<br>WTC1 and WTC2 than what happened to WTC7.\<br>\<br>Regardless of what the conspiracy theorists claim, WTC7 would never have<br>collapsed if WTC1 and WTC2 did not collapse. So any objective analysis<br>of the collapse of WTC7 must state that it was caused by uncontrolled<br>fires ***triggered by the destruction of WTC1 and<br>WTC2.***]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
