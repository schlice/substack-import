But they<br>probably won't want to, since lie detectors are notoriously inaccurate.<br><br>> The accuracy (i.e., validity) of polygraph testing has long been<br>> controversial. An underlying problem is theoretical: There is no<br>> evidence that any pattern of physiological reactions is unique to<br>> deception. An honest person may be nervous when answering truthfully<br>> and a dishonest person may be non-anxious. Also, there are few good<br>> studies that validate the ability of polygraph procedures to detect<br>> deception. As Dr. Saxe and Israeli psychologist Gershon Ben-Shahar<br>> (1999) note, \"it may, in fact, be impossible to conduct a proper<br>> validity study.\" In real-world situations, it\'s very difficult to<br>> know what the truth is.<br>><br>> A particular problem is that polygraph research has not separated<br>> placebo-like effects (the subject\'s belief in the efficacy of the<br>> procedure) from the actual relationship between deception and their<br>> physiological responses. One reason that polygraph tests may *appear*<br>> to be accurate is that subjects who believe that the test works and<br>> that they can be detected may confess or will be very anxious when<br>> questioned. If this view is correct, the lie detector might be better<br>> called a fear detector.\[1\](#fuega){#cite-fuega .citation_link}<br><br>To that end, if the polygraph is the only evidence they have, it can be<br>easily nullified as little more than chance.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-fuega){.citation_index}<br>[https://www.apa.org/research/act\...(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=9f503a&url=https://www.apa.org/research/action/polygraph){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="apa.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
