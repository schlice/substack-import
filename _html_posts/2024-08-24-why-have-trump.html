<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Because honestly, crowds at the convention don't determine who is going<br>to win the White House. It doesn't determine which candidate has more<br>energy. It doesn't determine who has more support. It doesn't determine<br>which party has more support for their platform.<br><br>The convention is not a microcosm of the nation. Crowd sizes don't tell<br>us anything substantive.<br><br>And by the end of the evening (these speakers go until the wee hours of<br>the morning), people are tired. They want to leave. Only the hardcore<br>followers will stick around, along with the family members of the<br>speakers, and RNC staffers.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
