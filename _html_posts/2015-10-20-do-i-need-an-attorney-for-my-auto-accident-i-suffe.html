<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [I recommend always consulting with a personal injury<br>attorney. Most of them offer free consultation and some don\'t even<br>require a retainer. They only get paid if they win.\<br>\<br>Therefore, they\'re very selective about cases they take. They don\'t<br>take every case that walks in the door.\<br>\<br>You can probably name at least three personal injury attorneys in your<br>area just from their TV commercials. I can name four, and one that<br>specializes in back injuries only (of all flavors: worker\'s comp,<br>negligence, accident, etc. Their tagline: \"We\'ve got your back!\").\<br>\<br>It doesn\'t hurt you to check with a personal injury attorney, and if<br>they take your case, there\'s a good chance they believe they will<br>win.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
