<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [If it can be proven that the innocent person specifically<br>confessed to the crime *in order to impede or delay* the investigation<br>into the real killer, the confessor can be charged with obstruction.\<br>\<br>Obstruction of justice is charged when a person deliberately, or through<br>omission, impedes the progress of a police investigation. Confessing to<br>a crime which one did not commit does not rise to the level of<br>obstruction unless the confession was done intentionally to forestall<br>the actual investigation into the actual criminal.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
