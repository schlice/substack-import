<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Why did the Dallas police take out the attacker of their officers<br>using a robot instead of showing their true strength and courage "mano a<br>mano?"**<br><br>I missed the part in the job description where it said that when<br>evaluating how best to stop a criminal from killing people, cops must<br>always use the most macho, Hollywood-style method to do so, so you can<br>prove to people just how much of a badass you are.<br><br>I also missed the part in the job description where it says "Gets killed<br>when necessary."<br><br>Yes, police work can be dangerous. But cops wear bulletproof vests<br>because they'd like to *not die* today. The priority is to go home at<br>the end of your shift, but to go home in your own car, not in the<br>coroner's van.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
