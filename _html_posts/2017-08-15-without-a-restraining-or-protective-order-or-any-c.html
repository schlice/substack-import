<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>You asked this question oddly. Let me break it down and answer it piece<br>by piece:<br><br>> *\H\ow can I be arrested for trespassing, which I was*<br><br>Simple. If you are not listed on the deed as an owner of the property,<br>and the owner of the property asks you to leave, and you don't, you are<br>*de facto* trespassing. This may not have been the case, but you didn't<br>supply any details, so we're just guessing. But any time you are on<br>private property (which includes private property open to the public,<br>like restaurants) and the property owner tells you to leave, then that<br>"open to the public" thing no longer applies to you, as you are present<br>in that property at the pleasure of the property owner. If they ask you<br>to leave, you must leave. Continued presence constitutes trespassing.<br><br>> *Without a restraining or protective order or any court order put on<br>> me or my house*<br><br>These things are not required in order to support a charge of<br>trespassing. If there was a restraining order or protective order issued<br>against you, violating the restraining order would be a violation of a<br>court order, not trespassing.<br><br>> *\D\o I have the right to sue the police for doing so*<br><br>If the police were carrying out their duty, which is to enforce the law,<br>and they found probable cause to presume that you were, in fact,<br>trespassing, they have the authority to arrest you and charge you with<br>trespassing. Suing the police, while possible, is not likely to get you<br>far, so long as the officers were doing their jobs.<br><br>If they arrested you with no cause and with no collected evidence and<br>you were subsequently released because there was no evidence to support<br>a charge of trespassing, you can then sue the police (with the help of<br>your lawyer) for *false arrest,* or whatever the charge is called in<br>your jurisdiction. Beyond that, suing the police for doing their jobs,<br>while possible, is not likely to benefit you in any way.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
