<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What is a good point to tell someone that multiple Schlerosis is not<br>my fault?**<br><br>Multiple Sclerosis is not a disease you can "catch." You didn't do or<br>not do anything that increased your own risk of developing the disease.<br>It is an *autoimmune disease*. This means your immune system is<br>*malfunctioning* and it is attacking healthy cells.<br><br>While we don't know the exact mechanism that induces this immune<br>response, we do know some risk factors that may indicate an increased<br>chance of developing the disease. We know this through *epidemiology*,<br>the study of disease patterns.<br><br>SEX: Females are two to three times more likely to develop MS than<br>males. Scientists believe that one\'s tendency to develop MS therefore<br>has some hormonal connection.<br><br>FAMILY HISTORY: Statistics show that the chance of the average<br>person in the United States developing MS is about 1 in 750. But close<br>(first-degree) relatives of people with MS, such as children, siblings<br>or non-identical twins, have a higher chance, anywhere from one in 100<br>to one in 40. It\'s not all genetic, though, and you can see this<br>through the \"identical twin\" example. If one identical twin has MS,<br>the other twin (who has the identical gene structure as the twin) has<br>only a 1 in 4 chance of developing MS. If it were all genetic, the<br>unaffected twin would have a 100% chance of developing MS instead of the<br>25% chance they exhibit today.<br><br>ETHNICITY: MS is more common among Caucasians (particularly those of<br>northern European ancestry) than other ethnic groups, and is almost<br>unheard of in some populations, such as Inuit, Yakutes, Hutterites,<br>Hungarian Romani, Norwegian Lapps, Australian Aborigines, and New<br>Zealand Maoris.<br><br>GEOGRAPHY: MS occurs with greatest frequency in higher latitudes<br>(above 40Â° latitude) away from the equator, than in lower latitudes,<br>closer to the equator. This may have something to do with vitamin D<br>production in the skin, and the vitamin\'s prophylactic effect on the<br>development of MS. The exact details about vitamin D\'s involvement with<br>the prevention of MS, however, is still unclear. Moving from one<br>geographic area to another seems to alter a person\'s risk of developing<br>MS. Studies show that families and their children will assume the new<br>risk level (higher or lower) of the area to which they move. Those who<br>move before the age of 15 generally take on the new risk themselves.<br>Those who move after the age of 15 may not see the new risk appear until<br>the next generation.<br><br>INFECTIOUS TRIGGER: Scientists have been searching for years for an<br>infectious agent that might trigger the MS disease process. While many<br>different viruses have been suggested, including rabies, herpes simplex<br>virus, measles, corona virus (other than COVID-19), canine distemper<br>virus, HTLV-1, Epstein-Barr virus, among others, none has yet been<br>confirmed. Chlamydia pneumoniae, a bacteria which 90% of the population<br>has been exposed to over their lifetime, has also been suggested but<br>never proven. Although no trigger has yet been identified, most MS<br>experts believe that some infectious agent is involved in initiating the<br>disease process.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
