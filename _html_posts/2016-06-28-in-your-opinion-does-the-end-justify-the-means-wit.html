<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>In my opinion, the ends never justify the means. "The end justifies the<br>means" means you can do anything to get what you want. Even if it's<br>illegal, immoral, or unethical. So long as you get what you want,<br>nothing is off the table.<br><br>A man once said, "If I can't go back with my self-respect, I won't go<br>back at all." That man was Capt Theodore Harris, USAF, who was in<br>solitary confinement for 14 months as a prisoner of war (POW) in Korea.<br>Why did he need his self-respect so much? Isn't getting home the most<br>important thing of all? Couldn't you compromise just a few of your<br>principles to get yourself home? Maybe even just one? Couldn't you live<br>without your self-respect?<br><br>See, the thing is, once you can compromise one of your principles, you<br>can compromise any of them. If you believe that the end justifies the<br>means, you have no self-respect, because you can compromise any of your<br>principles at any time. I don't want to be someone who isn't respected<br>because he compromises his principles. But more importantly, I need to<br>be able to respect myself. And holding myself to my principles is more<br>important than achieving a goal. If I can't achieve an end without<br>compromising a principle or two to do it, the goal isn't worth<br>achieving.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
