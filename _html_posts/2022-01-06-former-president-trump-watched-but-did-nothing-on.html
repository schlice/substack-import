Mayor Muriel Bowser requested more assistance.<br>> Acting Defense Secretary Chris Miller immediately called up 1,100<br>> members of the D.C. National Guard.<br>><br>> At the same time, officials were collecting Guardsmen at traffic<br>> points and Metro stations and returning them to the D.C. Armory to<br>> refit for a crowd control mission, the secretary said. Their mission<br>> was to support D.C. Metropolitan Police and Capitol Hill Police.<br>><br>> Guardsmen started flowing into the area of the Capitol soon after and<br>> reinforced Metro Police on the perimeter of the Capitol. This allowed<br>> the police and FBI to clear the chambers and offices of the U.S.<br>> Capitol, McCarthy said. \"By 7:15, both chambers and leadership<br>> offices were cleared, and members were able to return to business, and<br>> we began the planning for the following day,\" he<br>> said.\[1\](#gGXES){#cite-gGXES .citation_link}<br><br>Looks like a successful mission to me, and it looks like the Federal<br>government provided DC the support that they needed.<br><br>So to me, it looks like your statement is incorrect.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Former President Trump watched but did nothing on January 6th.
