<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>So let's explain quickly a little bit about the EDSS --- the Expanded<br>Disability Status Scale. It is a scale from 0 (No disability) to 10<br>(Death from MS) in 0.5 unit increments, and defines the level of<br>disability. The scores of 0 through 4.5 describe people who can walk<br>without any aid and it describes their impairment across eight different<br>functional systems:<br><br>- pyramidal -- muscle weakness or difficulty moving limbs<br>- cerebellar -- ataxia, loss of balance, coordination or tremor<br>- brainstem -- problems with speech, swallowing and nystagmus<br>- sensory -- numbness or loss of sensations<br>- bowel and bladder function<br>- visual function - problems with sight<br>- cerebral functions - problems with thinking and memory<br>- other<br><br>Scores between 5 and 9.5 are all characterized by varying degrees to<br>which walking is affected. The scale is often criticized because of its<br>reliance on walking in these scores.<br><br>All that is to say that by the time you reach EDSS score of 9, you are<br>essentially bedridden.<br><br>So how many people, on average, will be diagnosed at an EDSS score of 9?<br>One longitudinal study estimated that by 15 years post MS diagnosis,<br>there is an approximately 40% probability of a patient with MS needing<br>some type of walking aid and a 25% probability of them needing a<br>wheelchair.\[1\](#wYYgv){#cite-wYYgv .citation_link} Fewer than 5% of<br>people who are diagnosed with MS will develop an EDSS score greater than<br>8.5. Very few people progress rapidly. The mean EDSS change over 10<br>years was 1 point, and only 20% of patients had a change larger than 2.0<br>points.<br><br>The best predictor of later disease activity is early disease activity<br>and time between relapses. Basically, the better you do early on will<br>predict how well you will do later in life. From the most recent<br>extensions to the Olmsted County MS [[cohort<br>studies](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=e190b1&url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/cohort-analysis){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="sciencedirect.com"}]{.qlink_container} conducted by the Mayo<br>group, we can see that the time to disability is not influenced by<br>ongoing relapses once patients achieve an apparently permanent degree of<br>moderate disability (EDSS 3.5). Overall, 80% patients who are still<br>classified as RRMS into their second decade of disease continue to do<br>well for 15 to 20 years with limited permanent disability. Patients<br>doing extremely well (EDSS â‰¤ 2.0) after 10 years of MS generally do well<br>in the next decade. However, very rarely patients doing well even for 2<br>to 3 decades may develop severe late disability.<br><br>None of this is to say that there are any guarantees when it comes to<br>MS. If you have MS, get on one of the approved MS therapy drugs and do<br>regular monitoring with your healthcare team.<br><br>\<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*This answer is not professional medical advice, nor is it a substitute<br>for professional medical advice.
