<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Your statement "according to California law, it is my property" is not<br>precise. Depending on a lot of circumstances, it *may* be your property,<br>but it is unlikely since you "just" bought a condo.<br><br>In this case, there are two ways you get to keep it:<br><br>1.  Check your purchase agreement. If it includes "everything in the<br>    unit" including furnishings, then you own it and everything in it.<br>    The staging company must go after the seller for not removing their<br>    furniture before you took possession.<br>2.  If you can reasonably claim that the furniture was abandoned, then<br>    you get to decide what to do with it. In California, this means you<br>    must have given them a reasonable opportunity to come back and claim<br>    it. If you sent them a California Notice to Reclaim Abandoned<br>    Property (under \$700) and they still didn't come to get it, after<br>    the date on the form, you can do whatever you want with it: keep it,<br>    sell it, or destroy it.<br><br>In this case, the staging company wants it back, so item 2 is unlikely<br>to apply unless it's been years since they left it. So your only option<br>is option 1.<br><br>If your purchase agreement doesn't include "everything in the unit,"<br>then the furniture doesn't belong to you, period. If the staging company<br>contacted you and said they want their stuff back, keeping it is<br>theft and you can be criminally charged for that theft. How severely<br>you are charged is dependent on the dollar amount of the theft.<br><br>You can still keep the furniture if you **offer the staging company a<br>buyout deal** considering the original amount of the furniture, its age,<br>and its current condition, minus a reasonable discount. In other words,<br>make them an offer. If they agree, you can buy the furniture, own it for<br>a fraction of what it would have cost new, they don't have to take the<br>time to come get it, and you don't have to have the hassle of movers<br>coming in to your condo.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>I just bought a condo in California, and the staging company left<br>furniture in my condo. According to California law, it is my property.<br>Now the staging company wants it back. What should I do?<br><br>\<br><br>*This answer is not professional legal advice, nor is it a substitute<br>for professional legal advice, or a solicitation to offer professional<br>legal advice.
