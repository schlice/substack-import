<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Caffeine is very similar, pharmacologically, to<br>theophylline, which is a bronchodialator. Studies have shown that it<br>functions similarly (opening up airways and relieving some of the<br>symptoms of asthma). [[Some<br>studies](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=8edec5&url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0010864/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="nih.gov"}]{.qlink_container} have shown that caffeine is<br>beneficial to those with asthma, relieving symptoms for up to four<br>hours.\<br>\<br>Now, for the important stuff:\<br>]<br><br>- Don\'t drink caffeine for at least four hours before you are scheduled<br>  to take a lung function test. The caffeine may alter your bronchial<br>  tubes and you will not get an accurate indication of lung function.<br>- DON\'T STOP TAKING YOUR ASTHMA MEDICINE AND SWITCH TO MOUNTAIN DEW OR<br>  MONSTER!!! (or anything with caffeine in it) Never stop or change your<br>  medications without consulting your doctor!<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*This answer is not professional medical advice**, nor is it a<br>substitute for professional medical advice.
