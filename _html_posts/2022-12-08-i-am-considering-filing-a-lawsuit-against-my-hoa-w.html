<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>1.  GET A LAWYER.\<br>    You must make sure you *KNOW* your Governing Documents. In order<br>    to do so, you should get your Governing Documents reviewed by an<br>    attorney, even before you consider filing a lawsuit. You must<br>    understand exactly what the Governing Documents allow your HOA to<br>    do, and what they prevent your HOA from doing. Next, you must know<br>    exactly what your HOA did, and finally, you must be able to<br>    articulate how what they did violates the Governing Documents. This<br>    is what a lawyer helps you with. They can review your HOA's<br>    Governing Documents in light of your state's laws and review the<br>    HOA's actions to make sure you actually have a case that has a<br>    chance of winning.<br>2.  HAVE MONEY.\<br>    Suing your HOA will not be cheap. You may prevail in the end (and<br>    the HOA may be forced to pay your attorney's fees, depending on what<br>    state you live in), but until then, you're on the hook for your<br>    attorney's fees. And if you lose, you may end up paying *their*<br>    attorney's fees. So if you're living paycheck-to-paycheck, maybe a<br>    costly lawsuit isn't in the cards for you yet.<br>3.  BE PREPARED TO LOSE.\<br>    What happens if you lose? Are you going to continue to live with<br>    your HOA? Or are you going to move? Will you comply with their rules<br>    in the future?\<br>    \<br>    Also, while it's a bit tongue-in-cheek, *what will the neighbors<br>    think?* Will they think your lawsuit is frivolous? Will they be okay<br>    with the HOA having to spend their dues money to mount a defense<br>    against your lawsuit, even if they ultimately prevail? This kinda<br>    goes hand-in-hand with what happens if you lose.\<br>    \<br>    Don't get me wrong; this doesn't mean that you don't retain the<br>    right to sue. But just because you have the right to do something<br>    doesn't alleviate you of the consequences of your actions, which<br>    could include being ostracized from your own neighborhood.<br>4.  CONSIDER ALTERNATIVES.\<br>    You might consider alternatives to lawsuits, such as binding<br>    arbitration. This is less expensive than a lawsuit, but still<br>    effective at getting you results.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
