They<br>found it to be mostly true.<br><br>> \"So far this year, more students have been killed in schools than<br>> soldiers in combat zones.\"<br>><br>> --- [[Gwen<br>> Graham](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=fb0236&url=http://www.politifact.com/personalities/gwen-graham/){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="politifact.com"}]{.qlink_container} on Friday, May 18th,<br>> 2018 in a Facebook post<br><br>However, let's break the little tidbit down.<br><br>The first half of 2018 has seen an *unusually high* number of students<br>killed in school shootings. The Politifact writers find that through May<br>18 of 2017, there were two deaths in school shootings. Through May 18 of<br>2016, it was one; for 2015 it was zero; and for 2014 it was one. So the<br>fact that through May 18 of 2018 there were 26 shows that there is<br>an *anomaly* in school shootings in the first part of 2018 as opposed to<br>previous years. The total number of military members killed in the two<br>active military operations currently ongoing is 13.<br><br>Secondly, the death rate (or the likelihood of being killed in either a<br>school shooting or in the military) is more important than the actual<br>numbers in any snapshot at any given time. Considering that there are<br>approximately 50 million students in K-12 schools, and the military<br>members actively present in the two combat zones listed above is less<br>than 20,000, a military member is still *40 times more likely* to be<br>killed in a combat zone than a student is to be killed in a school<br>shooting.<br><br>The numbers game is the one that is similar to this: I can say that any<br>time a plane crashes, upwards of 200 people die. Any time a car crashes,<br>you could have as many as 10 people dead. So cars are objectively safer,<br>right? Only if you look at an individual car crash versus an individual<br>plane crash. You must look at the total number of people traveling by<br>air vs the total number of people traveling by car, and the number of<br>people killed on average each year in each one of those modes of<br>transportation. Once you do that, you find that air travel is<br>significantly safer than driving in a car.<br><br>So simple numbers, taken without any context, will not tell the whole<br>story. Let's be clear about something right now: **Yes, there were 26<br>children killed in school shootings, and that is an abomination.** But<br>to simply look at that number and extrapolate that *therefore, schools<br>are less safe than combat zones* is lazy statistics at best, and is<br>intentionally misleading at worst.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
