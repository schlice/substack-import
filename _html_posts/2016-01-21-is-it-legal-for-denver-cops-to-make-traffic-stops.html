<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>It is *legal* for Denver cops to make traffic stops in unmarked cars.<br><br>In *practice*, we sorta have a \"gentleman\'s agreement\" that the vast<br>majority of patrol (with the notable exception of Colorado State Patrol)<br>will be done in marked cars. We want to minimize any confusion about<br>whether or not the guy trying to pull you over is a real cop. Similarly,<br>most agencies (again, with the notable exception of Colorado State<br>Patrol) don\'t run radar from unmarked cars.<br><br>But it is not illegal for Colorado cops to stop you in marked or<br>unmarked cars if they observe you committing a traffic violation.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
