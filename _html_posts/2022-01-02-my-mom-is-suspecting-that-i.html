<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Why do you feel like you have to convince her of anything?<br><br>Live your life. Let her live hers. If you've told her you are not a<br>lesbian, that's it. That's the end of it. You can have whatever friends<br>you like; that doesn't change who you are.<br><br>Remember: the problem here is *her*, not *you*. You don't have to do<br>anything different. It's up to her to fix herself; it's not up to you to<br>fix her.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>My mom is suspecting that I'm a lesbian just because of the fact that I<br>have a lot of LGBQT+ friends. How can I convince her that I'm not?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
