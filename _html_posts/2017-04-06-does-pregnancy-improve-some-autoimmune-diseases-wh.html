<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>A2A<br><br>Pregnancy makes MS better during the time that the woman is pregnant.<br><br>MS is an autoimmune, demyelinating disease which causes the immune<br>system to attack the myelin sheath surrounding nerve fibers. It has also<br>long been known that pregnant women who have MS tend to go into<br>remission during their pregnancy. Researchers formerly postulated that<br>this was because the enhanced immune systems of pregnant women stopped<br>their autoimmune patterns for a while. Now, as demonstrated in a recent<br>study, scientists have shown that a hormone generated during pregnancy,<br>*prolactin*, \"\...encourages the spontaneous production of<br>myelin\...\".<br><br>> \T\he study is the first to determine that prolactin, which<br>> increases in the body during pregnancy, is directly responsible for<br>> the formation of new myelin in the brains and spinal cords of pregnant<br>> mice. Further, when non-pregnant mice with MS-like lesions were<br>> injected with prolactin, their myelin was also<br>> repaired.\[1\](#aoMLH){#cite-aoMLH .citation_link}<br><br>It is also known that within a few weeks to months of giving birth,<br>women will likely experience a relapse (for women who have relapsing<br>forms of MS).<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-aoMLH){.citation_index}<br>[http://www.sciencedaily.com/rele\...(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=bdd037&url=http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/02/070221071152.htm){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="sciencedaily.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
