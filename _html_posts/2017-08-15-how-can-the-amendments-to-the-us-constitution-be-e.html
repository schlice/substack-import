<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>There are two Constitutionally-approved methods to modify the<br>Constitution (as detailed in Article V of the Constitution):<br><br>1.  Congress can propose a new amendment with a two-thirds vote in both<br>    the House and the Senate. Any provision of the Constitution,<br>    including existing amendments, can be modified, or rendered null and<br>    void by a new amendment. The amendment must be ratified by<br>    three-fourths of the states to become part of the Constitution.<br>2.  Two-thirds of the states can call a convention to propose amendments<br>    to the Constitution, often called an "Article V Convention" or an<br>    "Amendments Convention." Once the Amendments are drafted, they are<br>    sent to the states, and must still be ratified by three-fourths of<br>    the states in order to become part of the Constitution.<br><br>To date, 33 amendments have been drafted and sent to the states. 27 of<br>these amendments were ratified and are now part of the Constitution. An<br>Article V Convention has yet to take place.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
