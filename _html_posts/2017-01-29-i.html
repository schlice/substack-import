<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>A2A<br><br>I'm going to take this on, because you have a flawed premise which is<br>causing your problem.<br><br>Your flawed premise: *MS patients need as much muscle as possible*.<br><br>Perhaps you've been told this. Perhaps you've read some stuff about<br>health maintenance with MS and you've come to this conclusion.<br><br>*The short answer is that this statement is false.* MS patients do not<br>need as much muscle as possible. If that were true, MS clinics would be<br>bodybuilding and bulking facilities, packing on slabs of muscle onto<br>every MS patient who could do it.<br><br>But they're not.<br><br>In actuality, maintaining muscle mass and muscle tone in MS patients is<br>nothing more than *a hedge against the future*.<br><br>The reason that MS patients should maintain muscle mass and muscle tone<br>is because at some point in the future, it is possible that they may<br>lose some of that mobility. Muscles may not respond as well in the<br>future, due to nerve damage. Sometimes, weakness in muscles occurs as a<br>mater of exacerbations, which can remit in RRMS patients. The problem we<br>are discussing comes when loss of full muscle control is caused by<br>actual nerve damage. And once you hit that point, it's very difficult,<br>if not impossible, to go back. Science as of today has not found a<br>proven method to repair damaged CNS nerves. Once they are damaged, and<br>those pathways between brain and muscle are disrupted, it becomes<br>exponentially more difficult to maintain muscle mass and muscle tone.<br><br>So exercising *now*, while you're still healthy enough to do so, is<br>a hedge against future potential muscle atrophy due to poor signal<br>quality between the brain and the muscle. This does not translate to<br>"all MS patients must pack on as much muscle as possible." This does<br>translate to "you should tone and build muscle before you're no longer<br>able to do so."<br><br>In my opinion, you should work with your neurologist on this issue. Tell<br>him/her your fitness goals and your priorities. I believe you should<br>work out a timetable for when you might consider stopping bodybuilding<br>and transitioning to a muscle building routine rather than a<br>bodybuilding routine. I think it's only wise that at some point in the<br>future, you transition away from cutting, and you move towards building<br>and toning, as a hedge against future issues. This, however, is a<br>strategy you should work out with your care team. There is no single<br>answer for anyone. Based on your disease, the close monitoring of it,<br>how you have progressed up to this point, and what your goals and future<br>priorities are, you and your neurologist should be able to come up with<br>a reasonable timeline where you can continue your bodybuilding now, and<br>eventually transition to a model best suited for a more long-term<br>strategy to maintain the best tone and muscle mass profile for you and<br>your future well-being.<br><br>MS means you need to *change* your life. MS doesn't mean you need to<br>*end* your life.<br><br>Good luck!<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*This answer is not professional medical advice**, nor is it a<br>substitute for professional medical advice.
