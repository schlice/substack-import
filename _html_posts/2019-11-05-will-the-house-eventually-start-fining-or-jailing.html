<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Will the House eventually start fining or jailing White House<br>officials who refuse to testify on impeachment after being issued a<br>subpoena?**<br><br>The House has no authority to fine or jail anyone. You might counter and<br>say that the Sergeant at Arms has locked people in broom closets in the<br>distant past, but that was before the well-provisioned FBI that we have<br>today.<br><br>Today, if the House wants to enforce its subpoenas, it must get past the<br>not-insignificant legal challenges to both their basis and the<br>overcoming of Executive authority and privilege. Remember, White House<br>officials are not refusing to testify because they are simply being<br>obstinate. They are refusing to testify because the President has made a<br>claim of Executive Privilege over their testimony. This means that there<br>is a valid reason that these people may not necessarily be forced to<br>testify.<br><br>Only a court can decide which privilege wins the day: Congress' subpoena<br>authority through its standing subcommittees, or the President's claim<br>of Executive Privilege. These are two equal powers. Both branches have<br>needs for information, and both branches have valid reasons for either<br>wanting information, or wanting to protect information.<br><br>So where does this go from here?<br><br>The House subcommittees issuing the subpoenas will have to take them to<br>the US Attorney's Office in DC, who will schedule a hearing in front of<br>a Federal judge. The Congress and the White House will have the<br>opportunity to present their arguments, and the judge will make a<br>determination as to whether or not the subpoenas are valid, and whether<br>or not the subpoenaed person can be compelled to testify.<br><br>Either way, the House does not need the testimony to file Articles of<br>Impeachment. They do not need any investigation; they can claim they<br>already have everything they need to make a determination that the<br>President has done whatever impeachable thing they believe he has done,<br>and they can move forward. So even if these subpoenas fail to get the<br>testimony they want, they can press on with whatever they have now.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
