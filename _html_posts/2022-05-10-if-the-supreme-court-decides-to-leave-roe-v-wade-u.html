<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>13 states have "trigger laws" which won't go into effect unless *Roe* is<br>actually overturned.<br><br>10 states already have laws banning abortions on their books, but since<br>*Roe* and its follow-on cases, those laws have been unenforceable. If<br>*Roe* remains, those laws will remain unenforceable.<br><br>In the short term, the case which spurred this on, *Dobbs,* will be<br>decided, and the Mississippi law banning abortions after 15 weeks will<br>be found to be unconstitutional under *Roe*.<br><br>The other states which have laws banning abortions after 15 weeks (like<br>Florida and Texas) will see those laws similarly overturned as<br>unconstitutional.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>If the Supreme Court decides to leave Roe v. Wade untouched, how will<br>that affect the states' new abortion laws?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
