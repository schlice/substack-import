<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Yes.<br><br>According to Christian theology, Jesus' physical body was perfected and<br>resurrected. Essentially, he received the OG version 1.0 body that God<br>initially created for Adam and Eve, the body that was untainted by sin.<br><br>The Bible also describes Jesus' *ascension* into Heaven; His physical<br>body ascended into Heaven, where He lives today.<br><br>> *And he led them out as far as Bethany, and lifting up his hands he<br>> blessed them. While he blessed them, he parted from them and was<br>> carried up into heaven. And they worshiped him and returned to<br>> Jerusalem with great joy, and were continually in the temple blessing<br>> God. \-- Luke 24:50-53 ESV*<br>><br>> *And when he had said these things, as they were looking on, he was<br>> lifted up, and a cloud took him out of their sight. And while they<br>> were gazing into heaven as he went, behold, two men stood by them in<br>> white robes, and said, "Men of Galilee, why do you stand looking into<br>> heaven? This Jesus, who was taken up from you into heaven, will come<br>> in the same way as you saw him go into heaven."*<br>><br>> *Then they returned to Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which<br>> is near Jerusalem, a Sabbath day's journey away. \-- Acts 1:9-12 ESV*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
