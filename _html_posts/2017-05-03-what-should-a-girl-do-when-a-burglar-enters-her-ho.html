<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>As most of the answerers have alluded to, the answer depends greatly on<br>where you are located. Because I am located in the US, I will base my<br>answer on their laws (generally), but your situation may be different<br>where you live, as well as different laws between states in the US, so<br>be very careful and make sure you know the law beforehand.<br><br>Let's start with what to do *before* a burglar enters your home. There's<br>an old story told about two hunters in Africa who stumble upon a den of<br>sleeping lions. As the lions begin to stir and eye their unfortunate<br>meal, one of the hunters kneels down, removes his backpack, and extracts<br>a pair of running shoes. The second hunter looks at him incredulously<br>and says, "What are you, crazy? You can't outrun a lion!" The first<br>hunter replies, "Oh, I don't have to outrun a lion. I just have to<br>outrun *you*." Now, I bet you're wondering what this has to do with home<br>security. The answer is this: You don't have to make your home a<br>fortress. You only need to make your home *less* appealing to the<br>burglar than your neighbor's home.<br><br>So how do you do that?<br><br>1.  Lights. Make sure your home is well lit on the outside. This<br>    used to be a fairly expensive proposition, especially the cost of<br>    running all those light bulbs all night. But with the advent of CFL<br>    and LED light bulbs, you can run many bulbs outside all night for<br>    nearly the cost of running a single 40-watt bulb. Setting your<br>    lights on a timer is a "set-it-and-forget-it" way to make sure your<br>    home is secure. You can also purchase lights which have ambient<br>    light sensors built in (they come on and dusk and turn off at dawn).<br>    Either way, burglars want to operate in the dark. Don't give them<br>    dark to work with.<br>2.  Shrubbery. Along with the dark, burglars like to be concealed<br>    while they break into your house. If there are large shrubs or<br>    ground cover which provides cover for a burglar to work in, clear it<br>    out. You don't want to give a burglar the means to work on opening a<br>    window while not being seen from the sidewalk.<br>3.  Get a dog. My Golden is the sweetest girl in the world. If you<br>    come in the house, she will lick your face to say hello and take you<br>    on a tour of all of her favorite toys. But if you're outside and you<br>    make even the slightest noise, it will sound like there's an angry<br>    horde of zombies outside and she's trying to wake up some very heavy<br>    sleepers. The point is that *if you're outside, you can't tell that<br>    she's a nice dog*. All you hear is the extremely vicious sounding<br>    barking. If you don't want to incur the expense of all the dog food,<br>    there are some pretty realistic dog barking simulators you can pick<br>    up on Amazon which are sound-activated.<br>4.  While you're at it, create a safe room. A safe room is a small<br>    room (generally a closet, but can be any small room with limited<br>    access) in which you should pre-stage a cell phone (it doesn't need<br>    a service plan to call 911) and a charger, and some form of weapon<br>    (a baseball bat, a throwing weapon, or if you are so inclined and<br>    are legally able, a gun safe, preferably with a gun in it). Ideally,<br>    you should replace the door to this room with a solid-core door<br>    (most interior doors in US homes are hollow-core) on which you can<br>    put a deadbolt lock. But even if you can't replace the door, just<br>    having a locking door is a good start.<br><br>Now, we can move on to what to do if a burglar *enters* your home. Most<br>states in the United States have a very strong "Castle Doctrine." The<br>Castle Doctrine stems from the old phrase, "A man's home is his castle."<br>This means that you should feel completely safe inside your home, and no<br>one should be able to threaten that safety. Castle Doctrine laws codify<br>the fact that you can defend yourself inside your home if an intruder<br>enters. You may not live in such a state. Some states require you to<br>attempt to retreat (called "duty to retreat" states). You should<br>investigate your state's laws regarding self-defense inside your home.<br><br>If you hear a burglar enter your home, get to your safe room. Get<br>inside, lock the door, and call 911. If you have a weapon in the room,<br>equip it. Be ready to use it in case the person on the other side of the<br>door is not a police officer. Stay on the phone with 911 until the<br>police arrive.<br><br>If the burglar enters your safe room, use your weapon. The only reason<br>they would be trying to get in there is to do you harm. Attack them, and<br>when they are incapacitated, *run*. Get out of the house and get<br>away. The house and the stuff are not more important than your life.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
