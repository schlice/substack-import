Officers are<br>more likely to take the registration of the vehicle and break off the<br>chase and find the car later using good old fashioned police work.<br>Chases have to be authorized by the patrol sergeant, and increasingly,<br>officers are told to break off, in the interest of public<br>safety.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
