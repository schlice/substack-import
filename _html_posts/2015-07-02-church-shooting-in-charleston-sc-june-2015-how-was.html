<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [As most everyone else said, the local arrest records<br>showed that Roof had a misdemeanor drug charge, not a felony. He was<br>still legally allowed to purchase a firearm. He was arrested in a mall<br>in South Carolina for being in possession of Suboxone, which is a drug<br>for heroin addiction treatment. He was under indictment for that charge<br>at the time. However, that drug charge was a misdemeanor, not a felony,<br>and would not have prevented Roof from purchasing a gun under Federal<br>law.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
