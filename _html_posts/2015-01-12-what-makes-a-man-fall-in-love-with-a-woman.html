<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Men are primarily visual creatures. Attraction, then,<br>starts with the eyes. Men look for what they perceive as beauty. Much of<br>what men perceive as beauty is based on societal norms, but part of that<br>perception is self-derived, and is based on many factors (the<br>environment in which they were raised, their ability to overcome<br>societal prejudices, etc). It is different for each man, which is the<br>source of the expression \"beauty is in the eye of the beholder.\"\<br>\<br>Once they have selected using the visual criteria, they move on to the<br>intellectual/emotional criteria (does she have similar interests to me,<br>does she pique my curiosity, do I want to get to know her better, is she<br>exciting, does she seem interested in me, etc).\<br>\<br>The more of these criteria that match what a man is looking for, the<br>quicker the man starts to fall in love.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
