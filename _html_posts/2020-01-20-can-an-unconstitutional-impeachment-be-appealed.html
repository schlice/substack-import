<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Can an unconstitutional impeachment be appealed?<br><br>Appealed to *whom*?<br><br>In other words, what is the organization that is above the Congress<br>which oversees impeachments?<br><br>The Constitution says that the House has the *sole* authority to<br>impeach, and the Senate has the *sole* authority to remove from office.<br>This means that *there is no one else*.<br><br>Are you thinking maybe the Supreme Court? The court deals with *law*,<br>and this is a matter of *politics*. The court does not handle matters of<br>politics. Remember that impeachments are matters of politics.<br><br>Are you listening to Trump's legal team who claims that the impeachment<br>is "unconstitutional?" They're discussing the theory behind the phrase<br>"high crimes and misdemeanors," and they are claiming that Trump's<br>actions do not rise to that standard. They're calling the bending of the<br>original meaning of "high crimes and misdemeanors" a "dangerous<br>perversion of the Constitution." This may or may not be true, but the<br>truth is that, regardless of what any legal scholar will tell you, high<br>crimes and misdemeanors are anything that a majority of the House says<br>they are, since there is no legal definition for what constitutes "high<br>crimes and misdemeanors." The House has voted and said that Trump's<br>actions *did* rise to the standard of high crimes and misdemeanors, and<br>now it's up to the Senate to determine if the standard set by the House<br>is enough to remove the President from office.<br><br>So even if you could claim that Trump's actions didn't actually rise to<br>the standard of "high crimes and misdemeanors" as the House said they<br>did, what do you do? Your only option is to amend the Constitution and<br>make it more clear what actually constitutes high crimes and<br>misdemeanors for future presidents.<br><br>So can an unconstitutional impeachment be appealed? No, because as long<br>as the Constitutional process is followed, there is no such thing as an<br>"unconstitutional" impeachment, and there's no one to whom you can<br>appeal. The House followed its own rules and its Constitutional dictates<br>and passed Articles of Impeachment. Period. End of story. That makes it<br>Constitutional.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
