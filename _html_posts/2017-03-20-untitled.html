<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>So you're claiming that "defects" in the round or the gunpowder can<br>cause them to spontaneously combust without being acted upon by any<br>outside influence? The chances of this are so infinitesimally small as<br>to be functionally non-existent. Modern smokeless powder is<br>"shelf-stable," meaning that unless acted on by outside forces<br>(temperature, external combustion, electrical charge, etc), it does not<br>combust. I don't think it's that far outside of the realm of reality to<br>say that because the odds of smokeless powder spontaneously combusting<br>are so low, that we can effectively call it non-existent.<br><br>That said, remember the scope of the question, which was worded to avoid<br>the slippery slopes about which you are referring:<br><br>> *Can a gun go off by itself?*<br>><br>> *In normal conditions, without being dropped, heated up, shaken,<br>> having design issues, or having their state altered in any other way<br>> can they go off without anyone touching the trigger?*<br><br>So we have specifically excluded design issues with smokeless powder in<br>this discussion. What we are referring to are the ways in which a gun<br>could fire a bullet without an operator touching the trigger, and<br>without being mishandled or altered.<br><br>I think unless you pose a new question, we should limit our commentary<br>to that specific question only. Thank you.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/Can-a-gun-go-off-by-itself-In-normal-conditions-without-being-dropped-heated-up-shaken-having-design-issues-or-having-its-state-altered-in-any-other-way-can-it-go-off-without-anyone-touching-the-trigger/answer/Bill-Stein<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
