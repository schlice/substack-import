<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**For the most part, are immigrants and refugees in the US contributing<br>members of society?**<br><br>You must be very careful when wording your questions. There is a<br>qualifier you forgot to add, and it's important because that qualifier<br>has been conflated with the word you used.<br><br>The question I will answer is:<br><br>For the most part, are *legal* **immigrants and refugees in the<br>US contributing members of society?**<br><br>The answer to this question is a resounding yes.<br><br>One of the best judges of societal contribution is reliance on state aid<br>(i.e. welfare programs like food, housing, and medical assistance). For<br>the most part, legal immigrants do not require large amounts of state<br>aid, while initially, most refugees do. However, those refugees by and<br>large become self-sufficient with time.<br><br>Secondly, legal immigrants, and for the most part, refugees, come to<br>this country in order to *make* a better life for themselves. They learn<br>the language. They start businesses. They send their kids to school.<br>They pay taxes. In short, they believe in the old ideal of the American<br>dream, and they also believe that you can make your own American dream<br>with hard work and determination. They want little to nothing handed to<br>them. They want to earn it themselves.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
