<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What gives the US the authority to attack Syria for using chemical<br>weapons when the US has used chemical weapons in the past?**<br><br>Article II, Section 2 of the US Constitution.<br><br>This is the "Commander in Chief" clause. It states that \"\t\he<br>President shall be Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United<br>States." It does not say that you can only strike a nation if you have<br>never done the same thing in the past.<br><br>Current understanding of the relationship between the Commander in Chief<br>clause and Congress' ability to fund and declare war is that the<br>President has "first strike" authority, but Congress must authorize<br>continued military operations. Indeed, the War Powers Act confirms this<br>understanding.<br><br>It sounds like you are probably asking about "moral authority" instead<br>of "legal authority," however. Morally, the United States has not used<br>chemical weapons since the Chemical Weapons Convention banned them for<br>all UN member nations. The US has every right to enforce the Chemical<br>Weapons Convention.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
