<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>> ***As there is a clear correlation between gun owners and deaths<br>> related to guns in America.***<br><br>Your question is based on inaccurate information. There is no clear<br>correlation between gun ownership and gun-related death. In fact,<br>exactly the opposite exists: there is an inverse relationship between<br>gun ownership and gun deaths.<br><br>It is an inverse relationship simply because there is no correlation<br>between lawful gun ownership and crime. None. Whatsoever. There<br>is no causal link between the number of firearms laws, the number of<br>firearms owned, the number of licensed concealed carriers, or any other<br>number related to lawful gun ownership, and crime.<br><br>Why?<br><br>Because lawful gun owners don't commit crimes with their guns.<br><br>If you have some evidence (not fake news stories) to prove your point,<br>please present it.<br><br>> *What do you (Americans) think of abolishing the 2nd amendment?*<br><br>There is no political will to do so. There is no political will to do so<br>because Americans aren't about to dismantle our rights, rights that tens<br>of millions of Americans enjoy without committing any crimes whatsoever,<br>because of a few wing nuts going all nutty.<br><br>[[Bill Stein\'s answer to Why has there been no press about some group<br>starting a drive for a US constitutional Amendment to limit the right to<br>bear arms?
