<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>If the animal truly is a service animal, the answer is no. The Fair<br>Housing Act prevents landlords from discriminating against tenants with<br>service animals. Service animals are either dogs or miniature horses.<br><br>Of course, in the common day, people equate "service animal" with<br>"emotional support animal" and they are not the same thing. While<br>"service animals" are dogs or miniature horses, "emotional support<br>animals" can be any breed or type of animal. While landlords generally<br>cannot deny someone specifically because they have an ESA, the rules are<br>slightly different. You can only keep an ESA if you have a doctor's<br>prescription for one, and you can only get a doctor's prescription if<br>you have a diagnosed emotional or mental health disorder. Here in NC, we<br>call that prescription an ESA letter.<br><br>Here, an individual must be diagnosed with an emotional or mental health<br>disorder by a licensed mental health professional (LMHP) to qualify for<br>an ESA letter. Landlords can deny an ESA if the ESA letter is<br>illegitimate or invalid. This includes letters from fake or counterfeit<br>online businesses, letters from unlicensed healthcare providers, or<br>forged letters. They can also deny an ESA if the animal is going to be a<br>nuisance or would create an undue burden on the facility or the other<br>tenants (think an emotional support llama or an emotional support pig).<br>It can also be denied if the ESA will require fundamental alterations to<br>the service provided.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
