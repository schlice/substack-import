<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Can Democratic senators get themselves infected with Covid-19 so that<br>they can enter quarantine and thus delay the vote to confirm a Supreme<br>Court justice?**<br><br>Nope. Nothing requires 100% attendance before a vote is taken.<br><br>The rule about which we are talking is regarding *quorum*. What<br>constitutes a quorum of Senators? How do we know we have one?<br><br>The Constitution states that "a Majority of each \House\ shall<br>constitute a quorum to do business\.... " That means that in order to<br>have a quorum, we have to have 51 Senators present out of 100 to cast<br>votes.<br><br>But how do we know we have a quorum, and when do we count? [[Senate<br>rules](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=5c1415&url=https://www.senate.gov/CRSpubs/577d2a5e-2b47-4045-95fa-a76398e41461.pdf){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="senate.gov"}]{.qlink_container} are actually very clear on<br>this topic. They state: "\T\he Senate presumes that it is complying<br>with the Constitution. Therefore, it presumes that a quorum always is<br>present unless and until the absence of a quorum is suggested or<br>demonstrated." So unless a Senator "suggests the absence of a quorum,"<br>the Senate presumes it has one. If a Senator makes such a suggestion<br>(which can be done so long as no other Senator has the floor), the<br>presiding officer can direct the clerk to call the roll. Once the clerk<br>calls the first name, the calling of the roll does not stop until either<br>quorum is determined, or "unless the Senate agrees by unanimous consent<br>to 'dispense with further proceedings under the quorum call.' While the<br>quorum call is in progress, no debate or motion is in order, nor may the<br>Senate act on any unanimous consent request except a request to dispense<br>with the call."<br><br>So sometimes, the suggestion of absence of quorum is used as a "brief<br>delay tactic" so that Senators may discuss a policy disagreement or a<br>procedural question, not necessarily because they believe that there are<br>fewer than 51 Senators present.<br><br>**TL;DR: You don't need 100 Senators to conduct business. The Senate has<br>a quorum of Senators when 51 are present to vote.**<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
