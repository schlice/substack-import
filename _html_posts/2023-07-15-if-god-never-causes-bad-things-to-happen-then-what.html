<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>So to you, punishing bad behavior is "causing bad things to happen?"<br><br>I think the "bad thing that happened" was Adam and Eve disobeying God.<br>God expelling them from the Garden of Eden, to live and die in the new<br>sin-filled world they brought about, is a natural consequence of what<br>they brought on themselves through their own actions.<br><br>God simply cannot abide sin, so when Adam and Eve sinned, God expelled<br>them from the Garden. This is an EFFECT, not a CAUSE.<br><br>God didn't cause that to happen. It's the effect of their bad actions.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
