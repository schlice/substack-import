<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Ha, here I am! Look, I'm no spring chicken (I have a few years on you),<br>but I'm not in the age range that I should be spending time in the<br>incontinence section of Walgreen's.<br><br>You should know that in MS, bowel and bladder issues are one of the most<br>common symptoms reported. According to our friends over at NMSS:<br><br>> Bladder dysfunction, which occurs in at least 80 percent of people<br>> with MS, happens when MS lesions block or delay transmission of nerve<br>> signals in areas of the central nervous system (CNS) that control the<br>> bladder and urinary sphincters. A spastic (overactive) bladder that is<br>> unable to hold the normal amount of urine, or a bladder that does not<br>> empty properly (retains some urine in it) can cause symptoms<br>> including:<br>><br>> - Frequency and/or urgency of urination<br>> - Hesitancy in starting urination<br>> - Frequent nighttime urination (nocturia)<br>> - Incontinence (the inability to hold in urine)<br>> - Inability to empty the bladder completely<br><br>So it's never our place here in the MS Forum to diagnose or attempt to<br>treat any disease or condition; we're not doctors. But I can tell you<br>what I've done that works for me. Remember, your mileage may vary, never<br>start, stop, or change treatments without first talking to your doctor,<br>etc.<br><br>I started treatment with a urologist, and the first step is medication,<br>before we go to more invasive procedures. I began with the<br>*under-active* bladder that I couldn't empty. It caused secondary<br>symptoms like swelling in the prostate. The signals simply weren't<br>making it strong enough to the bladder. So I started on a low, daily<br>dose of Tamsulosin (Flomax). (And btw, does anyone remember the<br>cringe-worthy advertisements for Flomax when it was still name-brand<br>only? oof!) That worked great...until it didn't. I then started swinging<br>the other way (the overactive bladder). I was getting daytime leakage,<br>inability to hold urine, frequency/urgency, etc. My problem, though, is<br>that every urgency control medicine had some sort of really severe<br>reaction with what I was already taking, but round about that time, a<br>new drug, Gemtesa, was released specifically to treat overactive bladder<br>(OAB) but while avoiding those serious side-effects. So after fighting<br>with insurance, I was able to get a prescription for Gemtesa. Those two<br>drugs, taken in combination, seem to do the trick for me. For now.<br><br>I still wear pads. I wear the stick-on pads in my underwear when I go<br>out (mostly me being neurotic, but it's cheap insurance). But otherwise,<br>the drugs keep me well controlled for now.<br><br>There are other, more aggressive treatments available. You should start<br>with your neurologist and confirm that your symptoms are MS-related, and<br>then get a referral to a urologist to help you design some treatment<br>plans for you.<br><br>The good news is that OAB is more common than in just MS patients, so<br>there are a myriad of treatment options available. We can use most of<br>those treatments pretty successfully.<br><br>Just know going into it that it's going to feel really weird when you go<br>to your urologist and the waiting room is filled with octogenarians and<br>walkers, and it smells like a day care...<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Is there anyone else who deals with bedwetting, bladder, or bowel<br>incontinence? Im feel like the only one, as Im only 29. I have had to<br>wear diapers and pull-ups for it, and use bathroom reminders my whole<br>life due to brain and spine issues.<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*This answer is not professional medical advice**, nor is it a<br>substitute for professional medical advice.
