<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Sean Hannity says both \"I never retained him in the traditional sense<br>as retaining a lawyer\" and \"I assume that those conversations were<br>attorney-client confidential.\" Is he confused about what \"client\"<br>means?**<br><br>Actually, I think it is you who is confused.<br><br>Attorney-client privilege is a rule that protects confidential<br>communications between a lawyer and a client. According to<br>[Nolo.com(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=e77f99&url=https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/attorney-client-privilege.html){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="nolo.com"}]{.qlink_container}, the attorney-client privilege<br>applies when:<br><br>- an actual or potential client communicates with a lawyer regarding<br>  legal advice<br>- the lawyer is acting in a professional capacity (rather than, for<br>  example, as a friend), and<br>- the client intended the communications to be private and acted<br>  accordingly.\[1\](#EyKSs){#cite-EyKSs .citation_link}<br><br>So the "attorney-client privilege" Hannity is speaking of has to do with<br>the fact that he spoke to Cohen not as a friend, but in asking him legal<br>advice. Hannity has stated that he never retained Cohen as an attorney,<br>and that he has never received an invoice from Cohen for services.<br>According to the definition of attorney-client privilege, retaining the<br>services of an attorney is clearly not required before attorney-client<br>privilege may attach to conversations. Note that the privilege can<br>attach when a "potential client" communicates with a lawyer regarding<br>legal advice. If the attorney records details about that conversation,<br>they are indeed protected by attorney-client privilege.<br><br>\<br><br>*As always, IANAL, this is not legal advice, and answers to law related<br>questions on Quora are for GENERAL INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. Do not<br>take legal action based on anything you have read here. If you have a<br>personal legal question, ask a lawyer in your area.*<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-EyKSs){.citation_index} [[The Attorney-Client<br>Privilege](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=e77f99&url=https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/attorney-client-privilege.html){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="nolo.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
