<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Why should any free man or woman be bound by laws that were passed<br>before they were born? They neither elected the officials nor voted on<br>any proposition related to those laws.**<br><br>Your parents are in charge of you up until the moment you reach the age<br>of majority. This means that your parents make decisions on your behalf,<br>including voting for government representatives who will structure the<br>law in a manner and application with which they approve.<br><br>You are therefore subject to that law because your parents participated<br>in its implementation (and by the way, choosing not to vote is also a<br>conscious decision to abdicate that responsibility to others'<br>viewpoints). You are subject to the law because your parents were<br>subject to the law, and actively participated in shaping it over the<br>years.<br><br>When you come of age, you have the newfound authority to vote for<br>representatives who will respect *your* viewpoints, and you have the<br>ability to re-shape the law if you choose.<br><br>The date of passage is irrelevant. The fact that you participate in<br>government (or that your parents did) is an implicit validation of the<br>legal authority of government, and an explicit affirmation of the social<br>contract.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
