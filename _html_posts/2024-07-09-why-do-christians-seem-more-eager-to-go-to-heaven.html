<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>False dilemma fallacy.<br><br>Your question phrases it as *either* we angle towards Heaven,<br>*or* we focus on improving life on Earth.<br><br>¿Por qué no los dos?<br><br>It's not *either/or*. It's *both/and*. Christians are *both* angling<br>towards Heaven *and* focusing on improving life on Earth. It<br>certainly doesn't have to be one or the other.<br><br>And actually, if you can properly prepare to go to heaven by being a<br>witness for Christ and by leading others to salvation, it will<br>automatically make their lives better. So actually, doing the more<br>important one secondarily causes the less important one to happen all on<br>its own.<br><br>Which would make sense given what you're describing: it appears that<br>Christians are more worried about eternity than the present. If you give<br>your life to Christ, your present circumstances will be easier to deal<br>with because you'll have a whole new perspective. If you don't follow<br>Christ, then nothing appears to get better here. This is probably why<br>there is an appearance that Christians care less about this life than<br>the next.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
