<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [You are falling into the trap that the media is<br>perpetuating: the police need to be feared because they look fearsome.\<br>\<br>First, to answer your question, the Posse Comitatus Act prevents the<br>U.S. government from using the military against the population. Just<br>because the police have to become increasingly \"militarized\" in order<br>to protect themselves against growing threats does not make them \"the<br>military.\" They still work for the Chief of Police, the Sheriff, or the<br>Governor. While part of the Executive branch of government, they all<br>ultimately work for the President, but only the military works for the<br>Commander-in-Chief. See the difference? So you\'ll never see the US Army<br>write you a speeding ticket. But some fancy bulletproof uniforms and<br>vehicles do not make the police into the military, and thus unable to do<br>their jobs under Posse Comitatus.\<br>\<br>Now, on to the meat of what you\'re getting at. The police have become<br>more militarized over the last 50 years. But that\'s not because of some<br>national conspiracy to make the police into some state military. It\'s<br>in response to the growing threats against the police. The past few<br>months have only proven that those threats are real, and only need a<br>push to set some people off.\<br>\<br>Times are tough for cops right now. It\'s up to all of us to counter<br>these threats with reason and logic and compassion, not<br>threats and fear.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
