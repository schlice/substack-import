<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The new law (HB 1203) appears to be written towards only homeowner's<br>associations. We will have to see when the law is signed where it ends<br>up in Florida Statutes. I suspect it will become part of 720, which is<br>the section of law regarding homeowner's associations.<br><br>To that end, here's what the new bill will do:<br><br>> The bill relates to the governance of homeowners' associations and the<br>> practice of the community association managers who manage those<br>> communities.<br>><br>> *Community Association Managers*<br>><br>> Regarding community association managers (CAMs) and CAM firms, the<br>> bill requires CAMs and CAM firms to:<br>><br>> - Annually attend at least one member meeting or board meeting of the<br>>   association;<br>> - Provide to community association members certain information,<br>>   including the contact person, contact information, and the hours of<br>>   availability;<br>> - Provide the community's members upon request a copy of the contract<br>>   between the association and the CAM or CAM firm;<br>> - Annualy complete at least 10 hours of continuing education; and<br>> - Biennially complete at least five hours of continuing education that<br>>   pertains to homeowners' associations, three hours of which must<br>>   relate to recordkeeping.<br>><br>> *Official Records*<br>><br>> The bill requires homeowners' associations to:<br>><br>> - Effective January 1, 2026, associations with 100 or more parcels,<br>>   maintain a digital copy of specified official records for download<br>>   on the association's website or through an application on a mobile<br>>   device.<br>> - Provide a copy of records or otherwise make the records available<br>>   that are subpoenaed by a law enforcement agency within five days of<br>>   receiving a subpoena.<br>> - Maintain official records for at least seven years, unless the<br>>   governing documents of the association require a longer period of<br>>   time.<br>><br>> *Criminal Violations*<br>><br>> The bill provides the following criminal penalties related to<br>> homeowners' associations:<br>><br>> - Second degree misdemeanor for any director or member of the board or<br>>   association to knowingly, willfully, and repeatedly violate (two or<br>>   more violations within a 12-month period) any specified requirements<br>>   relating to inspection and copying of official records of an<br>>   association with the intent of causing harm to the association or<br>>   one or more of its members;<br>> - First degree misdemeanor for knowingly and intentionally defacing or<br>>   destroying required accounting records, or knowingly and<br>>   intentionally failing to create or maintain required accounting<br>>   records, with the intent of causing harm to the association or one<br>>   or more of its members;<br>> - Third degree felony to willfully and knowingly refuse to release or<br>>   otherwise produce association records, with the intent to avoid or<br>>   escape detection, arrest, trial, or punishment for the commission of<br>>   a crime, or to assist another person with such avoidance or escape;<br>>   and<br>> - Third degree felony for an officer, director, or manager of a<br>>   condominium association to knowingly solicit, offer to accept, or<br>>   accept a kickback.<br>><br>> The bill also expands the current criminal prohibitions against<br>> fraudulent voting activity to provide it is a first degree misdemeanor<br>> for:<br>><br>> - Knowingly aiding, abetting, or advising a person in the commission<br>>   of a fraudulent voting activity related to association elections.<br>> - Agreeing, conspiring, combining, or confederating with at least one<br>>   other person to commit a fraudulent voting activity related to<br>>   association elections.<br>> - Having knowledge of a fraudulent voting activity related to<br>>   association elections and giving any aid to the offender with intent<br>>   that the offender avoid or escape detection, arrest, trial, or<br>>   punishment.<br>><br>> Any officer or director charged with a criminal violation under ch.<br>> 720, F.S., must be removed from office and a vacancy declared.<br>><br>> *Assisting Law Enforcement*<br>><br>> The bill requires associations, if subpoenaed, to provide a copy of<br>> the requested records within five business days of receiving the<br>> subpoena and to assist law enforcement in any investigation to the<br>> extent permissible by law.<br>><br>> *Financial Reporting*<br>><br>> The bill:<br>><br>> - Requires associations with 1,000 or more parcels to have audited<br>>   financial statements; and<br>> - Prohibits associations from reducing the required type of financial<br>>   statement (compiled, reviewed, or audited financial statements) for<br>>   consecutive years.<br>><br>> *Requirement to Provide Accounting*<br>><br>> The bill allows association parcel owners to make a written request<br>> for a detailed accounting of any amounts owed to the association.
