<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>> Why has the US Constitution been amended only 27 times?<br><br>Because it's hard. Not *impossible* (it has been amended 27 times, after<br>all), just *hard*.<br><br>The Framers wanted to make the Constitution *difficult, but not<br>impossible*, to amend. They did this because they did not want the<br>Constitution to just change willy-nilly with every passing generation.<br>They didn't want it to shift with the winds. They wanted it to have some<br>permanence. They wanted it to be a strong foundation upon which states<br>could build laws.<br><br>> **Why didn't politicians decide add some common sense rights into the<br>> constitution?**<br><br>Because you can't "add rights" that don't exist already. Here's the part<br>that most people find really difficult to understand: *the Constitution<br>doesn't grant rights.* The Constitution recognizes rights *which already<br>exist*, and prevents government from limiting those rights. That's a<br>tough concept to wrap your brain around. It's the difference between<br>*positive rights* and *negative rights*.<br><br>A positive right is one which someone must do something in order for<br>you to have the right. So if you had the *right* to healthcare (not a<br>healthcare *entitlement*, but the actual *right* to healthcare), someone<br>else *must* work to provide your right. They have no choice. For<br>example, doctors could not go on strike, because doing so would violate<br>your right to healthcare. You could go to the courts and demand they go<br>back to work, and they would have to. Your rights are *inviolate:* they<br>cannot be violated. This is just one of many reasons why in the United<br>States you do not have a right to healthcare. There are many healthcare<br>entitlements in the States, but you do not have a right to the fruits of<br>someone else's labor. You can engage in a mutual business arrangement<br>where you receive a service and they receive money, but that's not a<br>right. That's an entitlement program.<br><br>A negative right says that the government can make any rule they<br>want, except for making any rules about X. So for example, you have the<br>right to speak out against the government. The government can make any<br>other law they want about speech, so long as they don't make a law which<br>limits your ability to speak out against the government (note that I'm<br>only referring to the 1A clause about redress, there are indeed other<br>free speech rights as well). They do limit speech; they can limit the<br>time, place, and manner of your speech. They can make you get a permit<br>to speak in public if your speech will be disruptive. So for example, if<br>you want to protest by marching down a city street, you can, but you<br>must get a permit so the city can close roads and route traffic around<br>the protest, plan for extra law enforcement, plan around city services,<br>etc. In other words, the city must ensure that no one else's rights are<br>limited by you exercising *your* right.<br><br>The Bill of Rights (the first ten amendments to the Constitution) is a<br>series of negative rights, things the government cannot infringe on. The<br>Bill of Rights has a whole litany of "common sense rights" in it, such<br>as the right to free speech, the right to a free press, the right to<br>practice whatever religion you want, or no religion at all, the right to<br>keep and bear arms, the right to not have military soldiers quartered in<br>your home, the right to not be unreasonably searched and to not have<br>your property seized, the right to not incriminate yourself as part of<br>criminal proceedings, and so on.<br><br>These are common sense rights, and what makes them common sense is the<br>fact that *we have these rights without the Constitution*. The Bill of<br>Rights simply guarantees that the government cannot infringe on these<br>rights.<br><br>Finally, there is an amendment which states that *this isn't the limit<br>of rights you have*. Any other rights which weren't listed are reserved<br>to the states, and the people respectively. See? All rights are retained<br>by the people.<br><br>That's pretty common sense, in my book.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
