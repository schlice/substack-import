<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Usually, the CC&R must follow Federal and state law when it comes to<br>housing.<br><br>Most "limitations" that an HOA could place in its CC&Rs run afoul of the<br>Fair Housing Act, which prohibits discrimination based on "familial<br>status." This status is limited to families with minor children. A<br>numerical occupancy limitation, the effect of which would prohibit a<br>husband and wife with three children from residing in a two bedroom<br>home, would therefore violate the Fair Housing Act, and constitute<br>discrimination based on familial status. However, it does not implicate<br>"family" relations of individuals who are 18 or older, as is the case in<br>age-qualified communities.<br><br>That said, the Act doesn't really go into detail about how many people<br>comprise a "single family" when they reside in "single family housing."<br><br>If an HOA is going to have numerical limits in its CC&Rs, they must do<br>so carefully to avoid butting up against Federal housing law.<br><br>If your Association has a numerical limit you think violates Federal<br>law, consult with a real estate attorney who specializes in HOA law.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
