<br/><br/>Answer<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content: [\"White vision\" can mean a number of things. If you\'ve<br/>already had optic neuritis, \"white vision\" could be the vision signals<br/>being disrupted as you \"heat up\" during your walk. The same could be<br/>true of your dizziness. As your body heats up during your walk, your<br/>symptoms could be temporarily getting worse. If they get better after<br/>your walk, this could match what you are seeing. My optic neuritis tends<br/>to flare like this, but only when I\'m running; it doesn\'t do it when<br/>I\'m walking, not even when I hike. Try to make sure you\'re staying<br/>cool during your walk. Use a neck cooler or a body cooler when you walk;<br/>there are many available to choose from. I can provide some links if<br/>you\'re interested.\<br/>\<br/>It could also simply be dehydration \-- make sure you drink plenty of<br/>water before, during, and after your walk. I have to use a hydration<br/>pack (I carry a pack when I hike anyway) in order to stay adequately<br/>hydrated. Not to mention I live in Colorado which is super-dry, so<br/>adequate hydration is an issue for us MSers in dry climates.\<br/>\<br/>Hope this helps.]<br/><br/>*Disclaimer:*<br/><br/>*This answer is not professional medical advice**, nor is it a<br/>substitute for professional medical advice.
