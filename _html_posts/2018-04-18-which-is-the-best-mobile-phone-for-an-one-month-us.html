<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Which is the best mobile phone for an one-month use for a salesman and<br>sell it afterwards? (I need high quality camera and high battery<br>capacity)**<br><br>*(In case you're wondering, any time you ask a "which is the best"<br>question, it's all opinion. I'm trying to base my answer on independent<br>reviews from around the Internet, but in the end, it's still just<br>opinion. Your mileage may vary)*<br><br>In the United States mobile market, you're not really going to find an<br>amazing phone with a fantastic camera and amazing battery life.<br>You're either going to get incredible battery capacity and a mediocre<br>camera, or one of the best cameras on the market and so-so battery.<br><br>I would suggest going for the latter. And if that's the case, you want<br>the Pixel 2 from Google.<br><br>While it does not possess the best *physical* camera hardware available<br>in a mobile phone today (right now, that goes to either the iPhone X or<br>the Galaxy S9+), the software which runs the Pixel's camera produces the<br>best quality photos, every time, in every environment, hands down.<br>You simply cannot take a bad photo with that phone. There's one of two<br>reasons you buy a Pixel 2: you're a hardcore Android fanboy, or you want<br>the best camera experience in town. There's no two ways about it. If you<br>want the camera which will take the best pictures every time, you get a<br>Pixel 2.<br><br>Plus, since carriers don't directly sell them, you can get it from<br>Google and the resale market is really solid.<br><br>On the downside, battery life is so-so. But you can get external<br>batteries and battery cases of all kinds. You can't really get good<br>external cameras. So the trade off is not that bad in my book.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
