<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>> *In regards to Trump\'s tweets about banning the trans community from<br>> serving, would that violate the 14th Amendment?*<br>><br>> *Also, is Trump just trying to create more chaos to distract from the<br>> Russian investigation?*<br><br>No, and no.<br><br>The 14th Amendment prevents the government from applying laws in an<br>unequal way. It says nothing about how the federal government (and the<br>military) can spend its money. If the military chooses to not spend<br>\$3.7 billion over 10 years on gender reassignment surgery, hormone<br>therapy, and the cost of being a person down for a year while they<br>recover and go through their Real Life Experience therapy, they can make<br>that choice.<br><br>Also, since transgenderism is not a protected class under the Civil<br>Rights Act, the military (as an employer) can discriminate against<br>transgendered individuals if it can show clear reasons why doing so<br>furthers their mission, vision, and values.<br><br>As to Russia, the media has bought in to the whole Russia thing; they<br>have no choice but to ride that ship for all it's worth, and go down<br>with it if need be. They will play the Russia story daily to keep it<br>fresh in your minds. Despite the fact that there's nothing there of any<br>real substance. At. All. I mean, seriously. Don't you find it odd that<br>we switched from "interfering in the election" to "collusion" which<br>isn't even a thing? What does that even mean? Does that mean "supporting<br>a candidate?" The United States does that, and more, all the time, and<br>we have done it for many, many years. How then is Russia supporting<br>Trump (even if they did, which I doubt) any different? So every<br>political donor is "colluding" to get that candidate elected? Remember,<br>we've gone away from "interfering" and we're simply on to "colluding."<br>The circus continues...<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
