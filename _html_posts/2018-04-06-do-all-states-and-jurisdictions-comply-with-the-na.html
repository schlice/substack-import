<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Do all states and jurisdictions comply with the national instant<br>criminal background check system, (NICS) and if they don\'t should the<br>federal government refuse FFL licenses to gun shops in all of the non<br>compliant local and state jurisdictions?**<br><br>Yes, all Federal Firearms License (FFL)-licensed dealers use NICS, as<br>required by Federal law.<br><br>It is true that some FFL dealers do not do the requisite background<br>checks. The criminals know who these dealers are.<br><br>Ideally, the BATFE would thoroughly monitor every FFL and would revoke<br>their license if they violate the law. But BATFE doesn't have the<br>resources to thoroughly monitor every FFL, and in the cases where they<br>do find that a FFL has failed to follow the correct procedure, it is<br>very rare that they actually revoke a license. Don't forget that the<br>dealer himself has an appeals process he can follow, and he has a<br>business and a livelihood to maintain as well.<br><br>Nevertheless, BATFE could do more if they had more funding and more<br>investigators.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
