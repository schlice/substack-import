<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>If you, unthinking (like most teens I know), angrily type "kys" in a<br>chat, you're usually not seen as someone who is "encouraging others to<br>commit suicide." You're usually just seen as an angry little jerk.<br><br>But there have been some fairly high-profile cases in the United States<br>where people were encouraged to commit suicide, and then the victim<br>actually did, and the encourager was held criminally responsible for<br>that. Usually in those cases, the encouragement was continuous and<br>direct enough to be seen as coercing to someone in an emotionally<br>fragile state.<br><br>However, most states do not directly have any laws against encouraging<br>suicide. A small number of states have laws that specifically address<br>encouraging suicide: California, Minnesota, Oklahoma, and South Dakota.<br>However, Minnesota's law was ruled an unconstitutional infringement on<br>free speech, and California found that criminal liability for<br>"encouraging" suicide must include some act which is more direct than<br>just encouraging words.<br><br>However, once we move away from the criminal, someone successfully<br>encouraging another to commit suicide could appear to be culpable in a<br>wrongful death lawsuit, and could be responsible for financial damages.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Can I be arrested if I tell someone to commit suicide and they do it?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
