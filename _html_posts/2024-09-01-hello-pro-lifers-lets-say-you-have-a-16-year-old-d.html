<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>You asked what I believe, and I'm not sure that's really what you wanted<br>to hear, but here goes.<br><br>The answer to your question: no, I don't believe that a government<br>should decide if she is allowed to get an abortion. She should not be<br>allowed to get an abortion, period, and it should be beyond the reach of<br>government to authorize such a thing.<br><br>I don't believe a federal or state government has the right to take a<br>life without due process of law (it's in the Constitution, it's in the<br>5th and 14th Amendments). And unless there has been a trial and the baby<br>has been found guilty of a capital offense and has been given the death<br>penalty, we should not be permitted to take its life.<br><br>I teach my children to take responsibility for their actions. They are<br>well aware of the purpose of sex, and that is to create babies. Yes it's<br>fun, but it is fun *because* it encourages humans to do it more, in<br>order to...wait for it...make babies. Physiologically, it is fun so that<br>humans do it to make more humans. So yes, my 16-year-old daughter would<br>be homeschooled for a year (in the middle of high school) and would have<br>that baby and then likely give it up for adoption.<br><br>Look, I understand that abortion is a very volatile issue. And I<br>understand that women have bodily autonomy, and that this autonomy is<br>very important. But what we have with abortion, in my view, is a<br>*conflict of rights* issue, and it is a conflict between the right<br>of the woman to bodily autonomy and the right of the baby to live.<br><br>Scientifically, the baby is a living human. We know it is human because<br>it has two human parents and it produces human proteins (not frog or<br>carrot proteins). We know it is alive because it is growing and<br>consuming energy. **I believe that all living humans have the right to<br>live, and to not have their life unjustly taken from them.**<br><br>I can't think of a way to *consistently* define equal human rights that<br>excludes fetuses but also includes every kind of born person. I *also*<br>can't think of a *consistent* reason to allow someone's right to bodily<br>autonomy to trump someone else's right to live. And again, I do think<br>that women have bodily autonomy, and while I agree that the right to<br>bodily autonomy is important, I don't think that the right to bodily<br>autonomy gives anyone the right to kill another human. Take the case of<br>conjoined twins, where separating them means that only one will live.<br>Does the right to bodily autonomy of the one twin give them the right to<br>kill the other twin? Which twin's right to bodily autonomy trumps the<br>other twin's right to life?<br><br>Society has lots of conflicts of rights, and I do think that the woman's<br>right to bodily autonomy is valuable and important. But in this<br>particular case of this particular conflict of rights, I think the<br>baby's right to life outweighs the mother's right to bodily autonomy.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
