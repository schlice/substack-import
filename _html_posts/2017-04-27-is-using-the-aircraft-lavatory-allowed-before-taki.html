<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>> Question details:<br>><br>> Is there a regulation that allows or forbids a person to use lavatory<br>> before taking off?<br>><br>> Any safety consequences if someone uses it before taking off?<br><br>The question is not one of using or not using the lavatory. The lav is<br>completely functional and can be used at any time before, during, or<br>after the flight.<br><br>The question is whether or not you are obeying lighted signs, placards,<br>and crewmember instructions. I'm sure you've heard it a million times<br>during the briefing: US federal law requires compliance with lighted<br>signs (i.e. the seat belt sign), placards (i.e. non-lighted permanent<br>signs), and crewmember instructions.<br><br>If the seat belt sign is off and there is time, passengers may use the<br>lavatory before take-off.<br><br>However, once the seat belt sign is on, passengers are required to<br>remain in their seats with their seat belts securely fastened low and<br>tight across their laps. This is a critical portion of the flight,<br>during taxi and take off. The most jarring forces are sent into the<br>aircraft both during landing and during take-off.<br><br>Flight crews are not "flying stewards" or "flying stewardesses." They<br>are primarily there for your safety. The laws in place back them up.<br>It's critical that all passengers follow the instructions of the crew as<br>well as obeying the lighted signs. If you are up when the light comes<br>on, you are required to return to your seat. If you're in your seat when<br>the light comes on, you're required to stay there. Failing to do so is a<br>violation of federal law.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
