<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Before a President can be charged for a federal crime (let alone<br>sentenced), he has to be removed from office. Prosecuting a sitting<br>President is just a bad idea; it takes too much attention away from the<br>performance of his Constitutional duties.<br><br>So first, the President must be impeached (through Articles of<br>Impeachment passed by the House) and then tried in the Senate and "found<br>guilty" (even though it's not a legal process) and the Senate must vote<br>to remove him from office, at which point the Vice President becomes<br>President, and the President is no longer president.<br><br>Once that happens, a Federal prosecutor can file charges against the<br>former President, and with the cooperation of his Secret Service detail<br>(which he still has), he will be arrested, he will appear for<br>arraignment, and will likely be ROR (released on his own recognizance)<br>since his whereabouts are known 24/7, and he has a Secret Service<br>detail, which is now doing double duty protecting him and keeping tabs<br>on his location.<br><br>He will go to trial, and if he is convicted and sentenced to jail time,<br>he will be taken immediately from the courtroom and will be sent to a<br>Federal penitentiary to serve out his sentence. The ones where high<br>ranking government officials and celebrities are taken are actually more<br>lenient than most other prisons. They are colloquially called "Club<br>Fed," a play on [[Club<br>Med](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=95ea1c&url=https://www.clubmed.us/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="clubmed.us"}]{.qlink_container}, a longtime vacation resort.<br>While they're certainly not vacation hotspots, they are a little nicer<br>and a little less strict than prisons for violent felons.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
