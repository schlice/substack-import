<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**How does America reconcile "Give me your tired, your poor, your<br>huddled masses yearning to breathe free" with their treatment of<br>foreigners wanting to emigrate to that once great nation?**<br><br>Let's discuss the entire section of the poem you mentioned, shall we?<br><br>> *Give me your tired, your poor\<br>> Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,\<br>> The wretched refuse of your teeming shore\<br>> Send these, the homeless, tempest-tossed to me,\<br>> I lift my lamp beside the Golden Door.*<br>><br>> *- Excerpt from "The New Colossus" by Emma Lazarus, on the base of the<br>> Statue of Liberty*<br><br>Note the last line of the poem: "I lift my lamp beside the Golden Door."<br>Note the imagery there. The United States has a Golden Door. This<br>signifies two things:<br><br>1.  You can come in<br>2.  The door can close.<br><br>As a nation, we have a "door" because *we* get to control who comes in<br>and who does not. We are quite thrilled with foreigners who wish to<br>emigrate to this nation. We are, shall we say, slightly less thrilled<br>when foreigners attempt to *scale the wall* rather than enter through<br>the Golden Door.<br><br>If your *first act* as a member of a new society is to break that<br>society's laws, then it is questionable whether or not you wish to<br>follow *any* laws while a member of that society, and we are right to<br>question.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
