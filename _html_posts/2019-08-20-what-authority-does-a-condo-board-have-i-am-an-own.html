<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What authority does a condo Board have? I am an owner in a small condo<br>development in MA and the Board 'sold' our extra parking spaces to 2<br>owners using a Quit Claim. Is the Board allowed to do this?**<br><br>A quitcliam deed is the primary method by which property is transferred<br>in Massachusetts. Basically, it says that the property being transferred<br>has no other claim on it, and that the person accepting the property<br>places no other claims on it. That the property was transferred by<br>quitclaim deed is normal in Massachusetts.<br><br>The question is whether or not the Board has the authority to dispose of<br>community property.<br><br>There are two items which the Board must navigate: state law, and their<br>applicable Governing Documents.<br><br>Common areas and facilities are undivided (this means individual condo<br>owners do not have an *individual* ownership interest in them) and those<br>areas are managed by the Board. So long as the profits from any sale of<br>common areas are distributed to owners through an addition to the<br>operating fund, then as far as state law is concerned, the sale should<br>be legal.<br><br>In addition to prevailing state or local laws, a Board of Directors can<br>always only operate in accordance with its Governing Documents.<br>Disbursement of property must only take place in accordance with the<br>rules in that document. In nearly every case, the Board must get<br>approval from the members before they convey property. The Board, in<br>most cases, would have to arrange a vote of the membership before they<br>could go through the state process to transfer the land. But this<br>requirement may vary depending on what is stated in the relevant<br>Governing Documents.<br><br>If you are concerned that the sale may not have followed Massachusetts<br>condo law or any applicable Governing Documents, I suggest you and your<br>fellow condo owners who share your concern contact a real estate<br>attorney in your area.<br><br>\<br><br>*This answer is not a substitute for professional legal advice.
