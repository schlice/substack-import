<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Marijuana is still illegal under Federal law.\<br>\<br>Where people in Colorado (being one of those Coloradans myself) need to<br>be especially concerned is our various ski resorts, which are almost<br>universally located on National park land, not on state land. Therefore,<br>while legal in Colorado, marijuana is illegal on the slopes. Park<br>Rangers have been cracking down on marijuana at ski resorts, and have<br>already made record numbers of arrests for illegal drug use on the<br>slopes. Note that it is very clearly posted at the base camps and at the<br>lifts that marijuana is illegal on Federal land.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
