<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Nope. It's 100% against the law to be evil in Canada. There are no evil<br>people in Canada. They all moved to the United States decades ago.<br><br>Canada is a utopia of butterflies and rainbows where the unicorns poop<br>sunshine and it's never a sad day.<br><br>/s<br><br>\* For clarity, I love Canada, but there are evil people *everywhere.*<br>Canada is no exception. Because evil people are everywhere, and Canada<br>is a place where people can be, therefore evil people can be in Canada.<br><br>Logic.<br><br>Boom.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
