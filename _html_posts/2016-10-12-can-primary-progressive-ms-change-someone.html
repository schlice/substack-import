<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Considering the fact that your personality is, in part, made up of your<br>past experiences, and considering that MS causes memory and cognition<br>issues, it is conceivable that the disease itself can change your<br>personality, as it will change what you remember about yourself.<br><br>It's a challenge, and many patients with MS do change, not just because<br>of physical changes in the brain, but because of many factors, including<br>side effects from the MS medications, side effects from the medications<br>taken to control the side effects of the MS medications, and general<br>psychological changes related to having a lifelong chronic disease like<br>MS.<br><br>I know, because this happened to me. I may not be "critical, angry,<br>paranoid and cruel," but my personality has changed, and it is hard for<br>my loved ones to understand why or how.<br><br>I wish I could go back to being "who I was," for their sakes, but I'm<br>afraid I don't know who that was. I feel exactly the same, in my own<br>mind. Which, I guess, is the problem, isn't it? If I don't know I've<br>changed, and if I don't know how I've changed, it would be very hard for<br>me to change back. It would be like becoming someone new. For me, I feel<br>like it's hard enough being who I am, let alone trying to become someone<br>else so that I can be more like someone I used to be, when I don't feel<br>any different in the first place. Why can't they just accept that this<br>is who I am now? Why do they want to make me someone I'm not?<br><br>See the problem?<br><br>This disease wears you down. Physically, mentally, emotionally, in every<br>way possible. It doesn't kill you, but after 24 years of having to deal<br>with it, I could understand how it could so wear you down that you'd<br>want to be dead. Your family wants to help you, but in doing so they<br>make you feel more like a cripple, so you really just want them to stop<br>or leave, so you subconsciously try to force them away by being bitter.<br><br>This is where some therapy for both the patient and the caregiver can be<br>very helpful. The patients need to understand that the caregivers are<br>only trying to help, and the caregivers need to understand that too much<br>helping actually hurts.
