<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>A2A<br><br>There are two things that can help you: treatment and medication<br><br>I wholeheartedly recommend *both* of these options. Together. Not<br>alone.<br><br>The problem in the United States is, for the most part, that the people<br>who provide each one of those services are not one and the same.<br>Medication is provided by *psychiatrists,* medical doctors (MDs) who can<br>prescribe those medications. Treatment is usually provided by<br>*counselors* (licensed professional counselors - LPCs) or<br>*psychologists* (Ph.Ds). Most psychiatrists do not provide counseling<br>services, and most counselors and psychologists can't write<br>prescriptions.<br><br>Ideally, you'd want to find a pair or a team of these professionals who<br>work together. Often, if you talk to one, they can refer you to the<br>other with whom they can work to provide the missing piece of your<br>treatment.<br><br>You could also talk to your PCP (primary care provider - your regular<br>doctor) and see if there is any counselors he or she recommends. Then,<br>ask your doctor if they would act as your *prescribing physician* based<br>on the advice from the counselor. Note that your doctor and the<br>counselor would have to have a decent working relationship already<br>before they will do this. I suppose I was fortunate: my doctor<br>recommended a psychologist to me and agreed to work directly with him to<br>write any prescriptions I might need.<br><br>Find either a psychiatrist or a counselor/psychologist you like, and ask<br>them if they can recommend the other. That way, you are fully covered.<br><br>Medication alone is ineffective without treatment. Counseling is not as<br>effective as counseling and medication.<br><br>Get both.<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*This answer is not professional medical advice**, nor is it a<br>substitute for professional medical advice. This answer is for GENERAL<br>INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. If you think you are experiencing a medical<br>emergency, call your local emergency number (in the United States, 911)<br>immediately.* *ALWAYS SEEK THE ADVICE OF YOUR DOCTOR* *before<br>starting or changing treatment.*<br><br>*Quora users who provide responses to health-related questions are<br>intended third-party beneficiaries with certain rights under Quora\'s*<br>[[Terms of<br>Service](https://www.quora.com/about/tos)]{.qlink_container}*.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
