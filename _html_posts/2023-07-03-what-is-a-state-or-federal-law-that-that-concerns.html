<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>As others have hinted to, it's probably in your Governing Documents.<br><br>And it wouldn't be a neighbor, it would be the HOA.<br><br>In some Governing Documents, the HOA would have the authority to enter<br>the property to address immediate concerns between homeowners, such as<br>pest mitigation or broken water pipes, or any other safety concerns<br>between neighboring properties.<br><br>My Governing Documents says it this way:<br><br>> Should the Board of Directors in its sole discretion deem that any<br>> condition on any Lot exists which detracts from the appearance of the<br>> Property or causes a safety risk,the Board of Directors, its agents,<br>> employees or contractors shall have the right to enter upon any Lot<br>> for the purpose of correcting any such deficiency or condition and<br>> shall be entitled to assess the cost to the Owner. The costs of such<br>> maintenance shall be assessed against such Lot and this assessment<br>> shall not be considered to be a part of the annual or special<br>> assessments. The costs of this maintenance shall be a lien against the<br>> Lot and shall be payable along with any interest, attorney fees and<br>> costs of collection as provided in Article VII.<br><br>So in my neighborhood, the Board can enter my property to address "any<br>condition on any Lot with detracts from the appearance of the Property<br>or causes a safety risk."<br><br>Normally, in most HOAs in which a rule like this exists, they would only<br>do this after attempting to get me to fix the issue, and then would fix<br>it themselves if I refused. *But as you can see, there is no requirement<br>for them to attempt to have me fix it.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
