<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>It depends on what you mean by freedom. So let's start by defining<br>freedom, which I can probably presume you mean "free will."<br><br>The applicable definition of "free will" is that a person has the power<br>to make the ultimate decision.<br><br>So can God be sovereign over all (including our free will) and yet we<br>still have free will?<br><br>The answer is **yes. Because if it is anything other than yes, then we<br>do not have free will.**<br><br>Think about it this way. If I have a gun and I am pointing it at you, I<br>literally have the power to take your life. I have *sovereignty* over<br>your life at that very moment. But I choose not to do so, because I<br>don't want you dead (and I don't want to go to jail for murder), so I<br>don't. I have the power, but I do not exercise it.<br><br>Similarly God is indeed sovereign over all (including our free will). He<br>does exercise some influence (in a process we call *regeneration*), but<br>He does not exercise complete or ultimate influence, because He doesn't<br>want to. He truly desires for us to be free and to make the choice to<br>love Him freely. That means that the *ultimate* decision is ours.<br><br>> "But there are some of you who do not believe." (For Jesus knew from<br>> the beginning who those were who did not believe, and who it was who<br>> would betray him.) And he said, "This is why I told you that no one<br>> can come to me unless it is granted him by the Father." --- John<br>> 6:64--65 ESV<br><br>God does exercise His will in granting new hearts to those who He<br>chooses. God *regenerates* them, giving them hearts which will love God.<br>But the choice to follow Jesus is still ours, *even if God allows us to<br>love Him.*<br><br>Therefore, just because God has the power over our free will doesn't<br>mean we don't have free will. It would only mean we don't have free will<br>if God exerts His control over our self-determination, which He does not<br>do.<br><br>\<br><br>But more importantly, and this probably gets at the very heart of this<br>question, *if God has sovereignty over our free will,* ***are we still<br>accountable for our choices?***<br><br>And that answer is assuredly yes. We have free will. We can make our<br>own choices, and we are indeed responsible over our choices, and we will<br>account for them. We will, as Jesus says, "give account for every<br>careless word" (Matthew 12:36). Indeed, we will give an account,<br>according to Romans 14:12, of all of our preferences and choices and<br>behaviors. Each of us will give an account of himself to God.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
