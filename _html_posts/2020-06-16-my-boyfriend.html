<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**My boyfriends ex wife called DCFS on us. She had told them our house<br>environmentally unsafe (which was not true). Is there anyway I can<br>protect myself from her doing this again? Is there any legal recourse I<br>can take?**<br><br>After one incident? Probably not.<br><br>But if she continues, and you can establish a pattern of false<br>reporting, you can have a judge issue a Cease and Desist order or a<br>Restraining Order (depending on jurisdiction), or potentially, as<br>[[Heather<br>Johnson](https://www.quora.com/profile/Heather-Johnson-117)]{.qlink_container}<br>said, invite the District Attorney's office to take a look at misuse of<br>government services charges. This, of course, is dependent on location.<br><br>Your boyfriend's attorney may be able to help with some of this. If not,<br>you should retain one. This process becomes immensely easier with the<br>assistance of an attorney.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
