The higher speed, service ceiling, and<br>time-to-climb means that the B-1 is more survivable than the B-52 which<br>it was intended to replace. It also holds 61 FAI world records for<br>speed, payload, distance, and time-to-climb in different aircraft weight<br>classes, so it is no slouch even when not being compared to its<br>predecessor. In November 1983, three B-1Bs set a long distance record<br>for the aircraft, which demonstrated its ability to conduct extended<br>mission lengths to strike anywhere in the world and return to base<br>without any stops. This is a big deal, as it contributes to the \"force<br>projection\" mission of the military, and anything that allows us to<br>project force farther and faster than anyone else is a big win for the<br>United States.\<br>\<br>(Source:<br>[Wikipedia(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=2021c3&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockwell_B-1_Lancer){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container})]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
