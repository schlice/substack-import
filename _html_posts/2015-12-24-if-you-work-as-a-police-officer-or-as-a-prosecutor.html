<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>My dad was a detective with Nassau County PD (just east of NYC on Long<br>Island). At least one case that he worked on personally was featured on<br>*NYPD Blue*. The good crime dramas use actual cases (changing the names<br>to protect the guilty, of course) to enhance the realism of the show.<br>The phrase \"that\'s so crazy that it must be true\" comes to mind<br>because some of the cases seemed exactly that way. My dad called me one<br>night while the season was on-air and asked if I was watching. When I<br>confirmed that I was, he said, \"That\'s my case! That\'s my case!\"<br>I\'ll spare you the (actually) gory details of the case, but they did<br>use his case on the show. While the squad room dynamics were overly<br>dramatized to make them more interesting, the mannerisms, speech<br>patterns, lingo, and overall attitudes that the actors captured were<br>top-notch and very realistic. Much of that quality has to do with the<br>show\'s on-set advisor, usually a retired member of the department being<br>portrayed, and that person\'s ability to effect the dialogue and other<br>aspects of the show.<br><br>Today? Want to find a good cop show today that accurately reflects what<br>police officers (especially detectives) go through? Watch *The First 48*<br>on A&E. If you want true realism, that\'s your show.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
