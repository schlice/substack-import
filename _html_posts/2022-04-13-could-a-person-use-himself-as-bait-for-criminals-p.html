<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The problem here is that you *planned* on baiting criminals and then<br>*planned* on killing them, *planning* on citing self-defense as an<br>excuse.<br><br>All of this *planning* is what is commonly referred to as<br>premeditation*,* and it is one of the things needed to support a<br>murder charge.<br><br>So what's likely in this scenario is that you would be arrested and<br>charged with murder.<br><br>Sometimes, police do this in what is known as a "sting" operation. So if<br>you really want to do this, work with your local police department.<br>Otherwise, you risk being arrested yourself.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Could a person use himself as bait for criminals, put himself in<br>dangerous situations to kill criminals who attacked him, and cite<br>self-defense in those same killings?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
