<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Why do police officers shoot at vehicles coming towards them?<br><br>(US answer only)<br><br>So in other words, why do police officers shoot at a person charging at<br>them with a deadly weapon?<br><br>Because it's a direct threat to their life. Someone is charging at them<br>with a deadly weapon.<br><br>If someone is charging at you with a deadly weapon fully intent on<br>killing you, you are well within your rights (police officer or not) to<br>respond with any and all force needed, up to and including deadly force,<br>to stop that attack. There are always state level differences here, but<br>if you are carrying a gun, you should know the differences in your<br>state.<br><br>Also, for accuracy's sake, the officers don't shoot at the "vehicle."<br>They specifically shoot at the driver, not the vehicle, even though by<br>shooting at the driver you are shooting at the vehicle, but now we're<br>just splitting hairs.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
