Can I buy back the items in court legally?**<br><br>You cannot buy the items in court. The courtroom is not a sales floor.<br>There is no mechanism in court by which you can buy the items. The items<br>will be returned to the employer at the conclusion of the trial.<br><br>If you still somehow managed to be on speaking terms with the company<br>(who undoubtedly fired you), when your trial and sentence is over<br>(assuming you went to jail for the theft), you might ask them if you can<br>buy the items.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
