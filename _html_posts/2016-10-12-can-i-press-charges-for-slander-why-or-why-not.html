<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>(US Answer)<br><br>In most states, the offense is called defamation or **defamation of<br>character**. The statement must be false, and you also have to show harm<br>was caused by the lie.<br><br>There is also a category of defamation called defamation ***per<br>se*** in which there is no requirement to show harm, only that the<br>statement was made. There are four categories of defamation *per se*:<br>(i) accusing someone of a crime; (ii) alleging that someone has a foul<br>or loathsome disease; (iii) adversely reflecting on a person\'s fitness<br>to conduct their business or trade; and (iv) imputing serious sexual<br>misconduct.\[1\](#BzWqD){#cite-BzWqD .citation_link}<br><br>In most states, this is a civil offense. But in 17 US states and two<br>territories, there are laws which criminalize defamation.<br><br>Truth is always a defense to a defamation charge. This means that even<br>if a statement would be defamation if it were false, if the defense<br>could establish that the statement was actually true, a defamation claim<br>could not survive.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-BzWqD){.citation_index}<br>[Defamation(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=664f41&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defamation%23United_States){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
