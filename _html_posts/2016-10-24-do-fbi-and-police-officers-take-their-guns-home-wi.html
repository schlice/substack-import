<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>State and local police officers are usually issued a weapon which they<br>take home with them. In contrast, military police do not take their<br>duty weapons home with them.<br><br>Military police officers have a weapons card which they bring to work<br>with them. They arrive at the beginning of their shift and present the<br>weapons card to the armory. The card indicates which weapons the member<br>is qualified to carry. The armorer provides the empty weapon and<br>appropriately loaded magazines to the service member, leaving the<br>weapons card in the slot from which the weapon was retrieved. The weapon<br>is loaded using a clearing barrel in the presence of a **clearing<br>barrel official** (CBO) to ensure the weapon is loaded and unloaded<br>safely. The weapon is given to the member with the slide locked open and<br>the safety on. The barrel of the weapon is inserted into the clearing<br>barrel, the magazine is inserted, the slide is released, and the safety<br>is turned off. This leaves the weapon in condition 2, which means<br>round in the chamber, hammer down, safety off. The weapon is inserted<br>into the holster and the thumb break is closed.<br><br>At the end of the shift, the procedure is reversed, and the weapons card<br>is returned to the member.<br><br>Interesting side note: military police are trained to never draw their<br>weapons from their holsters unless they intend to fire them. Under<br>normal circumstances, the weapon leaves the holster exactly one time:<br>when taking it out to clear it before returning it to the armorer. The<br>"ready position" is hand on the backstrap, thumb break open. When we<br>train and do exercises, we use exactly the same ready position,<br>including opening the thumb break.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
