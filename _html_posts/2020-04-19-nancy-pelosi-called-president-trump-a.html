<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Nancy Pelosi called President Trump a "weak leader" and criticized his<br>Coronavirus response. Is she right?**<br><br>When you cannot compete in the ideological arena of ideas, you resort to<br>*ad hominem* attacks. When this happens, you can be sure that there is<br>nothing that they could have done better. There are plenty of things<br>that they could have done *differently*, but there isn't anything they<br>could have done *better*.<br><br>The perfect example of this: when Trump closed the border to inbound<br>travelers from China. The media and Democrat response to this action, at<br>the time, was that it was "racist" and "unnecessary." But now that<br>evidence has been mounting, it is clear that this action alone saved<br>tens of thousands of lives and slowed the spread of the virus to levels<br>we could potentially manage.<br><br>If Democrats were in charge, they never would have taken that action<br>until it was far too late.<br><br>So it is clear that while Democrats would have done things<br>*differently*, I cannot say definitively that what they would have done<br>would have been any *better*.<br><br>So the criticism of "weak leader" is nothing more than an<br>unsubstantiated, a*d hominem* attack.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
