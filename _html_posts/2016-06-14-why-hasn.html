<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I don't recall any mass shootings in recent years being perpetrated in<br>the name of "the NRA." I don't recall anyone storming into a nightclub<br>shouting, "The Second Amendment rules, baby!!!"<br><br>Maybe you can enlighten us and tell us which terror attacks in the<br>United States have been carried out by "the NRA" or in their name.<br><br>On the other hand, I can name a few terror attacks that were carried out<br>by al Qaeda, in their name, claimed by them, and officially endorsed by<br>them.<br><br>Do you see a difference here?<br><br>I can understand your dislike of the NRA. I'm not their biggest fans<br>either, but I can appreciate the work they do, as one of the strongest<br>supporters of our rights. They haven't perpetrated any killings. They<br>haven't taken credit for any killings. In fact, they have strongly<br>denounced killings while lobbying for the rights of law-abiding citizens<br>to arm themselves if they so choose. It is possible to both denounce<br>murder and advocate arms for law-abiding citizens.<br><br>Notice that the difference is the person behind the gun, not the gun<br>itself.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
