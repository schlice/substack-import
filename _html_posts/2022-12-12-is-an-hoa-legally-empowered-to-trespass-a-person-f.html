<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The answer is "it depends."<br><br>If there is a scenario in the Governing Documents in which a homeowner<br>can be forcibly removed from the subdivision, then the HOA could call<br>the police and "trespass" that homeowner.<br><br>Otherwise, no, the homeowner is a homeowner, and has rights.<br><br>Now, can the HOA trespass a person from *the clubhouse*? That's a<br>little more likely. Many Governing Documents disallow homeowners using<br>shared facilities when they are delinquent on their HOA dues payments.<br><br>But I fail to see how an HOA can trespass a person from the subdivision<br>when they actually own a residence there.<br><br>Ultimately, the answer will be found in your Governing Documents, but<br>I'd rate that claim as highly unlikely.<br><br>\<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*This answer is not a substitute for professional legal advice or a<br>solicitation to offer legal advice regarding specific facts.
