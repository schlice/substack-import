Providing that information is not only illegal,<br>but it violates end user privacy. Before information can be provided<br>under the demand of a warrant, the information must match what the<br>warrant is asking for.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
