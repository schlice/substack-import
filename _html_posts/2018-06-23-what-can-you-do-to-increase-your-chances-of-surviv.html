<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What can you do to increase your chances of surviving a mass<br>shooting?**<br><br>Like [[Chris<br>Knox](https://www.quora.com/profile/Chris-Knox-4)]{.qlink_container}, I<br>used to advocate the Run, Hide, Fight method.<br><br>Today, I advocate the "Move! Escape or Attack" method. It's essentially<br>an incremental improvement on Run, Hide, Fight (RHF) which allows you to<br>be more flexible in an active shooter situation.<br><br>- Move! When people are not used to high-stress situations, they can<br>  freeze up. Instead of saying anything else, we say "Move!" to try to<br>  break that vapor-lock. Moving to cover or concealment is the first<br>  step. Get out of the line of fire, get to a place where you can stop<br>  and analyze the situation. Moving first to an area of cover or<br>  concealment is appropriate.<br>- Escape or Attack. The problem with RHF was that "Fight" was listed<br>  only as a last resort, after hiding failed and your position was<br>  breached by the attacker. This fails to allow for any flexibility. You<br>  only hide if you can't run. And you only fight if you can't hide or<br>  your cover is blown. Escape denotes thoughtful movement towards an<br>  exit (and non-traditional exits must be considered, i.e. windows, fire<br>  doors, loading docks, or service areas not normally accessible to the<br>  public), whereas Run can be blind running, and it may not lead you to<br>  an exit. Run may not be purposeful, while Escape is a direct action<br>  leading to an exit.\<br>  \<br>  Attack is listed as equivalent to Escape, since it's not only<br>  applicable if Escape fails. Attack gives you an emotional advantage<br>  over Fight, which can be defensive in nature. Attack is a deliberate<br>  forceful proactive action. It's appropriate to orient a person into an<br>  aggressive posture to immediately counter a threat.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
