title: '"It is ridiculous tending towards dangerous to consider a book like the Bible
  holy that was written over thousands of years by tens of authors while the identity
  of some of the authors are not known at all apart from the ones in doubt. Do you
  agree?"'

<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Well, if you say it like *that...*<br><br>Sure, saying it like that certainly makes it sound like we can't trust<br>the Bible. I mean, it's thousands of years old. It's not one book, but<br>66 books, which were written by no fewer than forty different authors,<br>on three different continents, *in three different languages,* over the<br>span of 1500 years. How can you possibly trust such a collection of<br>works?<br><br>The short answer is that there are characteristics of these works which<br>clearly indicate divine intervention in their writing. In other<br>words, we know that the Bible is the *inspired word of God.*<br><br>Among all of that diversity in those writings, there is unity in the<br>message of the Bible. In other words, those books written over all that<br>time and all that space do not contradict one another. That central<br>message of the book is unchanged over all that time. And the book<br>contains no errors in historical or scientific information.<br><br>There is no possible way that humans could have accomplished such a feat<br>alone. If you think it is possible, I would challenge you to go into any<br>library anywhere in the world and select 66 works written by no fewer<br>than 40 different authors in no fewer than 3 languages written over the<br>span of 1500 years, and show that there is complete unity between them<br>and no errors of fact or historical information. Clearly, such a feat<br>would be impossible for humans to accomplish on their own.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
