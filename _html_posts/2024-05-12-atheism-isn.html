<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Mostly incorrect.<br><br>**Atheism is absolutely a worldview and a belief system, and depending<br>on how you define it, it could be a religion.**<br><br>Atheism is absolutely a worldview, as it answers the main questions<br>posed by all worldviews: our *origin, identity, meaning, the source of<br>our morality,* and our *destiny*. There are three main worldviews which<br>exist in this world: theism, pantheism and atheism. Theism<br>believes that God created all, Pantheism believes that God *is* all, and<br>atheism believes that there is "no god at all." So it is indeed a<br>worldview.<br><br>Atheism is also definitely a belief system. Atheists have *exactly as<br>much evidence that God does not exist as theists have that God does<br>exist.* Therefore, both believe (through faith) in their positions. If<br>you define "theism" as "belief in the existence of a god," atheism is<br>"belief in the non-existence of a god." And here's where atheists get<br>confused. They have just as much belief and faith as theists do, they<br>simply believe (through faith) that a god does not exist. That makes<br>atheism absolutely a belief system.<br><br>Whether or not atheism is a *religion* wholly depends on your definition<br>of religion. Usually, when atheists say that atheism is not a religion,<br>they mean it's not an "organized" religion with belief in a god or gods,<br>like those that meet in church buildings and praise their creator(s) and<br>do community service and all the other things that religious groups do.<br>Atheism is definitely not that. But if you define religion as a belief<br>system which believes in things based on faith (which is indeed one of<br>the definitions of *religion*), then atheism could be defined as a<br>religion.<br><br>\<br><br>*(EDIT) If you block me, your comments will magically disappear from my<br>answer. If I can't continue a dialogue with you, you can't dialogue with<br>me or my readers.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
