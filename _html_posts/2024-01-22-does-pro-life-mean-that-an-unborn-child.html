<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>No. Pro-life means that both lives have equal value. Pro-life means,<br>at the very least, we do not *devalue* the life of the child.<br><br>This does not, however, impact our ability to save the mother's life. If<br>a choice must be made and only one life can be saved, we would still<br>choose to save the mother. However, this is a very rare circumstance,<br>and even in the best of conditions, it is not at all clear on what to do<br>in such a situation.<br><br>Despite the corner case, the exception does not drive the belief. We<br>still value both lives equally. In other words, the baby has as much<br>right to live as the mother.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
