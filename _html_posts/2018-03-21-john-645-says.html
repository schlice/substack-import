<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**John 6:45 says, "It is written in the Prophets: \'They will all be<br>taught by God.\' Everyone who has heard the Father and learned from him<br>comes to me." Jesus declares the Father as God who also taught him (Jn<br>15:15). How can Jesus be that same God?**<br><br>Jesus says even more than that, which tells us that He is actually both<br>God and Man at the same time.<br><br>The Bible is clear that Jesus was fully human as well as fully divine.<br>John 1:1 says that "the word was with God, and the word was God." Then<br>in verse 14, it says "The word became flesh and dwelt among us as a<br>man." This is the first place we see the "hypostatic union," where we<br>find that Jesus is both fully human and fully divine. He is not half-man<br>and half-God. There are many Biblical references that illustrate that<br>Jesus was both fully human and fully God. He possessed all of the<br>attributes of the divine, and all of the attributes of a man, at the<br>same time.<br><br>There is a second teaching in the church called the *communicatio<br>idiomatum*, which teaches that the attributes of each one of Jesus'<br>existence do not influence the other. So the fact that He is fully God<br>does not give His human form special powers, and the fact that He is<br>fully human does not diminish His divinity in any way. But the<br>attributes of both are ascribed to the single person of Jesus. In other<br>words, nothing in the divine was communicated to the human, and nothing<br>in the human was communicated to the divine. Examples of this can be<br>found again in John 17:5 - "And now, Father, glorify me in your presence<br>with the glory I had with you before the world began" as well as John<br>3:13 - "No one has ever gone into heaven except the one who came from<br>heaven---the Son of Man."<br><br>> In these two verses, Jesus lays claim to the glory He had before the<br>> foundation of the world. He also claims to have descended from heaven,<br>> but how can this be true if He is a man? The answer is because the<br>> attributes of the divine are claimed by the person of Christ.<br>> Therefore, the person of Christ could claim to have the glory of the<br>> Father and could claim to have descended from heaven. But we know that<br>> the man Jesus, in the flesh, did not exist until His conception.<br>> Furthermore, this means that the two natures of Christ are distinct,<br>> yet they are in Union in the one person of Christ (the hypostatic<br>> union). It also means that the attributes of the divine and the<br>> attributes of the human are not transferred to each other --- the<br>> divine does not become localized and the human does not become<br>> infinite.\[1\](#XiJQw){#cite-XiJQw .citation_link}<br><br>The hypostatic union and the dual nature of Christ is one of the<br>foundational teachings of Christianity, along with another<br>difficult-to-wrap-our-human-brains-around foundational teaching: the<br>Trinity (one God, three persons).<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-XiJQw){.citation_index} [[Transubstantiation and the Real<br>Presence](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=3ba445&url=https://carm.org/transubstantiation){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="carm.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
