<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>There are a variety of reasons someone would choose to not be<br>vaccinated. There are religious objections to vaccines. There are health<br>reasons which might make vaccinations dangerous to the person taking it.<br>And of course, there are those people who just don't trust the<br>government.<br><br>In addition, this vaccine is not approved by the FDA. It has not gone<br>through rigorous testing, and we don't know if there are any long-term<br>effects from taking it.<br><br>Ultimately, objections to vaccination are no different than any other<br>vaccine ever.<br><br>However, my understanding of freedom includes a belief that society<br>should allow adults to make consequential decisions about their lives,<br>which includes the decision to forgo a vaccine which might preserve<br>their own life.<br><br>This decision should have no impact on your life. If you're vaccinated,<br>don't worry, you won't get COVID, despite the fear mongering of the<br>legacy media and the public health establishment. Breakthrough<br>infections are exceedingly rare for the vast majority of us, and if they<br>do happen, they would be mild anyway. The unvaccinated don't care, and<br>I'd refer you back to the previous paragraph.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>What is the rationale behind people not getting vaccinated?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
