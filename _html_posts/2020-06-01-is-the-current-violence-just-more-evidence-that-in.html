<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Is the current violence just more evidence that innocent, law-abiding<br>citizens should own firearms for self-protection?**<br><br>No. The *current* violence is just more evidence that radical leftists<br>and Antifa can hijack peaceful protesters and turn their protests into<br>hate-filled riots.<br><br>However, if the *current* violence gets worse, as Antifa has pledged to<br>do, and rioters start breaking into houses, then you had better already<br>own a gun and know how to use it.<br><br>But as you can tell, there's a timing problem here. If you don't own a<br>gun now and you haven't trained on how to use a gun to protect your<br>family without hurting your damn self, you may run out of time between<br>when rioters start leveling up their violence and when you can get a gun<br>and train with it enough to be effective.<br><br>The key? You have to employ the old Boy Scout motto (remember them?):<br>*Be Prepared.*<br><br>You have to go out now and buy a gun and train with it so that you can<br>defend your family before the violence gets bad.<br><br>The current violence doesn't require innocent, law-abiding citizens to<br>do anything other than to stay home. But if the current violence starts<br>to spill over into your home, you don't have time to prepare. You only<br>have time to *react*.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
