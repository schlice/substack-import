<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>They think this because *atheism is a religion,* and because a real<br>moderator does not agree or disagree with a debate participant; they do<br>not inject themselves into the debate.<br><br>Since the second part of that answer is self-explanatory, let me address<br>why being an atheist, all else being equal, is just as bad as being a<br>Christian, for a moderator.<br><br>When you say that atheism is a religion, the atheists start jumping<br>around, foaming at the mouth, and contending that there is no way that<br>atheism is a religion, because it specifically believes that there is no<br>god. But that rules out pantheistic religions like Buddhism and Jainism.<br>Unfortunately for the atheist, most nuanced definitions of religion<br>include atheism. But to understand this, we must first define what a<br>religion is. I think this definition probably fits the best:<br><br>> "A religion is a system of symbols which acts to establish powerful,<br>> pervasive and long-lasting moods in men by formulating conceptions of<br>> a general order of existence and clothing those conceptions with such<br>> an aura of factuality that the moods and motivations seem uniquely<br>> realistic." --- Clifford Geertz<br><br>While many have difficulty with the phrase "a system of symbols," the<br>rest of the definition is clear. Religion is a way of thinking that<br>helps people make sense of the world and becomes so embedded in them<br>that it makes other ways of thinking look foreign.<br><br>This definition of religion not only includes traditional religions, but<br>it also fits atheism perfectly. Atheism has "conceptions of a general<br>order of existence," and those generally consist of natural laws as<br>identified by science. Just like some of the basic tenets in other<br>religions, most atheists do not question these basic underlying<br>assumptions. They cannot bring themselves to question either natural<br>laws or the idea that life is based solely on natural laws, even when<br>those natural laws have been shown to be flawed and imperfect, and<br>unable to create the life we have today. When confronted with these<br>facts, atheists will do the same mental gymnastics to justify their<br>beliefs that they accuse Christians of doing when confronted with an<br>unpleasant Bible verse.<br><br>Atheism also fits the second part of the definition, too. They *so<br>deeply* believe that random chance caused life to form and that<br>macroevolution is fact, that their belief is "uniquely realistic." They<br>often say that believing in god is like believing in fairy tales, but<br>their belief in the power of natural laws creating irreducibly complex<br>physiological systems is the only rational belief one can have.<br><br>TL;DR: You are biased because atheism is as much of a religion as<br>Christianity, and an atheist moderator, all else being equal, is no<br>better than a Christian moderator.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
