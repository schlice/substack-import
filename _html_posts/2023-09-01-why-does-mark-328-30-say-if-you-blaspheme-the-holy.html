<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Ah yes, another question about the "unpardonable sin."<br><br>We do teach in Christianity that no one is beyond salvation. God's love<br>is infinite, and so anyone who has sinned can be forgiven. But yet,<br>this discussion of the "unpardonable sin" remains for us today. Let's<br>review.<br><br>First, you can't just look at Mark 3:28--30. You have to look at the<br>context to understand what happened here. **For text, without context,<br>is just pretext.**<br><br>So let's widen the scope of the passage to get a better understanding of<br>what happened. Let's instead read Mark 3:20--30:<br><br>> Then Jesus entered a house, and again a crowd gathered, so that he and<br>> his disciples were not even able to eat. When his family heard about<br>> this, they went to take charge of him, for they said, "He is out of<br>> his mind."<br>><br>> And the teachers of the law who came down from Jerusalem said, "He is<br>> possessed by Beelzebul! By the prince of demons he is driving out<br>> demons."<br>><br>> So Jesus called them over to him and began to speak to them in<br>> parables: "How can Satan drive out Satan? If a kingdom is divided<br>> against itself, that kingdom cannot stand. If a house is divided<br>> against itself, that house cannot stand. And if Satan opposes himself<br>> and is divided, he cannot stand; his end has come. In fact, no one can<br>> enter a strong man's house without first tying him up. Then he can<br>> plunder the strong man's house. Truly I tell you, people can be<br>> forgiven all their sins and every slander they utter, but whoever<br>> blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will never be forgiven; they are<br>> guilty of an eternal sin."<br>><br>> He said this because they were saying, "He has an impure spirit."<br>> (NIV)<br><br>So in this case, Jesus drove out an evil spirit, and "the teachers of<br>the law" (who we know to be the Pharisees) came down from Jerusalem,<br>*witnessed what Jesus was doing*, and **dismissed the miracles they were<br>seeing**. They instead blamed Satan for Jesus' ability to drive out a<br>demon.<br><br>Jesus told the crowd, "How can Satan drive out Satan?" Doesn't really<br>make much sense, does it? How can Satan oppose Satan? If Satan can<br>oppose himself, then he has no power at all. So it is simply illogical<br>that it is by Satan that Jesus could drive out spirits.<br><br>Therefore, Jesus continues, **you Pharisees are blaspheming the work of<br>the Holy Spirit**. Jesus knew their heart. He knew that they knew<br>exactly the source of His authority, and they *knowingly and willingly<br>denied it, in an attempt to slander both Jesus and the Holy Spirit.*<br><br>*THAT IS THE UNPARDONABLE SIN.*<br><br>*Witnessing Jesus perform a miracle and attributing His power to Satan,<br>or denying God's authority as personally witnessed.*<br><br>So how does this apply to us today? *It doesn't.* We can't see Jesus<br>performing miracles and then attribute Jesus' power to Satan, so *we<br>cannot commit the unpardonable sin*.<br><br>But is there a sin that we can commit which we cannot be pardoned for?<br>If God's love is infinite, we can ask to be forgiven of anything, and if<br>we truly repent and believe, we will be forgiven, right? Jesus even<br>says, "people can be forgiven all their sins and every slander they<br>utter," yet is there something that we can do (or not do) that cannot be<br>forgiven?<br><br>We can fail to repent and believe before we die.<br><br>This life is the only opportunity we have to give our lives to Christ.<br>If you know of Christ, and you believe in His salvific work, **and you<br>refuse to give your life to Him, you refuse to repent and believe,**<br>*and then you die*, you cannot be saved.<br><br>This life is your one chance to be saved.<br><br>Don't miss it.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
