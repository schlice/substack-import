<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>So since you cited "sin" in your question, this question only applies to<br>religious believers. You can safely ignore all the answers from<br>atheists, since if you don't believe in a higher power, there really is<br>no universal right and wrong anyway, and no behavior is *verboten*. Sin<br>can only be properly understood in the religious context, so your<br>question only really applies to religious believers.<br><br>Now, in the Christian religion, the Bible (Hebrews 13:4) is clear that<br>sex needs to be maintained within the confines of marriage:<br><br>> *Let marriage be held in honor among all, and let the marriage bed be<br>> undefiled, for God will judge the sexually immoral and adulterous.*<br><br>Clearly therefore, what is acceptable *within the context of<br>marriage* is unacceptable *outside of the context of marriage*.<br><br>Additionally, God lays out the purpose of sex, and it is in the context<br>of marriage. For Christians, God designed sex to be something shared<br>between a husband and a wife. For the Christian married couple, sex is<br>about more than just sharing your bodies. It's a journey of intimacy.<br>Since anything within the boundaries of marriage is acceptable, God<br>leaves it up to the married couple to work through what things are<br>acceptable *for them*. For example, some couples include oral sex or sex<br>toys in their repertoire. For others, it may be a trigger for memories<br>of past abuse or old pornography habits. So the same act can be loving<br>for some couples and harmful for others.<br><br>Working through those boundaries together is a great way for a couple to<br>grow in love more deeply as a couple while seeking God's wisdom in<br>everything.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
