<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Should we have a second version of the constitution for private<br>companies to protect the employees?**<br><br>No.<br><br>The Constitution is not a document related to protecting employees. The<br>Constitution is designed to define what government is, what government<br>is authorized to do (in the first part), and what government is not<br>authorized to do (in the first ten Amendments, called the Bill of<br>Rights).<br><br>If you want to protect employees, you pass laws. If you think that there<br>are not enough laws defining how private companies are required to<br>protect employees, then you probably need to re-take your Business 101<br>class.<br><br>But by all means, if you believe that new laws are needed, lobby your<br>Congresspeople to get those laws written. Or better yet, find an<br>affinity group who shares your views. There's power in numbers.<br><br>A quick Google search found the following on Wikipedia which may help<br>you start your search:<br><br>[[Category:Workers\' rights organizations -<br>Wikipedia](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=cf0d48&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Workers%2527_rights_organizations){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
