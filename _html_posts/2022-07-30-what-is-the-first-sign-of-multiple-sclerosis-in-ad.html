<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>It's difficult to say, since the "first" visible sign of MS varies from<br>person to person.<br><br>We can say that the most common "first symptom" is usually a vision<br>problem. And the most common vision problem is optic neuritis, which is<br>a swelling of the optic nerve behind the eyeball. It produces pain when<br>the eye is moved, along with blurry vision and sometimes a change in<br>color vision. Other possible vision issues associated with MS are<br>nystagmus ("dancing eyes") and diplopia (double vision).<br><br>Vision problems are just the most common first symptom of MS; they are<br>not the only one. Any MS symptom can be the "first" symptom.<br><br>The other problem with "first symptoms" is that you may actually be<br>experiencing symptoms before you are diagnosed, and you may not know it.<br>For example, I was experiencing mood and cognitive issues at least six<br>months before I had my first bout of optic neuritis, which led to my<br>diagnosis. The degree of degradation on my MRI is evidence that the<br>disease process was at work well before I was diagnosed, and sometimes<br>the symptoms are hard to distinguish from other causes.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>What is the first sign of multiple sclerosis in adults?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
