<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>> *The HOA is sending me mail saying that I need to repaint the entire<br>> outside of my house, but financially I can\'t because I am a single<br>> mother supporting two kids in college. If I don\'t paint the house,<br>> they are saying that I will be fined \$100 initially and \$25 everyday<br>> afterwards.*<br><br>Instead of bashing HOAs in general, I'm going to go out on a limb and<br>tell you exactly what you should do.<br><br>I'm assuming that you didn't paint the house in the first place. If you<br>painted the house without HOA approval, you're screwed. Just stop<br>reading here. If you didn't follow the HOA's rules regarding paint<br>colors when you painted the house, the HOA can fine you, put a lien on<br>your house if you don't pay, and then foreclose on your lien. If this is<br>the case, you'll want to find out what is cheaper: either paying for the<br>repaint, or paying for the fines. Do whichever is cheaper.<br><br>If you actually bought the house with that color on it, the HOA has a<br>really tough hill to climb to try to make you pay for it. You signed<br>your covenants with the house at that color, so the HOA (by allowing the<br>house to be sold with that color on it) tacitly approved the color. They<br>can't now come back and blame you for the color and force you to pay for<br>it or face fines.<br><br>They can either:<br><br>- pay for the repainting themselves (since it was their oversight that<br>  caused the house to be sold with the wrong color on it), or<br>- give you an unlimited waiver until such time as you can get the money<br>  to pay to paint the house yourself.<br><br>I don't know the laws in your area, nor do I know the agreements laid<br>out in your covenants. If you painted your house yourself, in violation<br>of your covenants, I'd talk to a lawyer, and start looking at how to pay<br>for it, since you could conceivably lose your house. If you didn't paint<br>the house, I'd start by talking to the HOA Board. They are homeowners in<br>your neighborhood too, so talking to them about this issue should help.<br>Advise them that they allowed the house to be sold with the wrong color<br>on it, so maybe they will work out a compromise on paying for the<br>repaint, or letting it go until you can afford it.<br><br>(EDIT) I learned that, as usual, this varies by state. Here in Florida,<br>the buyer is expected to inspect the home for HOA compliance<br>before it is purchased, find any items not in compliance, and<br>negotiate with the seller to repair those items, or the liability<br>transfers to the new owner.<br><br>I personally don't find that to be reasonable. In most cases, the HOA<br>doesn't even know when a violation exists. It would be an incredible<br>burden for a prospective home buyer to learn all of the HOA rules in a<br>prospective community and inspect a home against those rules. I'm not<br>even sure that home inspectors (which you hire before you buy a house)<br>would be able to find items on the exterior of the home which are not in<br>compliance with HOA rules. Nevertheless, that is the law in Florida.<br><br>So there are certain situations in which you may become liable for a bad<br>paint color which was not corrected prior to the previous homeowner<br>selling the home. Again, personally I find this highly unreasonable, but<br>I guess that's just me.<br><br>(EDIT 2) Some people seem to be intimating that by "color" the OP is<br>actually living in a house with *faded* paint. With modern paints, this<br>is usually unlikely, but if that's the case, this is a *maintenance*<br>issue. The homeowner is required to keep up the exterior look of the<br>house.<br><br>If the homeowner has a financial hardship, she should contact the HOA<br>and work something out. Perhaps the HOA can assist with soliciting<br>donations to a GoFundMe so she can paint her house, and neighbors can<br>contribute.<br><br>\<br><br>*We also have already fleshed out the fact that some people are okay<br>with HOAs and others hate them with a fiery passion. We get it. No<br>further need to add those "I would never live in an HOA community"<br>comments any further. We get it; you understand freedom better than the<br>rest of us plebes who are lorded over by our HOA overlords. Good for<br>you. Please don't comment about your greatness any more; I'm starting to<br>get a complex.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
