<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>There are very few drawbacks to internally suppressed firearms. The main<br>reason it is not done is because of the process.<br><br>In the United States, suppressors are regulated separately from firearms<br>under the National Firearms Act. For this reason, if you internally<br>suppress a firearm, the *entire firearm* must then fall under the<br>suppressor regulation.<br><br>Therefore, to purchase the new suppressed firearm, you would have to<br>follow the stricter rules of the suppressor:<br><br>- Be lawfully allowed to purchase a firearm<br>- Be 21 or older<br>- Be in a state where suppressors are legal to own<br>- Keep the firearm in a state which allows suppressors<br>- Before you purchase the firearm, you must fill out the appropriate<br>  paperwork (which includes photo, fingerprints, and approval of your<br>  local law enforcement) along with \$200 to a FFL to submit to the ATF<br>  to get your tax stamp<br>- Once the tax stamp is approved and returned, you can then purchase the<br>  firearm.<br><br>So not only are there additional requirements to purchase one,<br>especially if you purchase as an individual, but you just increased the<br>cost of the firearm by \$200 at a minimum, and you have to have your tax<br>stamp before you purchase the firearm.<br><br>So until the rules for suppressors are changed, it's easier to sell the<br>suppressor separately from the firearm.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
