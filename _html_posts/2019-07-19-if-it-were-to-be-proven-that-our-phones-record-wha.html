If your conversations are being recorded without your<br>permission, or not in accordance with state law, the recorder can be<br>charged with illegal wiretapping. It's also a federal crime to record<br>someone without their knowledge. It's also a federal crime to use or<br>disclose any information obtained by illegal recording of a telephone.<br><br>A HIPAA violation may be in there somewhere as well.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
