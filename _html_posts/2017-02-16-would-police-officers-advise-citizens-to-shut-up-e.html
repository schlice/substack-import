<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>[[Jaden<br>Michael](https://www.quora.com/profile/Jaden-Michael-1)]{.qlink_container}<br>has got it nailed. The problem we have in society today is that people<br>believe they can be judge and jury at the side of the road.<br><br>Doing that abrogates a function of the courts onto yourself.<br><br>Only the court can tell whether or not a law enforcement action is in<br>violation of your rights. They are the only entity authorized to do so.<br>You are not authorized to do this at the scene.<br><br>Doing so, and the quotes you have posted in your article links,<br>reference what cops like to call "resisting." There are several types of<br>resisting, but most of them are related to resisting arrest. You can<br>also resist commands given by an officer. You have to know that an<br>officer is in charge, right or wrong, at the scene. You are not. If you<br>are viewed as hostile and resistant, the officer will immediately start<br>to treat you differently, and the pressure at the scene goes up.<br><br>The time to argue about whether or not your rights were violated is when<br>you talk to your lawyer, NOT at the side of the road. We've said this<br>many times on this forum. No one wants your rights violated, but by the<br>same token, you cannot resist an officer's directives during the lawful<br>course of his duty. What's lawful? Not for you to decide at the scene!<br>It's only the court that can decide what's lawful! Resist, and the<br>officer may have to resort to using force to bring you into compliance.<br><br>**When it comes to a battle of force, the officer will win. Every.<br>Single. Time.**<br><br>Therefore, you have no choice but to assume, at the scene, that the<br>officer is acting lawfully. Once you get the opportunity to talk to a<br>lawyer, you can relay everything that happened and your lawyer and the<br>courts get to determine what is lawful and what is not.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
