<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Well, it's certainly on brand.<br><br>If there was ever a more willing group of people, who would prevent the<br>problem of accidentally creating a baby while they were having sex with<br>anything with appropriately sized appendages or holes by *permanently<br>altering their bodies,* the DNC would be a full collection of them, all<br>in one place.<br><br>Personally, I think it's a terrible look, and smacks more of<br>self-selected eugenics than anything else. I'm sure they meant it as a<br>"put your money where your jiggly bits are" or a "walk the talk" sort of<br>thing, but the optics just seem so totally off to me.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
