<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Look, I'm pro-life and Christian, but this interpretation is just wrong.<br>*Because that's not how God works*.<br><br>And what's the logic there?<br><br>- We kill children<br>- God gets mad<br>- So God...kills children<br><br>Huh?<br><br>Hopefully you can see the lack of logic in that line of thought.<br><br>God is very straightforward here, there's nothing ambiguous about what<br>He believes and what He will do. God didn't create evil. God doesn't<br>condone evil. God hates evil, in fact. God would like nothing more than<br>for people to stop being evil.<br><br>*But God gave you a choice. And He respects your right to make it.*<br><br>So if you want to kill babies, He will let you. Same holds true for any<br>other sin in the books. If you want to commit that sin, God will let<br>you.<br><br>**But if you do not accept Christ as your savior and place your trust in<br>Him and ask for forgiveness for your sins and repent, *the<br>punishment for those sins will fall on you*.**<br><br>We already live in a fallen world. Living in a fallen country is part<br>and parcel of living in a fallen world. We're not going to be punished<br>because we live in a country that allows abortion. *But those who know<br>that abortion is murder and who stand by and say nothing will be judged<br>for their own deeds.*<br><br>Everyone will be judged for what they alone have done. We don't get<br>judged as a nation by God. We get judged individually, one at a time.<br>Our sins are laid bare. *Someone* is going to have to pay for those,<br>because God, above all else, is just. That debt must be paid. For<br>believers, Christ already paid for our sins with his death and<br>resurrection. We are redeemed by Christ. For non-believers, there is no<br>one to pay for those sins but the non-believer. And if sin is not paid<br>for, the non-believer cannot remain in the presence of God, as He does<br>not abide sinners in His kingdom.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
