<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: [My dad was working a beat on Long Island in the 80s, and<br>was called to a DV in which he was facing a known drug abuser (many<br>dealings with this particular individual), so they knew him, knew he was<br>a good kid at heart, and they did not want to shoot him. But he was<br>exactly that individual: running down the sidewalk at full steam,<br>carrying a knife that he had just used to stab his girlfriend, and<br>refusing to stop. Remember, this is before TASERs. Pepper spray had no<br>effect on him; he was huge (muscular, not fat) and was high. The police<br>made the decision not to shoot him, even though he fully met the<br>criteria for a clean shoot.\<br>\<br>My dad lined up on the sidewalk against his advancing run, commanding<br>him to stop (which he did not do), and when he got within swinging<br>distance, he swung his 4 D-cell Mag-Light against the bridge of the<br>suspect\'s nose. This snapped his head back, splashed his nose across<br>his face, but did not stop him. He kept on running. Yeah, heroin will do<br>that. By the way, this was the only time in his career that he ever<br>commandeered a vehicle: he stopped a passing motorist to take him down<br>the block to set him up against the suspect\'s run.\<br>\<br>They tried using a pursuing cruiser to stop him by putting it up onto<br>the sidewalk at a 45 degree angle in his path, which caused him to run<br>into the front quarter panel, somersault over the hood of the cruiser,<br>land on his feet, and keep on trucking.\<br>\<br>Eventually, it took an officer of similar size to football tackle him,<br>and took an additional officer on each limb to secure him, a set of<br>handcuffs on each wrist which were locked together to restrain him. They<br>were still allowed to hog-tie at that time (the concerns about<br>positional asphyxiation not well known then), and he was hog-tied and<br>taken to county lockup to sleep it off.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/Is-it-legally-justifiable-for-a-cop-to-shoot-an-advancing-person-with-a-knife-who-refuses-to-stop-or-drop-it-How-about-morally/answer/Rick-Bruno-1<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
