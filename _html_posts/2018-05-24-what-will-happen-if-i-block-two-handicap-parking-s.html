People will just<br>assume you can't drive, or perhaps your handicap is so severe that you<br>can't drive *well.*<br><br>If you don't have a handicap tag or plate, the police can be called and<br>you can be cited for unlawfully parking in a handicap spot. You could<br>potentially receive two tickets for parking in two handicap spots. The<br>fines for those range in the hundreds of US dollars.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
