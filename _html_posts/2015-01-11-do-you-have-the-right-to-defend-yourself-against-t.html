<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [The example you gave said that the police were<br>commandeering your home because a crime was being committed next door.<br>The legal principle which allows the police to do this is what is known<br>as \"exigent circumstances.\" For example, let\'s assume that your<br>neighbor was making pipe bombs next door and had amassed over 100 active<br>bombs. The police could remove you from your home (forcibly, if need be)<br>for your own safety, because they would be doing a disservice to leave<br>you there simply because you refused to go. You could be placed into<br>\"protective custody\" for your own safety. Exigent circumstances means<br>that the police are allowed to enter your home, without your permission,<br>to prevent imminent danger to life or damage to property. This doesn\'t<br>mean that the police have the right to then search your home and arrest<br>you if they find a bag of weed in the toilet tank; plain-view and<br>warrant rules still apply.\<br>\<br>If the police claim exigent circumstances but are illegally acting, you<br>can, after the conclusion of the incident, file lawsuit against the<br>police department for unlawfully commandeering your property, or<br>unlawfully claiming exigent circumstances.\<br>\<br>You cannot \"force\" the police to stay out of your home if they claim<br>exigent circumstances exist. You can only hope to go back following the<br>incident and prove that no such circumstances existed. You cannot do<br>this at the scene.\<br>\<br>As many of us have said over many similar questions, there are many<br>legal remedies if the police act outside the law. NONE of these remedies<br>take place AT THE SCENE or DURING THE INCIDENT. ALWAYS comply with the<br>police, and then use the legal system to make your family and your<br>children and grandchildren independently wealthy at the city\'s<br>expense.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
