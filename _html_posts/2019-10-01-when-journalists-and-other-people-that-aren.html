<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**When journalists and other people that aren't government officials are<br>flying on Air Force One, are they charged for the trip and/or food?**<br><br>Yes.<br><br>People who fly on AF1 who are not members of the White House staff or<br>who run the aircraft (i.e. the service staff, the pilots, the AF comm<br>techs, etc) are charged to fly.<br><br>They are charged an "equivalent rate" and it works out to what you would<br>be charged to fly on commercial transportation, flying a similar route,<br>in First Class. It's one charge; they are not charged separately for<br>food, in just the same way that anyone flying First Class on a<br>commercial airliner is treated.<br><br>If you're a reporter, the organization you work for will be billed for<br>your flight. So yes, every reporter who flies in the press corps on AF1<br>with the President is charged by the Air Force to take that trip.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
