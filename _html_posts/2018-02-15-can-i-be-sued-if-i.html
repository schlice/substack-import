<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>In the United States, you can be sued for anything. You don't have to be<br>sued in this case. If you repay the owners for the cost of the animal<br>(which could be quite high), you may not be sued.<br><br>However, if they are dissatisfied with your attempt to reconcile, they<br>may still sue you. You could be sued for negligence (although it would<br>be tough to do) and you'll also be sued for destruction of property.<br><br>You'll be ordered to repay the cost of the property (the dog) as well as<br>an amount for pain and suffering, as pets are universally regarded to be<br>more than just property emotionally, even though legally they are seen<br>as property.<br><br>In order to prove negligence, the plaintiff will need to show that you<br>had a reasonable responsibility to protect the animal and you failed to<br>do so. Your response will be that it was an unforeseeable accident, and<br>nothing you could have done would have prevented the situation from<br>occurring; a true accident.<br><br>If you're doing this as a bona fide business and not just as a hobby,<br>you should have insurance, whether or not you accept money for your<br>work. The IRS makes the distinction between a bona fide business and a<br>hobby, even when you accept money.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
