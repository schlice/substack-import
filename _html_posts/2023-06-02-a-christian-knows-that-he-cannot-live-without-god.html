<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Because the world was designed in such a way that you can live a<br>perfectly happy, contented life without ever knowing God. As many of the<br>answers here have already told you, they've lived all this time without<br>God, and I can tell you that they can literally live out the rest of<br>their days without Him, too. And they'll live quite happily, I'm<br>certain, until they die. They can either mock Him (as some have done),<br>or simply say that they've successfully lived this long without Him and<br>they certainly don't appear to need Him. In any case, they'll all<br>continue to live quite happily without Him until they die.<br><br>The question is what happens *next*.<br><br>The atheist will tell you, "Well, you die, and you're just gone. That's<br>it. There's nothing more. Your life is over. You live as good as you<br>can, but then when your time comes, there is nothing. A big void, a<br>blackness. Your existence just terminates."<br><br>The Christian will tell you, "Well, you die, and then you will stand<br>before the throne of judgement, where God will judge your life, and you<br>will have to atone for your sin. And if you haven't accepted Him as your<br>Savior before you die, you won't get another chance at eternity."<br><br>So who is right? Can we be certain? If there's a god, why don't I see<br>him? Why doesn't he help me with this life?<br><br>So ask yourself this question: since we can't know for sure, is it<br>better to live as if God exists, or as if He doesn't?<br><br>This is the basis of "Pascal's Wager" which I paraphrase like this:<br><br>**If I'm wrong, and there is no God, I've lost nothing. But if you're<br>wrong, and there is a God, you've lost everything.**<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
