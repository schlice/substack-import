<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The short answer is God can do anything that it is possible to do.<br><br>Some things just aren't possible. He can't violate His own nature. The<br>Bible tells us these things. We know He cannot lie or deny Himself<br>(Hebrews 6:18; 2 Timothy 2:13; Titus 1:2).<br><br>He also can't violate the laws of the universe and the laws of physics<br>which He created. So for example, the gotcha question that atheists love<br>to ask me is, "Can God create a rock so heavy that even He can't lift<br>it?" They think this is a gotcha because regardless of how you answer,<br>it proves that God is not omnipotent. Either His inability to create<br>such a rock, or His inability to move such a rock, would place His<br>omnipotence into question.<br><br>But the existence of this question is based on a flawed understanding of<br>omnipotence. What truly is omnipotence? It's "unlimited power," the<br>power to effect change, to make things happen. God (being unlimited) has<br>unlimited power, and the Bible affirms this (Job 11:7-11, 37:23; 2<br>Corinthians 6:18; Revelation 4:8; etc.). Therefore, God can do whatever<br>is possible to be done. God cannot, however, do that which is actually<br>impossible. This is because ***true impossibility is not based on the<br>amount of power one has, it is based on what is really possible.***<br>The truly impossible is not made possible by adding more power.<br><br>Understanding this, you can understand why He cannot create a rock that<br>even He cannot move. The reason is because of His nature and the nature<br>of reality itself. God cannot do what is not actually possible to be<br>done, like creating a square circle or a two-sided triangle. Just<br>because you can stick words together this way does not make the<br>impossible possible. These things are *contradictions*; they are truly<br>impossible in reality. And even God cannot deny reality.<br><br>To answer the theoretical rock question, in order for God to create a<br>rock so heavy that He cannot lift it, He would have to create a rock of<br>sufficient mass such that His infinite ability to exert force could not<br>move it. Since His input force is unlimited, the size of the rock would<br>have to be infinite such that His unlimited input force could not move<br>it. And an infinitely massive rock cannot exist within this universe.<br>Therefore, God cannot create such a rock because it would not fit inside<br>of the universe He created and where rocks and matter exist.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
