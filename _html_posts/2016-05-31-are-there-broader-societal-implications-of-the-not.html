<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>A2A<br><br>Short answer: yes, absolutely.<br><br>Longer answer: While [[Mark<br>Werner](https://www.quora.com/profile/Mark-Werner-4)]{.qlink_container}<br>addressed the public's view of "the system," I would like to address the<br>damage done to the legal system as a whole by this entire debacle.<br><br>First, read my[ [answer to Death of Freddie Gray (April 2015): What\'s<br>the likelihood that the Baltimore police officers will be convicted of<br>murder and/or<br>manslaughter?](https://www.quora.com/Death-of-Freddie-Gray-April-2015-Whats-the-likelihood-that-the-Baltimore-police-officers-will-be-convicted-of-murder-and-or-manslaughter/answer/Bill-Stein)]{.qlink_container}<br><br>I wrote that answer less than a month after the now-infamous "rush to<br>judgment" by Baltimore City State's Attorney Marilyn Mosby. Consider<br>this quote from my previous answer:<br><br>> The reviews of the Michael Brown case took 108 days, and the review of<br>> the Eric Garner case took 140 days. But Ms. Mosby can determine in<br>> just a few hours that murder charges are warranted, and she didn\'t<br>> even consult a grand jury? It\'s clear to even the casual observer<br>> that the charges were *politically* motivated, not<br>> *judicially* motivated. That is a travesty and an absolute<br>> *abdication* of her responsibilities of her office.<br><br>The real problem with what happened is that this prosecutor buckled<br>under mob rule. She issued murder charges within hours of the<br>officers' arrests, *just to stop rioting mobs*. We predicted<br>(accurately) that not only would the officers be acquitted, but even if<br>they were guilty of some crime, the prosecutorial overreach exhibited<br>here will have negated any opportunity for a jury to even hear those<br>potential charges.<br><br>Murder is a serious offense to charge someone with, and as you can see<br>by the reviews of the Michael Brown and Eric Garner cases, is not<br>something to be taken lightly. Even if a prosecutor believes he or she<br>can make a murder charge stick, especially with something as<br>high-profile as one of these cases, you bring it to a grand jury to make<br>absolutely sure that you do have enough evidence to even charge<br>someone with murder. Again, Michael Brown's case review: 108 days. Eric<br>Garner's case review: 140 days. Freddie Gray's case review: **four<br>hours**. Which one of these is not like the other?<br><br>There is simply no way that even a legally-uneducated observer could<br>look at this case review and honestly believe that a thorough vetting of<br>all available evidence was done in four hours. She didn't even<br>*have* all available evidence in four hours.<br><br>And true-to-form, one by one, the officers are being acquitted, or being<br>found not guilty of murder.<br><br>Perhaps if she would have done, oh, I don't know, *her job*, she<br>would have found cause perhaps to levy a charge of voluntary<br>manslaughter, or even involuntary manslaughter for a participating<br>officer, if they did do a "rough ride" with Mr. Gray (which is still not<br>clear whether or not it actually occurred, and at this point we will<br>probably never know). What *is* clear is that these officers are not<br>guilty of murder.<br><br>Now, on to your question.<br><br>**Are there broader societal implications of the not guilty verdict in<br>the trial regarding Freddie Gray's death?**<br><br>1.  **Prosecutors who try to re-make the legal system into something<br>    akin to mob rule will find themselves not only losing cases, but<br>    also losing their jobs**, mostly because they are failing to do<br>    them. And with people rioting when they find an outcome they find<br>    unpleasant, or not in keeping with the narrative they are trying to<br>    further, prosecutors will be faced with these decisions more<br>    frequently now than ever before. Prosecutors must hold firmly to the<br>    principles of law and proper jurisprudence in order to win cases,<br>    not to appease rioters.<br>2.  There will be a distinct "chilling effect" in law enforcement.<br>    This is not specifically tied to Baltimore, but more to the<br>    after-effect of movements like "Black Lives Matter." [[Heather<br>    MacDonald](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=ccb575&url=http://imprimis.hillsdale.edu/the-danger-of-the-black-lives-matter-movement/){.external_link<br>    rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>    onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>    qt-tooltip="hillsdale.edu"}]{.qlink_container} coined it "the<br>    Ferguson effect." The kinds of proactive policing activities that<br>    occurred during the 1990s and 2000s which caused violent crime to<br>    drop over the last two decades have already started to decline in<br>    urban areas. Police still respond to calls for service when there is<br>    already a victim, but things like discretionary stops in high-crime<br>    areas are way down. This, in turn, has led to **the first sustained<br>    violent crime spike in twenty years**. Murders are up nearly 17% in<br>    the nation's 50 largest cities. As one example, in Chicago,<br>    pedestrian stops are down 80% and shootings are up 90% in statistics<br>    taken through March of this year.<br>3.  If we don't get a president into office who will strongly denounce<br>    violence against police officers, and take steps to mitigate that<br>    violence (ex. Texas made crimes against police officers "hate<br>    crimes"), I'm afraid that the dangerous rhetoric spouted by<br>    movements like BLM will only make the problem worse, and the media's<br>    amplification of such slander will make the problem worse by orders<br>    of magnitude.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
