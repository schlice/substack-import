<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: [They don\'t need to amend the Constitution. The Supreme<br>Court already ruled on these laws, and they found that the laws don\'t<br>actually infringe on the right of the people to keep and bear arms.\<br>\<br>Had the Supreme Court overturned these laws and stated that the word<br>\"infringed\" meant that no one can write any law whatsoever regarding<br>guns, then if people actually wanted to pass a law, they would have no<br>choice but to amend the Constitution.\<br>\<br>As it stands, different courts over the years have all held the same<br>opinion: reasonable gun laws do not infringe on your right to keep and<br>bear arms.\<br>\<br>Therefore, there is no need to amend the Constitution.\<br>\<br>Look at it this way: the anti-gun lobby wants to ultimately turn America<br>into the UK or Australia and make guns illegal for citizens to own. Laws<br>like these would most definitely be found to be unconstitutional. Look<br>at Washington, D.C.\'s handgun ban. This was actually found to be<br>unconstitutional, and was overturned because it prevented citizens from<br>owning guns. So for those citizens who want to make guns illegal, they<br>will indeed need a Constitutional amendment which overturns the 2nd<br>Amendment.\<br>\<br>We don\'t currently need a Constitutional amendment to change the word<br>\"infringed\" because we still have the right to keep and bear<br>arms.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/Define-INFRINGED-as-it-is-used-in-the-second-amendment-What-is-unclear-about-this-If-lawmakers-want-to-infringe-upon-our-right-to-bear-arms-why-dont-they-follow-the-law-and-amend-the-Constitution/answer/Bill-Stein<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
