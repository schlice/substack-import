<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [As far as the near-term goes, likely nothing.\<br>\<br>VMware was spun off from EMC, but EMC retained 81% of their stake in the<br>company, which was part of the prize that Dell was going for. Part of<br>the purchase deal for EMC was buying out all those VMware shares, and<br>providing tracking stocks to current EMC shareholders to compensate for<br>the loss of the indirect ownership of VMware.\<br>\<br>Dell intends to keep VMware a publicly traded company. EMC, on the other<br>hand, will lose its public trading status and become part of Dell, which<br>is privately held.\<br>\<br>Long term? I can\'t see why VMware wouldn\'t fit nicely into Dell\'s<br>goal to move out of the PC space and into the Enterprise space, which is<br>the whole objective of the EMC purchase anyway. But I\'m truly just<br>speculating here.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
