<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Of course morality exists without God. *But it's illogical.*<br><br>Regardless of where you claim morals come from (society, families, etc),<br>in order to know something is *wrong*, you must have an unchanging<br>standard for what is *right*.<br><br>Indeed, intellect, free will, objective morality, and human rights, as<br>well as reason, logic, design, and truth can exist only if God exists.<br>Yet atheists assume some or all of these realities when they defend<br>their atheistic worldview. They can't have it both ways.<br><br>The very fact that atheists think they have reasons to be atheists<br>actually presupposes that God exists. *Reasons* require that this<br>universe be a *reason*able one that presupposes there is order, logic,<br>design, and truth. But order, logic, design, and truth can only exist<br>and be known if there is an unchangeable objective source and standard<br>of such things. The illogical, amoral universe which continually seeks<br>to disorder (see Second Law of Thermodynamics) cannot be the cause of<br>logic and morals. Logic and morals must exist because of a logical,<br>moral creator.<br><br>Society cannot be that objective source of morality because society's<br>view of what is true and moral is fluid. For example, it was moral just<br>a few hundred years ago in this country to own another person. Having<br>such a fluid standard is no standard at all. And society is an<br>absolutely terrible arbiter of truth; these days, *my truth* and *your<br>truth* can be two different things! "I'm speaking my truth," we are<br>told, is a valid thing to say. In other words, society is saying that<br>truth is relative to the individual. Also probably not a very solid,<br>unchanging standard on which to base a system of morality.<br><br>To say something is *un*reasonable, atheists must know what *reasonable*<br>is. To say something is *not* designed, atheists must know what<br>*designed* is. To say something is *not* true, atheists must know what<br>*truth* is, and so forth. Like all non-theistic worldviews, atheism<br>borrows from the theistic worldview in order to make its own view<br>intelligible.<br><br>So while people can indeed "have morality" without God, it doesn't make<br>any sense. In order to even know something is wrong, there must be an<br>unchanging standard of what is right.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
