<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Police officers are no different than anyone else out in public. You can<br>record video of a traffic stop if the officer is in a public place just<br>as you can record video of anyone else in a public place.<br><br>That said, if the officer tells you you have to stand in a specific<br>place, or to stay back from the scene, or gives you any other<br>directions, you are still required to follow those directions. You<br>cannot shove your phone in the officer's face, or expect to get<br>arrested. You cannot interfere with the officer's performance of his<br>duties. Or, again, expect to be arrested.<br><br>But other than that, you can record anyone out in public.<br><br>By this point in our history, every officer assumes that he is being<br>recorded by no fewer than three cameras every time he steps out of the<br>cruiser, and probably at least one while he's in the car.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
