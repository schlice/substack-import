<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>To answer the specific question:<br><br>> **Can I file a lien on someone's property if they committed fraud and<br>> theft by deception?**<br><br>In specific, no.<br><br>Fraud and theft by deception, especially in the scale in which you are<br>discussing, are crimes which are prosecuted by the district<br>attorney. *You* will not receive anything from that prosecution, as you<br>are not the prosecution, the state is. If prosecuted, the defendant will<br>most likely spend time in jail.<br><br>Once the crime has been prosecuted, you can *sue* for theft and fraud.<br>You will have to provide the bill of sale and proof that you paid, and<br>then you'll have to show that you never received the property.<br><br>There are several types of damages you can receive:<br><br>- Compensatory damages. You can be compensated for the actual<br>  financial loss you suffered.<br>- Loss of revenue. If the 11 mobile homes were to be rental<br>  property, you can receive the rental income you were going to get had<br>  you gotten the property and rented it out.<br>- Punitive damages. These are damages designed to punish the<br>  defendant for outrageous conduct and/or to reform or deter the<br>  defendant and others from engaging in conduct similar to that which<br>  formed the basis of the lawsuit.<br><br>*(You may be entitled to others; your legal team will help you sort that<br>out)*<br><br>It's unlikely that you'd actually receive the property *directly* when<br>all is said and done, but you can still get it, and it depends on<br>whether or not there is a mortgage on the property. If the property is<br>mortgaged, the property will revert ownership to the mortgage holder,<br>and if it is not, the state will take ownership of the property. The<br>mortgage holder will re-sell the property, and the state would auction<br>off the property. Once you receive all the money from your lawsuit, you<br>can use some of it to re-purchase the property.<br><br>While none of these outcomes are guaranteed, this is the most likely<br>outcome for a case like this.<br><br>\<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*This answer is not a substitute for professional legal advice or a<br>solicitation to offer legal advice regarding specific facts.
