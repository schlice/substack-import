<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>What percent of murders are committed with illegally obtained guns?<br><br>The actual answer is that we don't exactly know.<br><br>We can come fairly close to a good answer. Interestingly, Joe<br>Scarborough made the claim on his show that something like 3% of murders<br>are committed with legally purchased guns. Politifact [[looked into that<br>claim](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=61080e&url=http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2015/oct/05/joe-scarborough/msnbcs-joe-scarborough-tiny-fraction-crimes-commit/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="politifact.com"}]{.qlink_container}.<br><br>It seems that a lot of these numbers are being derived from interviews<br>of prisoners. But here's what we do know:<br><br>> In 2004, the government conducted its periodic [[*Survey of Inmates in<br>> State and Federal Correctional<br>> Facilities*](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=440217&url=http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/fv9311.pdf){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="bjs.gov"}]{.qlink_container}. It found that among inmates<br>> who had a gun when they committed their crime (16 percent of all<br>> prisoners), about 11 percent had bought the firearm at a retail store,<br>> a pawn shop, a flea market or a gun show. Another 37 percent had<br>> gotten it from a friend or family member. About 40 percent said they<br>> got it illegally on the black market, from a drug dealer or by<br>> stealing it.<br>><br>> \...\<br>><br>> \W\hile 3 percent or 10 percent might not be the exact number of<br>> legally purchased firearms used by criminals, the fraction is in that<br>> ballpark.<br>><br>> \"I think it's safe to say that a low percentage of criminal assaults<br>> and robberies are committed with guns that were acquired by legal<br>> purchase from a gun store."<br>><br>> Joseph Olson, a professor at Hamline University School of Law and<br>> former board member of the National Rifle Association, believes that<br>> the number of legally acquired firearms used by criminals is<br>> negligible.<br>><br>> \"Criminals don't go through background checks because they know they<br>> wouldn\'t pass them,\" Olson said.\[1\](#ArvcR){#cite-ArvcR<br>> .citation_link}<br><br>So I think the answer to your question is "a very low percentage" of<br>firearms used by criminals in crimes are actually legally purchased.<br><br>We know that the number of mass shooters below 21 who legally purchased<br>their guns is strikingly low: one. The others either stole them or<br>made straw purchases.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-ArvcR){.citation_index} [[PolitiFact - MSNBC\'s Joe<br>Scarborough: Tiny fraction of crimes committed with legal<br>guns](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=143f0b&url=https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2015/oct/05/joe-scarborough/msnbcs-joe-scarborough-tiny-fraction-crimes-commit/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="politifact.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
