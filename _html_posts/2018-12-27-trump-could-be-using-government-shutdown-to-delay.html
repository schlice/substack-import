<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Trump could be using government shutdown to delay the emoluments<br>lawsuits against him. Do you think this is possible?**<br><br>To be honest, we're saying "Trump," but we really mean "Trump's<br>lawyers."<br><br>In order to provide the best possible defense, they will use every<br>procedural avenue open to them to either delay or nullify the case<br>before it ever has an opportunity to go to trial. That's a feature of<br>the system. Both sides get vigorous representation.<br><br>Trump's legal team is doing exactly what I would expect them to do in<br>the face of an inability by the prosecution to proceed.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
