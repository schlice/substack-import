<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>A2A<br><br>You can file a Freedom Of Information Act (FOIA) request with the<br>department for 911 transcripts. Contact the main number at the<br>department in question and ask to speak to the FOIA Officer. They will<br>provide you with the procedure to make your FOIA request. You may also<br>get the same information (i.e. how to submit a FOIA request) from the<br>department's website, but if you can't find it, go ahead and call them.<br><br>Be aware, however, that depending on your reason for making the request,<br>the contents of the conversation may be privileged information (i.e. you<br>are unrelated to the subjects in the call, you are not using it for<br>media purposes, etc), and may not be releasable. Also, if there are<br>still open investigations related to the information on those<br>recordings, they also may not be releasable.<br><br>I assume by "audio call" you are referring to recordings or transcripts<br>of the radio calls made between the dispatcher and the officers. These<br>days, those communications may be a bit thin for any one particular<br>incident. Most communications and dispatches go over MDT (mobile data<br>terminal), and not over voice radio. You may not be able to get that<br>information, either.<br><br>If you are the subject and your investigation is still ongoing, contact<br>the investigating officer and make your request. Feel free to go up the<br>chain if you don't get the information you need.<br><br>If you're involved in a legal matter (i.e. a lawsuit), your lawyer will<br>subpoena the information during the discovery phase of the trial.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
