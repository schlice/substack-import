<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Based on Michael Cohen\'s plea in federal court, could the Trump<br>Organization, including the president, be prosecuted under the RICO Act?<br>The Trump University case was a civil RICO class action, settled before<br>trial.**<br><br>Not at all.<br><br>First, you would have to be clear that the request by Trump for Cohen to<br>pay off Daniels was a campaign finance violation.<br><br>**It is not at all 100% clear that the payment is a violation of<br>campaign finance law**.<br><br>In a nutshell, campaign finance law says that in order for it to be a<br>violation, it must be a fully political payment. Basically, you have to<br>prove that Trump would not have made the payment if he was not a<br>candidate.<br><br>In this case, Trump can easily show that he would have made the payment<br>had he not been a candidate. His record of payoffs of other women with<br>whom he's had affairs, before he was a candidate, means that his payment<br>could have had a personal, as well as a political, motivation. Indeed,<br>he doesn't even have to deny that he had a political motivation. He<br>could have had multiple motivations. In order for it to be a campaign<br>finance law violation, however, it must not have had any other<br>motivation behind it.<br><br>And that alone means that the payment is not covered under campaign<br>finance rules, and is therefore not a Federal crime.<br><br>It's not a campaign finance violation, which means it's not a violation<br>of Federal law, which means that RICO also does not apply.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
