<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If a law enforcement agency had you and your iPhone in custody, could<br>they hold it up to your face to unlock it without your permission?<br>Looking for US and Canadian perspectives.**<br><br>This could change tomorrow, but currently, the law protects your<br>password from being revealed against your will. It does not protect<br>your biometric data (i.e. fingerprint, iris, etc). Biometric data is<br>data about who you are, and it is public information. Your password is<br>something you know, not something you are, and you cannot be compelled<br>to reveal your passcode against your will. It is considered *testimony*<br>to reveal a passcode; providing a fingerprint or taking a picture of<br>your face is not considered testimony. Think about it: when you are<br>arrested, the police take your fingerprints and your picture, and that<br>information is entered into a database. It is not protected,<br>personally-identifiable information under the law.<br><br>So can the police hold your phone up to your face to unlock it? Under<br>current interpretations of the law, yes they can. Can they make you<br>enter your password to unlock your phone? No, they cannot.<br><br>(EDIT) Comments were discussing the legality of doing such a thing, as<br>there is an expectation of privacy when your phone is locked, even with<br>a biometric lock. The original question did not ask whether or not the<br>police had legal basis to view the contents of your phone, so I am<br>answering the question which was asked: the protected nature of<br>biometric data, especially when it is used to lock a phone. This is why<br>biometrics, while convenient, are on legally shaky ground when it comes<br>to protecting the contents of a mobile device.<br><br>Pro tip: *if you are going to be arrested, power off your phone*. On<br>both iPhone and Android devices (current models), when you have<br>biometric locks enabled, a phone restart requires entering your<br>passcode. Your biometrics are useless when your phone is restarted. On<br>some Android phones, depending on software and model, you can set a<br>hotkey or a keypress combination to lock your device to the passcode<br>(not to the biometric screenlock). Even the "pattern lock" on Android is<br>more legally protected than your biometric data.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
