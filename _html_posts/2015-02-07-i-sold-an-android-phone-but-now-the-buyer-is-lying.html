<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [You should have waited to process the full refund until<br>you had the phone. In the future, if you run into such a situation:\<br>]<br><br>- Have the buyer return the phone. Make sure the phone arrives in the<br>  same condition in which you sent it. Make sure the buyer knows that<br>  the refund will be commensurate with the condition of the returned<br>  phone.<br>- Process the refund once you have the phone in hand and it is in the<br>  same condition in which you sent it. Process an appropriate refund<br>  depending on the condition of the phone.<br>- When you get it back, restore it to factory software. Don\'t sell it<br>  with CyanogenMod on it.<br>- Call the Customer Service number for your carrier. Make sure the phone<br>  is paid for, and is listed as yours. You will need to give them the<br>  IMEI. If there is documentation that shows the same for that IMEI, ask<br>  for it.<br>- Since the phone is paid for, make them remove the carrier lock. There<br>  is normally a website that allows you to do this.<br>- Sell the phone as stock but carrier-unlocked so it can be used on any<br>  carrier that supports that frequency.<br>- Also, don\'t accept unlimited refunds. Refunds should be limited to 7<br>  days, which should be long enough to determine if the phone works or<br>  not.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
