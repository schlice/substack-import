<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [In addition to what [[Cliff<br>G.](https://www.quora.com/profile/Cliff-G-13)]{.qlink_container} already<br>said, the courts have also determined that Miranda doesn\'t apply when<br>you are pulled over and talking to an officer there. The \"temporary<br>detention\" you experience when an officer stops your vehicle does not<br>amount to \"custodial interrogation,\" so you don\'t have the right to<br>remain silent until you\'ve had the chance to talk to your attorney. You<br>do have to answer questions related to your driving, ownership of the<br>car, license, registration, insurance, etc. You don\'t have to answer<br>quetions *not related to why you were stopped.*\<br>\<br>If you were stopped because you and your vehicle matched the description<br>of someone who just robbed the gas station a half a block away, you\'re<br>in a whole different ballgame. This is a custodial interrogation, and if<br>you refuse to answer questions, you can expect to be arrested, and<br>you\'ll likely have to sort it all out at the police station. But if<br>you\'re being accused of a crime, you might do well to not answer<br>questions, allow yourself to be arrested, and call your lawyer from the<br>police station.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
