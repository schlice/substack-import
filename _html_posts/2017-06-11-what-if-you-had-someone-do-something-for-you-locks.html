<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>In general, if a tradesman agrees to perform a service for you, you have<br>entered into contract with them. It may be a verbal contract, it may be<br>a written contract (which most do these days, but they usually call it a<br>"work order"), but it is a contract nonetheless.<br><br>If the work is completed and you then refuse to pay onsite, most<br>tradesmen will say okay, leave and then bill you for the service. If you<br>refuse to pay the bill, they will either send it to their collection<br>agency, or they will file a lawsuit under your jurisdiction's "theft of<br>service" laws. You would have to show that they did not complete the<br>agreed-upon work, in good faith, otherwise you would be obligated to<br>pay, and the court would see to that.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
