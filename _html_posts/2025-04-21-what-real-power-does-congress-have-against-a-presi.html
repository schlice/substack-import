<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Congress always retains the power of impeachment if they believe that<br>"high crimes and misdemeanors" have been committed.<br><br>But no government agency has any power over any other agency simply<br>"doing their job poorly." Testing boundaries would be considered doing<br>your job, just doing it badly. It's not a crime.<br><br>**The correct way to resolve this Constitutionally is to not re-elect<br>that person.**<br><br>In the original design of the government, the President wasn't even<br>directly elected by the people. This is why we have the Electoral<br>College. The President is merely the head of the Executive branch, not a<br>representative office. In the original design, it was Congress that had<br>the power. Congress was supposed to be the strongest branch of<br>government, as they contained the direct representatives of the people.<br><br>The Representatives in the House were supposed to be directly elected by<br>the people every two years. In this way, the current thinking of the<br>population would always be present in Washington. The House was supposed<br>to represent "the hot passions of the day." That's literally why it was<br>called the "House of Representatives" because those are the people who<br>directly represent citizens.<br><br>The Senate was never supposed to be directly elected by the people. The<br>Senate was supposed to be appointed by the states, to represent the<br>interests of the state. The Senate was the "deliberative body," and<br>Senators had longer terms than Representatives in the House. Thus,<br>Congress was a delicate balance between the interests of the people and<br>the needs of the states.<br><br>That is until the 17th Amendment introduced direct election of Senators<br>and everything changed. Career politicians and the 17th Amendment ruined<br>the Congress. Congress began insulating themselves from anything that<br>could directly tie any accountability to themselves, so they built a<br>massive bureaucracy to actually run the government. They also delegated<br>a great deal of authority to the President, making that office far more<br>important that it was ever designed to be.<br><br>This isn't just an issue of "one rogue President testing boundaries."<br>This is a systemic issue which has been shaping up this way for decades.<br>If I were king for a day, I'd reset the government to the way it was<br>supposed to be, before we started putting our hands in it and mucking it<br>all about.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
