<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Is it illegal for someone to tell you how to sign your signature?<br><br>In some cases, you may be required to sign your full legal name. For<br>example when you're signing loan documents, one of the documents you<br>sign is a "One And The Same" document. Mine says that "William Stein"<br>and "Bill Stein" refer to the same person. I have to sign that document<br>in exactly the way they specify, generally my full legal name. If I<br>don't, it may invalidate the document, which could lead to delays in<br>processing my loan, or outright denial.<br><br>So in some cases, it may be legal for someone to tell you how to sign<br>your name.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
