<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Malingering is a big word which basically means \"calling in sick.\"<br>This is a practice by which a person fakes an illness in order to<br>receive some form of \"secondary gain.\"<br><br>Faking an illness to avoid work or duty is illegal for any number of<br>reasons, primarily because you receive pay to not work, and you are<br>absent from work under false pretenses. This is the basis of a fraud<br>charge. You are defrauding your employer by feigning illness. Your<br>employer is paying you to work; you are defrauding your employer for<br>accepting money for a reason other than being sick.<br><br>This is already a crime under the Uniform Code of Military Justice<br>(UCMJ) in the military. The military has made a substantial investment<br>in the person\'s training, and the qualities of character and discipline<br>expected of a military member are not best exemplified by feigning<br>illness. In the military, you are either at your duty station, on<br>official orders away from your duty station, or you are at the clinic.<br>Anywhere else, and you\'re AWOL.<br><br>Companies in the United States have solved this problem in multiple<br>ways:<br><br>- Many companies have modified the \"sick day\" and instead called it a<br>  \"sick/personal day.\" If you truly are sick, you can call in sick<br>  with no advanced notice. If you simply need to take a day to<br>  accomplish personal business, you can take a personal day with less<br>  notice than vacation (usually only a day\'s notice is required to take<br>  a personal day; managers are required to grant personal days so long<br>  as essential business functions are covered).<br>- Other companies have lumped all paid non-work days into one large<br>  bucket called PTO or \"paid time off.\" A certain number of PTO hours<br>  are accumulated for each block of time you work, depending on your<br>  length of tenure with the company. Any time away from work comes out<br>  of the PTO bucket. Once that bucket is exhausted, any time away from<br>  work is unpaid. This is a popular option for FTH (full-time hourly)<br>  employees (hourly employees who make a minimum or guaranteed 40-hours<br>  a week).<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
