Input a 5-digit code, and the driver's door<br>opens. Then press the 3/4 button, and all doors open, or press the 5/6<br>button and the powered trunk/powered liftgate opens. If you press the<br>7/8 and 9/0 buttons together, all doors lock.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
