<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>My esteemed colleagues here are correct, and the policies remain in<br>place today.<br><br>The first two years are freebies. You can complete two years of academic<br>study and leave the Academy and owe nothing. Generally with enough<br>credits that you only need one more year at a traditional college to<br>graduate with a BS.<br><br>Once you begin classes in your 2Â° (junior) year, you incur an Active<br>Duty Service Commitment (ADSC). Depending on how long you continue<br>before you leave will determine how much time (and in what grade) you<br>will be required to repay. As I understand it, there is an option to<br>repay that time not in service but in dollars as well. Off the top of my<br>head, I'm not sure what those amounts are, and I'm certain they change<br>frequently.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
