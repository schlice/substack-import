<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Are there any further consequences after a president is impeached?<br><br>Yes.<br><br>Once the House passes Articles of Impeachment, they are forwarded to the<br>Senate for trial. The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court presides as the<br>judge over this trial. The trial is used to determine whether or not the<br>President is to be removed from office because of the impeachable<br>offense that the House found.<br><br>A supermajority of Senators (67) must vote to remove the President from<br>office in order for it to happen. If a supermajority of Senators do not<br>vote for removal, the President may finish the remainder of his term<br>(ref: Impeachment trial of Clinton, William Jefferson).<br><br>Once that is done, which is what I think you really were asking,<br>there is no further consequence. The trial is over, and either the<br>President is removed from office, or he is not. If he is removed from<br>office, the Vice President serves as President for the remainder of the<br>President's term in office.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
