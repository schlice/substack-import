<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Now that *Dobbs* has been repealed and the Supreme Court has determined<br>that abortion is not a Constitutional right and is not under federal<br>control, there is little that Trump could do to restrict abortion,<br>despite the fact that he said he is uninterested in doing anything more<br>than giving states control over their own abortion policy. I think we're<br>pretty safe in assuming that no further abortion restrictions will be<br>forthcoming from the federal government.<br><br>But let's assume he was lying, and he really wants to invoke a 100%<br>abortion ban. *How could he do it?*<br><br>- He could try to convince a Republican-led Congress to pass a national<br>  abortion ban, although such a ban, being deeply unpopular, probably<br>  would not pass. Members of Congress are still beholden to the people<br>  who elected them, and those people don't want to see a full national<br>  ban.<br>- He could try to have the Attorney General enforce the *Comstock Act*<br>  against mail-order abortifacients, which currently make up around 50%<br>  of all abortions.<br>- Finally, he could encourage Congress to pass a Constitutional<br>  amendment enshrining "fetal personhood," which would give legal<br>  protections to fetuses in the womb.<br><br>He can't do any of these on his own; he would need assistance from<br>people who also believe that abortion should be restricted for everyone.<br>And none of this really speaks to whether any of these methods are<br>*legal* or would survive any legal challenges.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
