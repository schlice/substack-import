<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I'm going to put my skeptical side away and side with you and believe<br>you when you say you don't sell drugs.<br><br>What he's trying to do is his job. He's trying to arrest you for selling<br>drugs. If you go see him, he will arrest you. Don't let his assurances<br>to the contrary dissuade you. He wants to arrest you, because that's his<br>job. He's trying to get you to willingly show up at the police station<br>so they don't have to get warrants and go through all the other legal<br>channels to extricate you from your home. They'd rather have you come<br>down to the station yourself so they can arrest you peacefully and<br>without needing a warrant. He won't tip his hand and show you his cards.<br>He won't show you the video until you are at the station and they can<br>arrest you.<br><br>Maybe they have a video, which would be enough to arrest you, but the DA<br>may have told them that they don't have enough evidence to make a charge<br>stick. If they have enough evidence to arrest you but they haven't put<br>out a warrant yet, then this may be why.<br><br>Regardless, if they have a video or audio recording which purports to<br>show you selling drugs, you need a lawyer. Don't wait until you get<br>arrested. Get a lawyer now. Work with your lawyer so that you can be<br>*ready* for when you are arrested, if they actually decide to arrest<br>you.<br><br>By the way, this is the only way you get a lawyer to actually show up in<br>a short amount of time when you get arrested: you have to pre-arrange<br>this with your lawyer, so that if you are arrested, you will be able to<br>make a phone call and your lawyer can meet you at the police station.<br>Otherwise, it could be days before your lawyer can actually get to you,<br>and you can sit in jail for that time. They don't even have to charge<br>you formally for 72 hours and they can hold you in jail. So you will<br>have to go find a reputable defense attorney and put him or her on<br>retainer. That means you'll have to pay out of pocket for that retainer.<br><br>But however you decide to handle it, I would not go down to that police<br>station. Because I know that if I did, I'd be arrested.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/How-many-times-does-a-cop-have-to-catch-you-on-video-or-audio-to-make-an-arrest-for-selling-drugs/answer/Bill-Stein<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
