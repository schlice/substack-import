<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Does the US Constitution\'s Fourth Amendment protect your cell phone<br>from being seized and searched?**<br><br>Yes, the Fourth Amendment covers you and all of your property and<br>possessions.<br><br>As always, there are exceptions.<br><br>The Fourth Amendment says that you cannot be subject to<br>*unreasonable* search and seizure. Reasonableness is the ultimate<br>determining factor in whether or not a search is prohibited by the<br>Amendment. The implication here is that *some* searches are *reasonable*<br>and are allowed.<br><br>For example, if an officer has asked if he can search your car and you<br>agreed, the officer can search without a warrant. This is considered<br>reasonable. Searches after you are arrested are also reasonable, as are<br>searches without a warrant when exigent circumstances exist, such as<br>imminent destruction of evidence, or when people are in imminent danger.<br>Also, there is no Fourth Amendment protection if the items are in plain<br>view, but the *contents* of a cell phone have a reasonable expectation<br>of privacy if it is locked by a PIN or passcode.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
