<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I am arguably someone who could benefit from free healthcare. The cost<br>of my healthcare is higher than most.<br><br>That said, I have to agree that healthcare is not a right.<br><br>Even if you decide on universal healthcare, you're not actually making<br>healthcare a "right." No one has a "right" to a commodity. For example,<br>look at the right to keep and bear arms. This doesn't mean you have the<br>"right" to a free gun. Because you have the right to free speech doesn't<br>mean the government gives you a free computer to connect to the Internet<br>for free. Just because we have a soup kitchen that provides free food<br>doesn't mean you have a "right" to food. We want you to have a house,<br>but the existence of the homeless shelter doesn't mean you have the<br>"right" to housing. These "rights" do not exist in the Constitution<br>because they are not "natural rights" which the government cannot take<br>away from you. They are commodities, which should rightly exist in the<br>free marketplace. Charity can assist the poor (and welfare is simply a<br>government-sponsored charity program), but charity does not solve<br>poverty. And before I get too far off-topic, that's a discussion for<br>another question.<br><br>Rights are not about giving you something for free. They are about<br>protecting natural liberties from entities which might seek to take them<br>away from you. A right to healthcare without charge (which would be the<br>only way it could be a "right," because if it's your right, you should<br>not have to pay to exercise it) means that someone else must labor for<br>free. That's called *slavery*, and we abolished that long ago.<br><br>Most people who talk about "free healthcare" tend to equate "free" with<br>"I don't pay at the time of service." But healthcare, like food or<br>shelter, is a commodity. One way or another, you do pay. And if it's<br>government-run healthcare, you pay through taxes. Let's not forget<br>that the places which have government-run healthcare have some of the<br>highest marginal tax rates in the known world.<br><br>But a "right?" No, healthcare is a service, not a right.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
