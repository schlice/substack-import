<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If we can convince enough young people to not join the military, could<br>we starve them of enough recruits that they would have to abandon their<br>overseas colonial ambitions?**<br><br>You'd have to assume a lot in order to make this hypothetical scenario<br>work. For the sake of this hypothetical, let's assume you're talking<br>about the United States.<br><br>First, you 'd have to assume that it is the military leadership which<br>drives any perceived "overseas colonial ambitions." In fact, the<br>military gets its strategic marching orders from the President in<br>concert with the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who implement the President's<br>military policy directives. So if there are any "overseas colonial<br>ambitions" to be had, they would belong to the President.<br><br>Second, you'd have to assume that the United States has "overseas<br>colonial ambitions," which we currently do not. In fact, we're not<br>interested in annexing any territories or countries anywhere in the<br>world. We have plenty of other options: for starters, we can annex<br>Puerto Rico, or any one of the [[13 unincorporated US<br>territories](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=eb82d3&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unincorporated_territories_of_the_United_States){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container} we currently possess, and<br>we don't even need to engage the military to do it. We can just make<br>them new states, with nothing more than a supermajority of Congress.<br><br>Finally, you'd have to assume that a resource shortage of new recruits<br>to active duty would somehow curtail the President's plans for anything.<br>Don't forget that we have a Reserve force which is double the size of<br>our Active Duty force which can be recalled to Active Duty very quickly.<br>If we have a personnel shortfall and we have operational needs, the<br>Reserves will be recalled to Active Duty to fill in the gaps.<br><br>Therefore, for these reasons, it's extremely unlikely that your scenario<br>is even feasible, or even if it was feasible, that it would achieve its<br>aims.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
