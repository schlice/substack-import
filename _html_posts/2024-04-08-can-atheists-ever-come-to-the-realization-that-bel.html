<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The problem is not that proof exists. The problem is what proof atheists<br>will accept.<br><br>Most atheists are looking for "observable, verifiable and repeatable<br>evidence" for the existence of God, but this is illogical. Concrete<br>evidence of a non-concrete God is kinda silly, wouldn't you say? It's<br>like using a metal detector to find a plastic cup.<br><br>It's not that religious folks *won't* provide you the concrete evidence<br>of God's existence that you want, no one can, because God is not<br>"concrete."<br><br>If God even exists, and if theists are correct that He created the<br>universe, He must exist outside of the universe, because you must be<br>outside of a thing in order to create the thing. Since all time, all<br>space, and all matter were created with the creation of the universe at<br>the Big Bang, God must be *outside* of all of those things. If He is<br>outside of time, then He has no beginning or no end (He is "timeless"),<br>and if He is outside of space and matter, then He is immaterial (He has<br>no form or matter). So if God actually created the universe, then He is<br>*necessarily* immaterial and eternal.<br><br>So you're never going to find concrete evidence of God's existence.<br>You're never going to discover one of God's hairs, or see one of God's<br>footprints. *But that doesn't mean you can't prove beyond a reasonable<br>doubt that God exists*. You just have to use different tools to do it.<br>Because we know that things exist which are not concrete, but we are all<br>rational to believe in. For example, you can't prove using science that<br>a sunset is beautiful or that the Nazis were evil. But we are all<br>rational to believe in beauty and morality, despite the fact that<br>science cannot prove them.<br><br>What's more, you can't even prove the assertion that *the scientific<br>method accurately produces truth* using the scientific method. You just<br>assume (without evidence) that it does.<br><br>There is plenty of proof that belief in a God is rational and logical.<br>It's just not the kind of "proof" demanded by atheists. They've set the<br>rules so narrowly that any non-material explanation automatically fails.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
