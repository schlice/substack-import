<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**I went to the food store to get some chips and I didn\'t realize there<br>were small worms. My family ate a almost the whole bag until I realized.<br>Where can I take this to court? This has happened more than once.**<br><br>Sounds like the chips were bad.<br><br>But before you can recoup money from the chip manufacturer, you have to<br>show that some harm has befallen you. You also have to show that there<br>wasn't negligence somewhere else in the supply chain. For example, were<br>the chips expired when you bought them? And more importantly, did the<br>chips hurt anyone? Did they make anyone sick? Did you incur medical<br>expenses after eating the bad chips?<br><br>If the answer to any of these is yes, you may be able to sue for<br>damages.<br><br>You probably won't have a large enough damage to do anything other than<br>small claims court, which you can do yourself.<br><br>However, you can always retain an attorney at your own expense to help<br>you file that suit. You can also seek the assistance from a community<br>legal aid group in your area.<br><br>\<br><br>*This answer is not a substitute for professional legal advice.
