<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>In the police car is not considered formal arrest, it is considered a<br>"detention" which an officer is allowed to do for his own safety and<br>yours. You were "detained," not "arrested," For an arrest to be recorded<br>in III, you need to be processed into the criminal justice system. You<br>need to be booked into the jail, ID'd, fingerprinted, photographed, and<br>placed into a cell. The DA still has 72 hours to charge you or release<br>you, so you can be "arrested, never charged" but if you've been<br>arrested, you know it. And there's no way you get an III printout a mile<br>long if you've never been arrested before.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/A-cop-lied-in-court-and-said-I-was-arrested-and-Ive-never-been-arrested-before-What-can-I-do/answer/Tim-Dees<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
