<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**How do you survive a false rape accusations as a politician? Something<br>like \"You assaulted me 45 years ago, and I have waited all these years<br>for no reason.\"**<br><br>There are several ways to do it. Clarence Thomas survived exactly this<br>type of accusation, and he did so by denying that any sexual assault<br>ever occurred. He was nominated anyway, and is now on the Supreme Court.<br>The FBI did investigate his case, and found it to be "unfounded."<br><br>In Judge Kavanaugh's confirmation circus, the FBI also reviewed the<br>letter from Dr. Ford, and forwarded it to the White House. In this case,<br>there is no criminal investigation to be had here, as not only has the<br>statute of limitations long since expired, but there is also no<br>allegation of a federal crime. The FBI has already completed a<br>background investigation, but it does not routinely check the veracity<br>of any derogatory information it gets. It compiles that information and<br>passes it on to the White House. It does not do any additional<br>investigation, unless the White House asks them to do so, since it is<br>the White House's nominee. The White House can ask the FBI to re-open<br>the background investigation, but Trump has already stated that he is<br>loathe to do that.<br><br>The Judiciary Committee has given the victim the opportunity to testify,<br>and the presence or absence of an FBI investigation should have no<br>bearing on her testimony, especially since she has no authority to<br>demand that the FBI investigate, and neither does the Senate Judiciary<br>Committee. They can ask the FBI to investigate a crime that they become<br>aware of, but there is no alleged Federal crime here. The only thing the<br>FBI could do would be to re-open the background investigation, which it<br>cannot do without a go-ahead from the White House.<br><br>So how do you survive? Continue to tell the truth. If it didn't happen,<br>it didn't happen. You have two independent people who claim it didn't<br>happen, and one who did. And at this point, it's all circumstantial,<br>with poor memories all around.<br><br>That's not to say that it didn't happen, or that it did. It's also not<br>to disparage victims of sexual assault, which is indeed terrible. What<br>matters here, in this case, is what can be proven beyond a reasonable<br>doubt, and with a more than 30 year old allegation, there is nothing<br>here which can be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
