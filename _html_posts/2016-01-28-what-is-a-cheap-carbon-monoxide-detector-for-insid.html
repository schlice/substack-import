<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>They may exist, but *you don\'t need one.*<br><br>Unlike your home, your car is never completely sealed (well technically,<br>your home is not completely sealed either, but it\'s sealed better than<br>your car). Have you noticed that when a car hits the water, it<br>immediately starts to fill up on the inside? If the passenger<br>compartment was completely sealed, you\'d stay in an airtight bubble<br>until you either ran out of air, or you opened the bubble. However, this<br>never happens. This is because passenger compartments in cars are not<br>airtight. There is always airflow through your car.<br><br>Besides, the entire volume of air in the passenger compartment can be<br>completely replaced in a matter of seconds by merely opening the window.<br><br>So, with that said, two suggestions:<br><br>1.  The climate control system has an \"off\" position. *I suggest you*<br>    *never* *use it*, ever. Even if you are cold and the car hasn\'t<br>    warmed up yet, leave the fan on its lowest position. Put it on the<br>    floor vents, or the defroster, but don\'t turn it off. This will<br>    help to keep air circulating through the car, and if you do this one<br>    thing, I can guarantee you will never suffer any ill effects of<br>    carbon monoxide in your car\'s cabin. You would literally have to<br>    run the exhaust directly into the cabin to suffer any ill effects<br>    with the fan on.<br>2.  Crack the window every once in a while. Have a sunroof? Open it! If<br>    it\'s a nice day, I\'d suggest you do that too. Even when I have the<br>    windows open, I still always have the fan on, at least at its lowest<br>    setting.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
