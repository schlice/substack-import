<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>So you're asking if the Bible depicts real things that really happened.<br>Thankfully, there is little doubt that the events recorded in the Bible<br>actually happened.<br><br>*(The following is excerpted from the book* [[*I Don't Have Enough Faith<br>To Be An<br>Atheist*](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=23ee88&url=https://www.amazon.com/Dont-Have-Enough-Faith-Atheist/dp/1581345615){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="amazon.com"}]{.qlink_container} *by Norm Geisler and Frank<br>Turek)*<br><br>\<br><br>We know that the New Testament is historically reliable. This is<br>evidenced by:<br><br>1.  Early testimony<br>2.  Eyewitness testimony<br>3.  Uninvented (authentic) testimony<br>4.  Eyewitnesses who were not deceived<br><br>Early testimony. This is *just one* piece of evidence that the Bible<br>writers talked about events which actually took place: *writings from<br>outside of the Bible.* There are ten known non-Christian writers who<br>mention Jesus within 150 years of his life. When you add those<br>non-Christian writings to the Christian sources over that same 150<br>years, there are about as many sources who mention Jesus as cite<br>Tiberius Caesar, the Roman emperor at the time of Jesus. In other words,<br>Jesus of Nazareth, who was not even a Roman official in the Roman<br>Empire, is mentioned in ancient writings about as much as the emperor at<br>that time!<br><br>Some of these non-Christian sources---such as Celsus, Tacitus, and the<br>Jewish Talmud---could be considered *anti-Christian* sources. While<br>these works do not have any eyewitness testimony that contradicts events<br>described in the New Testament documents, they are works written by<br>writers whose tone is decidedly anti-Christian. What can we learn from<br>them and the more neutral non-Christian sources? We learn that they<br>admit certain facts about early Christianity that help us piece together<br>a storyline that is surprisingly congruent with the New Testament.<br>Piecing together all ten non-Christian references, we see that:<br><br>1.  Jesus lived during time of Tiberius Caesar.<br>2.  He lived a virtuous life.<br>3.  He was a wonder-worker.<br>4.  He had a brother named James.<br>5.  He was acclaimed to be the Messiah.<br>6.  He was crucified under Pontius Pilate.<br>7.  He was crucified on the eve of the Jewish Passover.<br>8.  Darkness and an earthquake occurred when he died.<br>9.  His disciples believed he rose from the dead.<br>10. His disciples were willing to die for their belief.<br>11. Christianity spread rapidly as far as Rome.<br>12. His disciples denied the Roman gods and worshiped Jesus as God.<br><br>In light of these non-Christian references, the theory that Jesus never<br>existed is clearly unreasonable. How could non-Christian writers<br>collectively reveal a storyline congruent with the New Testament if<br>Jesus never existed?<br><br>Eyewitness testimony. Suppose someone wrote a book in 1980<br>describing your hometown as it was that year. In the book, the author<br>correctly describes: your town's politicians, its unique laws and penal<br>codes, the local industry, local weather patterns, local slang, the<br>town's roads and geography, its unusual topography, local houses of<br>worship, area hotels, town statutes and sculptures, the depth of the<br>water in the town harbor, and numerous other unique details about your<br>town that year. Question: If the author claimed he had visited your town<br>that year---or said he had gotten good information from people who had<br>been there---would you think he was telling the truth? Of course,<br>because he provides details that only an eyewitness could provide.<br>That's the type of testimony we have throughout much of the New<br>Testament.<br><br>Luke includes the most eyewitness details. (While Luke may not have been<br>an eyewitness to the Resurrection itself, he certainly was an eyewitness<br>to many New Testament events.) In the second half of Acts, for example,<br>Luke displays an incredible array of knowledge of local places, names,<br>environmental conditions, customs, and circumstances that befit only an<br>eyewitness contemporary of the time and events.<br><br>Classical scholar and historian Colin Hemer chronicles Luke's accuracy<br>in the book of Acts verse by verse. With painstaking detail, Hemer<br>identifies **84 facts in the last 16 chapters of Acts that have been<br>confirmed by historical and archaeological research.** It's a long list,<br>so I'm not going to reproduce it here, but the research has been done,<br>and the facts have been verified. Because of this, there should be<br>little doubt that Luke was an eyewitness to the events, or had direct<br>access to eyewitnesses.<br><br>Now, here's where skeptics get very uncomfortable. Luke reports a total<br>of 35 miracles in the same book in which he records all 84 of these<br>historically confirmed details. Several miracles of Paul are recorded in<br>the second half of Acts. For example, Luke records that Paul:<br>temporarily blinded a sorcerer (13:11); cured a man who was crippled<br>from birth (14:8); exorcized an evil spirit from a possessed girl<br>(16:18); "performed many miracles" that convinced many in the city of<br>Ephesus to turn from sorcery to Jesus (19:11-20); raised a man from the<br>dead who had died after falling out of a window during Paul's<br>long-winded lecture (20:9-10); healed Publius's father of dysentery, and<br>healed numerous others who were sick on Malta (28:8-9). All of these<br>miracles are included in the same historical narrative that has been<br>confirmed as authentic on 84 points. And the miracle accounts show no<br>signs of embellishment or extravagance---they are told with the same<br>levelheaded efficiency as the rest of the historical narrative.<br><br>Now, why would Luke be so accurate with trivial details like wind<br>directions, water depths, and peculiar town names, but not be accurate<br>when it comes to important events like miracles? In light of the fact<br>that Luke has proven accurate with so many trivial details, it is<br>nothing but pure anti-supernatural bias to say he's not telling the<br>truth about the miracles he records.<br><br>Uninvented (authentic) testimony. We know the New Testament writers<br>told the truth. We know this because:<br><br>1.  *They included embarrassing details about themselves.* Let's put it<br>    this way: If you and your friends were concocting a story that you<br>    wanted to pass off as the truth, would you make yourselves look like<br>    dim-witted, uncaring, rebuked, doubting cowards? Of course not. But<br>    that's exactly what we find in the New Testament. The people who<br>    wrote down much of the New Testament are characters (or friends of<br>    characters) in the story, and often they depict themselves as<br>    complete morons. People making up stories tend to not do this.<br>2.  *They included embarrassing details and difficult sayings of Jesus*.<br>    Similar to the first point, if you were trying to get people to<br>    believe in your fictitious god-man, would you include embarrassing<br>    details about him? If you were trying to depict Jesus as the<br>    perfect, sinless God-man, you would not do this. Nor are these<br>    qualities congruent with the Jewish expectation that the Messiah<br>    would come to free them from political oppression. In fact,<br>    according to their own Bible at the time (the Old Testament), Jesus<br>    was cursed by God for being hanged on a tree! The best explanation<br>    for these embarrassing details is that they actually occurred, and<br>    the New Testament writers are telling the truth.<br>3.  *The New Testament writers carefully distinguished Jesus' words from<br>    their own*. Even though quotation marks did not exist in<br>    first-century Greek, the New Testament writers distinguished Jesus'<br>    words very clearly. Most red letter editions of the Bibles are<br>    identical, illustrating how easy the New Testament writers made it<br>    to see what Jesus said and what he didn't say. Why do we cite this<br>    as evidence of their trustworthiness? Because it would have been<br>    very easy for the New Testament writers to solve first-century<br>    theological disputes by putting words into Jesus' mouth. After all,<br>    if you were making up the "Christianity story" and trying to pass it<br>    off as the truth, wouldn't you simply make up more quotes from Jesus<br>    to convince stubborn people to see things your way? Think how<br>    convenient it would have been for them to end all debate on<br>    controversial issues such as circumcision, obeying the Law of Moses,<br>    speaking in tongues, women in the church, and so forth by merely<br>    making up quotes from Jesus! Because they carefully distinguished<br>    Jesus' actual words from their own, literary archaeologists conclude<br>    that it is likely they recorded Jesus' actual words.<br><br>Eyewitnesses who were not deceived. The last possible out for the<br>skeptic is that the New Testament writers were deceived. In other words,<br>perhaps the New Testament writers simply were wrong about what they<br>thought they saw.<br><br>Given the characteristics of the New Testament that we have already<br>reviewed, it does not seem plausible that the New Testament writers were<br>deceived, given their level of accuracy about everyday, non-miraculous<br>events. They have been proven right about so many historical details.<br>Why doubt their observations about miraculous events when they got so<br>much other minutiae correct? Skeptics point to many different possible<br>theories, but they do so without a shred of evidence. Just because a<br>competing theory exists doesn't mean that that's how it happened. It<br>doesn't prove anything other than the vividness of the imagination.<br><br>And with so much the writers got right, does it make logical sense to<br>believe them on the non-miraculous events, but then discount their<br>testimony when it comes to the things that are less easy to believe?<br>Christians are used to "counter-punching" alternative theories to the<br>Resurrection. But that's not enough. While skeptics rightfully put the<br>burden of proof for the Resurrection on Christians (and, as we have<br>seen, Christians can meet that burden with good evidence), Christians<br>need to put the burden of proof on skeptics for their alternative<br>theories. In light of all the positive evidence for the Resurrection,<br>skeptics must offer positive, first-century evidence for their<br>alternative views.<br><br>It's one thing to concoct an alternative theory to the Resurrection, but<br>it's another thing to actually find first-century evidence for it. A<br>theory is not evidence. Reasonable people demand evidence, not just<br>theories. Anyone can concoct a theory to explain any historical event.<br>For example, if someone were to claim that all of the video footage from<br>the Holocaust concentration camps was staged and manufactured by Jews in<br>order to garner sympathy and support for a Jewish state, would you<br>believe that theory? Of course not, because it flies in the face of all<br>the known evidence. To be taken seriously, those who offer such a theory<br>must present credible, independent eyewitness reports and other<br>corroborating evidence to counter the numerous reports that say the<br>Holocaust was real and was actually carried out by the Nazis. But no<br>such counterevidence exists.<br><br>This is the case with the Resurrection. While skeptics have formulated<br>numerous alternative theories to explain away the Resurrection, there is<br>no evidence from any first-century source supporting any of them. No one<br>from the ancient world---not even the enemies of Christianity---has<br>offered a plausible alternative explanation for the Resurrection. Many<br>alternative theories formulated over the past 200 years are rooted in<br>anti-supernaturalism. Since modern scholars philosophically rule out<br>miracles in advance, they concoct ad hoc explanations to explain away<br>the Resurrection.<br><br>Those who have alternative theories for the Resurrection should be<br>asked, "What evidence do you have for your theory? Can you please name<br>three or four first-century sources that support your theory?" When<br>honest skeptics are presented with this question, they typically answer<br>with silence or a stuttering admission that they have no such evidence<br>because none exists.<br><br>And it's not just the Resurrection that the skeptics have to explain.<br>They also have to explain the other thirty-five miracles that<br>eyewitnesses have associated with Jesus. Are we to believe that the four<br>Gospel writers were all deceived about all of those miracles as well as<br>the Resurrection?<br><br>The bottom line is that there are too many miracles and too much<br>testimony to believe that all of the eyewitnesses got it wrong every<br>time. With regard to the Resurrection, all alternative theories have<br>fatal flaws, and we have strong eyewitness and circumstantial evidence<br>that Jesus actually rose from the dead. In other words, not only do we<br>lack a natural explanation for the empty tomb, we have positive evidence<br>*for* the Resurrection. The explanation that requires the *least* amount<br>of faith is that Jesus really did perform miracles and really did rise<br>from the dead as he predicted.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
