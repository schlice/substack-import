<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I see this sort of question all the time. People have the fundamental<br>misunderstanding that *religion* is the opposite of *science*. Like, for<br>some reason, you have to throw out the scientific method in order to<br>have faith in a god. In actuality, this isn't *religion vs. science.*<br>It's *good science vs. bad science*.<br><br>Faith is not an absence of logic. Faith is belief in the facts that you<br>have. We all have faith. Even the atheists have faith that their<br>conclusions are correct.<br><br>Science is really a search for causes. So when we're answering the most<br>important scientific question around: why are we here, we are trying<br>to find our *cause*. What caused us? We know that the *something* which<br>caused us must be eternal, what we call the First Cause. Because if the<br>thing that caused us had a cause itself, then it is not the First Cause<br>(i.e. something caused *it*). There seem to be two possible answers to<br>that question: either an eternal universe caused us to come into<br>existence through random chemical interactions, or some other eternal<br>creator outside of the universe caused us to come into being.<br><br>Our analysis of the existing data shows us overwhelmingly that the<br>universe could not have been the cause of humanity coming into<br>existence. There are a variety of proofs we use to determine this (and<br>if you're interested, I can point you to some really great resources<br>which discuss these proofs) such as the Law of Causality and some other<br>proofs as well which show conclusively that the universe had a<br>beginning, and thus a cause, therefore it could not be our creator. But<br>this leaves us with only one other option: some other eternal creator<br>outside of the universe caused us to come into being.<br><br>And wouldn't you know it, the God of the Bible happens to fit the<br>attributes of such a creator perfectly. But that's a different<br>discussion, for another day.<br><br>TL;DR: In actuality, belief in an eternal creator is very logical<br>and is highly informed by science, reason, inference, and the scientific<br>method.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Does having faith in God mean you are abandoning your reasoning and<br>wisdom?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
