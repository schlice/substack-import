<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**The Senate has voted 49 51 against calling for additional witnesses in<br>President Trump\'s impeachment hearing. Is this good for the<br>Republicans?**<br><br>Republicans, by and large, believe that this impeachment has gone on<br>long enough. Most Republicans, even if they individually believe that<br>the President's actions with respect to Ukraine may have contained a<br>personal motive, they also believe that the actions had a national<br>interest motive as well.<br><br>Finally, most Republicans believe that none of that rises to the level<br>of an impeachable offense.<br><br>So is the vote against additional witnesses good for Republicans? I<br>can't say what is "good" for anyone. I can say that wrapping up this<br>impeachment trial based on the strength of the case presented by the<br>House is Constitutionally appropriate. There is no need for additional<br>witnesses, since the House voted to pass these articles of impeachment<br>with the evidence contained in them. The Senate's job is to judge the<br>articles as they are written, not to re-investigate everything the House<br>already investigated. This vote signals that the Senate wishes to do<br>just that.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
