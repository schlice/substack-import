<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Is it possible to get a viral infection from someone breathing on my<br>face or on the food that I eat?**<br><br>Yes, and likely no.<br><br>Yes, you can absolutely be infected by someone breathing on you. The<br>virus transmits from person to person by little droplets of water vapor<br>from an infected person's lungs. Those droplets land on surfaces or on<br>you. They enter your eyes or nose and infect you through your<br>respiratory system. This is actually the primary method of coronavirus<br>transmission.<br><br>And likely no, food is not known to be a route of transmission of the<br>virus. And the information available from outbreaks of SARS and MERS,<br>caused by coronaviruses similar to the one that causes COVID-19, is<br>reassuring. According to the WHO, the evidence showed that those<br>illnesses were not transmitted by food.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
