<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>So this is an interesting answer.<br><br>The Oil Life Monitor (or the OLM) in Chevy-GM vehicles actually is not a<br>mileage counter, and it does not have sensors which interact directly<br>with the oil. The OLM actually monitors driving conditions, driving<br>characteristics and engine statistics to determine when the oil should<br>be replaced. It uses actual driving conditions to either increase or<br>decrease the amount of time until the oil should be changed.<br><br>For example, if you drive in warm weather and do mostly highway miles,<br>you could see oil change intervals of as high as 7500 to 8500 miles. If<br>you do lots of short trips in cold weather, your oil life monitor can<br>alert you as soon as 3000 miles.<br><br>So rather than relying on your local mechanic, who would much rather see<br>you change your oil every 3000 miles, you can get a better estimate as<br>to when your oil *actually* is due for a change directly from your car.<br><br>TL;DR: The Oil Life Monitor (OLM) in your car provides a pretty good<br>prediction as to when you should get your oil changed. While you *can*<br>technically drive past 0% oil life, I would not recommend it. In this<br>case, you should probably get your oil changed.<br><br>Sources:<br><br>[https://www.wallacechev.com/blog\...(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=473279&url=https://www.wallacechev.com/blog/oil-life-monitoring-what-is-it/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wallacechev.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>[https://weberautomotive.com/a-qu\...(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=8dbc89&url=https://weberautomotive.com/a-quick-guide-to-understanding-your-cars-oil-life-percentage){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="weberautomotive.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
