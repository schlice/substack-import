<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>This is a classic thought experiment, but most of these answers rest on<br>a flaw of understanding God's omnipotence.<br><br>Most people understand God's omnipotence as "God can do anything." But<br>actually, omnipotence does not refer to what God can or can't do.<br>*Omnipotence is a measure of power.*<br><br>Power is the ability to effect change, to make something happen. God,<br>being omnipotent, has unlimited power. But we know that there are some<br>things which God cannot do. For example, the Bible tells us that God<br>cannot deny His own nature (cf Hebrews 6:18; 2 Timothy 2:13; Titus 1:2).<br>The reason He cannot do these things is because of His nature, and the<br>nature of the universe He created. In other words, **God cannot do<br>things which, in this universe, are impossible to do,** like creating a<br>two-sided triangle. This is because true impossibility is not based on<br>the amount of power used, but on what is actually possible to do. The<br>truly impossible is not something which can be accomplished by simply<br>adding more power. *Impossibility,* therefore, means the same thing<br>whether or not God is involved.<br><br>So is it possible for God to create a rock so heavy that even He cannot<br>lift it? Considering that God has unlimited power, God has unlimited<br>lifting force. So is it possible, in this universe, for a rock to exist<br>which is of sufficient (infinite) mass such that God's unlimited lifting<br>force cannot move it?<br><br>The answer is no, but not because God is not omnipotent, but because<br>such a rock cannot be created. You cannot have an infinitely large rock<br>in our universe, because material objects cannot be infinite. Our<br>universe (where matter, time, and space are) is finite, so you cannot<br>have an infinitely-sized rock in a finite universe.<br><br>Therefore, the question is really asking whether or not God can make a<br>contradiction, which He cannot.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
