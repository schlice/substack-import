<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>As an *anyone,* atheist or otherwise, the answer is never. No one<br>consumes the blood of Christ.<br><br>*But, but, but, at the Last Supper, Jesus said take and drink for this<br>is the cup of my blood!*<br><br>However:<br><br>1.  There is no indication that He meant that literally. In fact, He<br>    says that the words He was speaking were spiritual words: "It is the<br>    Spirit who gives life; the flesh profits nothing; the words that I<br>    have spoken to you are spirit and are life," (John 6:63).<br>2.  The elements were still referred to as bread and wine. After<br>    Jesus said, "This is my blood," (Matt. 26:28), he said, "But I say<br>    to you, I will not drink of this fruit of the vine from now on until<br>    that day when I drink it new with you in My Fathers kingdom," (Matt.<br>    26:29). Why would Jesus speak figuratively of His blood as "the<br>    fruit of the vine" if it was his literal blood?\<br>    \<br>    We read the same thing in Paul's first letter to the Corinthians:<br>    "For I received from the Lord what I also delivered to you, that the<br>    Lord Jesus on the night when he was betrayed took bread, and when he<br>    had given thanks, he broke it, and said, "This is my body, which is<br>    for you. Do this in remembrance of me." In the same way also he took<br>    the cup, after supper, saying, "This cup is the new covenant in my<br>    blood. Do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of me." For<br>    as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the<br>    Lord\'s death until he comes.\<br>    "Whoever, therefore, eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in<br>    an unworthy manner will be guilty concerning the body and blood of<br>    the Lord. Let a person examine himself, then, and so eat of the<br>    bread and drink of the cup" (1 Cor 11:23--28 ESV). Why would Paul<br>    refer to the elements as "the bread and the cup" and simply *relate<br>    them to Jesus' broken body and shed blood* if they were Jesus'<br>    actual body and blood?<br>3.  **There is no indication that the disciples worshipped the<br>    elements.** While the practice exists in the Catholic mass, there is<br>    no indication that the disciples did the same. There's also no<br>    indication that the disciples, seated right there with Jesus,<br>    thought that the bread He was holding was actually His body, or that<br>    the cup He was holding actually contained His blood.<br>4.  The Supper was instituted *before* Jesus died. The Last<br>    Supper happened on the night before He was crucified. Are we to<br>    conclude that at the Last Supper, when they were all at the table,<br>    that when Jesus broke the bread, it actually became His sacrificial<br>    body, *even though the sacrifice had not yet happened?* And are we<br>    to conclude that the cup of wine became His actual sacrificial<br>    blood, *even though the sacrifice had not yet happened?*<br>5.  It is a violation of the Hypostatic Union and the<br>    *Communicatio Idiomatum*. In what we call the "hypostatic<br>    union," Jesus became both *fully human* and *fully divine*. He is<br>    not 50% human and 50% God. He is fully 100% human and 100% God at<br>    the same time. And in what we call the "communicatio idiomatum," the<br>    divine does not influence the human, and the human does not limit<br>    the divine. So if Jesus was fully human, how then could His body<br>    literally be in every church everywhere in the world? To say that<br>    Jesus in His physical form is in more than one place at a time is to<br>    deny the incarnation. That is, it denies that Jesus is completely<br>    and totally a man -- since a man can only be in one place at one<br>    time.<br><br>So while we eat bread and drink wine or juice in remembrance of Jesus'<br>broken body and shed blood, and every time we do it we thus remember, we<br>do not actually eat Jesus' actual body, or drink Jesus' actual blood.<br><br>There's nothing special in the eating or drinking. There's something<br>special in the *remembering* and the *worshipping.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
