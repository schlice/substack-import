<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: [Police are only allowed to use force one level greater<br>than the force presented. Police still can\'t shoot people who are not<br>threats; so far, every case you\'ve seen in the news where a police<br>officer shot an unarmed, non-threatening person, he was arrested. But<br>just because someone is unarmed doesn\'t make them non-threatening, so<br>don\'t misunderstand. And yes, there will always be outlier events, but<br>that is the exception rather than the rule.\<br>\<br>And police have NOT been \"increasingly accused.\" Accusations of police<br>brutality have actually been on the decline over the past 20 years. The<br>advent of videocameras on cell phones have \"publicized\" the issue far<br>more than it has ever been publicized before, and the police are<br>increasingly being shown in a very negative light. So while it<br>\"appears\" that police brutality is increasing, the problem is a<br>changing media landscape that increasingly paints police in a negative<br>light.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/What-would-it-cost-to-fortify-ones-home-well-enough-that-the-police-cannot-break-into-it/answer/Bill-Stein<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
