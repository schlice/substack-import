<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Should Quora be held responsible for minors getting advice on subjects<br>that in the real world would put you in jail?**<br><br>Let's go a step further.<br><br>*Quora* *cannot* *be held responsible for any advice that anyone<br>gets from their site.*<br><br>Most users tend to gloss over the [[Quora Terms of<br>Service](https://www.quora.com/about/tos)]{.qlink_container}, but this<br>might be a good time to go back and re-read them. You agreed to them<br>when you created a user account on the platform; might be useful to know<br>what it is you agreed to.<br><br>Quora's TOS isn't much different than most other message boards.<br>Basically, it says that it is completely not responsible for any content<br>that any user posts.<br><br>Allow me to be more specific for a moment.<br><br>> 9. Indemnification<br>><br>> You agree to release, indemnify, and defend Quora Entities from all<br>> third-party claims and costs (including reasonable attorneys' fees)<br>> arising out of or related to: i) your use of the Quora Platform, ii)<br>> Your Content, iii) your conduct or interactions with other users of<br>> the Quora Platform, or iv) your breach of any part of this Agreement.<br>> We will promptly notify you of any such claim and will provide you (at<br>> your expense) with reasonable assistance in defending the claim. You<br>> will allow us to participate in the defense and will not settle any<br>> such claim without our prior written consent. We reserve the right, at<br>> our own expense, to assume the exclusive defense of any matter<br>> otherwise subject to indemnification by you. In that event, you will<br>> have no further obligation to defend us in that matter.<br><br>Section 9 in the TOS is titled "Indemnification." This is where you<br>agree to not hold Quora responsible for anything you read on the site,<br>and it's also where you agree that you can't make a claim against Quora<br>for what you read on the site. Further, you have to *defend* Quora<br>against any claims against you. So if someone were to sue me for<br>something I posted on Quora (say a copyright claim), I'd have to defend<br>Quora from participation in that action and make it about me and the<br>claimant, making sure that Quora is not involved.<br><br>In other words, content on Quora belongs to the content creator, or if<br>you don't own the content, you assert that you have rights to use the<br>content.<br><br>I also like section 8d of the terms of service.<br><br>> d\. YOUR SOLE REMEDY FOR DISSATISFACTION WITH THE QUORA PLATFORM IS TO<br>> STOP USING THE QUORA PLATFORM.<br><br>In other words, if you are dissatisfied with anything at all about<br>Quora, your only legal option is to stop using Quora.<br><br>TL;DR: No.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
