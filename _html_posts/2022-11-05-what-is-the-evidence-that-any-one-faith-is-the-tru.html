<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Faith is never blind. Blind faith is foolish. Faith is not "belief<br>without evidence." Faith is believing what you *know* to be true. Faith<br>is "*belief* *in what the evidence is showing you*."<br><br>We know Christianity is true through the evidence of its truth: the<br>Bible. And we know the Bible is true because of:<br><br>- prophesy. The Bible is filled with prophesies about "God becoming<br>  man." And those prophesies detailed all kinds of things: how he would<br>  be conceived, how he would be born, how he wold live, how he would be<br>  captured and persecuted and killed, and that he would rise from the<br>  dead. Remember that it is a prophesy because it was written hundreds<br>  to thousands of years before it happened. And then it happened. And as<br>  evidence that it happened, we have:<br>- testimony. We have eyewitness testimony, people who were present<br>  and saw the very things that were prophesied. These eyewitnesses<br>  recorded, and then proclaimed, what they saw. They were physically<br>  subjected to torture and death for saying the things they said, which<br>  they could have spared themselves by simply being quiet. So we know<br>  that their testimony, in the face of certain death, was true. In other<br>  words, we know the testimony was authentic, or "uninvented."<br>- miracles. Miracles were performed, and were witnessed by people<br>  who personally recorded their existence. These miracles were not only<br>  prophesied, but were recorded in the Bible by people who personally<br>  witnessed them.<br>- outside references. There are other references outside the Bible<br>  which verify the authenticity of the bible. Ancient historians<br>  recorded the same events in their writings as are recorded in the<br>  Bible, proving the accuracy of the Biblical accounts.<br><br>Why would the Bible writers lie? What would they get out of it? Because<br>what they got out of telling the stories they did was rejection,<br>misunderstanding, persecution, torture, and death. Hardly a compelling<br>reason to lie.<br><br>There are many more details which show us that the Bible writers were<br>authentic, and were telling the truth, but it's probably too detailed to<br>include here. But we know that all of these things happened.<br><br>Therefore, if we believe that the Bible accounts are true, and the Bible<br>speaks of God and Jesus and the path to salvation, we should clearly<br>believe that it is true.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
