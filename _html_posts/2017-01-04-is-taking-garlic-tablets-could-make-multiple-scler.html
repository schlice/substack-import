<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Could it? Sure. Is it likely? Probably not.<br><br>[[A<br>study](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=790062&url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25961060){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="nih.gov"}]{.qlink_container} published at the National<br>Institute of Health found that "garlic appears to enhance the<br>functioning of the immune system by stimulating certain cell types, such<br>as macrophages, lymphocytes, natural killer (NK) cells, dendritic cells,<br>and eosinophils, by mechanisms including modulation of cytokine<br>secretion, immunoglobulin production, phagocytosis, and macrophage<br>activation."\[1\](#xTuZe){#cite-xTuZe .citation_link} So is it<br>possible that a simple stimulation of white blood cells could cause<br>increased disease activity? Sure, it's possible.<br><br>However, at the same time, garlic also modulates the secretion of<br>cytokines, which regulate the immune system. which could contribute to<br>the regulation and/or treatment of many diseases, such as "obesity,<br>metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disorders, gastric ulcer, and even<br>cancer."\[2\](#kkzfO){#cite-kkzfO .citation_link} Cytokine modulation<br>may be critical, as there is evidence of increased cytokine activation<br>during MS relapse.\[3\](#VYFYy){#cite-VYFYy .citation_link} So garlic<br>may also *regulate* improper immune system function.<br><br>Garlic, therefore, could make things worse by increasing white blood<br>cell activity, but it could also make things better by modulating<br>cytokines.<br><br>No one has yet studied this in humans, to the best of my knowledge.<br><br>So what should you do? Should you start pounding the garlic because you<br>have MS?<br><br>Absolutely not. This is all "bleeding-edge" medicine. There is no<br>consensus yet regarding this issue. It's only been studied, on paper,<br>using mouse models of a disease which mimics MS. Changing things now is<br>not only not indicated, but without further study, it could be harmful.<br><br>If you think that garlic might help you, talk to your neurologist and<br>your nutritionist. Let them work together to decide what will be best to<br>treat your disease.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-xTuZe){.citation_index} [[Immunomodulation and<br>anti-inflammatory effects of garlic<br>compounds.](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=790062&url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25961060){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="nih.gov"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>\[2\](#cite-kkzfO){.citation_index} [[Immunomodulation and<br>anti-inflammatory effects of garlic<br>compounds.](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=790062&url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25961060){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="nih.gov"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>\[3\](#cite-VYFYy){.citation_index} [[Multiple Sclerosis: The Role of<br>Cytokines in Pathogenesis and in<br>Therapies](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=427bf8&url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3497335/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="nih.gov"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*This answer is not professional medical advice**, nor is it a<br>substitute for professional medical advice.
