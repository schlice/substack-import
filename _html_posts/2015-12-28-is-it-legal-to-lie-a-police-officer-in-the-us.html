<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>In some cases, you may not lie to the police. For example, when<br>questioned, you are required to give your real name and other personally<br>identifying information. The police can (and often do) detain you until<br>they have positively identified you.<br><br>As far as anything else goes, you are perfectly free to lie to the<br>police. You can\'t be convicted of \"telling a lie.\"<br><br>Understand, though, that every time you lie when you are talking to the<br>police, you probably are providing false information. You could be<br>charged with \"obstructing justice\" or \"obstructing a public<br>official\" or \"presenting false evidence.\" That doesn\'t make it<br>*illegal* to lie. It simply means that depending on the situation, it<br>might be in your best interest to *not* lie, or better yet, to not talk<br>to the police at all. If your lie deliberately impedes a police<br>investigation (by sending the police away from, instead of towards, the<br>actual criminal), you could be charged with any number of worse crimes<br>than obstructing, including \"accessory after the fact,\" or \"aiding<br>and abetting.\"<br><br>In other words, if it\'s in your best interest to not talk to the<br>police, don\'t. It\'s better to say nothing than to lie. You\'ll end up<br>far worse off if you lie to the police than if you don\'t say anything<br>at all.<br><br>Note that I didn\'t talk about whether it\'s a good idea to not<br>cooperate. I simply am comparing saying nothing at all to saying things<br>that are not true.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
