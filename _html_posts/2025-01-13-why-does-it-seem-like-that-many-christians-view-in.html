<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>It's probably because you associate racist people from the early to<br>mid-20th century as Christians. But it wasn't their Christianity which<br>influenced their belief, it was their racism.<br><br>In fact, if they had been better/closer followers of Christ in<br>everything they did, they would have seen that their position was<br>particularly unbiblical.<br><br>Alas, "*there\'s none so blind as they that won\'t see*" (Jonathan<br>Swift).<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
