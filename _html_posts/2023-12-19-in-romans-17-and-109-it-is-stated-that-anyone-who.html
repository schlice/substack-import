title: '"In Romans 1:7 and 10:9, it is stated that anyone who believes that God (the
  Father) raised Jesus from the dead will be saved. Does this mean that anyone who
  believes that Jesus raised himself from the dead will not be saved?"'

<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>No, because Jesus (God) did raise Himself (Jesus) from the dead. That's<br>precisely what happened. Jesus is God. God is God. The Holy Spirit is<br>God. But God the Father is not God the Son. God the Spirit is not God<br>the Father. God the Spirit is not God the Son. God the Father raised God<br>the Son from the dead. Are you confused yet?<br><br>Mixing terms for God won't damn you to hell. *Misunderstanding the<br>Trinity* won't condemn you to hell. *Not believing that God paid the<br>penalty for our sin will.*<br><br>The simple fact of the matter is that God took the punishment on Himself<br>that we deserve. We are sinners. We deserve hell. There is no question<br>about it. And there is nothing we can do, ourselves, under our own<br>power, to buy our way into heaven. But instead of allowing us to take<br>the punishment for our sin, He took the punishment we deserve onto<br>Himself. His shed blood on the cross washes our sins clean. His<br>resurrection defeated death. He paved the way so we could go to Heaven,<br>and all we have to do is make the choice to believe in Him.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
