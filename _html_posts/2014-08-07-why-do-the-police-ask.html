<br/><br/>Answer<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content: [Please remember that police officers are just doing their<br/>jobs as well. They want the stop to go smoothly. Most times, they want<br/>to find a good way to start the conversation, and generally it\'s going<br/>to surround why you\'re having the conversation in the first place.\<br/>\<br/>Perhaps you don\'t know what you did. Perhaps you didn\'t know you were<br/>speeding. If you honestly don\'t know, you can say, \"Honestly, I don\'t<br/>know why you stopped me.\"\<br/>\<br/>Remember that your best bet is to be honest and polite. The VAST<br/>majority of police officers are good, hard-working people that are<br/>trying to keep the public safe.]<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content language: English<br/><br/><br/>
