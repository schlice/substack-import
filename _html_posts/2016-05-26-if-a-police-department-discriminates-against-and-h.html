<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>That person should talk to a lawyer. If the lawyer finds that actual<br>harassment and discrimination exists, they will help you file a lawsuit<br>against the department.<br><br>That person will have to understand that they have a tough row to hoe in<br>order to meet that burden. You stated that the police have "no valid<br>reason" for what they are doing, yet you honestly can not know every<br>reason the police have for doing the things they do, and they are under<br>no obligation to tell anyone except a lawyer during discovery or the<br>judge if you get arrested.<br><br>There are also varying definitions of what "discrimination" is and what<br>"harassment" is and if the police are doing their job, they have wide<br>latitude in the actions they can take. What you "perceive" to be<br>harassment and discrimination may not be so at all, and might even be<br>perfectly legal given the context in which it is done.<br><br>My suggestion: talk to a lawyer.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
