<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Which Bible is easier to read, the CEV or the ERV?<br><br>CEV.<br><br>The Contemporary English Version (CEV) was designed to allow for anyone<br>who reads contemporary English to read it and understand it. It was<br>based on studies into how people read and understand English, and the<br>translation was done with that understanding. It is designed to be read<br>and understood by people without stumbling in speech, and by people who<br>have little to no understanding of "bible" words. It therefore achieves<br>its goal of being an easy-to-read bible translation.<br><br>The Easy-Read Bible (ERV) originally started out as the English Version<br>for the Deaf (EVD). Deaf people sometimes have difficulty reading<br>English, because sign language is their first language. The EVD was<br>designed specifically for them, with simpler vocabulary and shorter<br>sentences.<br><br>In 2004, the EVD was translated into the ERV (the EVD was left as-is and<br>is still available). They expanded some of the vocabulary in the<br>translation, but being based off of a version designed for the deaf, it<br>still suffers from the same shortcomings that a translation of a version<br>originally designed for the deaf would suffer. Its original sources are<br>good, but its translation could suffer because of its origins. And while<br>it is indeed easy to read, it suffers slightly over the<br>CEV.\[1\](#svcmB){#cite-svcmB .citation_link}<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-svcmB){.citation_index} [[218 online Bibles in 72<br>languages, in text and audio<br>format.](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=764f11&url=https://www.biblegateway.com/versions/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="biblegateway.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
