Winnipeg initially used 999 as the emergency number, but<br>> switched numbers when 9-1-1 was proposed by the United States. In the<br>> United States, the push for the development of a nationwide American<br>> emergency telephone number came in 1957 when the National Association<br>> of Fire Chiefs recommended that a single number be used for reporting<br>> fires.<br>><br>> In 1967, the President\'s Commission on Law Enforcement and<br>> Administration of Justice recommended the creation of a single number<br>> that could be used nationwide for reporting emergencies. The Federal<br>> Communications Commission then met with AT&T in November 1967 in order<br>> to choose the number.<br>><br>> In 1968, the number was agreed upon. AT&T chose the number 9-1-1,<br>> which was simple, easy to remember, dialed easily, and worked well<br>> with the phone systems in place at the time.<br><br>Some other countries indeed use 999, and that was the first emergency<br>phone number. However, when it was established in the US, they chose a<br>different number. AT&T and the FCC made the decision in 1968 because 911<br>was simple, easy to remember, and worked well with the phone systems at<br>that time.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
