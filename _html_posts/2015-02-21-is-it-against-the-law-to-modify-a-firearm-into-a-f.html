<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [It is illegal to possess a firearm that fires more than<br>one round per trigger pull without a Federal Firearms License.\<br>\<br>It\'s not illegal, in most places, to sell parts that allow you to<br>create such a weapon.\<br>\<br>Some may argue that the devices actually are separate trigger pulls, so<br>they keep with the letter of the law.\<br>\<br>Sure, you go ahead and hang on to that. It can be your defense in<br>court.\<br>\<br>But what about the spirit, the intent of the law?]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
