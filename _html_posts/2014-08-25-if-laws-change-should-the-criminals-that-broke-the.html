Past versions of the law<br>or potential future revisions of the law do not change the law that was<br>in place at the time of the act, and the general rule is that the law in<br>place at the time the crime was committed is the law that<br>stands.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
