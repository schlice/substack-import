<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I still have one amalgam filling left, placed in my tooth while I was in<br>high school. My neurologist hasn't recommended to me that I remove it<br>yet, and my dentist has been removing them through attrition: when an<br>amalgam filling fails or breaks, we replace it, but if it is stable<br>inside the tooth, we're leaving it.<br><br>So the prevailing guidance is to use non-amalgam fillings if you have a<br>pre-existing neurological condition, and if you are diagnosed after you<br>get amalgam fillings, the prevailing guidance in the United States is to<br>not use them for new fillings, but it isn't 100% necessary to remove<br>them all right away.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>The FDA recommends that non-amalgam be used for people with a<br>preexisting neurological condition such as multiple sclerosis, but what<br>about before that condition is diagnosed?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
