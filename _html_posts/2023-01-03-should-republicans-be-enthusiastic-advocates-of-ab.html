<br><br><h2>Space Submission</h2><br><div><br><br>Space name: Everything Republican<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The generally-accepted term for viewpoints like this would be considered<br>a form of eugenics. Eugenics is "the study of how to arrange<br>reproduction within a human population to increase the occurrence of<br>heritable characteristics regarded as desirable."<br><br>The people who initially put the abortion industry together were<br>eugenicists. Margaret Sanger, the founder of what would become Planned<br>Parenthood, was a known eugenicist, even though modern-day Planned<br>Parenthood disavows this history.<br><br>But before I get too far into the weeds, I need to get this part out:<br><br>**Killing babies because they could become Democrats is abhorrent, even<br>for people on Quora.**<br><br>Killing babies because they are Black is *even more abhorrent*.<br>I can't even believe that in 2023 I have to type that sentence.<br><br>However, it's hard to ignore the correlations. More Planned Parenthood<br>locations are found in poor, predominantly-Black neighborhoods than<br>elsewhere in cities and towns. More Black babies are aborted than born.<br>Literally, the most dangerous place in the world to be a Black baby is<br>in the womb.<br><br>So is it *correlation* or *causation?* Are Planned Parenthood locations<br>near Black communities because that's where they are needed, or are<br>Planned Parenthood locations placed into Black communities to make it<br>easier for them to access and use?<br><br>This is the basis of eugenics.<br><br>The Republican platform is decidedly pro-life. Republicans strictly<br>oppose "elective abortions." There are a scant few reasons Republicans<br>as a whole would ever support abortion, and those might be cases of rape<br>or incest. If it's a "one-or-the-other" medical situation, this is also<br>not an "elective abortion." Saving a mother's life is a red herring, as<br>lifesaving measures which inadvertently cause death to the baby are not<br>abortions.<br><br>**Republicans would never support abortion on the off-chance that a baby<br>might become a Democrat. Republicans would never support abortions<br>because a baby is Black.**<br><br>Those are simply non-starters.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
