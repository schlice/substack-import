<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Is it illegal to threaten presidential candidates online?<br><br>While intricacies always exist, the short answer is an emphatic yes.<br><br>Reference ***18 U.S. Code § 879: Threats against former Presidents and<br>certain other persons***<br><br>> (a)Whoever knowingly and willfully threatens to kill, kidnap, or<br>> inflict bodily harm upon---<br>><br>> \(1\) a former President or a member of the immediate family of a<br>> former President;<br>><br>> \(2\) a member of the immediate family of the President, the[<br>> (https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=75b2f4&url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/definitions/uscode.php?width%3D840%26height%3D800%26iframe%3Dtrue%26def_id%3D18-USC-586235682-206521002%26term_occur%3D999%26term_src%3Dtitle:18:part:I:chapter:41:section:879){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);" qt-tooltip="cornell.edu"}<br>> ]{.qlink_container}President-elect[,(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=75b2f4&url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/definitions/uscode.php?width%3D840%26height%3D800%26iframe%3Dtrue%26def_id%3D18-USC-586235682-206521002%26term_occur%3D999%26term_src%3Dtitle:18:part:I:chapter:41:section:879){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="cornell.edu"}]{.qlink_container} the Vice President, or<br>> the Vice President-elect;<br>><br>> \(3\) a major candidate for the office of President or Vice President,<br>> or a member of the immediate family of such candidate; or<br>><br>> \(4\) a person protected by the Secret Service under section<br>> 3056(a)(6);<br>><br>> shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 5 years,<br>> or both.<br><br>I'll skip the definition of "immediate family" and I'll skip the<br>definition of paragraph 4 since those weren't asked for. But the<br>definition in paragraph 3 of "a major candidate" is defined in Title 18<br>§ 3056(a)(7) as "those individuals identified as such by the Secretary<br>of Homeland Security after consultation with an advisory committee<br>consisting of the Speaker of the House of Representatives, the minority<br>leader of the House of Representatives, the majority and minority<br>leaders of the Senate, and one additional member selected by the other<br>members of the committee." In other words, once Congress recognizes that<br>a person is a major candidate and identifies them to the Secretary of<br>Homeland Security, they are covered under this section. Their spouses<br>are also covered within 120 days of the election as well.<br><br>The definition of "threaten" which matters in this context is<br>threatening to "kill, kidnap, or inflict bodily harm."<br><br>The medium is irrelevant. Threats anywhere are taken seriously.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
