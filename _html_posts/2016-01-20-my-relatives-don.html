<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Don\'t talk to them any more. Don\'t associate with them. Don\'t call<br>them. Don\'t send them Christmas cards. You might say a final goodbye to<br>them all in a letter so that they don\'t think you fell off the face of<br>the planet, but there is no reason that you can\'t tell them that you<br>don\'t have the time or energy to have anyone in your life who doesn\'t<br>like you, for any reason.<br><br>Relatives are often given a \"pass\" because they are \"family.\" I had<br>a family member steal from me, and the prevailing opinion among the rest<br>of the family was that I should give them a pass because they are<br>family. I instead excluded them from my life and did all the right<br>things, which eventually led to a police investigation, enough evidence<br>proffered to bring two felony charges, but the DA at the time chose not<br>to pursue those charges. It\'s been over ten years and they are no<br>longer a part of my life. I have to think of my kids. What kind of<br>message does it send when my relatives steal from me and I continue<br>associating with them? It says that relatives can abuse you and there<br>are no consequences. I love them, but I don\'t want to associate with<br>them.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
