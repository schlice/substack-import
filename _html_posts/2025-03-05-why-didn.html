<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>God doesn't want a bunch of mindless robots who have no choice but to<br>believe in Him. He only wants people with Him who *freely choose* to<br>believe in Him. So if you are forced to believe in Him, you will, but<br>you may not be happy about it.<br><br>That's the very essence of free will. Love can only be given freely; it<br>can never be coerced.<br><br>Think about it. If you can't be bothered to spend one hour of one day of<br>the week to worship God, why would you want to go someplace where you're<br>going to spend *every day of the rest of eternity* doing it? I think<br>that would be the worst torture imaginable.<br><br>No, God set up the system so that you can freely choose to love Him or<br>to reject Him without violating your free will. And to make sure your<br>choice is *truly* free, He places us in a world filled with evidence of<br>His existence, *but without His direct presence*, which would be so<br>overwhelming as to overpower our free will and coerce us into believing<br>in Him. And he does not want that.<br><br>He truly wants everyone to be saved. But He's not going to force<br>everyone to love Him. So you can freely choose to reject Him if you so<br>desire.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
