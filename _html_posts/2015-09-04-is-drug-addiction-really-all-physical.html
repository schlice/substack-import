<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Thanks for the A2A.\<br>\<br>I highly suggest you watch [[Pleasure Unwoven: An Explanation of the<br>Brain Disease of<br>Addiction](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=e1f92a&url=http://www.amazon.com/Pleasure-Unwoven-Explanation-Disease-Addiction/dp/B003AC98V2/ref%3Dsr_1_1?s%3Dmovies-tv%26ie%3DUTF8%26qid%3D1441384723){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="amazon.com"}]{.qlink_container} by Kevin McCauley. Kevin<br>used to be a doctor when addiction took over his life. He then went on a<br>fact-finding journey learning the pathways in the brain which lead to<br>addiction.\<br>\<br>The physical addiction symptoms are actually resident in the brain. The<br>symptoms manifest in the body, but ultimately the problem is one of the<br>brain, not of the body.\<br>\<br>Yes, addiction is a physical disease. \"Disease\" means an improper<br>functioning of a body system, and addiction is an improper functioning<br>of the pleasure/response feedback loop system in the brain.\<br>\<br>The improper functioning of this system feeds the physical cravings.\<br>\<br>The video explains it very well. You\'ll also find snippets of the video<br>on YouTube, albeit not the full video.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
