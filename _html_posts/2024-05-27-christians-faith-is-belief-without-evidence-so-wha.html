<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>> Christians faith is belief without evidence<br><br>Says who? Christian faith is not belief *without* evidence. Faith<br>bridges the gap between the *undeniable* and the *unknowable*.<br><br>For example, we know that the universe was created, because it had a<br>beginning, and if it had a beginning, it had a cause (see the Law of<br>Causality).<br><br>If you're a non-Christian, you might say that cause is *nothing.* Random<br>chance. But Christians believe that the cause is *something*, and that<br>cause is what we refer to as "God."<br><br>Faith bridges that gap between what we know (the universe had a cause)<br>and what we can never know with certainty (God created the universe).<br><br>But just because we can't know it with certainty, is that reason to<br>disbelieve it?<br><br>Which is more likely: *nothing created something*, or *something created<br>something?*<br><br>It takes less faith to believe something created something than to<br>believe nothing created something.<br><br>So while the Christian and the non-Christian both have faith, the<br>non-Christian has to have more faith to believe that nothing created<br>something.<br><br>\<br><br>Faith is not unique to Christians. Everyone has faith. The difference is<br>not that we have faith, it's *where we place our faith.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
