<br/><br/>Answer<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content: [There are certain conditions in which the municipality in<br/>question is trying to change its enforcement policy.\<br/>\<br/>As you know, a law is only as good as its enforcement. In my area,<br/>\"sliding\" is a traffic violation (i.e. making a left turn into the<br/>right lane). However, it has never been enforced other than to add it as<br/>an additional infraction during an accident investigation. A few years<br/>ago, the city started a public awareness campaign to improve compliance<br/>with this law. Our city and county officers and deputies were directed<br/>to make traffic stops for the infraction, but to only issue warnings for<br/>the behavior. This was an attempt to advise people that their driving<br/>behaviors were in fact illegal before actual enforcement<br/>began.]<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content language: English<br/><br/><br/>
