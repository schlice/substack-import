<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: [Your mention of diabetes mimicking alcohol totally brought<br>me back to my Air Force Security Police days. I stopped a guy who<br>blasted full speed through the main gate at NORAD when I was working as<br>the SRT Team Leader that day. When we finally got him stopped (just<br>outside the vehicle capture which leads into the facility itself), he<br>was groggy and partially unresponsive, and his breath smelled of<br>alcohol. I asked for his license and he gave me his library card.\<br>\<br>Somehow, he managed to show us his Medic Alert bracelet which showed he<br>was a diabetic. Hypoglycemia. We called Medical out, they checked him<br>out, gave him a candy bar, and within about 10 minutes we were able to<br>recount to him what he had done and how close we came to shooting him.<br>Turns out he had a diabetic incident down on the highway, felt it coming<br>on, and wasn\'t able to reach his emergency glucose pills before losing<br>control. It\'s amazing that he made it as far up NORAD Road as he did<br>without crashing, and that he made it through the gate, also without<br>crashing.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/What-physical-conditions-or-ingestions-might-cause-a-false-breathalyzer-reading/answer/Tim-Dees<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
