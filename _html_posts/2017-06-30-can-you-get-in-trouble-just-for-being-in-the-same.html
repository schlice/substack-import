<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>*(When I say "organization," that also means "club.")*<br><br>In general, just being a part of an organization does not mean shared<br>liability for activities not sanctioned by the organization.<br><br>The only time you might find yourself in some amount of hot water is if<br>the organization knew that illegal activity was going to take place, the<br>organization condoned (approved of) the activity, and told everyone<br>about it. While the majority of states do not have requirements to<br>inform law enforcement of illegal activity you know will take place,<br>some do.<br><br>Another time you may find yourself in some form of "trouble" (since you<br>didn't define what "trouble" you're referring to) is if this "club" is<br>at a school and you are under 18. Schools fall under a different subset<br>of laws, as the school acts *in loco parentis* which basically means<br>that legally, while you're there, they have some authority in the same<br>way your parents do. The school can levy administrative punishment<br>against all of the students in the club if they choose, especially if<br>the students were aware that illegal activity was going to take place,<br>and did nothing to stop it. Schools can, for the most part, administer<br>clubs in mostly the way they see fit, so long as that administration<br>furthers the goal of maintaining and enhancing the academic environment.<br>The *legal* aspect of the punishment will still be left to local law<br>enforcement, and will be limited to the person committing the crime. But<br>*administrative* punishments can be handed out by the school to whomever<br>they choose. The school could simply choose to disband the club, or they<br>could hand out individual punishments to students as well.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
