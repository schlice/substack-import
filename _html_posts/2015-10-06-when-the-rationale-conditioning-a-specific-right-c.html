<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Let\'s continue with your thought. Let\'s assume for a<br>second as a hypothetical (even though all the answers on this page show<br>you that it is not true) that a well-regulated militia is no longer<br>necessary to the security of a free state. (I shudder just to type it).\<br>\<br>Because this prefatory clause no longer applies, does that somehow<br>weaken or nullify the operative clause?\<br>\<br>Again, let\'s look at the Founders and the time the Constitution was<br>written. The Founders were brought up in the time of the \"common law.\"<br>The Supreme Court said it in Ex Parte Grossman, 267 U.S. 87 (1924)\<br>\<br>]<br><br>> \The founders\ were born and brought up in the atmosphere of the<br>> common law, and thought and spoke in its vocabulary. . . . \W\hen<br>> they came to put their conclusions into the form of fundamental law in<br>> a compact draft, they expressed them in terms of the common law,<br>> confident that they would be shortly and easily understood.\<br><br>\<br>Therefore, in defining and writing the new law of the land, they based<br>their thoughts on common law. We can therefore look to the common law to<br>determine their intentions.\<br>\<br>William Blackstone\'s *Commentaries* which addressed issues of common<br>law were influential at the time of the formation of the new government,<br>both in Britain and in America. Blackstone said, \"Self-defense \\...\<br>is justly called the primary law of nature.\" Since self-defense is a<br>law of nature, it was also considered to be a \"natural right.\"<br>Therefore, an armed population was necessary to preserve that right. He<br>went on to say, \"The subjects of England are entitled to the right of<br>having and using arms for self-preservation and defense.\" When the<br>Constitution was formed, this was a plainly understood undergirding<br>idea. Even some of the laws in the colonies reflected that colonists<br>were required to be armed.\<br>\<br>The Founders also knew that the first step in enslaving a population was<br>to disarm them. During the Virginia Convention, George Mason stated,<br>\"Forty years ago, when the resolution of enslaving America was formed<br>in Great Britain, the British Parliament was advised by an artful man<br>\\...\ to disarm the people.\"\<br>\<br>The Founders, therefore, expected the population to always keep and bear<br>arms at all times, and not just because they were part of the militia.<br>They were expected to maintain \"self-preservation and defense\" and to<br>be able at all times to resist tyranny.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
