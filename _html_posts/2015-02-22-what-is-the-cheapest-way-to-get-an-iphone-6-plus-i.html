<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [The cheapest way is to use Verizon, who still exclusively<br>subsidizes phones for customers. I believe AT&T will subsidize your<br>phone if you want the contract. I\'m pretty sure that T-Mobile doesn\'t<br>have subsidies anymore. But the cheapest way to get the phone is to get<br>it subsidized by the carrier and to sign a 2-year agreement.\<br>\<br>Using programs like AT&T Next or T-Mobile JUMP doesn\'t get you a<br>cheaper phone. It actually costs you more, more than double, for the<br>actual phone.\<br>\<br>For example, (totally made up numbers, btw) let\'s say you can get a<br>6plus from AT&T for \$199 on contract. You pay a total of \$199 for the<br>phone, and you have to keep it for two years. You could also get it for<br>\"\$0 down\" and \$20 per month, no contract. Your monthly \"line access<br>charge\" will be much lower to account for the monthly phone charge, but<br>over 2 years, you actually pay \$480 for the phone, because there is no<br>carrier subsidy because you are not locked into a contract. If you<br>cancel, you have to return the phone, which the carrier sells to get<br>refurbished and reused. It\'s a win-win for the carrier. No more paying<br>out subsidies, no more contracts which people hate (when most people<br>stay anyway), and they get all the devices back to<br>resell.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
