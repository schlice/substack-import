That weapon has no fewer than one external<br>and three internal safeties which only moved when the trigger moved.<br>Although no one ever tried it, my instructor claimed that you could<br>hammer nails with a loaded M9, striking right on the hammer at the<br>rear of the firearm, and it would not discharge.<br><br>Assuming a normally functioning firearm, and under normal conditions, if<br>the trigger does not move, the gun does not fire.
