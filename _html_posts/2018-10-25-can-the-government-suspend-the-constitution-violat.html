<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Can the government suspend the constitution & violate human rights<br>during wartime?**<br><br>*(US answer)*<br><br>In short, no.<br><br>The Constitution is never suspended, and the power of martial law is<br>actually laid out in the Constitution:<br><br>> *The Privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended,<br>> unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may<br>> require it.*<br><br>*Habeas corpus* is the right to a hearing when being lawfully<br>imprisoned. More broadly, it is the oversight by the judiciary of law<br>enforcement. The imposition of martial law suspends habeas corpus, and<br>allows law enforcement to imprison people without due process in order<br>to quell insurrections or invasions. Martial law is also governed by<br>several notable Supreme Court decisions, as well as the *Posse Comitatus<br>Act*, which prevents the military from enforcing civilian laws without<br>Congressional approval.<br><br>The Constitution remains in full force and effect even during periods of<br>martial law.<br><br>Additionally, human rights in general are not defined in the<br>Constitution, unless you're referring to the Bill of Rights as "human<br>rights." Human rights existed before the Constitution, and would still<br>exist even if "the Constitution was suspended."<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
