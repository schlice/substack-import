<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The Eufy SoloCam S220 is unique because it requires no subscription fees<br>to run. It is completely self-contained, with its own onboard 8GB<br>storage. However, you can also connect it to an optional HomeBase 3<br>unit, which has expandable memory. Additionally, cloud storage is<br>*available* for a fee, but it is not required. The HomeBase gives<br>you some additional features, like AI face detection.<br><br>It is battery powered, and has a built-in solar panel. Only two hours of<br>direct sunlight a day is enough to keep the batteries essentially<br>charged forever.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
