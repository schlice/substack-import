<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The reason why you need to learn CPR in person, as [[Matthew<br>Higgins](https://www.quora.com/profile/Matthew-Higgins-25)]{.qlink_container}<br>stated, is because of one simple thing: **doing chest compressions is a<br>lot harder than it looks.**<br><br>Doing some Internet-based training \"in a pinch\" may do more harm than<br>good. I\'d really discourage you from doing that.<br><br>Chest compressions are difficult. You have to displace (move) the<br>breastbone much farther than you realize. It has to move several inches.<br>And if you place your hands incorrectly, you can injure the patient more<br>than they will be injured by chest compressions.<br><br>Chest compressions, if done correctly, will break ribs. But to be<br>honest, I\'d rather have a few broken ribs and be alive than have an<br>intact ribcage in my coffin.<br><br>It\'s a lot harder to do than you think. Most people do it wrong the<br>first time. Make sure that the first time you do it is not on a person.<br>Most people who have taken CPR and First Aid training have used a<br>\"Resusci-Annie.\" This human analog is nothing more than a human torso<br>designed to respond similar to a human chest when performing<br>compressions. The more advanced units will indicate when the compression<br>is effective, and the trainer will tell you on each compression whether<br>or not you\'re doing it right. It\'s the most effective way to learn<br>CPR. You must learn it by feel, not by video.<br><br>Contact your local Red Cross chapter to see when you can take their next<br>CPR/First Aid class.<br><br>If you don\'t have a Red Cross chapter nearby, contact your local fire<br>department.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
