<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>According to the Americans with Disabilities Act, this is a reasonable<br>accommodation (emphasis mine):<br><br>> Examples of reasonable accommodations include making existing<br>> facilities accessible; job restructuring; **part-time or modified work<br>> schedules**; acquiring or modifying equipment; changing tests,<br>> training materials, or policies; providing qualified readers or<br>> interpreters; and reassignment to a vacant position.<br><br>That said, the employer is not unreasonably cutting your hours. You were<br>only going to be working for 5 1/2 hours anyway, assuming they gave you<br>a 30 minute break. Cutting your hours to 4 hours does not change the<br>essential nature of the job (it's still a part-time job), and since they<br>are only cutting your hours from 5 1/2 to 4, they are only cutting 1 1/2<br>hours from your work day. If it is easier for them to schedule that as a<br>business, it sounds like it would be a reasonable accommodation.<br><br>I understand you're losing hours, but modifying your schedule in this<br>way is probably not something you can consider unreasonable from a<br>business perspective, and it appears to me to be reasonable.<br><br>However, if this is a major concern to you (I know it is because you're<br>losing hours), you should consider contacting an employment attorney who<br>is knowledgeable about ADA law in your state.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
