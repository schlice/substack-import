<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What\'s the maximum period of time a person can be sentenced for<br>contempt of court for refusing to comply with a judge\'s request (like<br>answering a question)? Also, could a person be sent to a maximum<br>security prison for contempt?**<br><br>In the United States, civil contempt charges are not subject to the<br>principle of proportionality. In theory. a person can be held in<br>contempt indefinitely. A circuit court decision in 2002 (*Chadwick v.<br>Janecka)* stated this. The defendant in that case, H. Beatty Chadwick,<br>was held in contempt for 14 years, the longest contempt confinement in<br>history.<br><br>It's unlikely that someone would be sent to maximum security over a<br>contempt charge, but it's up to the state (or the Marshal's service for<br>federal contempt charges) to decide where prisoners are housed.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
