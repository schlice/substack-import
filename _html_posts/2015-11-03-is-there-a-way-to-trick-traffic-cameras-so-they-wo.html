<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>*Please Note: In almost all states, any device or treatment which<br>obscures your license plate (and paint would be included) is*<br>*illegal* *to have on your car while you\'re on the road. Check your<br>state rules before using any of these products. Being caught with any of<br>them could get you a ticket.*<br><br>Yes, there are a number of solutions that allow your license plate to be<br>obscured in such a way that when a camera tries to view your plate, it<br>is obscured.<br><br>One such tool is a variation of a Fresnel lens. When your plate is<br>viewed straight on, it is visible. But from a high angle (such as where<br>a camera would be located), the plate is obscured.<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-f07a31ae69a78c897d9edf48688a207c){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-f07a31ae69a78c897d9edf48688a207c" master_w="437"<br>master_h="226"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>A second solution attacks the problem of red light cameras taking flash<br>photos of your plate. Have you ever taken a picture of a street sign?<br>Have you noticed how washed out the image of the sign is? Signs use a<br>highly-reflective gloss paint (originally created by 3M) to reflect as<br>much light back as possible. It\'s used in road stripe paint and signage<br>paint all over the world. Now imagine spraying that clear-coat<br>high-gloss reflective substance on your license plate, and what the<br>impact would be to a camera which takes flash pictures:<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-ce9b6c705edfeee1b3fe846af897d78b){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-ce9b6c705edfeee1b3fe846af897d78b" master_w="400"<br>master_h="150"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>You can tell that the contrast was turned up in the second photo, but<br>still, you get the idea.<br><br>There is a third system which is more technological, and is built into a<br>license plate frame. It detects the flash from the camera and activates<br>several bright infrared LEDs around the license plate to similarly<br>\"blind\" the camera to the contents of your plate.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
