<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If there is no direct evidence of Jesus being from any particular race<br>why is it bad to let the artist have their own interpretation of<br>Jesus?**<br><br>It's not "bad" to let artists use creative license. It happens all the<br>time.<br><br>The problem is not the *helpfulness* of the representation, but the<br>*truth* behind it. Any time we portray Jesus with an image, we<br>*constrain* our thinking and our praying to that image, and Jesus as God<br>is so much more than an image.<br><br>As J. I. Packer says in his book, *Knowing God:*<br><br>> *\T\he pathos of the crucufix obscures the glory of Christ, for it<br>> hides the fact of his deity, his victory on the cross, and his present<br>> kingdom...\T\he symbol is unworthy most of all because of what it<br>> fails to display. And so are all other visible representations of<br>> deity.*<br>><br>> *\I\mages will falsify the truth of God in the minds of men...\I\f<br>> you habitually focus your thoughts on an image or picture of the One<br>> to whom you are going to pray, you will come to think of him, and pray<br>> to him, as the image represents him. Thus you will in a sense "bow<br>> down" and "worship" your image; and to the extent to which the image<br>> fails to tell the truth about God, to that extent you will fail to<br>> worship God in truth.*<br><br>So it's not "bad" to allow artistic license in depictions of Jesus. It's<br>bad for us, the people who see the images, because we end up forming an<br>image of Jesus which is not, and can never be, an accurate depiction of<br>his deity. To the extent that the image fails to represent the truth<br>about God, we fail to actually worship God, and so our worship ends up<br>falling short.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
