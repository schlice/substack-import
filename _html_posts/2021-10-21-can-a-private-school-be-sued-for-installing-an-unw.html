<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>First of all, virtually anyone can be sued for virtually anything, so<br>sure, a school can be sued.<br><br>The question then is about whether or not you will be successful in your<br>suit.<br><br>And the answer depends heavily on circumstances.<br><br>Chances are, you connected to the school\'s WiFi. And chances are that<br>when you did so, a consent form popped up which you didn\'t read (no one<br>ever does) which probably stated, in part, that the school retains the<br>right to monitor your activity while you use their resources. So chances<br>are that you actually did consent to monitoring.<br><br>Sometimes, schools make students sign IT consent forms at the beginning<br>of the school year, and those agreements normally cover any device a<br>student brings to school or connects to a school resource.<br><br>So you would then have to prove that they were monitoring your activity<br>while you were *not* connected to the school WiFi, which would have<br>violated the agreement you already digitally accepted.<br><br>So unless you can show that they were monitoring you while you were away<br>from the school in violation of the initial agreement, then they likely<br>retain the right to monitor any device which uses the school WiFi or is<br>used in the school, whatever the text of the agreement said.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Can a private school be sued for installing an unwanted<br>parenting/spyware app on students' personal devices they bought<br>themselves and the school has no legal access to?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
