<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Since states, counties and cities make laws, it would be impossible for<br>us to say how any one of those thousands of entities across the United<br>States may or may not regulate what HOAs are allowed to do.<br><br>But in general, the answer is no. States, counties, and cities *usually*<br>leave HOAs to govern their areas as they see fit in order to accomplish<br>their stated goals. They generally do not put provisions on what HOA<br>rules must say and what they must not say. Even here in Florida, the<br>land where the HOA was born, the strict state laws surrounding HOAs only<br>say in the broadest terms what rules HOAs cannot make. For example, our<br>most recent state law change with respect to HOAs stated that an HOA<br>cannot regulate what cannot be seen from neighboring properties in a<br>home's back yard. So if you want to install a pool, or if you want to<br>put artificial turf in your back yard, the HOA cannot regulate that.<br><br>If the HOA rule is "no overnight street parking," and the rule was duly<br>enacted in accordance with the HOA's Governing Documents, then the HOA<br>is legally permitted to pursue its stated discipline schedule when<br>homeowners violate those rules.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
