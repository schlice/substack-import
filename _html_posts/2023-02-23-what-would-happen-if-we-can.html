<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>If you can't find proof of God's existence, you aren't looking. You<br>don't even have to look hard.<br><br>The question is what will you accept as proof.<br><br>Will you only accept what can be physically or empirically tested? Will<br>you only accept *physical proof*? Well that doesn't make sense, because<br>plenty of things exist, things we know exist, that are not physical. Why<br>would you put God in a different category? Accepting that certain things<br>exist that are not physical but then demanding that God must be proven<br>empirically or physically, seems only to be the case if you are trying<br>to build your test in such a way as to ensure that God cannot pass.<br><br>And science can't prove everything. Some things simply cannot be proven<br>by science. Just off the top of my head, I can give you five examples of<br>rational beliefs that cannot be proven by science:<br><br>1.  mathematics and logic (science can't prove them because science<br>    presupposes them),<br>2.  metaphysical truths (such as, there are minds that exist other than<br>    my own),<br>3.  ethical judgments (you can't prove by science that the Nazis were<br>    evil, because morality is not subject to the scientific method),<br>4.  aesthetic judgments (the beautiful, like the good, cannot be<br>    scientifically proven), and, ironically<br>5.  science itself (the belief that the scientific method discovers<br>    truth can't be proven by the scientific method itself).<br><br>So what kind of proof does exist? Why should we believe anything at all?<br>The proof is found in logic and reason, timeless principles of any<br>scientific inquiry.<br><br>We can prove, through logic, that a creator God exists. God's existence<br>is evidenced by:<br><br>- the beginning of the universe (Cosmological Argument)<br>- the design of the universe (Teleological Argument/Anthropic Principle)<br>- the design of life (Teleological Argument)<br>- the Moral Law (Moral Argument)<br><br>These are sound, logical proofs that show, beyond a reasonable doubt,<br>that God exists.<br><br>\<br><br>But God has left *just enough ambiguity* in the world to not coerce<br>anyone who isn't willing to believe. In other words, God won't convince<br>you, and I can't convince you, ***if you aren't already willing to<br>believe.***<br><br>The reason: God values your free will. God is love, and love can<br>only be freely given; it can never be coerced. So God will never do more<br>than *woo* you, so to speak. And He wants it that way.<br><br>So if your first instinct is to say, "You can't prove God exists, and<br>you never will," you're absolutely right. With that attitude, you'll<br>never believe in God's existence.<br><br>So it's not on me to convince you of anything. It's on you to be<br>actually willing to believe. Not listening to the proofs as a skeptic,<br>because you'll always be skeptical, and you'll always find something to<br>be skeptical about. That's by design. That means that your free will is<br>still intact.<br><br>It is only when you seek Him with all of your heart that you'll find<br>Him.<br><br>> "For I know the plans I have for you," declares the Lord, "plans to<br>> prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.<br>> Then you will call on me and come and pray to me, and I will listen to<br>> you. You will seek me and find me when you seek me with all your<br>> heart. I will be found by you," declares the Lord. --- Jeremiah<br>> 29:11--14 NIV<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
