<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Ah, an excellent question!<br><br>I do find it fascinating that if you were to ask an Evolutionist or a<br>Darwinist the same question, they would unequivocally tell you that all<br>humans descended from primates. *So the atheists actually agree with the<br>theists that humans all came from common ancestors.*<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-c976809032ec1d77d6838b8377327e0e){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-c976809032ec1d77d6838b8377327e0e"<br>master_w="1280" master_h="960"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>*"So then, how do you explain the different races?"*<br><br>As a theist, I'm going to give you the most non-theistic answer:<br>evolution.<br><br>*WHAT?????? THEISTS ADMIT THAT EVOLUTION HAPPENED?*<br><br>Oh yes. We've said it all along, because *we have seen it with our own<br>eyes, and in our own lifetimes.*<br><br>Specifically, it's called *microevolution*. We also commonly refer to it<br>as *adaptation*. Small changes wherein a species adapts to its<br>surroundings. For example, when bacteria are attacked by antibiotics,<br>some survive because the parent bacteria possessed the genetic capacity<br>to resist, or a rare biochemical mutation somehow helped it survive (we<br>say "rare" because mutations are nearly always harmful). It passes that<br>capacity or mutation on to its offspring. The evolutionist would say,<br>"Yes, the bacteria *evolved."* We agree, they did. But in what way? The<br>theist observes that throughout all of these mutations and generations,<br>*the bacteria always remain bacteria.* They never become frogs or<br>elephants. So categorizing the evolution (and calling it what it is,<br>pointing out what it is not), is critical when we discuss evolution.<br><br>*"But races are sooooo different! They must have evolved separately!"*<br><br>Well actually, they're not. In actuality, there is only one race: the<br>human race. The differences between the "races" are actually so small as<br>to be trivial. The variations in DNA between individual humans is<br>approximately 0.2%. Of this difference, only 6% of that is ethnic<br>differences.<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-8ccc59832d05889985996d3930f91720){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-8ccc59832d05889985996d3930f91720" master_w="397"<br>master_h="251"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>*(Image courtesy*<br>[*ChristianAnswers.net*(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=5551dd&url=https://christiananswers.net/q-aig/race-definition.html){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="christiananswers.net"}]{.qlink_container}*)*<br><br>The similarity between humans, even between humans of different races,<br>is so great that, in practice, black people are often better tissue<br>matches for white people than other white people.<br><br>That's quite a telling data point. Humans aren't very different from<br>each other.<br><br>*"So back to the differences. How did they happen?"*<br><br>So let's discuss our differences. There are four main ethnic groups of<br>human beings, according to anthropologists:<br><br>- Caucasoid (European or "white"),<br>- Mongoloid (which includes the Chinese, Inuit or Eskimo, and Native<br>  Americans)<br>- Negroid (black Africans), and<br>- Australoid (the Australian Aborigines).<br><br>Within those four main groups can exist subgroups. But even between the<br>ethnic groups, everyone has all the same stuff. No one ethnic group has<br>*something* that another ethnic group *lacks.* For example, everyone has<br>melanin in their skin. Negroid people simply routinely express more than<br>Caucasoid, and this is likely a function of where they primarily lived<br>for thousands of years. Also, look at eyes. The typical almond-shaped<br>Asian eye has exactly the same structural makeup as the traditional<br>Caucasoid eye, but the Asian eye has a different amount of fat around<br>it. They both have fat, but one has more, and the other has less.<br><br>I posit that the differences between ethnic groups is far less than<br>people think. Calling us different "races" just makes this confusion<br>even stronger.<br><br>\<br><br>Wanna hear the craziest modern-day hot take?<br><br>Based on everything I just told you, **transracism is more biologically<br>conceivable than transgenderism**.<br><br>Oof, that's a hot take right there! Yep, it is more biologically correct<br>for a white person to claim they are black than it is for a man to claim<br>he is a woman. But ask the average American on the street and they'll<br>tell you that a man can be a woman but a white man can't be a black man.<br><br>Marinate on that one for a while.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
