<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**How long does the House have to turnover the impeachment to the<br>Senate?**<br><br>There is no Constitutionally-defined timeframe within which the House<br>must turn over Articles of Impeachment to the Senate.<br><br>But why delay?<br><br>Pelosi has no control over how the Senate conducts business, just as<br>McConnell had no control over how the House conducted its<br>investigations.<br><br>What's she afraid of?<br><br>She's said all along that she did her duty by filing the Articles. Now<br>it's up to the Senate to take them and do their thing with them. That<br>part is out of her hands.<br><br>She claimed just a few weeks ago that we couldn't wait until 2020 to<br>vote Trump out. He was such an existential threat to democracy that we<br>had to push forward with impeachment.<br><br>What changed today? Why withhold the Articles of Impeachment from the<br>Senate? What happened to the "existential threat" to our democracy?<br><br>So is she trying to control how the Senate conducts its business?<br>Constitutionally, she has no say in that decision. She should not<br>attempt to influence the Senate, just as McConnell did not try to<br>influence how the House did its business.<br><br>She simply cannot have the Senate acquit Trump. He can't be "impeached<br>and acquitted." If he won't be convicted, she's going to ensure that he<br>is only "impeached" and nothing more. If he's acquitted, then the<br>Articles were meaningless. If he's "not acquitted" then the Articles<br>still have meaning, even if by "not acquitted" it's never went to trial.<br><br>However, the argument can be made that if the articles never go to the<br>Senate, he's not really impeached. Impeachment is a process, not a vote.<br>She must complete the process, or she appears to be the one with the<br>ulterior motive.<br><br>It's a disaster for Democrats right now, and it becomes clearer every<br>day that they are grasping at straws for whatever advantage they can<br>garner in 2020.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
