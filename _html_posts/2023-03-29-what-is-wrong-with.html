<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I'm not sure what you mean by "selling" the Gospel. [[Brandon<br>J.C.](https://www.quora.com/profile/Brandon-J-C)]{.qlink_container}<br>discussed "selling" the Gospel using monetary terms, which would imply<br>that some wouldn't be able to "afford" it.<br><br>I don't think you mean it that way. I think you mean "selling" the<br>Gospel in terms of "trying to sell someone on the idea of the Gospel"<br>and there is absolutely nothing wrong with that.<br><br>It's a practice common in the Christian churches of today called<br>*evangelism*. Evangelism is the process by which we take the Gospel and<br>we physically deliver it to those who have not received it yet. We can<br>do this physically (with a Bible), verbally (with our speech), or even<br>electronically (download the free YouVersion app).<br><br>We learn the tools to "sell" the Gospel through a discipline called<br>*apologetics*. Apologetics comes from *apologia,* the Latin word for<br>apology, which itself comes from the Greek word ἀπολογία, which means<br>\"speaking in defense.\"<br><br>We bring the word of the Lord to people (evangelism) by explaining and<br>defending our faith (apologetics).<br><br>If that's how you "sell" the Gospel message, *everyone should be buying.<br>Best of all,* *it's free!* Except that if you do accept the message,<br>you'll have to repent of your sin and stop acting sinfully. You may have<br>to change your entire life. So while it is free, it could cost you your<br>life. *It costs nothing, but it could cost everything.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
