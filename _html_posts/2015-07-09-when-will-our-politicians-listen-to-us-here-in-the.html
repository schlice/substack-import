<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [It appears that either the law didn\'t apply, or the<br>redneck gun nut you speak of broke the laws.\<br>\<br>How will \"more laws\" have stopped him?\<br>\<br>Name one law that would have stopped the racist redneck gun nut you<br>speak of. There is no law that would have stopped him, as he already<br>quite possibly broke laws to do what he did.\<br>\<br>By passing more laws, you are, in effect, \"doing something.\" However,<br>passing more laws won\'t actually \"accomplish anything,\" like<br>preventing more racist redneck gun nuts from actually obtaining guns<br>(by, oh, breaking the law) and continuing to do what they do.\<br>\<br>If you\'re more interested in \"doing something\" than \"accomplishing<br>something,\" then you should leave the law-making to the big<br>boys.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
