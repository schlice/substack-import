<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Wouldn't Trump have a stronger case if he didn't ignore congress and<br>obstruct justice while they probed him, then investigations unveiled<br>Democratic wrongdoing?**<br><br>You might think so, but you'd be forgetting that little thing called<br>*separation of powers* and *checks and balances.*<br><br>Congress does not lord over the President. In fact, the founders were<br>extremely worried that the legislature would turn the Presidency into<br>nothing more than its puppet, and would just rubber-stamp everything<br>that came across his desk. To that end, they set up a system of checks<br>and balances between the three *co-equal* branches of government. To<br>counter their fears about the legislature running the Presidency, they<br>made a unitary Executive, and endowed him with the full authority of law<br>enforcement. The Congress, for its part, can check the Executive with<br>two powers: the power to defund Federal agencies, and the power of<br>impeachment.<br><br>Now, on to the charges in your "question."<br><br>First of all, he's not "ignoring Congress." He's responding directly to<br>Congress. Whether or not that response can be Constitutionally justified<br>remains to be seen, but he's most definitely not ignoring them. He is<br>asserting his position that the Executive is a co-equal branch of<br>government and cannot be bullied by an overreaching legislature, which<br>is what he believes is going on.<br><br>Secondly, "obstruction of justice" is a crime. If the President were<br>committing a crime, it's up to Congress to file Articles of Impeachment,<br>as that is their remedy when the President commits a crime. The fact<br>that they have not yet impeached the President means that either they<br>don't believe strongly enough that he actually committed a crime, or<br>there is no political will to impeach the President. Either way, they<br>can wring their hands and whine about "cover-ups" and "a fleecing of<br>America" all they want, but they have the power to impeach the President<br>at any time they want. Clearly, Congress' complaints are just "sound and<br>fury, signifying nothing."<br><br>Finally, I have no doubt that investigations into the beginnings of the<br>Russia collusion hoax will indeed reveal that the FBI and our<br>intelligence apparatus unlawfully opened counterintelligence<br>investigations into the President and his campaign by knowingly using<br>opposition research in a deceptive way as "evidence" that such an<br>investigation needed to be opened, in order to extract political gain.<br>The Attorney General and the Inspector General at the FBI and the DOJ<br>are all already conducting those investigations, because the whole thing<br>stinks, and it's their job to find the source of the odor.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
