<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If you are picked up and have a warrant and are arrested and put in<br>the police car is it legal for the cops to take you to another person\'s<br>residence to arrest them also?**<br><br>While it is unsafe and generally a bad idea, it's not technically<br>illegal. If the police have a manning shortage and can't task another<br>car to pick someone else up, they may do this, but it would be<br>surprising and highly unusual to do so.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
