<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Yes, if your parents call the police to bring you home. **But if you're<br>worried that your parents will bring you back home after you leave, then<br>you're not doing it right.**<br><br>If you're already living away from your parents, emancipation might be<br>the right choice for you. Or if you're already working and you want to<br>be able to manage your own money.<br><br>Here's the trick: in order to be able to substantiate an order of<br>emancipation in Vermont, you have to be living on your own for at least<br>three months, among other things:<br><br>- You are at least 16 years old<br>- You have lived separate from your parents, custodian, or legal<br>  guardian for three months or longer<br>- You are managing your own financial affairs<br>- You have demonstrated the ability to be self-sufficient in your<br>  financial affairs and can provide proof of employment or other support<br>  (\"other support\" does not include general assistance, Reach Up<br>  benefits, or relying upon the financial resources of someone receiving<br>  assistance or aid)<br>- You either hold a high school diploma or are earning a passing grade<br>  in an educational program approved by the court and directed toward<br>  the earning of a high school diploma or its equivalent<br>- You are not under legal guardianship or in the custody of the<br>  Commissioner of Social and Rehabilitation Services or the Commissioner<br>  of Corrections<br>- Your emancipation is in your best interests considering such factors<br>  as whether you will be able to assume adult responsibilities; your<br>  adjustment to being on your own; the opinion of your parents,<br>  custodian, or guardian; and whether the emancipation will create a<br>  risk of harm to you.\[1\](#tQtgH){#cite-tQtgH .citation_link}<br><br>So two things stand out to me:<br><br>1.  You have to be living on your own for at least three months, if not<br>    more. If your parents call the police to bring a missing child home,<br>    you won't be able to claim emancipation because you haven't been on<br>    your own, handling your own affairs, for three months.<br>2.  Your parents opinion is part of the consideration of the court as to<br>    whether or not you will be granted emancipation.<br><br>What these two things tell me is that *if you don't have your parents'<br>cooperation, you'll not be granted emancipation* and will simply have to<br>wait until you turn 18.<br><br>I think this is a great opportunity to have a very meaningful discussion<br>with your parents about how you can make it on your own, they should<br>give you the chance, etc. Because if they don't, I can just imagine that<br>you can make the next two years a pretty hellish experience (as they can<br>for you as well; those two years won't be fun for any of you). So rather<br>than go through it that way, it's best to sit down with them and review<br>your plans and the actual feasibility of them, **and get them to buy in<br>to your plan.** If you do well for at least three months on your own and<br>then you meet all of the requirements in Vermont to request legal<br>emancipation, you should get your parents to agree to allow it.<br><br>Sign a contract with them. If you can meet the requirements, they let<br>you go. If you can't, you agree to stay at home and follow your parents'<br>rules until you turn 18.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Will the police bring me back to my parents if I move out, even if I\'m<br>safe and self-sufficient? I\'m 16 from Vermont.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-tQtgH){.citation_index} [[Emancipation of<br>Minors](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=7baa0a&url=https://www.vermontjudiciary.org/probate/emancipation-minors){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="vermontjudiciary.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
