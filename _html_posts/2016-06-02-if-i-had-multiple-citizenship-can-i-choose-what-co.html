<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The only thing that dual (or multiple) citizenship gives you is the<br>right to live in either country without having to immigrate.<br><br>Once you have chosen a country to live in, you are required to follow<br>all of the laws of that country. Citizenship is not what determines<br>which set of laws you get to follow, presence does.<br><br>Consider this example. As a tourist visiting another country, I'm still<br>bound by the laws of the country I'm visiting. Violating those laws<br>would get me thrown in that country's jail. Claiming ignorance will only<br>get you so far. Claiming that you're not bound by that country's laws<br>because you're not a citizen will get you nowhere at all. At best, it<br>will get you a one-way ticket home.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
