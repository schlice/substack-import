<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Seek professional help.\<br>\<br>It\'s not a bad thing to say \"I need help coping with this. I need help<br>processing this.\"\<br>\<br>It doesn\'t make you \"mentally ill\" to seek the advice of a<br>professional therapist to discuss your issues. I know there are lots of<br>stigmas surrounding psychology, but these people are professionals. They<br>can help you cope with it and move on with your life, which frankly you<br>should have done by now, which makes it all the more critical that you<br>seek professional help, the sooner the better.\<br>\<br>Seeking advice on Quora also doesn\'t count as professional medical<br>advice.]<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*This answer is not professional medical advice**, nor is it a<br>substitute for professional medical advice.
