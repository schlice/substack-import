<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Wikipedia is very illuminating on this one:<br><br>> The settlement a person receives for their pain and suffering depends<br>> on many factors. This includes the severity of the injury, type of<br>> medical treatment received, the length of recovery time, and potential<br>> long term consequences of the personal injuries. In addition to<br>> physical pain, claimants can also cite emotional and psychological<br>> trauma in their pain and suffering claims. For example, a visible scar<br>> on the face can lead to painful feelings of constant embarrassment and<br>> insecurity.<br>><br>> The amount of money damages a claimant gets for pain and suffering<br>> will also depend upon the amount claimed in a lawsuit if such is filed<br>> or the amount demanded to the responsible party in the underlying<br>> claim if it is an insurance claim. Even though a lawyer representing a<br>> client in an injury negligence-based lawsuit may claim a certain<br>> amount for pain and suffering, the jury or the insurance adjuster will<br>> award pain and suffering money for differing reasons. In practice,<br>> historically tort cases involving personal injury often involve<br>> contingent fees, with attorneys being paid a portion of the pain and<br>> suffering damages; one commentator says a typical split of pain and<br>> suffering is one-third for the lawyer, one-third for the physician,<br>> and one-third for the plaintiff.<br>><br>> Jury awards for pain and suffering may vary depending upon<br>> socio-economic and political factors within the community from which<br>> the jury is drawn. In most states the maximum monetary amount awarded<br>> for pain and suffering is capped at what is listed in the particular<br>> suit or written complaint. In some jurisdictions there are maximum<br>> amounts set in law which a jury may not exceed in awarding damages.<br>><br>> The personality of the plaintiff, their witnesses and overall effect<br>> of the injuries which befell the victim plaintiff will play a powerful<br>> role in any damage award if damages are even awarded once liability<br>> issues are satisfied. The power and personality of the lawyer<br>> representing her or his client also may factor into a high money<br>> damage award case.<br>><br>> Such awards may follow in house insurance guidelines with some leeway<br>> granted to adjusters to adjust the claim in order to prevent the claim<br>> from being fully litigated in court. There is a wide range of levels<br>> of compensation which may fluctuate seasonally and with the economy<br>> and dictates of the insurance industry setting the varying levels of<br>> compensation to claimants. Some insurers have experimented with using<br>> computers which tabulate the data that is presented and grant the<br>> adjuster a level of money authority for which to settle the<br>> claim.\[1\](#wWzwP){#cite-wWzwP .citation_link}<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-wWzwP){.citation_index} [[Pain and suffering -<br>Wikipedia](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=bff372&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain_and_suffering){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
