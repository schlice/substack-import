<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [[[Tim<br>Dees](https://www.quora.com/profile/Tim-Dees)]{.qlink_container} has a<br>great answer. He is right, this happens everywhere.\<br>\<br>I have seen it famously happen in the military. As told to me by a<br>former aircraft maintenance tech, he would be taught how to work on a<br>particular avionics component by first reading through the \"Dash 1\",<br>or the official maintenance manual. Once they did it \"by the book,\"<br>the supervisor would set the book aside and say, \"Okay, now here\'s how<br>we *really* do it,\" and the unapproved method would undoubtedly be<br>twice as fast, three times as simple, didn\'t make the component unsafe,<br>and was one of those head-scratchers, as in \"why doesn\'t the book have<br>you do it this way?\"\<br>\<br>In all things, I think, there is \"the way it is,\" and \"the way it<br>ought to be.\"\<br>\<br>I will disagree that police are more prone to this than others; police<br>not following the rules can, at best, get a charge dropped because<br>evidentiary procedures were not followed, or, at worst, get someone<br>killed. Tim pointed out a few ways cops \"don\'t follow the rules,\" but<br>I would say that the consequences for cops not following the rules are<br>much greater than someone not following the exact maintenance procedure<br>in the book. And someone will likely notice a cop not following the<br>rules, so I think today\'s ubiquitous cameras-everywhere society will<br>make it harder and harder for cops to step out of line at<br>all.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
