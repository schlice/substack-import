<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If you were offered 500 dollars to wear a level III bulletproof vest<br>and let someone empty a snub nosed 38 special revolver into you at short<br>range for testing, would you volunteer?**<br><br>No way. Not because I'm afraid of getting shot, but because if you<br>believe the vest needs to be on a *person* instead of an *analog* in<br>order to have a valid test, then your test is obviously flawed.<br><br>Placing the vest on a human analog will provide exactly the same force<br>feedback on the obverse side of the vest as a human chest would. Some<br>human analogs actually have human skeletons and human organs inside of<br>them to more accurately reproduce the force feedback that would result<br>from a trauma to that analog.<br><br>In other words, there is *simply no amount of money* that would<br>necessitate shooting at a real person for testing.<br><br>And even if there were an amount of money that would convince someone to<br>allow themselves to be shot in a vest, \$500 is most certainly not it.<br>You're missing quite a few zeros.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
