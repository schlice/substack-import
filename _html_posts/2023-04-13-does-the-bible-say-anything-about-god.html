<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Of course it does.<br><br>*But! But! But! It never directly says \"abortion!\"*<br><br>This is true; the Bible never specifically says the word "abortion." But<br>there are abundant Scriptural references that make God's position on<br>abortion crystal clear.<br><br>> "Before I formed you in the womb I knew you,\<br>> and before you were born I consecrated you;\<br>> I appointed you a prophet to the nations." --- Jeremiah 1:5 ESV<br><br>This says that God knew us before He formed us in the womb.<br><br>> For you formed my inward parts;\<br>> you knitted me together in my mother's womb.\<br>> I praise you, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made.\<br>> Wonderful are your works;\<br>> my soul knows it very well.\<br>> My frame was not hidden from you,\<br>> when I was being made in secret,\<br>> intricately woven in the depths of the earth.\<br>> Your eyes saw my unformed substance;\<br>> in your book were written, every one of them,\<br>> the days that were formed for me,\<br>> when as yet there was none of them. --- Psalm 139:13--16<br><br>This psalm talks about God's direct role in our creation and formation<br>in the womb.<br><br>> "When men strive together and hit a pregnant woman, so that her<br>> children come out, but there is no harm, the one who hit her shall<br>> surely be fined, as the woman's husband shall impose on him, and he<br>> shall pay as the judges determine. But if there is harm, then you<br>> shall pay life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand,<br>> foot for foot, burn for burn, wound for wound, stripe for stripe. ---<br>> Exodus 21:22--25<br><br>So let's talk about Exodus 21, which abortion advocates believe means<br>that the Bible condones abortion because it's "a property crime if the<br>baby dies, but if the mother dies, it's murder."<br><br>Not quite. This passage prescribes the same penalty---death---for<br>someone who causes the death of a baby in the womb as for someone who<br>commits murder. This law and its punishment clearly indicate that God<br>considers a baby in the womb to be just as much a human being as a<br>full-grown adult.<br><br>In other words, if the only consequence of the men's fighting was that<br>the woman gave birth prematurely, but she and the baby were ultimately<br>unharmed, then the worst that would happen was that the offender would<br>pay a fine determined by the husband and approved by the judges. The law<br>did not address every loss or consequence, but it did ensure that<br>*permanent* consequences were justly compensated.<br><br>If the mother, baby, or both were injured, the husband of the baby's<br>mother, along with the judges, would decide on a fair punishment. If a<br>life was lost, however, the law specified that the offender would also<br>lose his life.<br><br>For Christians, abortion is not a matter of a woman's right to choose to<br>have a baby. The baby is already present and living. Abortion is a<br>matter of the life or death of a human being made in God's image<br><br>TL;DR: The Bible *very clearly* **says abortion is murder. It is<br>the unlawful, unjust killing of a human being created in the image of<br>God.**<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
