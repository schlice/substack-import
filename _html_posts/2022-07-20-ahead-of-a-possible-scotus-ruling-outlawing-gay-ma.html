<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>So the whole idea of this is utterly silly.<br><br>First, there is no "possible SCOTUS ruling outlawing gay marriage."<br>Maybe you're unaware of how the Supreme Court works, but first there<br>would have to be a law, and someone would have to break that law, and<br>then that someone would have to challenge the precedent in *Lawrence* or<br>in *Obergefell*, and that challenge would have to make it all the way to<br>the Supreme Court.<br><br>Justice Clarence Thomas wrote, in his *lone concurrence* on *Dobbs*.<br>that other substantive due process cases, like *Lawrence* and<br>*Obergefell*, should be reviewed if they come up. Notice that *no other<br>Justice joined him in his concurrence*. The idea of reviewing *Lawrence*<br>and *Obergefell* is even unpopular among the Justices. You'd need four<br>Justices to even agree to review a case challenging *Lawrence* or<br>*Obergefell*, and it's unlikely you'd be able to find four Justices that<br>are even interested in doing so.<br><br>Therefore, it's extremely unlikely that a case would ever make it to<br>SCOTUS to even challenge *Lawrence* or *Obergefell.*<br><br>However, somehow, the House saw this as a crisis. They found it<br>necessary to pass the Respect for Marriage Act. This bill would repeal<br>the Defense of Marriage Act, portions of which have already been<br>overturned by the *Lawrence* and *Obergefell* courts. The 267--157 vote<br>in the House paves the way to enshrine gay marriage in Federal law.<br><br>Except for the fact that this law is unnecessary. There is no threat to<br>gay marriage. This is nothing more than Democrats searching for a wedge<br>issue during a time when they are so utterly down in the polls and<br>Biden's approval numbers, and facing a red wave in November.<br><br>Some House Republicans labeled this bill as "a solution looking for a<br>problem." Rep. Mike Johnson, R-La., went further by calling the<br>legislation an election-year gimmick meant to give Democrats a wedge<br>issue in face of skyrocketing inflation and President Biden\'s low<br>approval numbers. \"There\'s not a single Republican even talking about<br>that or any of these other categories in the law,\" said Johnson, who<br>serves as vice chairman the House Republican Conference. \"This is<br>designed to divide the country. This bill is a shameful effort.\"<br><br>Additionally, this law would remove the rights of the states to decide<br>anything about marriage for themselves. And 35 states have already done<br>so. \"This legislation would reverse the law in 35 states,\" said Rep.<br>Jim Jordan, R-Ohio. \"In 30 of those 35 states, the people of those<br>respective states went to the ballot and voted for that .... it would<br>undo what the people \wanted\.\"<br><br>The bill now heads to the 50--50 Senate, where they currently do not<br>have the 10 votes they need to overcome the expected filibuster. So<br>unless something radically changes, this bill is DOA in the Senate.<br><br>This bill has virtually no chance of becoming law, but Democrats aren't<br>concerned about it passing. They're concerned about using it as a wedge<br>issue during a time when they really don't have much to campaign on.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Ahead of a possible SCOTUS ruling outlawing gay marriage, over 150 House<br>Republicans voted to not protect it. Does this vote reflect the opinion<br>of a majority of Americans?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
