<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>First of all, there is an axiom that you must understand: **For any<br>statement which begins with "Can God..." the answer is *Yes, God<br>can.***<br><br>So the default answer is yes, God can forgive lustful sin.<br><br>The truth is that we are all sinners. We have all fallen short of the<br>glory of God. But if we seek Him with all of our hearts, we will find<br>Him. If you truly desire to know Him, He will make Himself known.<br><br>> You will seek me and find me when you seek me with all your heart. ---<br>> Jeremiah 29:13 NIV<br><br>So the key here is *seeking Him with all of your heart.* You can't seek<br>Him but then retain your sinful ways. So you can't persist in lustful<br>sin while continuing to seek repentance.<br><br>If you truly repent (which is a word which indicates a *turning away*<br>from sin), you will desire to not sin in thought or deed. And when you<br>are saved, you will begin to change. The old thoughts and desires will<br>fade away, and you will become a new person in Christ.<br><br>We will fail, because we are human. But God will never abandon us. He<br>will not leave us. He will never think we are "beyond saving."<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Can God forgive lustful sin?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
