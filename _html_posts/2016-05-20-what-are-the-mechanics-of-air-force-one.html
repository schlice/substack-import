<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>To the best of my knowledge, AF1 lands the same as any other 747.<br>Granted, I only participated in landings and takeoffs of AF2, but the<br>plane is the same. I'm certain that they require all of the passengers<br>(including the President) to buckle up for takeoff and landing.<br><br>(EDIT) I think what you may be referring to is the fact that 1. the<br>pilots who fly this plane have thousands upon thousands of hours doing<br>so before they ever get the privilege of co-piloting that bird. Only the<br>best of the best heavy drivers get that privilege (which may explain the<br>really good landings), and 2. while you can advise the President that<br>it's time to sit down and buckle in, I bet he could safely ignore that<br>warning and do as he pleases without worrying that his flight crew will<br>turn him over to the local police when he lands for failing to follow<br>proper safety procedures. Besides, the flight details are not covered by<br>Federal aviation regulations as commercial flights are since the flight<br>is operated by the Air Force and follow Air Force Instructions on flight<br>operations. The President, as Commander-in-Chief, sits at the top of the<br>Air Force, so while the flight crew can tell the President that he<br>should buckle in for landing, he could probably avoid doing so without<br>consequence (unless the landing happens to be a little rough in which<br>case he may fall down).<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
