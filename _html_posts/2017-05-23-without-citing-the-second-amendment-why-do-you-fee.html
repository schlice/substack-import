<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I trained on that style of weapon during my time in the military. The<br>marksmanship ribbons I earned prove that I did pretty well with it. I<br>bought one and was able to break it down and re-assemble it by rote. I'm<br>comfortable carrying it, I'm comfortable sighting it in, and I'm<br>comfortable using it. I can put rounds downrange exactly where I want<br>them to be.<br><br>So why wouldn't I want to use the training I have to protect and defend<br>my family? Otherwise, I'd feel like that training went to waste.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
