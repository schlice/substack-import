<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>If you stop and think about it, it's real easy to see why people refuse<br>to believe in God.<br><br>Like Jack Nicholson said to Tom Cruise in *A Few Good Men*, we can't<br>handle the truth.<br><br>The fact is that our rejection of religious and moral truth is often on<br>volitional rather than intellectual grounds---**we just don't want to be<br>held accountable to any moral standards or religious doctrine.** So we<br>blindly accept the self-defeating truth claims of politically correct<br>intellectuals who tell us that truth does not exist; everything is<br>relative; there are no absolutes; it's all a matter of opinion; you<br>ought not judge; religion is about faith, not facts!<br><br>Perhaps Augustine was right when he said that we love the truth when it<br>enlightens us, but we hate it when it convicts us.<br><br>Maybe we reject God because we can't handle the truth.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
