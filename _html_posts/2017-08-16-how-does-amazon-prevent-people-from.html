<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Short answer: they can't, but they do things to "encourage" you to keep<br>it.<br><br>There's no difference between "renting" a radar detector and buying one,<br>trying it out, deciding you don't like it, and returning it because you<br>don't like it.<br><br>How they limit this practice is using shipping fees, and in some<br>cases, restocking fees.<br><br>You can return the product if you don't like it, but you'll pay return<br>shipping and (if it's a marketplace seller) a restocking fee (which I've<br>seen as high as 15% of the original cost of the item), which will all<br>come out of your refund. So in some cases, it may not be worth it to<br>send that item back.<br><br>Only some items are eligible for Free Returns, and it must state on the<br>product page that the product is eligible for Free Returns, but even<br>those are minus the original return shipping fees if the return is not<br>due to a problem caused by Amazon.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
