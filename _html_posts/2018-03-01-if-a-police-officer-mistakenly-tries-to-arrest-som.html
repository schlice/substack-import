<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>*"You may beat the rap, but you can't beat the ride."*<br><br>Police officers have a lower threshold than courts do when they place<br>someone under arrest. Police only need to have "probable cause" in<br>order to arrest someone. Probable cause means that there must be a<br>*reasonable basis* for believing that the suspect committed a crime.<br>This is why the person is brought in front of a judge for *arraignment*,<br>a process which involves reviewing the officer's cause for arrest and<br>determining if there is enough evidence to hold the suspect over for<br>trial. The judge will determine if the police did, in fact, have<br>probable cause to make the arrest. If they did not, the person must be<br>released.<br><br>Later, when the person appears in front of the judge at his or her<br>trial, it then becomes the job of the prosecution to *prove* *beyond a<br>reasonable doubt* that the person did, in fact, commit the crime.<br><br>Remember too, the erroneous nature of an arrest is only determined by a<br>competent court in that jurisdiction; it is not determined during the<br>arrest. Therefore, since no one, not the suspect, not the police, not<br>the supervisor, no one other than a court can determine whether or not<br>the reason for arrest was legally in error, you must operate under the<br>*presumption* that the reason for the arrest is *reasonable*.<br><br>It doesn't have to be *right*, it only has to be *reasonable*.<br><br>Therefore, resisting arrest because *you think* that the officer<br>does not have probable cause is illogical, since it is the judge who<br>determines whether or not the officer did, in fact, have probable cause.<br>You have to be arrested first before the judge can make that<br>determination.<br><br>Therefore, you can be charged with resisting arrest ***even if the basis<br>for the arrest was in error.***<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
