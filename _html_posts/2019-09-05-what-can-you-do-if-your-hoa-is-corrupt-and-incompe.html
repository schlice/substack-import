<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>What can you do if your HOA is corrupt and incompetent?<br><br>"Corrupt" means they are violating laws. Get together with your<br>neighbors, retain a real estate attorney, and file a lawsuit.<br><br>"Incompetent" means they don't know how to manage money, or they don't<br>know how to properly discharge their duties. While not illegal, it's not<br>a great situation to find yourself in. In this scenario, you can either<br><br>- move, or<br>- run for the Board and fix the problems yourself.<br><br>I did the latter. I served six years on our Board, three as President.<br>I'd like to say I fixed many of the problems. Some remain unfixed, but<br>at least it was the choice of all the homeowners to leave it that way.<br><br>Then I moved.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
