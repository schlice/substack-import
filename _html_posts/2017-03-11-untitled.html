<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>You must be careful in this situation. Having a handgun in your hand<br>might qualify as brandishing because it can be "brought to bear"<br>very quickly, and your hand is in a position that you can activate the<br>weapon without relocating your hand. It depends on your jurisdiction and<br>your local prosecutors. Just answering the door holding a gun may be<br>illegal where you live. Additionally, in some jurisdictions, a lot of<br>brandishing charges rest on the opinion of the victim. Did they feel<br>threatened? Did they feel like you were using force against them, even<br>if you never raised the gun from your side? Holding a gun while<br>answering the door is a slippery slope, open to lots of interpretation,<br>and not a place you want to get to.<br><br>Like I said in my own answer, leave the gun in the holster with your<br>hand on the backstrap (this is not brandishing, this would instead be<br>considered a "ready position"). You can make an incredibly strong case<br>against brandishing if the gun remains in the holster, even if your hand<br>is on the backstrap; holstered weapons are generally considered "safe<br>carry" weapons.<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-3af39aa5a3fe56f3d5dea0e0ae70aec7){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-3af39aa5a3fe56f3d5dea0e0ae70aec7" master_w="532"<br>master_h="433"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>If it's a rifle, leave it slung across your shoulder. Or, as some of the<br>other respondents mentioned, just don't answer the door. You have no<br>legal obligation to answer the door, ever. If it's the police, you still<br>don't have to answer the door. If they have a search warrant, you might<br>want to answer the door if you're not keen on buying a new door, but<br>other than that, you are under no legal obligation, ever, to open your<br>door if you were not expecting someone to be there.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/Is-it-legal-to-answer-the-door-of-your-home-with-your-gun-drawn-and-pointed-at-whoever-is-on-the-other-side-of-it/answer/Kevin-Baker-14<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
