<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Some facts to consider:<br><br>- There are currently 121,678 people waiting for lifesaving organ\<br>  transplants in the U.S. Of these, 100,791 await kidney transplants<br>  (as\<br>  of 1/11/16).<br>- The median wait time for an individual's first kidney transplant is\<br>  3.6 years and can vary depending on health, compatibility and\<br>  availability of organs.<br>- In 2014, 17,107 kidney transplants took place in the US. Of these,\<br>  11,570 came from deceased donors and 5,537 came from living donors.<br><br>On average:<br><br>- Over 3,000 new patients are added to the kidney waiting list each<br>  month.<br>- 13 people die each day while waiting for a life-saving kidney<br>  transplant.<br>- Every 14 minutes someone is added to the kidney transplant list.<br>- In 2014, 4,761 patients died while waiting for a kidney<br>  transplant. Another, 3,668 people became too sick to receive a<br>  kidney transplant. \1\<br><br>However, at least in the United States, you can\'t compel anyone to<br>undergo such a risky procedure as a voluntary kidney removal. There are<br>many considerations a living donor has to make before deciding to donate<br>a kidney.<br><br>Besides the donor needing to be in good physical condition and able to<br>withstand a major surgery under general anesthesia, someone who has<br>cancer, diabetes, kidney disease, heart disease, liver disease, sickle<br>cell disease, HIV or hepatitis will generally not qualify to be a donor.<br>Cancer alone knocks 39% of the population out. Another 610,000 Americans<br>will be diagnosed with some form of heart disease.<br><br>But even if you could provide kidneys for everyone on the transplant<br>list, that\'s still only about 120,000 people from a \"forced\" donor<br>pool of about 50 million qualified people.<br><br>What should be done is more education to let people know that living<br>kidney donations is relatively safe (as safe as any other general<br>surgery) and carries limited risk of future complications. Most<br>generally, people who have donated a kidney go on to live full lives<br>with only one.<br><br>We should also encourage more people to become donors postmortem. Most<br>states have an organ donation program which allows people to register to<br>become organ and tissue donors when they apply for, or renew, their<br>driver\'s licenses. In fact, the majority of kidneys donated (more than<br>double) came from deceased donors.<br><br>\<br><br>\1\ [[Organ Donation and Transplantation<br>Statistics](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=35b667&url=https://www.kidney.org/news/newsroom/factsheets/Organ-Donation-and-Transplantation-Stats){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="kidney.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
