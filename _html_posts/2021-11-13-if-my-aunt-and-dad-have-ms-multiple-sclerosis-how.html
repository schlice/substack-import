<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Here's the actual answer to your question. Sorry it has taken this long.<br>This evidence is from epidemiological studies about who gets MS. You can<br>find this information at the National MS Society.<br><br>The rate of MS in the general population is about 1 in 750. Having a<br>first-degree relative with MS (like a parent or a sibling) changes<br>that risk to anywhere between 1 in 100 and 1 in 40.<br><br>But it's not all genetic. Take the identical twins example. They share<br>the exact same DNA, so if it was all genetic, if one twin gets MS, the<br>other twin should have a 100% chance of getting it. But the other twin<br>only has a 25% chance of getting it. So clearly, there are other factors<br>involved in who gets MS.<br><br>Some of those factors are age, sex, location where you grew up, your<br>heritage, and some infectious trigger to start the disease process which<br>we haven't yet identified.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>If my aunt and dad have MS (multiple sclerosis), how likely am I to get<br>it as his son?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
