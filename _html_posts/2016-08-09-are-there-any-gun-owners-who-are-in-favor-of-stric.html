<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Absolutely.<br><br>One of the old tropes of the gun crowd has been "enforce the laws we<br>already have." But no one really says what that means. Except me and a<br>few others, of course, but a paltry few of us.<br><br>Primarily, we need to start coming down hard on people who use guns<br>to commit crimes. Oftentimes (too often, in fact), the gun charge is<br>pled away during plea bargaining to get a guaranteed conviction on the<br>actual crime. The prosecutor says, "I'll drop the gun charge if you<br>plead guilty to first-degree robbery." It's used as a bargaining chip,<br>and the criminals know this. So they use guns with impunity. If you<br>truly want to stop criminals from using guns, we must get tougher with<br>criminals who use guns to commit crimes. And if DA's will not do it of<br>their own volition, we must mandate it through state law:<br><br>- If a gun is used in the commission of a crime, it automatically adds<br>  an aggravating factor to the crime committed.<br>- Additionally, the crime of "Commission of a Crime With a Gun" should<br>  also be a charge that must be added to the list of charges. To be<br>  fair, the gun would have to be part of the crime (the criminal<br>  threatened someone with the gun, or actually discharged it).<br>- Neither the aggravating condition nor the crime of commission of a<br>  crime with a gun can be waived. The DA would be required to charge the<br>  criminal with these.<br>- Neither of the two conditions can be lessened in plea bargaining.<br><br>I'm kinda up in the air on mandatory sentencing, but there should be<br>minimum sentences required. For example, a judge couldn't apply a 30-day<br>sentence fulfilled by time served for committing a crime with a gun. I'd<br>say a minimum 10 year sentence just for using a gun should be required.<br>So something like 10--20 just for using a gun, sentences required to run<br>consecutively, not concurrently.<br><br>At the same time, we decriminalize drug possession/use charges. That's<br>not because I want people to become drug addicts. It's because drug<br>addicts should not be prisoners. They should be patients. Get<br>them the help they need. Don't lock them up. We don't decriminalize drug<br>sale, or PID (possesion with intent to distribute) charges. This should<br>reduce the load on the jails, so we can keep the *real* criminals in<br>jail longer.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
