<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>You would definitely be asked to come back and talk to the detectives<br>regarding the recent robberies.<br><br>You would be asked about the details of those robberies.<br><br>The detectives would be looking for specific details that were not<br>revealed to the press, things that would only be known to the police and<br>the perpetrator.<br><br>They would also want to know why you are turning yourself in. Most<br>criminals try to not get caught, and statistically, most do not. So<br>you stand a better chance of never going to jail if you don't confess to<br>your involvement. So they would want to know your motivations.<br><br>The police are, understandably, cautious. There are "attention-seekers"<br>who are like children who do "naughty" things just to get attention from<br>their parents. For them, any attention is good. Even negative attention.<br>Also, you could be attempting to take the blame for someone else<br>(perhaps your child actually committed the robbery and you want to take<br>the fall for him so he doesn't have to go to jail). So you can<br>understand that the police would be skeptical of someone turning<br>themselves in unprovoked.<br><br>If, however, your story truly checks out, and the police are thoroughly<br>convinced that you are the perpetrator, they will eventually arrest you.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
