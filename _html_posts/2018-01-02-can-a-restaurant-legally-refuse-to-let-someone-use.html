<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Laws for restroom access for customers are made at the state level.<br>Federal law only requires that restrooms be made available to employees.<br><br>To answer your question, restaurants do not have "public restrooms,"<br>since restaurants are not "public locations." Restaurants are<br>privately owned locations which are open to the public. There's<br>a difference. Being a private facility, the restaurant can restrict the<br>use of its facilities to whomever they choose, and most restaurants<br>restrict their facilities to paying customers to save money. Regardless,<br>the restaurant must remain compliant with state law regarding who must<br>be given access to restrooms in food service establishments. In order to<br>find out who can be restricted and when, check the laws in your state.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
