<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>No<br><br>The justices submitted an unsigned opinion. Unsigned opinions do not set<br>precedent. The ruling affirms the Oklahoma Supreme Court\'s decision,<br>which simply says that *this* charter, for *this* charter school, in<br>*this* state, violates the Oklahoma Constitution and the US<br>Constitution.<br><br>If the court wanted to set precedent, they would have published a signed<br>opinion along with their reasoning. They chose not to do this, so there<br>is no precedent set in this case. Religious groups are free to bring<br>further cases discussing this particular issue in the future.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
