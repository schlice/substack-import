<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Are the U.S. laws that ban exposure of female nipples (but not male) a<br>violation of the 14th Amendment?**<br><br>Technically, yes.<br><br>However, courts have relied much more heavily on states' beliefs that<br>women's bodies are sexual, and that the female breast is more closely<br>related to *genitalia* than it is to a simple infant feeding structure.<br><br>This is, of course, our own fault. United States society has sexualized<br>the female breast, starting with our more prudish Victorian and<br>Judeo-Christian heritage, and never really changing. Clearly, the<br>"sexual revolution" in the 60s was an attempt to change this, but it has<br>existed for hundreds of years, and that kind of inertia is difficult to<br>change. You can't turn the cruise ship on a dime.<br><br>Are state laws which criminalize female toplessness an actual violation<br>of the 14th Amendment? It sure looks like it. It also looks like such<br>laws are some of the worst examples of gender discrimination our society<br>still clings to.<br><br>More specifically, the government must show that if it is going to<br>infringe unequally on a right, there must be a compelling state interest<br>in doing so, and such interest really doesn't exist today.<br><br>It seems that the time is right for a woman to bring such a<br>Constitutional challenge. No other time in US history has seen<br>conditions so ripe for change as now.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
