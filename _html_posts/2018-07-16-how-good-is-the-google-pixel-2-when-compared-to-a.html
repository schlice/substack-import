<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**How good is the Google Pixel 2 when compared to a similar iPhone or<br>Samsung device?**<br><br>There are two areas we can compare where it really makes a difference:<br>the camera, and the OS. There are other areas of comparison as well, but<br>I think the camera is probably the most noticeable difference.<br><br>Camera<br><br>As far as the *hardware* is concerned, the Galaxy S9 and the iPhone X<br>have better specs. The cameras are most definitely better quality, and<br>both the S9 and the iPhone X sport dual-camera setups for better<br>portrait mode support (the S9+ actually has a *physical variable<br>apeture* for better low-light shots).<br><br>Now, that said, the image processing software on the Pixel 2 is *second<br>to none.* Period. Full stop. Despite only having a single lens, the<br>Pixel 2 takes better actual pictures every single time.<br><br>In multiple side-by-side comparisons (you can find them all on YouTube),<br>the Pixel 2's image processing software handily beat all comers in the<br>vast majority of shooting scenarios. And in practice, you simply *cannot<br>take a bad picture* with the Pixel 2.<br><br>My oldest sold his S9+ and bought a Pixel 2 XL specifically for the<br>camera. He took it with him to Coachella and his pics actually looked<br>better than the pictures from his friend's DSLR.<br><br>If you're looking for the best camera hardware on the market, the S9+ is<br>the way to go. But if you want the *best pictures*, you cannot beat the<br>Pixel 2. Hands down.<br><br>OS<br><br>The ever-present iOS vs Android debate will rage on until one of the<br>platforms officially dies. For now, that doesn't seem like it's going to<br>happen anytime soon. Basically, pick the one you like. There are<br>advantages and disadvantages to both.<br><br>The Pixel has, arguably, the most *stock* Android experience of any<br>commercial phone out there, as there are virtually no overlays on top of<br>Android O. And Google will patch its Pixel phones *first* before any<br>other manufacturer, as the hardware developer and the carrier must all<br>test Google's updates with their hardware and network. So Pixel phones<br>will get Android updates before any other manufacturer.<br><br>However, TouchWiz has really *de-bloated* in the S9 experience. Granted,<br>Samsung still has its suite of apps (some of which may actually be<br>useful), but it has gotten much *closer* to stock Android than ever<br>before. And that's a very good thing.<br><br>Nevertheless, on Android, if you don't like TouchWiz or the stock<br>Android experience, you can always add your own custom launcher and go<br>crazy.<br><br>Other<br><br>Samsung phones still have expandable memory, while the Pixel and the<br>iPhone do not.<br><br>The iPhone X has completely removed the fingerprint sensor, relying only<br>on Face ID, while both the Pixel and the Samsung phones retain it,<br>albeit on the back.<br><br>The Pixel has a squeeze interface. The Samsung has the oft-maligned<br>Bixby button. The iPhone has neither of these "features."<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
