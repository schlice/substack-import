<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Normally, 18650 batteries do not contain internal overcharge or thermal<br>protection. It's up to the device in which it is being used to provide<br>that protection. Devices which can charge those batteries will generally<br>include some form of overcharge cutoff, and devices which draw on those<br>batteries can sometimes include a thermal switch. In the vaping world,<br>you would find these protections in "regulated" mods.<br><br>This is why mods which are "unregulated" can be dangerous. That lack of<br>regulation means that it comes down to the resistance in the build which<br>determines how much power is drawn from the battery. Appropriate<br>resistance will not draw more amperage than the battery can handle, but<br>this requires regularly testing the voltage produced by the mod and the<br>resistance in the build.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
