<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [While you might like to set some conditions that nations<br>must follow, nations are independent. They don\'t answer to any \"world<br>government\". You can certainly write a treatise in the United Nations<br>for member states to use as guidelines, but there is no one organization<br>that can direct nations\' laws.\<br>\<br>A nation can determine on its own whether or not it feels that<br>pre-emptive military action is appropriate. The rest of the nations in<br>the world can judge for themselves whether or not they think that this<br>action was justified and can make policies to deal with that nation<br>accordingly. So nations who act unilaterally and unprovoked not only<br>face the wrath of their own citizens, but the rest of the<br>world.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
