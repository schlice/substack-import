<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**To all true American\'s who will YOU call president, Trump, Biden,<br>Sanders or other?**<br><br>Depends on who you consider a "true American." To me, that's someone who<br>holds firmly to the principles of the Constitution. No matter your<br>political party, your affiliation, or any other subgroup with which you<br>identify, if you are American, it's because you believe in the<br>Constitution.<br><br>And according to the Constitution, a peaceful transition of power took<br>place on January 20th, just as it has for several hundred years now<br>between at least 45 different people.<br><br>Therefore, a "true American" (in my view) calls Biden the President.<br><br>And election issues are not new to Biden, Trump, or anyone for that<br>matter. Elections have been called questionable many times. Remember the<br>2000 election? That was the most "questionable" of any recent election,<br>as it was essentially decided by the courts. I am certain that the<br>SCOTUS learned their lesson well from 2000, and some of their refusal to<br>hear election-related cases is still due to the sting of the backlash<br>from the judiciary stepping in to a political process during that<br>election.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
