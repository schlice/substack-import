It<br>is run like a corporation, with bylaws adopted by the corporation, and<br>which runs according to those bylaws.<br><br>Additionally, the HOA is incorporated in the city in which it does<br>business. This means that the HOA's Covenants, Conditions and<br>Restrictions (CC&R) becomes part of the city charter, influencing local<br>zoning ordinance and how taxes are applied to that neighborhood.<br><br>If the CC&R is never filed with the city, then it never becomes part of<br>the city charter. This could cause problems with city zoning or city<br>taxes applied to the residents in that HOA.<br><br>However, the HOA still runs as a 501(c)4 independent of the CC&R being<br>filed with the city. The buyers still received notice of the CC&R when<br>they bought their homes, and that "constructive notice" still applies.<br><br>So long as the HOA operated in accordance with its own bylaws, it is<br>still a legal corporation, and homeowners are still bound by the CC&R<br>that they agreed to upon purchasing their homes.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
