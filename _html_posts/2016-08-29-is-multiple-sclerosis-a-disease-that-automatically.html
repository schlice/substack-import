<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>(Answer specific to the United States)<br><br>Short answer: no. There is no disease or condition that automatically<br>disqualifies anyone from doing anything.<br><br>Longer answer: The Americans with Disabilities Act and its amendments<br>have changed the system of employment in the United States. No longer is<br>a prospective employer allowed to ask you whether or not you have a<br>disability before you are hired. No longer can you be judged because you<br>are disabled.<br><br>When an employer wants to hire someone, they can list the physical<br>requirements of the job. We had to be able to lift 100 pounds, possess a<br>minimum level of cardiovascular ability, walk, crouch, crawl, climb<br>stairs, use fingers with dexterity, and work in high-stress situations.<br>The employer is able to assess your physical ability to ensure it meets<br>the standards. On your application, they are only allowed to ask you if<br>you are able to meet the listed requirements, with or without reasonable<br>accommodations. If you are, you answer yes. No more, no less. There is<br>no requirement to disclose your disability, as that is considered<br>protected health information (PHI) which is between you and your doctor.<br><br>To become a police officer in our jurisdiction, you must accomplish the<br>following:<br><br>1.  Pass a written examination and Oral Boards<br>2.  Pass a background investigation and Computer Voice Stress Analysis<br>    exam<br>3.  Pass psychological, medical, physical assessment, and drug<br>    screenings<br><br>Once those are complete, you enter the POST-certified Basic Law<br>Enforcement Academy. At the conclusion of your training, you are sworn<br>and placed into On the Job Training (OJT) which advances you to<br>progressively more responsibility over time. Eventually, you work solo<br>as other officers do.<br><br>So long as you can meet the standards, and you can do the job, you can<br>be hired, disability or not.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
