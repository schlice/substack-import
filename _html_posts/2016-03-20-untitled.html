<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: [Ccleaner may be a bit of overkill every time. If you are<br>concerned about something being written to your system, your best bet is<br>to use either a sandbox to run your browser, or run your browser in a<br>VM.\<br>\<br>If you\'d like to try a sandbox first, look up Sandboxie. Far and away<br>the best sandbox app out there.\<br>\<br>If you use a VM, be sure to take snapshots so that if you do pick up a<br>virus, you can revert to a saved snapshot. Make sure to keep your<br>virtual network isolated as well.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/Why-does-my-husband-use-incognito-mode-in-his-browser/answer/Bill-Stein<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
