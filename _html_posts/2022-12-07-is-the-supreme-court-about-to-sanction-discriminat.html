<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>No, but they are setting up lower courts to hear many challenges as to<br>whether or not a particular discrimination is lawful.<br><br>The primary reason is because the case they are hearing now is not about<br>religion. It's only about *compelled speech*. The Court (as well as both<br>litigants) recognize that there is indeed a 1st Amendment freedom to<br>decline to speak, and the government cannot compel people to speak. That<br>is the central issue the Court is wrestling with: whether or not an<br>anti-discrimination law can compel someone to speak in violation of the<br>1st Amendment.<br><br>The discrimination, however, is not towards the people, but towards the<br>expressive speech. Here's an example related to this case: a homosexual<br>couple could buy a custom website celebrating a heterosexual marriage,<br>and the vendor would create that website. A heterosexual couple could<br>not buy a custom website celebrating a homosexual wedding; the vendor<br>would not create that custom website. It's not about the *client*, it's<br>about the *speech*.<br><br>So the question about whether or not the government can compel speech is<br>pretty clear, and the Court appears to be leaning towards making that<br>ruling. But finding the line between a 1st Amendment protected religious<br>exemption and a violation of state anti-discrimination law is going to<br>have to be left to case law. I'm certain that there will be cases that<br>clearly show an unlawful discrimination, and there will be cases which<br>show a clear religious exemption. But the state (in the states which<br>protect sexual orientation) has a vested interest in protecting a<br>certain class of people from discrimination, and the federal government<br>has a vested interest in not burdening the free exercise of religion.<br><br>It will take many years of litigation in order to find that clear-ish<br>line. SCOTUS, based on what I heard at oral arguments, appears to be<br>leaning toward ruling that applying a public-accommodation law to compel<br>an artist to speak or stay silent violates the free speech clause of the<br>First Amendment. The upshot of this is that in future cases, the state<br>will have the burden of proving that the conduct was actually<br>discriminatory and not protected by the 1st Amendment.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
