<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Free speech is exactly that. And contributing any amount<br>of money I choose is part of my right to speak freely.\<br>\<br>What the court failed to take into account is the fact that there is a<br>downside to free speech, and that is enabling censorship by speaking so<br>loudly that you drown out other free speech. The amount of your free<br>speech can actually hinder the speech of others.\<br>\<br>And more money equals more opportunity to drown out other<br>speech.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
