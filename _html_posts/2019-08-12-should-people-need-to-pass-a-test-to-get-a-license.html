<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Should people need to pass a test to get a license to own a weapon?<br><br>No. And there are several reasons why.<br><br>First of all, you can't make a test to allow someone to exercise a<br>Constitutionally-protected right. The Constitution says you can own a<br>firearm. You can't make a test which requires you to get a license to<br>exercise a Constitutional right unless you change the Constitution. Do<br>you think you should need to get a permit before the police won't barge<br>into your home and search it for illegal stuff without a warrant? Do you<br>think that you should only be free from self-incrimination if you have a<br>self-incrimination prevention permit? Do you think you should be<br>required to pass a test and get a license before you can post on Quora,<br>or on any website for that matter? Of course not. No Constitutional<br>right is any different in this regard.<br><br>So bypassing the Constitutional requirement for a minute (which we must<br>do to continue this hypothetical), there are many items out there which<br>are demonstrably more dangerous for which you don't need a permit to<br>own. Chainsaws and wood chippers are extremely dangerous, yet you don't<br>mandate a license to buy one. Knives are extremely useful and arguably<br>as dangerous (if not more dangerous) than firearms, and no permits are<br>required to purchase them, and they're not even protected by the<br>Constitution. Cars kill more people than guns, and you don't need a<br>license to own a car. Clearly, you need a license to drive a car,<br>which brings us to the next point...<br><br>And that point is the question you probably wanted to ask: **should<br>people need to pass a test to get a license to *carry* a<br>weapon?**<br><br>Absolutely yes.<br><br>In the same way we license drivers, you don't need a license to own a<br>car. You only need a license to drive one on a public road. In the same<br>way, you should not need a license to own a gun, but you should need a<br>license to carry one off of your own property. You should be shown to be<br>competent enough to not hurt yourself or others with it. A simple usage<br>test and a nominal fee (not an exorbitant fee as is currently charged by<br>even most "shall issue" states) should be all that is required to carry<br>a firearm.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
