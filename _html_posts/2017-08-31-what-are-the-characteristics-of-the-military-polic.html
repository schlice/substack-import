<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Characteristics? Besides a few different devices on their uniforms, you<br>can't tell them apart. So characteristically, there is no difference<br>whatsoever. When they are working, they have exactly the same authority<br>as their full-time counterparts, so you can't tell them apart that way.<br><br>The big difference? The full time cops deploy. The Augmentees stay<br>behind and fill in as police while the full time guys are out of<br>country.<br><br>The only other time you'll see them around is when they are doing normal<br>duty rotations to maintain proficiency, and as I said, aside from a few<br>devices on their uniforms, you would hardly notice the difference<br>between them.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
