<br/><br/>Answer Comment<br/><br/><br/>Content: [*Another consideration, all the mass shootings that have<br/>captured the attention of the public: Aurora, Sandy Hook, Columbine,<br/>Virginia Tech, the mall shooting in Salt Lake City*\<br/>\<br/>Wrong about Utah (SLC) and Colorado (Aurora and Columbine). I get your<br/>point, and your point is accurate, but a few facts are incorrect, as SLC<br/>and Aurora do not have strict gun control laws (unless you count the<br/>ridiculous magazine ban recently enacted in Colorado). Colorado is even<br/>an open-carry state.]<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Answer:<br/>https://www.quora.com/How-strict-should-gun-control-laws-actually-have-to-be-to-effectively-reduce-mass-shootings/answer/Will-Pasto<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content language: English<br/><br/><br/>
