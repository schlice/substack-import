<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>He is allowed to do so (as he has the authority to make judgment calls<br>about whether or not a violation should be written), but it\'s not wise.<br>He could get himself into trouble because of what we call *selective<br>enforcement*. This is a defense which is often raised by a driver who<br>claims the officer ignored others around him who were also violating the<br>same law.<br><br>To win with a "selective enforcement" defense, however, you have to take<br>a huge ­additional step and show that the officer had a specific and<br>improper ­motive to pick on you. Unless you can prove (not just allege)<br>that the officer was unfairly targeting you alone, you won\'t be able to<br>get by with a \"selective enforcement\" defense in traffic court.<br><br>The reason is, regardless of what the officer did or did not do with<br>other motorists, you were actually violating the statute in question,<br>and the officer did observe you violating the statute. So the presence<br>or absence of tickets given to other motorists does not change what<br>happened in your particular case.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
