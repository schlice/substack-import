<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Look, I get what you're saying. We're not talking about exegetical<br>analysis, we're talking about logic. And if you were to say "The<br>Bible is true because the Bible says it is true," this would be an<br>example of circular logic.<br><br>So using the Bible to prove the truth of the Bible only works for people<br>who already believe that the Bible contains God's Word.<br><br>So for the remainder of the logically-minded, how can you prove that the<br>Bible is authentic and trustworthy, and that the Bible contains the word<br>of God?<br><br>The answer comes in a set of logical proofs that build upon themselves.<br><br>1.  First, you must prove that God exists. We do this through our<br>    logical arguments: the beginning of the universe (Cosmological<br>    Argument), the design of the universe (Teleological<br>    Argument/Anthropic Principle), the design of life (Teleological<br>    Argument), and the existence of the Moral Law (Moral Argument)<br>2.  If God exists, then miracles are possible. Miracles can authenticate<br>    a message from God (i.e., as acts of God to confirm a word from<br>    God).<br>3.  We know the Bible is historically reliable. This is evidenced by:<br>    1.  Early testimony<br>    2.  Eyewitness testimony<br>    3.  Uninvented (authentic) testimony<br>    4.  Eyewitnesses who were not deceived<br>4.  The Bible says Jesus claimed to be God.<br>5.  Jesus' claim to be God was miraculously confirmed by:<br>    1.  His fulfillment of many prophecies about Himself;<br>    2.  His sinless life and the miracles He performed;<br>    3.  His prediction and accomplishment of His own resurrection.<br>6.  Therefore, Jesus is God., and whatever Jesus (who is God) teaches is<br>    true.<br>7.  Jesus taught that the Bible is the Word of God.<br>8.  Therefore, it is true that the Bible is the Word of God (and<br>    anything opposed to it is false).<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
