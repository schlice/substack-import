<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What would happen if Trump tried to force the states to re-open, and<br>what will happen if we defy him?**<br><br>I don't know how he could force states to re-open. He has no such<br>authority.<br><br>But let's assume, for argument's sake, that he somehow attempted to<br>force states to re-open.<br><br>How states respond is fully up to states.<br><br>Let's say California's governor believes it's "too soon" to re-open. He<br>can simply choose to not lift his "stay at home" order. Since there is<br>no Federal "stay at home" order (nor is any available for them to<br>implement), then Californians will be forced to stay at home.<br><br>But let's say Florida's governor believes the president, and lifts any<br>statewide "stay at home" order, but you believe it's still too soon.<br>What's a scared citizen to do?<br><br>Stay home.<br><br>No one is forcing you to leave your home. They can re-start the economy<br>without you. I mean, like most people who were forced to stay home and<br>who worked in a job where you couldn't work from home, you probably lost<br>your job anyway. So just stay home.<br><br>Unless, of course, you have to go back to work.<br><br>Well, now you're in a pickle, aren't you. You want to go back to work,<br>but you're scared of the virus. What should you do? You should go back<br>to work, and you should ensure your employer is providing you with all<br>of the personal protective equipment (PPE) required in your particular<br>job situation: masks, gloves, gowns, etc. Whatever is required. Then<br>make sure you wear it, don't get lazy. If they don't, contact OSHA and<br>report them for an unsafe working environment.<br><br>Also, make sure you, personally, continue to practice good social<br>distancing, even when you're not at work.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
