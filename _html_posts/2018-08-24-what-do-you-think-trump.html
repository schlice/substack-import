<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What do you think Trump\'s reaction will be to Trump Organization CFO<br>Allen Weisselberg getting immunity for providing information about<br>Michael Cohen?**<br><br>The world will find out just what a sleazy businessman Trump actually<br>was when he was running the Trump organization. I think Trump should be<br>concerned that *everything* about his past will come to light, in<br>excruciatingly gory detail. Trump will, most likely, send a tweet storm<br>excoriating Weisselberg as a sellout and a sleaze and decry Fake News<br>and the Russian Witch Hunt.<br><br>HOWEVER, I must acknowledge the elephant in the room.<br><br>NONE OF THIS HAS ANYTHING TO DO WITH RUSSIA OR COLLUSION!<br><br>Remember the *REAL* reason for the Mueller probe: to get Trump out<br>of office. That's the whole reason we have it. Mueller knows there is no<br>Russia collusion. We all know that Strzok and Page made up the whole<br>Russia collusion tactic as an insurance policy to get Trump out of<br>office. The thought is that if we dig up enough dirt on Trump, we can<br>have a Nixon-esque exposition of *just how bad a man Trump really is*,<br>and the House can see clear to call something a high crime and<br>misdemeanor so that they can file articles of impeachment with the<br>Senate.<br><br>They'll never get him removed from office, because the Senate will never<br>vote to remove him from office without a real crime proximate to the<br>office of the President which would make it apparent that he can no<br>longer effectively function as President.<br><br>But hypothetically, even if they *did* get him removed from office, then<br>Pence is president, and he'll keep all of Trump's voters, and probably<br>take some #NeverTrumpers back from wherever they went. He'll double down<br>on Trump's policies, with a much tighter Christian bent and no real<br>Trump-like skeletons in his closet, which makes it objectively worse for<br>the far left. You think abortion is threatened *today*? Just wait until<br>Pence becomes president.<br><br>So it will be a Pyrrhic victory at best, and at worst, it keeps<br>Republicans (if not Trump) in the White House through 2024.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
