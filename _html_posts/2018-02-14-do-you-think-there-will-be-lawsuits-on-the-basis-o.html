<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Do you think there will be lawsuits on the basis of constitutionality<br>if President Trump\'s \"Food Box\" program is made into law?**<br><br>No, there would not be a Constitutional challenge if they decide to<br>float a proposal to cut SNAP funding (not eliminate, but cut) and<br>replace some of it with "food boxes." So far as I can tell, there is no<br>Constitutional requirement to have a SNAP program at all, so changing it<br>to give less money for food and instead actually give food should not<br>cause a Constitutional issue.<br><br>I'm sure the 9th Circus can find some Constitutional argument for trying<br>to block Executive action (again). Maybe food boxes somehow violate the<br>3rd Amendment or something. Because food boxes is just like quartering<br>soldiers...or something. Who knows. If there is a wacky equivalence to<br>be found, you can bet on the 9th being the stalwarts to find it. Meh.<br><br>There are many concerns with the actual proposal (not the<br>Constitutionality of it) of course, such as people with dietary<br>restrictions, and people who are homeless and can't receive a box. It is<br>those concerns that would probably render such a program a non-starter.<br>They should instead revamp the SNAP program and be MUCH more strict on<br>where SNAP funds can be used, and on what products SNAP funds can be<br>spent. You would think that the *actual name of the program*, the<br>Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program would render it<br>self-limiting, but I guess they thought that it was somehow<br>discriminatory to try to tell people on what they could spend<br>nutritional assistance dollars. I personally find it fascinating how<br>much money from SNAP gets spent in the Port of Miami. They must have a<br>special 3-night SNAP Cruise that I'm unaware of.<br><br>But Constitutionally? It should not be a problem.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
