<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Assuming that all goes according to plan, the HOA will be served with<br>notice of lawsuit. So yes, they'll know.<br><br>It is possible for the HOA to be sued and they not know about it. Let's<br>assume that the service was done to the office of the HOA's Managing<br>Agent, but the secretary at the front door accepted the service. The<br>secretary failed to deliver the summons to the appropriate Managing<br>Agent, who would notify the HOA's attorney. In other words, the notice<br>of lawsuit got lost in the shuffle. If service happened correctly to a<br>valid recipient and the correct people never found out about it, the<br>court date would come and the HOA could have a default judgement issued<br>against it.<br><br>If the service did not happen correctly and the HOA doesn't show up,<br>no judgement can be entered against them because they were not properly<br>served. The case would probably be continued to another date, and the<br>homeowner would have to try again to properly serve the HOA.<br><br>Even if the HOA was improperly served, or not served at all, they can<br>still show up and a trial can commence, even if service was incorrect.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
