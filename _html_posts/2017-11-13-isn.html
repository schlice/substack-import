<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>According to today's society, it is not important to give *anyone*<br>the benefit of the doubt.<br><br>In today's society, you are guilty if you have been accused.<br><br>It doesn't matter if you're innocent.<br><br>It doesn't matter if you're gay and not attracted to the person.<br><br>If you have been accused, you are guilty. Or you must be, because<br>consequences immediately befall you, before a trial of your peers has<br>had an opportunity to weigh in on the matter.<br><br>We have reached a critical tipping point in political correctness, a<br>point at which the mere accusation of wrongdoing is enough to warrant<br>consequences. I suspect that eventually, someone will be ruined and it<br>will then be discovered that the accuser was lying just to ruin the<br>person. But will that be enough to overcome the current tide of<br>political correctness we currently see? Only time will tell.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
