<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Your disease will continue to progress in the background.\<br>\<br>For the large majority of people with relapsing forms of MS, your<br>disease will change to a progressive form within 10 years.\<br>\<br>I\'m not trying to scare you. I\'m simply saying that this is the trend<br>for people who do not use one of the approved medicines to slow the<br>progress of the disease.\<br>\<br>As the other answerers have alluded to, diet and exercise are important,<br>but diet and exercise alone will not slow the progression of the<br>disease.\<br>\<br>From my research, I know this: if you \"had MS\" and you changed your<br>diet and \"cured your MS\", you didn\'t have MS. You had something else<br>that mimicked MS, but as [[Shane<br>Ryoo](https://www.quora.com/profile/Shane-Ryoo)]{.qlink_container} said,<br>you can\'t cure MS by changing your diet.]<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*This answer is not professional medical advice**, nor is it a<br>substitute for professional medical advice.
