<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Is there any situation where a cop can arrest you and legally not read<br>you your Miranda rights?**<br><br>Yes. That would be *each and every arrest.*<br><br>Hollywood got this one completely and totally wrong, and anyone who has<br>actually been arrested knows the truth.<br><br>Cops don't read you your rights when you are arrested, because Miranda<br>doesn't apply when you are arrested. **Miranda only applies when the<br>police want to ask you questions**. It's a situation we call "custodial<br>interrogation." If the police are simply arresting you and have no<br>desire to ask you any questions, they will not Mirandize you upon<br>arrest. If they need to ask you questions, they will Mirandize you.<br><br>Normally, your Miranda rights are read to you in the interview room, not<br>at the side of the road. You are given a card which lists exactly what<br>the detective just told you, and you agree that you heard what he or she<br>said, and you indicate your choice whether or not you choose to remain<br>silent until you have had the chance to talk to an attorney, and then<br>you sign the card.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
