<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Do churches receive federal funding in the U.S.?<br><br>The answer is no, churches do not receive federal funding.<br><br>For those who believe that tax exemption is some kind of "government<br>benefit," you would first have to believe that the government *owns* the<br>money, and through their benevolence, churches are *permitted* to keep<br>it.<br><br>That's not how taxes work.<br><br>Government shall make no law concerning the establishment of religion,<br>so says the 1st Amendment. Courts have long recognized that "the power<br>to tax involves the power to destroy\[1\](#gxsko){#cite-gxsko<br>.citation_link}" and with this in mind, churches are not taxed. Taxation<br>exerts too much control over churches.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-gxsko){.citation_index} [[McCulloch v.
