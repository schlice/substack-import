How can you be judged by a jury of your own peers<br>when a lawyer with more experience at jury selection than the other one<br>can stack the jury in their favor?**<br><br>You can't stack a jury because you can't pick who is going to be on the<br>jury. You can only exclude potential jurors, and you only have a limited<br>number of exclusions you can make.<br><br>Voir dire is a process to *reject* seated jurors, either using a<br>peremptory challenge (one which does not state a reason) or a challenge<br>for cause (one which the attorney states a specific reason why a juror<br>would not be able to reach a fair and impartial conclusion). It's not a<br>process by which you can *add* jurors of your choosing to the jury.<br><br>Each side has a certain number of peremptory challenges (depending on<br>the type of trial and the severity of the charge), and an unlimited<br>number of challenges for cause.<br><br>Lawyers must be careful not to remove jurors just because they are<br>members of a "cognizable group," or the possibility of a *Batson<br>Challenge* presents itself. The name comes from [[Batson v.<br>Kentucky](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=8298ae&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batson_v._Kentucky){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}, a case where the<br>defendant argued that the result was invalid because jury selection<br>excluded a "cognizable group."<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
