<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>What is something you were trained in but have never had to use?<br><br>- CBR gear.<br><br>CBR stands for "chemical, biological, and radiological." The "gear" is<br>heavy, full-body suits with embedded activated charcoal to absorb any<br>nasty airborne chemicals before they touched your skin, and "gas masks"<br>which can filter out any of that nasty stuff. I used to train others on<br>how to use it. Never had the opportunity to ever use it.<br><br>- CPR<br><br>I know all of it. I know how to use the AED (Automated External<br>Defibrillator). I know how to do the old way (pumps and breaths) and how<br>to do "Hands-Only CPR." I have an app on my phone that provides me with<br>a timer and a tempo marker. Never once had to do CPR on someone.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
