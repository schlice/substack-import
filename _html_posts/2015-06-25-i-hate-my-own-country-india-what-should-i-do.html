<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [I\'m going to see if I can come up with a thoughtful<br>answer.\<br>\<br>I\'m not going to tell you to leave. I know leaving your country is<br>hard, and becoming a citizen of a new country is very, very hard. It\'s<br>a long, slow process. But it\'s avoidable, I think.\<br>\<br>[[Ryosuke<br>Yokoe](https://www.quora.com/profile/Ryosuke-Yokoe)]{.qlink_container}<br>is both wrong and right. You don\'t have to love your country, but<br>patriotism and nationalism are not inherently irrational. Extreme<br>nationalism is irrational, but loving your country (both its concept and<br>its ideals) is not. You may not love your country, but you should learn<br>to be happy living there. And there are a few ways you can do that.\<br>\<br>Understand your anger. It\'s not the country itself that you hate;<br>there has to be something about your country that you hate. Learn what<br>it is, and fully grasp the concept you don\'t like.\<br>\<br>Work to change it. No one lives in a vacuum. Everyone can have some<br>influence in making the world a better place. Even you, in your country,<br>can work to influence change.\<br>\<br>Unless you happen to live in a country that is Communist or<br>Totalitarian, you have the power to influence people and effect<br>change.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
