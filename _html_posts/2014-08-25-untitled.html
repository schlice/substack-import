<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: [Your answer is not a rant. It\'s a valid concern about the<br>structure of the Federal government. Remember what I said in my answer:<br>the People choose Congress, the States choose the President. The<br>current system ensures some level of equality throughout the states, so<br>that states with small landmasses are not dwarfed in their power by<br>states with large landmasses, and states with small populations are not<br>dwarfed by states with larger populations. Allowing a popular vote for<br>President makes the election a popularity contest, and doesn\'t take the<br>best interest of the state into consideration. You would think that<br>voters take their states\' interests into consideration, but most often<br>they do not.\<br>\<br>You speak in terms of percentages of votes, but you don\'t speak in<br>terms of percentages of eligible voters who actually vote. When our<br>voter turnout is such that one out of every five eligible voters<br>actually casts a vote, I don\'t think it\'s right that a popular vote<br>determines the winner. In that case, it really is a popularity contest,<br>and the more popular person will win, because people will actually make<br>the effort to vote for him, whereas if they are not thrilled with him in<br>general, they won\'t. That\'s not democracy. That\'s representative<br>government, where the disinterested are forced to live with the choices<br>of others.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/Why-isnt-the-Electoral-College-considered-undemocratic/answer/Bill-Stein<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
