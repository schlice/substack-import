<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The Supreme Court's power is already limited.<br><br>The Constitution checks the Judicial branch:<br><br>- The court does not have *original jurisdiction* in the vast majority<br>  of cases. It only has *appellate jurisdiction,* which means cases can<br>  be *appealed* to it, but cases cannot *originate* in it. There is one<br>  notable exception: cases involving disputes between two or more<br>  states, cases where a state is a party, and cases affecting<br>  ambassadors, other public ministers, and consuls. This means these<br>  cases are initially tried in the Supreme Court, not a lower court, and<br>  the Supreme Court\'s decision is final. In every other case, the case<br>  must be heard by a lower court and then appealed to the Supreme Court.<br><br>The Legislative Branch checks the Judicial branch:<br><br>- Justices on the Supreme Court are subject to impeachment, just as any<br>  other federal official is. The Legislative Branch can impeach a<br>  Justice.<br>- Finally, the Legislative Branch can override a Supreme Court ruling by<br>  re-writing an offending law in such a way that it does not violate the<br>  Constitution. In that way, the law is still in effect, but it simply<br>  does not violate the Constitution.<br><br>The Executive Branch also checks the Judicial branch:<br><br>- The Executive Branch checks the Judicial Branch through its power to<br>  nominate judges, issue pardons, and enforce court decisions. The<br>  President nominates judges, including Supreme Court justices, but<br>  these nominations require confirmation by the Senate. The President<br>  also has the power to issue pardons for federal crimes, which can<br>  influence the outcome of judicial cases. Finally, the Executive Branch<br>  is responsible for enforcing court orders, which is essential for the<br>  judicial system to function effectively.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
