  exist?"'

<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>It does seem necessary that any Palestinians who wish to remain in Gaza<br>following the IDF operations will have to agree to the right of Israel<br>to exist.<br><br>This is not without precedent. The Israelis offered this deal to them in<br>the 40s following the war for Israeli Independence, and then again in<br>the 60s following the Six Day War. Israel told them that if they accept<br>Israel's right to exist and they live in peace, they could become **full<br>citizens of Israel.** Each time, some Palestinians took them up on the<br>offer. Those Palestinians now live free in Israel. Which is amazing,<br>because Israel is the only true democracy in the Middle East. Think<br>about that. Those Arabs are living as free citizens in the only true<br>democracy in the Middle East.<br><br>Were you aware that Muslims live free in Israel? Were you aware that<br>Israel is almost 20% Muslim? Were you aware that for the last number of<br>years, the most popular baby boy name in Israel was Muhammad? Were you<br>aware that there are Muslims who serve alongside Jews in the IDF? It's<br>true.<br><br>But back to the Palestinians. For those who choose to not accept<br>Israel's right to exist, they will not "throw away their right to<br>exist." They only "throw away their right to exist *in Gaza*." If they<br>are Palestinian civilians and not Hamas terrorists, they will be "asked"<br>to leave. We know Egypt will not take them. We can probably guess that<br>none of the other Arab nations in the region will take them (in one of<br>the greatest tragedies of the conflict). But they will have to leave all<br>the same. It's kinda like closing time at the bar: "You don't have to go<br>home, but you can't stay here."<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
