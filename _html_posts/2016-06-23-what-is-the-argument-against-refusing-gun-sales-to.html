<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The United States holds that the rights granted to citizens cannot be<br>abridged without due process. The 5th amendment says that citizens<br>cannot be deprived of "life, liberty, or property without due process of<br>the law." Guns are most definitely property.<br><br>How is someone placed on the terror watchlist? No one knows. The process<br>is secret.<br><br>Does someone on the terror watchlist have the opportunity to appeal? No,<br>there is no process.<br><br>Does someone on the terror watchlist get notified that they are added to<br>the watchlist? No. They find out when they try to buy a plane ticket and<br>discover they are on the "No Fly list" which is a derivative of the<br>terror watchlist. Trying to keep the bad guys from boarding planes and<br>flying them into buildings again.<br><br>Therefore, addition to the terror watchlist does not involve any<br>semblance of due process.<br><br>You cannot summarily deny a guaranteed right in the Constitution without<br>due process.<br><br>Therefore, **you cannot summarily remove someone's right to keep and<br>bear arms without the same due process.** Since addition to the terror<br>watchlist involves no semblance of due process at all, you cannot<br>therefore use it as a basis to lawfully deny someone a Constitutional<br>right.<br><br>You could potentially modify the process and *delay* the purchase of<br>a gun, alert the government, and give them the opportunity to bring<br>charges against the person, but if they fail to do so, we default to<br>allow the purchase to proceed.<br><br>But I don't think that's in any of the current proposals.<br><br>Thus, the stupidity of the argument.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
