<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [In theory, since it is a humanitarian mission, the US<br>would respond to China in the same way it did for Maylasia, and US<br>foreign policy is not dictated by the foreign or domestic policies of<br>other countries. We provide humanitarian support and assistance to any<br>country that requests it. I suspect the Chinese may be disinclined to<br>acquiesce to our offer of assistance, though. More likely, they<br>wouldn\'t ask for help, unlike the Malaysians, who<br>did.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
