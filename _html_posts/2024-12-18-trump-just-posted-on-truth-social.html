<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Despite the fact that I am indeed happy that Republicans have full<br>control of the government this time around, I'm not sure where he got<br>the idea that he won the biggest mandate in 129 years. I'd love to see<br>his calculations on that.<br><br>Yes, Republicans have won control of all branches of government, but<br>Trump's Presidential election success certainly isn't the biggest in 129<br>years. It's big, but not even as big as Reagan's win in 1980. Nixon won<br>with 61% of the popular vote; Trump's win, while decisive, didn't break<br>50%.<br><br>Democrats, of course, are now claiming that [[Trump can hardly claim a<br>mandate](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=30dd86&url=https://www.npr.org/2024/12/16/g-s1-38003/trump-mandate-presidents){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="npr.org"}]{.qlink_container} when he didn't even break 50%<br>of the popular vote. Fine, Democrats. If 50% of the popular vote is the<br>minimum required to claim a mandate, we'll be certain to remember that<br>the next time a Democrat is elected to the White House. Bookmark this<br>NPR article because it will become very important when that happens.<br><br>And as far as ignorance is concerned, I don't think Trump has the<br>ability to be ignorant. He has way too many advisers telling him stuff<br>to be ignorant. He may handle it in ways you don't expect, but ignorance<br>is probably not the best descriptor for Trump.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
