<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**My neighbor asked permission to store their junk vehicle (500\$ value)<br>on my lot for a couple months, I went to ask them to remove it six<br>months later to find they moved with no contact info- dick move to have<br>it towed?**<br><br>Not necessarily a dick move, but may be an illegal move.<br><br>Abandoned vehicle laws vary by state. How long the vehicle has to be on<br>your property before it is considered abandoned and what you are allowed<br>to do with it all vary by state. [[This<br>website](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=59d1cd&url=https://www.titlegods.com/blog/2018/7/30/how-to-report-or-title-an-abandoned-car){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="titlegods.com"}]{.qlink_container} has a great list of laws<br>by state discussing abandoned cars. Make sure you understand your<br>state's laws before you have it towed.<br><br>If the appropriate time has passed and you can't reach the original<br>owner, you should probably contact your local law enforcement<br>(non-emergency number, please) and report an abandoned car on your<br>property. Explain the entire situation to them, and let them contact a<br>tow company to properly impound the vehicle. They will also try to<br>contact the registered owner of the vehicle before it is declared<br>abandoned.<br><br>The previously mentioned website has information if you want to get<br>title to the vehicle instead of just reporting it abandoned and getting<br>it towed. You only need to pursue re-titling it if you want to take<br>possession of it. You can have it towed as an abandoned vehicle without<br>obtaining title first.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
