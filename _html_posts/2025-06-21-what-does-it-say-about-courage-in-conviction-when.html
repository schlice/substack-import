<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Actually, it says more about the person asking the question rather than<br>the people described.<br><br>It's a logical fallacy (or at the very least, a great<br>oversimplification) to deal in absolutes.<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-7f5a372b84db587fd9a455aece115181){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-7f5a372b84db587fd9a455aece115181" master_w="731"<br>master_h="356"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>*(Never mind the fact that this statement is an absolute in itself,<br>because we digress...)*<br><br>Atheists may "consistently" stand for their "beliefs," but they are<br>quite confused. When they "consistently stand" for their belief, it is<br>usually the fact that they *don't believe in a god.*<br><br>That's fine, but they don't recognize that **this is actually a<br>belief.** Believing that you do not believe a god exists is, in itself,<br>a belief. You believe in the truth of that belief.<br><br>So when I (as a Christian apologist) points out that they actually have<br>a belief, they "consistently" argue that they have no belief. Confusion.<br><br>Know what else atheists have? saints. Saints are people who were<br>important leaders in their religion that have died but are remembered<br>for their contributions. Atheism has these: Christopher Hitchens, Carl<br>Sagan, George Carlin (?), etc.<br><br>Know what else atheists have? Here's a list.<br><br>- Preachers. Preachers are people who stand on the stage and deliver<br>  a message to those with similar beliefs. Atheism has these: Richard<br>  Dawkins, Sam Harris, Matt Dillahunty, etc.<br>- Core texts. Core texts (which are sacred or holy in theistic<br>  religions) are books or literature written by man that claims to tell<br>  its readers important truths about their beliefs. Atheists most<br>  definitely have these: *The God Delusion, God is Not Great, The End of<br>  Faith,* etc*.*<br>- Blasphemy. Blasphemy would be acts or statements that are so<br>  offensive to their religion that they might cause emotion or anger in<br>  the listener. To see if blasphemy exists in atheism, try this: tell an<br>  atheist that God exists, and if the atheist is emotional or upset at<br>  hearing this, does that not imply the atheist feels he is being<br>  blasphemed against?<br>- Apologetics. The definition of apologetics is "debate and<br>  argumentation that attempts to defend a religious belief against<br>  attack." There\'s a reason all the atheists are about to swarm the<br>  comments section: *to defend their religious beliefs*. If they truly<br>  believe in nothing (if they truly have a lack of belief in god), then<br>  there is no reason to defend nothing. Definitionally, "nothing" needs<br>  no defense, as it doesn't exist. A lack of belief does not need to be<br>  defended. Me blathering on about nothing shouldn't even be noteworthy.<br>  It should be nothing worth commenting on. So by responding, atheists,<br>  you are demonstrating the presence of something which is worthy of<br>  defense. And that can't be "nothing."<br><br>And finally, they have:<br><br>- Churches! Church is traditionally defined as a building (I went to<br>  church), but as was demonstrated during Covid, the church clearly<br>  identified that it is not a building, but a collection of like-minded<br>  people with similar beliefs. Do not atheists have this? American<br>  Atheists? Atheist Alliance International? Freedom From Religion<br>  Foundation? Do not these organizations meet periodically to discuss<br>  insights about their beliefs? Sounds a lot like a non-theistic church<br>  to me.<br><br>But let's get back to your absolutes point. Atheists can have<br>*degrees of belief* just as theists can. Not all atheists follow<br>atheism religiously, just as not all theists follow theism religiously.<br>For example, just as some Christians might not go to church, listen to<br>pastors, or know the Bible very well, they can still be somewhat<br>religious, or even not religious at all, while still believing in the<br>core philosophy of their religion. In fact, people tell me all the time<br>that they are Christian while either not acting like a Christian, or<br>*even while holding non-Christian beliefs.* In precisely the same way,<br>an atheist may not know anything about important and influential atheist<br>figures, or associate with atheist organizations, or go out seeking to<br>engage in debate or apologetics about atheism, and still just hold a<br>quiet and private belief that God does not exist.<br><br>So your points about how atheists consistently stand firm for their<br>beliefs, but many self-proclaimed Christians often run from or are<br>offended by basic theological questions is simply incorrect, on both<br>fronts. I personally believe atheism is a non-theistic religion. We both<br>have religion, but we have different objects of our belief.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
