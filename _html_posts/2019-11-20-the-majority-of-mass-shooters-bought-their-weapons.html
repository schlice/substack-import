<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**The majority of mass shooters bought their weapons legally. However,<br>most had criminal or mental histories, precluding the purchase of those<br>weapons. How can different agencies share that information so current<br>firearms laws can be enforced properly?**<br><br>The reason you're having trouble with this is because you have one<br>inaccurate statement, and I'll bold it for you:<br><br>> However, most had criminal or mental histories, **precluding the<br>> purchase of those weapons.**<br><br>While it is true that most of the mass shooters we've had so far have<br>had criminal or mental histories, **most of those did not preclude the<br>purchase of weapons.**<br><br>In order to be precluded from purchasing firearms, you have to be a<br>convicted felon, or have been adjudicated a mental defective in court.<br>There are two incidents that I know of where a prohibited person may<br>have been inadvertently allowed to purchase a weapon:<br><br>1.  Sutherland Springs: The Air Force may have been responsible to pass<br>    information on to NICS, but it's still unclear based on the<br>    disposition of his discharge as to whether or not that information<br>    exchange was mandatory.<br>2.  Charleston. Dylan Roof was indeed prohibited because of a<br>    prescription drug charge, and should have been denied. However, a<br>    clerical error led to the investigation not being done within the<br>    requisite time frame, and a "default allow" being issued.<br><br>All of the other shooters did, or would have, passed their background<br>checks and would have been allowed to purchase firearms.<br><br>Also important to note: the two situations I know of were convicted<br>felons, not mental defectives, even though most of them had mental<br>issues which should have, in some way, told someone that they should<br>probably stay away from firearms. But the system isn't set up that way.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
