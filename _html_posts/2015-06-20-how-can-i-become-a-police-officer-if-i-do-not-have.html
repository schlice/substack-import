<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [I missed the part on the application that said, \"Do you<br>have a dark sense of humor?\" I must have had an outdated application.\<br>\<br>You are *generalizing*, which means you are taking your encounters with<br>police and extrapolating them as normal behavior across the entire<br>force. How many cops have you had dealings with? Maybe 20? Unless<br>you\'ve been in the system, in which case that would be higher. There<br>are over 300,000 active police officers in this country and you got a<br>good random sampling of them through your personal experiences?<br>Sheesh.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
