<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What, if anything, do Christianity, Judaism or Islam teach about the<br>origin of God? In other words, if God created the heavens and the earth,<br>where (if anywhere) do these religions explain God to have come from?**<br><br>God, by definition, doesn't come from anywhere. He is *eternal*,<br>necessarily so.<br><br>Why is it necessary that God is eternal? Because anything that is not<br>eternal has a cause, which means it has a beginning, which means that<br>there would have to be something that existed before God that caused God<br>to exist.<br><br>Christian writings teach that God caused everything to be created.<br><br>> *Through him all things were made; without him nothing was made that<br>> has been made. (John 1:3)*<br><br>Therefore, God must be timeless. He must have existed before anything<br>existed, which means He is, necessarily, eternal.<br><br>To answer your question: where did God come from? **He didn't come from<br>anywhere. He always was.**<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
