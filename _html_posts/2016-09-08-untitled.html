<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Everyone else seems to compare guns to people, imparting some kind of<br>magical mind control that the gun has over people, turning *them* into<br>killing machines. In fact, these same people see the mere presence of a<br>gun as somehow changing people, making them kill when previously they<br>wouldn't.<br><br>The gun is simply a tool. It is a tool to kill. In that sense, it is a<br>"killing machine." Killing may be distasteful to you (as it is to most<br>normally-adjusted people), but killing can also be legally and morally<br>justified. If you are in a situation where killing can be justified, why<br>would you not use the best tool for the job? Guns are arguably the most<br>efficient tool available to take a life while simultaneously not<br>affecting people standing right next to the intended target. It is a<br>very precise, high-velocity method to impart deadly force. Ultimately,<br>that's all it is. *On its own*, it does nothing. Not a single one of<br>my guns has ever gotten up and killed anyone. The gun requires a<br>person imparting the will to take a life to operate it and cause<br>death. The addition of the person makes the gun a killing machine.<br>Alone, it does nothing.<br><br>Knives were originally designed as "killing machines" as well, but they<br>found far more utility as cutting tools. They are still used as killing<br>machines, and in far greater numbers than guns. In fact, most domestic<br>violence cases involve knives. Do you have the same dislike for kitchen<br>knives? Or has their perceived utility in your mind overcome the fact<br>that they were, and still are, quite efficient killing machines?<br><br>Cars were never designed as killing machines, but they are indeed just<br>that. Cars kill more people than guns and knives combined. But because<br>cars have such incredible utility in transportation, we ignore<br>completely that they are killing machines. The only difference between a<br>car and a gun is that the car was not designed as a killing machine.<br><br>I just want you to evaluate your dislike and understand it for what it<br>is. Your dislike is *your* issue, not the gun's, or the knife's. It's<br>something you must own. And like the knife, if you start to see the<br>utility in the gun as a tool of self-defense, you can overcome your<br>dislike of it in the same way you have overcome your dislike of the<br>knife as a killing machine.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/Laws-and-regulations-aside-why-are-some-U-S-gun-owners-surprised-if-you-say-you-dont-like-guns/answer/Chris-Bast<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
