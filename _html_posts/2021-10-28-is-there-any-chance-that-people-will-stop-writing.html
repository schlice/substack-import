<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Nope.<br><br>Quora makes changes to its platform on a regular basis. Lately, it<br>appears that platform changes have been appearing weekly, sometimes<br>multiple times per week. There is no guarantee that the banner you<br>specified will remain on previous questions, and it's a simple macro I<br>programmed which pastes the original question at the bottom of my<br>answer, so it's only a combination keystroke to splat it at the bottom<br>of my answer.<br><br>It's simple, it's quick, it doesn't detract from the answer, and it<br>conclusively shows you the question I answered, even if the question is<br>changed, and even if Quora removes or changes its "original question"<br>banner.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Is there any chance that people will stop writing, \"Original question:<br>blah...blah...blah...\"? For years Quora has posted when the original<br>question changed at the beginning of all previous answers.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
