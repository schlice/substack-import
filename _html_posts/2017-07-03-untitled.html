<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Participation in extracurricular activities is important to becoming a<br>strong candidate. The [[Academy<br>Admissions](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=338591&url=https://www.academyadmissions.com/admissions/advice-to-applicants/high-school-and-college-students/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="academyadmissions.com"}]{.qlink_container} website says,<br>"Sustained participation in select activities over the course of your<br>high school career is preferred." Emphasizing one over the other is<br>probably not ideal. You do need all of it: the academics, the athletics<br>(your football will count for that), and other non-athletic<br>extracurricular activities as well. In short, all extracurricular<br>activities (athletic and non-athletic) are combined in your<br>Extracurricular Composite. The EC is combined with your Academic<br>Composite to form your Weighted Composite.<br><br>EC + AC = WC<br><br>Your Weighted Composite is added to your Selection Panel Rating to form<br>your Selection Composite, or your overall competitive standing. The<br>Selection Panel will look at qualitative factors that might be missed in<br>other objective tests, such as your Character Evaluation done by your<br>ALO, and your Fitness Assessment. These make up the "whole person"<br>evaluation that the Selection Panel Rating reflects.<br><br>WC + SPR = SC<br><br>Like I mentioned, strong academic qualifications alone are not enough to<br>make you competitive for appointment. The relative weighting of the<br>scores that go into your overall competitive standing are:<br><br>- Academic Composite: 50%<br>- Extracurricular Composite: 20%<br>- Selection Panel Rating: 30%<br><br>You can see that your Extracurricular Composite factors less heavily<br>than your selection panel rating, but the two combined (EC and SPR) add<br>equally alongside your AC to form your SC.<br><br>I strongly suggest you use the [[Admissions Liaison Officer (ALO)<br>Locator](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=3baf43&url=https://www.academyadmissions.com/admissions/outreach-programs/find-your-admissions-liaison-officer/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="academyadmissions.com"}]{.qlink_container} tool on the<br>Admissions website and get in contact with your ALO. They can help<br>answer your specific questions and help guide you through the admissions<br>process.
