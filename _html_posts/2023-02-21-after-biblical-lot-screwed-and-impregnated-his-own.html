<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The Bible is filled with flawed people. All kinds of evil people are<br>represented in the Bible: murderers, rapists, philanderers, misogynists,<br>prostitutes, gold-diggers, they're all in there.<br><br>I mean, just look at the people Jesus kept company with. Matthew was a<br>tax collector. Mary Magdeline was a prostitute. He kept company with<br>other tax collectors like Zaccheus. Heck, Saul (later Paul) was probably<br>the worst among them. Saul persecuted the early church, and he was<br>ruthless, breaking into homes and arresting not just the male<br>ringleaders, but the women too.<br><br>But that's the point.<br><br>The Bible is not full of saints and wonderful people, *because none of<br>us are saints or wonderful people.* We are all sinners. We have all<br>fallen short of God's grace.<br><br>*But these are exactly the people Jesus came to save*. A doctor doesn't<br>treat people who are well, he treats people who are sick.<br><br>And none of us have moral superiority. In fact, we are the worst of the<br>bunch, myself included. What I do have is *a Savior who has His own<br>moral superiority*. He is where I turn for salvation. I don't count<br>myself better than anyone else. I am only who I am *because of Him*.<br><br>And He can offer the same to you. **Just like the baddies in the Bible,<br>He can save anyone.**<br><br>The Bible is not the source of morality. Jesus is. And Jesus was<br>sinless and perfect, and He died to relieve us of the sin which infects<br>every one of us. If He can save the evil people in the Bible, He can<br>save me, and He can save you too.<br><br>All you have to do is ask.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
