If yes, what is the role of the Congress? Isn't it<br>the job of the president of the US only to execute laws?**<br><br>In the US, the president does not make law. Congress makes laws. The<br>president and his agencies execute and enforce laws.<br><br>You may be confused with Executive Orders. These are orders the<br>president makes to his own Executive Branch agencies for how to enforce<br>*existing* law. They do not create *new* law, and when it happens, the<br>laws are generally overturned. The most recent example of this is the<br>DACA program which President Obama enacted via Executive Order. This<br>program will likely be found to be unconstitutional by the Supreme Court<br>this summer.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
