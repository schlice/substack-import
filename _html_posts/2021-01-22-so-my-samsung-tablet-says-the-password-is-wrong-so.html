<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**So my Samsung tablet says the password is wrong so I tried to factory<br>reset (power, volume, home button) but it just bring me to "warning OS<br>screen" so I click cancel to continue and it says "downloading do not<br>turn off target" what do I do?**<br><br>You didn't reset it. You put it into DFU or (Firmware Download) mode.<br>That mode allows you to load a new firmware to your tablet, which is not<br>what you want.<br><br>Try this instead:<br><br>1.  Ensure the device is powered off.<br>2.  Press and hold the Volume Up and Power buttons.<br>3.  Continue to hold Volume Up and Power buttons until the Android<br>    Recovery screen appears (about 10-15 seconds) then release both<br>    buttons.<br>4.  From the Android Recovery screen, select Wipe data/factory reset.<br>5.  Select Yes.<br><br>If this is not working, we'll need a little more information, like which<br>specific model of Samsung tablet you have.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
