<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Should or could the impeachment charges against ex-President Donald<br>John Trump be amended or expanded?**<br><br>The impeachment is complete. It cannot be expanded or amended, as it has<br>already been transmitted to the Senate, and to modify it now would<br>require a new Bill of Impeachment. The House cannot pass a new one as<br>the person is no longer a Federal official. You cannot impeach someone<br>who is no longer a Federal official.<br><br>Which poses an interesting Constitutional question for the trial: ***how<br>can you try someone in Congress who is not a Federal official?*** You<br>may have noticed that Chief Justice Roberts declined to serve as the<br>judge for the trial. He's right to decline, as he can only serve when<br>the President is on trial. The president is not on trial, a private<br>citizen is on trial (which is also an issue, and we'll get there). The<br>Vice President (the President of the Senate) would be the next logical<br>choice, but she cannot preside, as she has a direct conflict of<br>interest, which is why they chose Sen. Leahy. The framers of the<br>Constitution never contemplated an ex-President being tried, as the<br>punishment is moot (removal from office).<br><br>The Constitution specifically forbids Congress trying private citizens<br>in its prohibition against *Bills of Attainder*. A Bill of Attainder<br>is a legislative act that singles out an individual citizen or group of<br>citizens for punishment without a trial, and while we call the Senate<br>proceedings a "trial," it is actually not, because the Senate "trial" is<br>only for Federal officials, not private citizens. The Constitution<br>provides that \"<br>\o Bill of Attainder or ex post facto Law will<br>be passed\" (Article I, Section 9, Paragraph 3). Simply put, you cannot<br>try a civilian in a political venue, especially when the result could be<br>a punishment.<br><br>But Trump is no ordinary citizen; he is a former President. So the<br>Senate will have to vote to determine whether or not they should proceed<br>with a trial. Of course, the Senate will vote that it does have standing<br>to try an ex-President, but it will be a very close vote. It might even<br>be 50--50, and the Vice President will have to break the tie.<br><br>But this also means that there is no way in the Hot Place that you'll<br>get 2/3 to convict, mostly because of what we just talked about:<br>Congress does not have standing to punish a civilian, and Congress is<br>Constitutionally prohibited from passing a Bill of Attainder, which is<br>what any punishment against a civilian would amount to. So you will find<br>that if a trial goes forward (unconstitutionally, of course), many of<br>the people who vote against any punishment will do so because they<br>recognize the lack of Constitutional authority, and the specific<br>prohibition against Bills of Attainder.<br><br>And *even if they did*, while unlikely, Trump, as a private citizen,<br>would have valid grounds to contest the bill in Federal court as a<br>Constitutional violation against a Bill of Attainder.<br><br>\<br><br>*For the time being, I have re-enabled comments on selected answers.<br>Some people like to comment. Some people like to engage with me in a<br>civil manner, and I did kinda miss that\...a little.

If my answer is grammatically low-quality or is un-cited opinion<br>masquerading as fact, downvote it. If you think I\'m wrong, write your<br>own answer. But Quora is a question-and-answer site, not a debate site.<br>If you are simply commenting to tell me \"ackshually, you\'re wrong,\"<br>don\'t be surprised if I quietly delete your comment. Put anything<br>vaguely harassing in there, and your deletion will be followed by a<br>block/mute, and a BNBR report. I will do this immediately and with no<br>compunction. You have been warned.
