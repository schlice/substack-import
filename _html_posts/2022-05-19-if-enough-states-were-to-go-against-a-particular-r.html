<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The Court doesn't issue "rulings" that states must follow. The Court<br>simply decides whether a law, or the way the law is implemented,<br>violates the Constitution.<br><br>For example, the draft opinion from the court regarding *Dobbs v.<br>Jackson Women's Health* says that the law is Constitutional because the<br>grounds upon which the case was appealed (a violation of the finding in<br>*Roe v. Wade*) are unconstitutional. In doing this, the Court is stating<br>that the finding in *Griswold v. Connecticut* (that a right to privacy<br>exists in the Constitution) was incorrectly decided and is reversed, and<br>that the finding which flowed from it in *Roe v. Wade* (that the right<br>to privacy found in *Griswold* extended to abortion rights) is also<br>reversed.<br><br>Therefore, since none of these things are actually<br>Constitutionally-guaranteed rights, the question of whether or not those<br>things are *legal* falls back on the states to decide. States are<br>actually free to do as they please when it comes to abortion. Some<br>states will ban it, most states will apply some level of restriction to<br>it, and some states will allow it completely.<br><br>However, if the Supreme Court finds that a law is constitutional, any<br>state "going against" that finding (and enforcing the unconstitutional<br>law anyway) will find that the aggrieved party will file suit in<br>district court alleging that the law is unconstitutional based on the<br>Supreme Court's findings, and the law in that state will be ruled<br>unconstitutional and will be unenforceable.<br><br>At best, the state could re-write the law to achieve the same goal,<br>while doing so in a Constitutional way.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>If enough states were to go against a particular ruling from the Supreme<br>Court, could they possibly overrule it?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
