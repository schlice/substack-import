<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>No.<br><br>There's really not much more to say than no, but if you want some level<br>of explanation, here's some:<br><br>1.  **You have no idea why the police officer is doing what he is<br>    doing.** Police have the legal authority to enforce the law, and to<br>    ensure the safety of the general public. When a police officer uses<br>    (or threatens to use) deadly force, it is because he is attempting<br>    to stop a threat to life or a threat to cause grave bodily harm.<br>    What is "grave bodily harm?" Here's an example: if someone punches<br>    you in the face so hard that he shatters your orbital socket, you<br>    could be blinded in that eye. That vision may return, or it may not.<br>    Nevertheless, this is considered "grave bodily harm" and any<br>    citizen, not just police, has the right to defend themselves against<br>    such harm. The police have the additional burden of defending<br>    society in general against that harm, and allowing such a person to<br>    continue constitutes an exigent threat against the public at large.<br>    You may not know this. You may only see a police officer and an<br>    unarmed man.<br>2.  As we have said numerous times here, **unarmed does not mean "not<br>    dangerous."** Unarmed people can inflict the "grave bodily harm" we<br>    spoke of in the previous bullet. For example, if a person is<br>    mentally unstable, he may cause great bodily harm, without thought<br>    for his own well-being, and doesn't need any weapon to do that.<br>    Also, if a person is under the influence of drugs, not only can he<br>    cause bodily harm, but depending on the drug, he could be entirely<br>    immune to pain control techniques, such as Tasers.<br>3.  Finally, **you have no authority to insert yourself into the<br>    police's job.** If you think you can do it better, feel free to pick<br>    up an application at the police station and fill it out. Don't think<br>    you can become Joe or Jane Vigilante and expect to get off. If you<br>    shoot a cop, you will be the focus of the investigation, not the<br>    person who the officer had in his own sights. Also, consider this:<br>    if the police are going to use deadly force, they have to be able to<br>    reasonably articulate an imminent threat to themselves or to the<br>    public. Whether or not their opinion is "reasonable" is a matter of<br>    fact which is determined by a court. Not you, not the public, not<br>    YouTubers. A court. If you size up a situation and determine that<br>    the officer is not reasonable in their belief that there is an<br>    imminent threat to the public, you are abrogating a duty of the<br>    court onto yourself, which in and of itself is not lawful. You have<br>    no legal authority to make decisions that are supposed to be made by<br>    a court, and you will be charged as an aggressor.<br><br>So if you see something like this happening, what should you do? I know<br>it seems like the "in" thing to do these days, but if you're there, and<br>you have your phone handy (and who doesn't), take a video. Turn the<br>video over to the local media when you're done. They will be sure to use<br>it to boost their ratings. Or, if you're more interested in seeing<br>justice done than seeing your video on the local news, turn your video<br>over to the District Attorney's office and let them investigate the<br>police.<br><br>Then put it on YouTube.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
