<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Is it not undue search to systematically fingerprint and photograph<br>American citizens upon entry to the USA?**<br><br>Why would you want to photograph and fingerprint American citizens who<br>enter the USA? They already have passports (which imply fingerprints)<br>and photographs in those passports. Sounds like an unnecessary extra<br>step when the information is already there.<br><br>To the legality of the operation (should you decide to waste the money<br>to do it), it should be legal. The appearance of your face is not<br>protected information. Your fingerprints are also not PII (Personally<br>Identifying Information) like your Social Security Number. You willingly<br>leave your fingerprints everywhere you go, so if they are protected,<br>you're doing a bad job at protecting them (unless you wear latex gloves<br>all day which is just weird unless you're a doctor).<br><br>But why would you do this to American citizens in Customs while they are<br>returning to the USA? It simply makes no sense. There's no good reason<br>to do it when the information is already on file.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
