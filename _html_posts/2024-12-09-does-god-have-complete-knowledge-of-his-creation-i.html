<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Yes.<br><br>As God exists outside of time, His view of our lives has a completely<br>different perspective than ours.<br><br>At the very time of the creation of the universe, God knew, for all of<br>time, that you would be born. He knew, for all of time, what decisions<br>you would freely make along the way. And He knew, for all of time, how<br>those decisions would shape your life. Because He exists *outside* of<br>time, He does not experience time as we do. For God, it's all *now*. The<br>past is *now*. The present is *now*. The future is *now*.<br><br>So indeed, He can see it all, as He exists outside of time as we know<br>it.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
