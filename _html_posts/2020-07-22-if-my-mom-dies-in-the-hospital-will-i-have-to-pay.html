<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If my mom dies in the hospital, will I have to pay her medical bills?<br>I\'m 18, going to college in the fall, and I live in Iowa. Her and I are<br>both on Medicaid.**<br><br>The fact that she is on Medicaid is important.<br><br>With Medicaid, the state in which she dies can recover medical payments<br>made from the time she turned 55 until the time of her death.<br><br>The state can only use assets to pay the bill; the state can't make you<br>pay the bill out of your own pocket. They also can't collect from you if<br>you (or another adult sibling) lived in her house for at least two years<br>and helped to provide care which kept her out of a nursing home or other<br>medical facility. Since the only asset you are allowed to keep on<br>Medicaid is a house, the state can put a lien on the house to recover<br>the money. Alternatively, some states may be willing to negotiate and<br>allow the executor to pay a reduced amount to settle the hospital debt.<br><br>For people who were not on Medicaid, the estate is responsible for<br>paying the medical bills, up to its capacity to do so.
