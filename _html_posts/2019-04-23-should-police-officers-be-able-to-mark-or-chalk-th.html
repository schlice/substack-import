<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Should police officers be able to mark or chalk the wheels of parked<br>cars in the interest of parking enforcement? Or is this a 4th Amendment<br>violation?**<br><br>This is an absolutely fascinating case.<br><br>A Michigan woman, who admittedly was a "frequent recipient of parking<br>tickets" eventually decided to challenge the constitutionality of<br>chalking tires.<br><br>And she won.<br><br>[[The 6th Circuit Court<br>ruled](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=591248&url=http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/chalking-tires-constitutes-unreasonable-search-appeals-court-rules){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="abajournal.com"}]{.qlink_container} that when the police<br>mark a tire with a piece of chalk, this is a "trespass" on a<br>Constitutionally-protected location in a public place. In just the same<br>way that when SCOTUS ruled in 2012 that placing a GPS tracker on a<br>vehicle is a "search," the 6th Circuit ruled that placing a chalk mark<br>on a vehicle is an unconstitutional trespass to gain evidence, and is a<br>4th Amendment violation.<br><br>Additionally, the court found that chalking vehicles violates the<br>"reasonableness" standard. The city searches vehicles \"that are parked<br>legally, without probable cause, or even so much as \'individualized<br>suspicion of wrongdoing\' --- the touchstone of the reasonableness<br>standard,\"<br><br>Clearly, police can sidestep the whole Constitutional issue by simply<br>taking a picture of the vehicle, which is perfectly legal. You can chalk<br>mark the ground around the tires, since that's not actually trespassing<br>on the vehicle, but is marking the public area around the vehicle. The<br>marks on the ground, in combination with the photographs, should be<br>enough evidence to determine if the vehicle is in the same position, or<br>if it was moved and returned to the same spot.<br><br>Now, if even photographs are found to be in violation of the<br>"reasonableness" standard, because the city takes pictures of vehicles<br>without any probable cause that the vehicle is illegally parked, then<br>this may change how cities enforce parking regulations. This may force<br>more cities to move to metered parking rather than time-based<br>enforcement. Personally, I believe that since it is perfectly legal to<br>take a picture of a vehicle for whatever purpose you like, there should<br>be no Constitutional issue taking pictures of city streets and then<br>comparing them to future pictures of city streets for vehicles in the<br>same location for more than the allotted time. The city could even set<br>up cameras which routinely take pictures of sections of the street.<br>Parking officials could review the camera snapshots for vehicles parked<br>in one spot for more than the allotted time, and ticket those vehicles.<br>The photographic evidence should be sufficient to meet the<br>reasonableness standard, and since the cameras take continuous pictures<br>of all parking spots, there is no issue of probable cause in targeting<br>any specific vehicle.<br><br>So she should be proud that she caused police procedure to change,<br>possibly causing city parking policies to be re-examined, and she made a<br>4th Amendment case which law students will be talking about for decades.<br>And she got out of one parking ticket.<br><br>But that's about it.<br><br>She's still going to get parking tickets.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
