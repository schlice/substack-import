<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [It is neither of the items you have cited. Specifically,<br>it is *their* interpretation of their religion that leads them to do<br>the things that they do. Most Muslim scholars will tell you that this is<br>not an \"exact\" interpretation of their religion. As with most<br>religions, the texts must be taken in context and as a whole.<br>Cherry-picking certain passages and using them to model your behavior is<br>a poor way to handle historical texts which must be read in context and<br>with the whole of the document in mind.\<br>\<br>Poor interpretation of religious texts has led to some very bad<br>consequences in the past. The Spanish Inquisition and the Crusades are<br>examples from the Roman Catholic church, so in my opinion, no religion<br>is immune from such invalid thought.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
