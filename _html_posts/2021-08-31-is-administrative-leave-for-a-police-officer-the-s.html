<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Functionally, yes. The officer is not performing work responsibilities<br>in uniform, and is still getting paid.<br><br>But that's literally where the similarities end.<br><br>The officer is usually told to stay home. Back in the day (BC, Before<br>Cellphones), they were literally told to stay home to stay near the<br>phone. Today, most departments don't force the officers to stay home,<br>but they must stay close to home. Some tell them that they have to stay<br>within a certain distance of the department so that they can be called<br>in as required. They may not perform any law-enforcement duties during<br>this time.<br><br>The time away is no picnic. If the officer was involved in a shooting,<br>they are likely not sleeping at night, while their brain replays the<br>events over and over, processing the trauma and inventing new scenarios<br>to try to see if it could have ended differently. To that end, the<br>officer will have to schedule psychiatric counseling during this time<br>(and in the vast majority of cases, they need it to help process what<br>they have been through). The department, in the meantime, is collecting<br>as much evidence as they have, and will be conducting a Use of Force<br>Review. That review will determine whether or not the officer used force<br>appropriately and if they need remedial training, or perhaps if force<br>was used incorrectly or unlawfully, disciplinary action, up to and<br>including termination. The District Attorney will be starting their<br>investigation, and their investigators will probably want to talk to the<br>officer, so he has to be available for those interviews. Finally, the<br>Department of Justice may start investigations to see if the victim's<br>civil rights were denied.<br><br>So the officer sits away from work, constantly replaying what he did,<br>while his employer goes over his every action with a fine-toothed comb<br>to see if he did anything wrong and to determine whether or not he gets<br>to keep his job, while at the same time, the DA and the DOJ look to see<br>if he needs to go to jail for doing his job.<br><br>If this is your idea of "paid vacation," we should consider vacationing<br>separately.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Is administrative leave for a police officer the same as a paid<br>vacation?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
