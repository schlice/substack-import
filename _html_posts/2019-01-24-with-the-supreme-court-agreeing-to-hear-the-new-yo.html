<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**With the Supreme Court agreeing to hear the New York firearms<br>transport laws case, is it likely that they will agree to hear<br>challenges to state assault weapons bans in the future?**<br><br>Possibly.<br><br>The court has already upheld assault weapons bans (AWBs) in New York,<br>Connecticut, and Maryland, so it's likely that AWBs will be unaffected<br>by whatever SCOTUS finds in this transport case. However, these AWBs<br>came before the court while Kennedy was still present, so the court may<br>have simply been unsure about the outcome, so they refused to hear those<br>cases.<br><br>With Kavanaugh on the court now, they may be feeling a little bit more<br>sure about their chances.<br><br>This case is specifically about people with premises licenses<br>transporting their guns outside of city limits. They're already allowed<br>to transport within city limits, to one of the seven gun ranges in the<br>city, but the current law disallows them from transporting their guns<br>*outside* of city limits, anywhere, at any time, for any reason, no<br>exceptions. And considering that the lower courts already upheld the<br>law, there's a really good chance that SCOTUS did not agree to review<br>just so they could uphold the law, too. It's probably a good sign that<br>the law is on its way out.<br><br>So why now, and why this corner case? It could be that SCOTUS is simply<br>stretching its newly-originalist Constitutional legs, and this simple<br>case is a good way to do it. Or, they're taking baby steps towards<br>developing a full body of gun rights precedent. First, it's striking<br>down a really stupid New York restriction, and then moving on to<br>dismantling other, more onerous restrictions. Finally, the court could<br>be ready to apply a test to the Second Amendment. A test would be<br>something that you could use to measure whether or not any law is<br>Constitutional. It could be a "strict scrutiny" test, wherein the<br>government law must be narrowly tailored to advance a compelling state<br>interest. If they created such a test, most gun control laws would be in<br>violation. They could impose an "intermediate scrutiny" test, wherein a<br>state law must advance an important government interest "by means that<br>are substantially related to that interest." It is this level of<br>scrutiny that currently allows most gun control regulations to remain<br>intact, such as the aforementioned assault weapons bans.<br><br>The truth is, we don't really know. But the simple fact that the court<br>has entertained another gun case within a decade is a telling sign in<br>and of itself: they're ready to put some well-needed definition to the<br>Second Amendment.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
