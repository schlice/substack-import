There are requirements<br>to hold the office of the President, but not being under investigation<br>is not one of them.<br><br>Remember, in the US, you are innocent until proven guilty. And being<br>*accused* of a crime is not the same as being charged with a crime or<br>being indicted for a crime.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
