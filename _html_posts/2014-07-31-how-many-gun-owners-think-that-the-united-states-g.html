<br/><br/>Answer<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content: [There was a quote attributed to Norman Thomas, the famous<br/>US socialist, but that attribution is dubious at best. Nevertheless, the<br/>quote is salient and pertinent:\<br/>\<br/>"The American people will never knowingly adopt socialism. But under the<br/>name of Liberalism, they will adopt every fragment of the socialist<br/>program until one day America will be a socialist nation without knowing<br/>how it happened."\<br/>\<br/>This is the only way the United States will ever become like Nazi<br/>Germany: the expansion of Liberalism until we have become a fully<br/>socialist nation. And without a single shot being fired.\<br/>\<br/>It has nothing to do with guns, as the implication in your question<br/>states. Gun control advocates don\'t want the US to become like Nazi<br/>Germany either. Perhaps it would be easier for them to control guns if<br/>it was, but they don\'t want the US to become like Nazi Germany<br/>either.]<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content language: English<br/><br/><br/>
