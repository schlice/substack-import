<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Most of the time, you can do the chest compressions with the bra in<br>place.<br><br>Your correct hand placement on adults:<br><br>- Find the sternum (the big flat bone in the dead center of the chest).<br>- Find the base of the sternum.<br>- Measure two fingers width distance from the base of the sternum with<br>  your non-dominant hand.<br>- Place the heel of your dominant hand right next to your two-finger<br>  measurement on the sternum. That is the correct location to perform<br>  chest compressions.<br><br>You should be able to perform the compressions successfully without<br>having to move the bra.<br><br>I think the only situation which might cause problems is if you're<br>actually pushing the base of the bra, and underwires are cutting into<br>the skin. In that case, I'd move the bra out of the way and continue<br>chest compressions. Look, modesty is out the door when a heart is not<br>beating.<br><br>Similarly, to get correct AED probe placement, you would use the<br>included forceps in the AED kit to cut the bra off. That's a must for an<br>AED, but not necessary for chest compressions.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
