<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Rather than link these two answers, it makes more sense for me to just<br>quote this question:<br><br>[[Prisons and Prison Life: What are some last meals ordered by<br>inmates?](https://www.quora.com/Prisons-and-Prison-Life-What-are-some-last-meals-ordered-by-inmates)]{.qlink_container}<br><br>These are some examples of last meals ordered by inmates. As you can<br>see, some of them are fairly extravagant, and some are fairly basic.<br><br>In nearly all cases, the prison attempts to comply with the "last<br>wishes" of the prisoners, but in all cases, the rules for executions are<br>exceedingly well detailed, including the details about last meals.<br><br>Of course, it varies by state (and sometimes by prison), but in general,<br>there aren't limits to what a convict can order, so long as it is within<br>reason. Requesting Kobe beef *from Japan* might be unreasonable for a US<br>prisoner, but simply requesting Kobe beef that you can get from your<br>local specialty butcher might be a more reasonable request.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
