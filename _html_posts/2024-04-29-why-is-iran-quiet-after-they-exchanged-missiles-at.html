<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Oh, that one's easy.<br><br>Despite what Iran said, literally 99% of what they threw at Israel was<br>intercepted before it got anywhere close.<br><br>Israel retaliated, but in a very measured way, despite what they wanted,<br>and in a greater way than Joe Biden wanted. Israel launched a limited<br>couterattack with just a few attack aircraft *which never entered<br>Iranian airspace*, and Israel *completely destroyed* their launch<br>sites. Think about that. They threw hundreds of drones and rockets at<br>Israel, and they were all knocked out of the sky with no damage. In<br>response, just a handful of Israeli jets *completely destroyed those<br>launch sites* *without ever setting foot in Iranian territory.*<br><br>The message from Israel was loud and clear: *your attack was useless,<br>and we can reach out and obliterate you with just a few fighter jets,<br>without even breaking a sweat. Don't push us.*<br><br>The limited engagement also allowed Iran to quietly deny that anything<br>happened, thus allowing them to "save face" in the Arab nation<br>community. Which, unsurprisingly, they took, and brushed the whole<br>unfortunate incident under the rug.<br><br>And that, as they say, is that. You won't hear anything else on it from<br>anyone because Iran is going to deny any retaliation ever happened, and<br>Israel knows just how effective they are, and no one really wants to<br>start World War III with direct engagement. So Iran will go back to<br>fighting a proxy war to keep their nose "clean" and no one's the wiser.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
