<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>In the US, your medical plan will pay for your injuries.<br><br>Your insurance company will want to know how you became injured. They<br>may use that information to seek reimbursement for some of their costs.<br>For example, if you were injured in a car accident, your insurance<br>company may file lawsuit against the at-fault driver to recoup some of<br>your medical costs. Or they may seek reimbursement from the auto<br>insurance policy of the at-fault driver to cover your medical expenses.<br>Or they may just send you the bill and make you do all the work.<br><br>I admit, it may be difficult to recoup costs from terrorists.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
