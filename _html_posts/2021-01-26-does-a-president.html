The president's pardon power is absolute, and defined in the<br>Constitution.<br><br>Impeachment is a remedy to remove a federal official from office after<br>he has committed "high crimes and misdemeanors." It is a political<br>remedy, not a criminal one.<br><br>An impeached president is still president. It is up to the Senate to<br>remove the president from office, and optionally vote to deny that<br>president the ability to ever hold public office again. None of that<br>reverses any previous decisions the president lawfully made while<br>president.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
