<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>To answer this question, you have to elaborate.<br><br>- You must identify who the criminals are, if you know who they are.<br>- You must identify the crime committed, if you know it.<br>- You must identify what, to you, constitutes "real justice." Is that a<br>  proper decision in court, or will you only be satisfied if this person<br>  or persons is either incarcerated or executed? This helps to clarify<br>  your definition of "justice." To some, "justice" actually means<br>  "retribution."<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
