<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>As you can see, there is a great deal of ambiguity over your mere<br>possession of such pictures.<br><br>This is partially because whether or not a nude picture rises to the<br>level of child pornography (CP) is *subjective*. It depends on whether<br>or not a picture is *sexually suggestive enough* to be considered<br>pornography.<br><br>If it is, then it is *possible* that in your state, you may be eligible<br>to be charged with "possession of CP."<br><br>You could *then* commit any number of both Federal and state crimes for<br>sending those pictures to someone else, as you could then be guilty of<br>"distribution of CP" which becomes a Federal crime when it crosses state<br>lines, as well as state crimes for possession in either state.<br><br>Age of consent does not factor in to whether or not a photo constitutes<br>CP, or whether possession of it counts as a crime. **There is no age at<br>which possession or distribution of CP becomes lawful.**<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>I'm 16 and I privately own nude images of myself on my phone, is this<br>illegal in all 50 states and would it be considered CP by law all over<br>the U.S for a teen my age? And would sending it to someone be illegal<br>even if the age of consent is 16?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
