<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>> *War is an ugly thing, but not the ugliest of things. The decayed and<br>> degraded state of moral and patriotic feeling which thinks that<br>> nothing is worth war is much worse. The person who has nothing for<br>> which he is willing to fight, nothing which is more important than his<br>> personal safety, is a miserable creature, and has no chance of being<br>> free unless made and kept so by the exertions of better men than<br>> himself.\<br>> -John Stuart Mill*<br>><br>> *The true soldier fights not because he hates what is in front of him,<br>> but because he loves what is behind him.\<br>> -G.K. Chesterton*<br><br>Hopefully this gives you an idea why soldiers kill. This is why "murder"<br>is forbidden in the bible, not "killing."<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
