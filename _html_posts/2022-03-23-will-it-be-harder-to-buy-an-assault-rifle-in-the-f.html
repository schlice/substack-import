They are collector's pieces, and most of them *start* at about<br>\$10,000 to purchase, and that's for the cheap ones in bad condition.<br>The really good ones get ridiculously expensive, and sell for hundreds<br>of thousands of dollars, assuming you can find a collector willing to<br>part with one.<br><br>Here's the rest of the process:<br><br>[[Edward Peterson\'s answer to How do I legally own a fully automatic<br>weapon?](/How-do-I-legally-own-a-fully-automatic-weapon/answer/Edward-Peterson-20)]{.qlink_container}<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Will it be harder to buy an assault rifle in the future since you can<br>only buy assault rifles registered before 1986?
