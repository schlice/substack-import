<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>No, there is no Federal requirement for homes in the US to have<br>automatic lawn sprinklers.<br><br>While states have many and varied laws regarding the *use* of in-ground<br>or above-ground automatic sprinkler systems (such as required additional<br>equipment and usage specifications), there are no requirements to<br>actually have them in any state law. Most homes (especially new<br>construction) have them pre-installed by the builder, especially if the<br>builder is building out the entire neighborhood (as in the case of a<br>master planned community).<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Are homes in the US required to have an automatic lawn sprinkler?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
