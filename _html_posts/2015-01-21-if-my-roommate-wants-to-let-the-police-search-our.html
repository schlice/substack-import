<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [If the police have a warrant, whether or not your roommate<br>gives permission is irrelevant. The search covers what the warrant lists<br>as covered. If it covers your room, then no amount of locked doors will<br>prevent anything.\<br>\<br>I will assume that the police do not have a warrant, and they can only<br>search what they are given permission to search. In that instance, in<br>most jurisdictions, **your roommate is allowed to consent to a search of<br>your room**. Your lease does not define \"areas\" within your apartment<br>or home that exclusively belong to one person or another. You both are<br>listed on the lease, so you both have full access to the full facility.\<br>\<br>You may have defined areas in your apartment or home that \"belong\" to<br>one of you or to the other of you, but that\'s an \"agreement\" between<br>the two of you and is not legally binding in most jurisdictions. Your<br>roommate can grant access to search a room, and if he can get in, so can<br>the police. If your roommate can\'t get in, the police can enter the<br>room with your roommate\'s permission. So hopefully your roommate<br>doesn\'t give them permission to search your room. Doesn\'t matter what<br>you have posted on your door. Doesn\'t matter that your door is locked.<br>If your roommate is on the lease, he can give permission for any part of<br>the home to be searched. Legally, this is allowed because the roommate<br>is on the lease. Again, this is variable dependent on jurisdiction. In<br>practice, though, it is unlikely that this would happen because you\'re<br>crossing into legal gray area, and police want whatever they find to be<br>admissible in court, so they are going to make sure they cover their<br>bases.\<br>\<br>Ultimately, what would happen in that circumstance is that if the police<br>encounter a locked door, even if the roommate gives permission, but the<br>person who exclusively uses that space is not home to grant access, the<br>police will get a telephonic warrant to search that location if they<br>have probable cause to believe that something they want is in there.<br>Then they will break the door and enter. Should only take them about 20<br>minutes to secure a telephonic warrant, and then they will enter your<br>room anyway.\<br>\<br>It\'s likely that if the police don\'t know or can\'t articulate what<br>they are looking for, even if they have the roommate\'s permission, they<br>won\'t enter your locked room without a warrant.\<br>\<br>The only exception to this would be exigent circumstances. If they<br>believe you are holding a prisoner in there against their will or if<br>they believe that evidence is in there in the process of being destroyed<br>(i.e. you stareted a wipe of a hard drive and then locked your door and<br>left), then they can enter without a warrant.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
