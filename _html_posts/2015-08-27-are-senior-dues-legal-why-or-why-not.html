<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Schools can charge you separately for items that are not<br>specifically related to education time in the classroom (and in some<br>cases, schools charge extra fees for those). These fees have become<br>increasingly popular as school budgets continue to get cut and schools<br>look for ways to recoup the costs of things they have traditionally done<br>with tax dollars: proms, senior week, senior picnics, yearbooks, etc.,<br>but can no longer pay for with tax dollars which must, by law, go to<br>classroom education first. The items paid for with \"senior dues\" are<br>generally ancillary items that are unrelated to actual classroom<br>education.\<br>\<br>While students will never be denied a diploma because they failed to pay<br>senior dues, they may be denied admission to activities funded by senior<br>dues. For example, if senior dues pay for the graduation exercises, the<br>student may not be able to \"walk.\" The student will still receive a<br>diploma, however. Usually, events like senior pictures and the senior<br>prom are conducted in conjunction with outside agencies and companies,<br>so those fees may be collected separately. But schools will generally<br>collect for senior activities in one lump sum to fund them<br>all.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
