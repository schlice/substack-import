<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Considering his most recent statement about the war, Trump would urge<br>Israel to *hurry up and conclude its conflict with Hamas*.<br><br>Trump gave comments to *Israel Hayom* [[in an exclusive<br>interview](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=1ff710&url=https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/03/25/trump-to-israel-hayom-only-a-fool-would-have-not-acted-like-israel-on-oct-7/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="israelhayom.com"}]{.qlink_container} the outlet published<br>yesterday. He first claimed that Biden's presidency contributed to the<br>conflict:<br><br>> He \Biden\ can\'t talk. He\'s a very dumb person. He\'s a dumb<br>> person. His foreign policy throughout 50 years has been horrible. If<br>> you look at people that were in other administrations with him, they<br>> saw him as a weak, ineffective president, they \Hamas\ would have<br>> never done that attack if I were there.<br><br>Trump then noted that the disinformation campaign being waged by Hamas<br>is actually hurting Israel's reputation, and he recommends that they<br>conclude the conflict:<br><br>> You have to finish up your war. To finish it up. You gotta get it<br>> done. And, I am sure you will do that. And we gotta get to peace, we<br>> can\'t have this going on. And I will say, Israel has to be very<br>> careful, because you\'re losing a lot of the world, you\'re losing a<br>> lot of support, you have to finish up, you have to get the job done.<br>> And you have to get on to peace, to get on to a normal life for<br>> Israel, and for everybody else.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
