Repent. What is repentance, anyway? It translates as a *turning<br>    away.* It is a turning which is so complete as to essentially turn<br>    away from your past life and turn towards a new life. Repentance<br>    involves *recognition* *of sin and* *resolution* *to live<br>    without sin.* It is an intention towards action. It is a deliberate<br>    understanding of the underlying sinful condition and a deliberate<br>    turning away from it. Repentance is an action word which demands<br>    action to consciously recognize and turn away from sin and turn<br>    towards God.<br>2.  Believe. Sounds easy, right? Well, in essence, it is. Belief is<br>    actually better stated as "belief that Jesus is your Lord and savior<br>    and died as a penal substitution to pay for your sins." It is an<br>    acknowledgement that your life belongs to Christ, and you want him<br>    to direct your thoughts and deeds.<br><br>That's it. No more, no less. Repent and believe.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>What did Jesus say we must do to live forever in God's eternal kingdom?<br>Is it also how our names get written in the Book of Life?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
