<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [The philosophy of the two organizations are similar, but<br>beyond the general idea that they both are law enforcement, they are<br>very different. While civilian police are accountable to the general<br>public and to the municipality for which they work, military police are<br>not accountable to the general public, nor are they similarly<br>accountable to the military members they protect. They are only<br>accountable to the chain of command in which they are stationed. This is<br>important, as they could be dealing with people who outrank them, and<br>thus need to be outside of that person\'s chain of command in order to<br>be effective at their jobs. Military police do not \"arrest\" military<br>members. They \"detain\" military members and release them to their own<br>chain of command (unit commander or first sergeant) for disciplinary<br>action.\<br>\<br>Military police, as [[Marc<br>Whinery](https://www.quora.com/profile/Marc-Whinery)]{.qlink_container}<br>mentioned, enforce the standards in the Uniform Code of Military Justice<br>(UCMJ), which is the set of laws that the military is subject to, over<br>and above Federal, state, and local laws. Military police can also<br>detain civilians who are violating civilian laws on a military base, but<br>in that instance they would turn them over to civilian law enforcement<br>for processing. Military installations reside in a state, a county, or a<br>city, and have *concurrent jurisdiction* with their local counterparts<br>in civilian law enforcement. This means that while the UCMJ is the law<br>of the land on a military base, Federal, state, and local laws all still<br>apply. The military police cannot enforce civilian laws under the Posse<br>Comitatus Act, but they can detain civilians to be processed by civilian<br>law enforcement.\<br>\<br>On most modern military installations, military police are divided into<br>two sections: Law Enforcement (LE) and Security Police (SP). Law<br>Enforcement does the job typically associated with civilian police:<br>patrol, community relations, and responding to calls for service on the<br>military base. Security Police performs the Force Protection mission of<br>military police: they guard the resources and personnel at that<br>facility. That function may include Alarm Response Teams (ART) for the<br>alarm-protected interiors of the facilities which house sensitive<br>materials and operations, and Security Response Teams (SRT) which<br>respond to radio-dispatched service calls outside of those facilities.<br>Some smaller installations which are mission-only facilities (i.e. no<br>housing, no community center, etc) may only have SP functions, with<br>whatever LE functions are needed covered by SP. Cheyenne Mountain Air<br>Force Base is one of these facilities. There is no separate LE and SP<br>functions, they are SP-only, and whatever calls for service are received<br>are handled by the ART or SRT teams.\<br>\<br>As you can see, as far as function goes, military police have a very<br>different job than civilian police. But as a subset of society, military<br>police deal with far fewer traditional policing incidents than their<br>civilian counterparts.\<br>\<br>So besides having \"police\" in the name, military police and civilian<br>police are apples and oranges as far as mission is<br>concerned.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
