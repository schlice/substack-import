<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If an employee constantly harasses and abuses a disabled coworker and<br>the store fails to take adequate action, can a lawsuit be filed against<br>the store?**<br><br>Any harassment by any employee against any other employee can result in<br>a lawsuit. It's just worse for the perpetrator if the person is disabled<br>as well, because additional charges under separate disability protection<br>laws can also be filed along with the harassment and hostile work<br>environment lawsuits.<br><br>Both the harasser and the employer would be liable.<br><br>However, the person being harassed needs to give the employer the<br>opportunity to fix it. That person needs to go to his/her manager, HR<br>department, etc, and report the harassment, and give the employer the<br>opportunity to correct the situation.<br><br>If they fail to do so, then the lawsuits are the appropriate remedy.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
