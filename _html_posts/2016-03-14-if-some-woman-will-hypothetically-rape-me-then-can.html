<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>An article was posted in USA Today in September of 2014 about this very<br>scenario.<br><br>[[Statutory rape victim forced to pay child<br>support](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=86c6e3&url=http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/09/02/statutory-rape-victim-child-support/14953965/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="usatoday.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>The upshot of the article is a few things:<br><br>1.  Child support is not for the rapist, nor is it punitive damages for<br>    a rape victim. It is intended to ensure a child is cared for.<br>2.  Most states will come after the other parent for child support,<br>    regardless of how the pregnancy happened.<br>3.  The only exceptions to this occur if the petitioning parent is<br>    guilty of sexual assault, or sexual assault with a minor, and not<br>    all states have this exemption.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
