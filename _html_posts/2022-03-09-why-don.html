<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Because they don't want to.<br><br>There is a difference between *proving* a proposition and *accepting* a<br>proposition. I may be able to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that<br>Christianity is true, but only the atheist can choose to accept it.<br><br>If I ever meet an atheist that I could have a reasonable conversation<br>with (and I have yet to do so), I would ask him the following: if I<br>could provide reasonable answers to all of the questions and objections<br>he may have about Christianity, *would he become a Christian?* If the<br>answer is no, then the problem is not one of a lack of facts. The<br>problem is volitional, not intellectual. No amount of evidence would<br>convince such an atheist, because evidence is not what is in the<br>atheist's way. The atheist is in the atheist's way.<br><br>In the end, only the atheist knows if he is truly open to accept the<br>evidence for Christianity.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Why don\'t atheists just start believing in God so they can go to<br>heaven?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
