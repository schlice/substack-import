<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Oh, I\'ve argued for the Army to take over the A-10<br>program for a while. It fits much better as a flying tank; it fits the<br>Army\'s (and as you noted, the Marines\') missions much more closely<br>than the Air Force.\<br>\<br>The problem isn\'t mission fit, however. The problem is \"everything<br>that comes along with flying an airplane.\" It\'s the logistics and the<br>pilots. The Army and the Marines currently only fly limited aircraft,<br>and for the most part, they are rotary-wing. They would have to ramp up<br>an entirely new logistics chain to support an airplane. They would have<br>to retrofit their facilities to include runways capable of handling<br>fixed-wing aircraft (their current runways are only large enough for<br>rotary-wing aircraft). The new logistics channels alone would be an<br>incredible expenditure, not to mention training new pilots for fixed<br>wing flight, basically duplicating what the Air Force already does.\<br>\<br>With unlimited funding, I assume that the Army or the Marines could<br>easily take over the A-10 program. But no one has unlimited<br>funding.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
