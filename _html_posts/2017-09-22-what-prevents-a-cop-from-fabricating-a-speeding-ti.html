<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>> *What prevents a cop from fabricating a speeding ticket?*<br><br>You mean, are there mechanisms in place (besides department policy) that<br>prevent it?<br><br>The short answer is nothing. Nothing prevents a cop from fabricating<br>a speeding ticket.<br><br>But stop and think logically about it for a second, and ask yourself<br>this basic question:<br><br>WHY?<br><br>Why would a cop fabricate a speeding ticket? To what end? Do you *know*<br>the cop? Does he have a personal grudge against you? Besides a personal<br>vendetta against you, what reason would he have to do something like<br>that? I mean, if there was incentive to write you a false ticket, I<br>suppose he might, but these days, what incentive would be there? There<br>are no "ticket quotas," and even if there were, it would likely only be<br>for dedicated traffic cops or for cops on a dedicated traffic duty (like<br>motorcycle cops working a targeted intersection or targeted road), but<br>even those guys don't have "quotas." The cop could literally let you go<br>and within two minutes, find another speeder. Seriously, they are<br>everywhere. There's no need to risk their own career to do something so<br>silly as to falsify a ticket against you, when there are many speeders<br>out there to choose from.<br><br>Cops don't even *like* writing speeding tickets. Why then would they<br>waste the energy not only to pull you over, but then to *make up a<br>story* about pulling you over?<br><br>It simply makes no sense whatsoever.<br><br>FYI: my dashcam records not only the time and date, but it receives<br>actual GPS data and encodes it onto the video; this includes the speed.<br>So if I was really not speeding, I could use that data to assist in<br>fighting the ticket.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
