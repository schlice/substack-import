<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What are some options for firearms storage for several months if I am<br>going to somewhere that doesn\'t allow personal firearms? Family is not<br>a good option because they are all on the other side of the country.**<br><br>There are a few options, and they vary in price.<br><br>Self-storage locations may have small locker-type storage rather than<br>renting a whole room. You must first check in your state to see if<br>leaving firearms in self-storage is legal, but if it is, this is a way<br>to go. It may not be cost-effective, but it will definitely work. Note<br>that you will not be able to store your ammunition, just your firearms.<br>If you do go the self-storage route, you can move your entire gun safe<br>into the storage room if they don't have lockers for you to use.<br><br>A second option is a pawn shop. Pawn shops have bad reputations, but<br>they actually have some valid uses, and storing your firearms is one of<br>them. Here's how you do it: pawn shops will give you a loan against<br>collateral you bring in. So you bring in your gun and get a loan with<br>the gun as collateral. You make payments on the loan, and as long as you<br>continue to make payments, they will hold the gun as collateral on the<br>loan. Once you're back, pay off the loan, and you get your gun back.<br>Similar to self-storage, the pawn shop will likely not store your ammo.<br>Make sure you read the contract carefully; they should not charge you<br>extra storage fees or any other charges. The downside, of course, is<br>that if you miss your payments, the pawn shop can sell your gun to get<br>their money back, but using a pawn shop is a valid method to store your<br>firearms while you're gone.<br><br>Valet storage is relatively new, but it allows you to store boxes<br>instead of renting a room and storing items that way. They give you<br>whatever boxes you need, you pack your stuff, and they take the boxes<br>and store them for you. Check with the valet storage company to see if<br>they will store guns for you and what their requirements are. Valet<br>storage is cheaper than renting a self-storage unit, or even a pawn<br>shop.<br><br>If you're only storing pistols, a bank's safe deposit box is a good,<br>inexpensive way to store firearms. Most bank safe deposit boxes allow<br>you to store guns (and again, not ammunition), and are actually very<br>reasonable to lease. The terms of the lease may not work for you, since<br>they generally are more into long-term storage of items.<br><br>Finally, if none of these options work for you, you can always pop down<br>to your local gun range and ask the staff. If they won't allow you to<br>leave your guns at the range (for a fee), they may know of some local<br>businesses which will store your guns for you. Some enterprising FFLs in<br>the area may offer such a service (I would if I had my FFL). The folks<br>at the range should know who those people are. Heck, I'd do it myself if<br>I could store your guns legally in my state without a background check.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
