<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>First of all, I don't know how much Federal income taxes Amazon pays,<br>and neither do you. And if you are one of the few people who *does*<br>actually know how much Federal income tax Amazon pays, you are likely<br>not authorized to talk about it, and doing so would be a Federal crime.<br><br>So let's assume that you use whatever public data you can get your hands<br>on and you come up with this 1% figure, and let's assume that it is<br>pretty close. Why this happens could be for a number of reasons:<br><br>1.  Amazon could be carrying over net operating losses to the following<br>    tax year. For example, if you lost \$1M in one year but then made<br>    \$1M dollars the next year, you would have a net zero operating<br>    income, and you would pay no taxes.<br>2.  Amazon pays little taxes despite high income due to their use of<br>    *restricted stock.* Amazon pays their employees using *restricted<br>    stock* as part of their total compensation. The tax code allows them<br>    to deduct the value of the restricted stock on the vesting date of<br>    that stock. At the same time, employees have to pay taxes on the<br>    market value of that stock, so the taxes are indeed properly<br>    accounted for for the full value of that stock. So let's assume<br>    Amazon grants \$10 billion of stock in 2020, and it vests in 2023<br>    with a market value of \$30 billion, meaning that the value of the<br>    stock increased about three times its initial value over that<br>    three-year period. Amazon gets a *tax deduction* for \$30 billion in<br>    2023, but only recorded an expense of \$10 billion. As a result, the<br>    value of the expense is understated, and the "book profits" are<br>    overstated, by \$20 billion. Book income is artificially high, so<br>    Amazon looks profitable for financial accounting, because the<br>    financial accounting does not capture the full economic picture. And<br>    the bottom line is that *this is all perfectly legal. C*ompensating<br>    employees is indeed a deductible expense, and just because financial<br>    accounting does not require the full cost of that compensation to be<br>    recognized does not mean companies are doing anything wrong.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
