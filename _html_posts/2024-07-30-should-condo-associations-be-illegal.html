<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>No. Condo associations should not be illegal. People should be free<br>to enter into any business relationship they choose, provided that the<br>business itself is not doing illegal things. Condo associations,<br>however, should be *closely monitored* and *regulated* by the state.<br><br>Condo associations, like Homeowner's Associations, are voluntary<br>associations. No one is forced to join a HOA or a COA. Don't want to<br>join the Condo Association? Don't buy that condo. Simple.<br><br>But Condo Associations, even to a greater degree than HOAs, are<br>*necessary*. Without them, individual condo owners face liability when<br>someone sues. Without them, paying for common amenities becomes<br>problematic. Without the COA, who owns the common areas?<br><br>With the COA, it is the COA which owns the common areas and pays for the<br>maintenance and upkeep. It is the COA which pays for general liability<br>insurance on the same common areas so that condo owners are insulated<br>from those legal actions. It is the COA which handles nuisances which<br>are below the threshold for law enforcement, but above the threshold<br>where it could be easily ignored. It is the COA which enforces the rules<br>which keep the property attractive and livable, which in turn keeps your<br>property values as high as possible.<br><br>You certainly don't need to join that COA. You don't need any of those<br>benefits. You can live without them.<br><br>And if they were universally unliked, builders wouldn't attach them<br>before any of the units are sold. It would be a selling point that there<br>is no COA. I bet some condos in some areas do, in fact, sell without<br>COAs, and they are marketed that way.<br><br>But as Murphy's Law will tell you, it is of course the most desirable<br>units in the most desirable areas of town which will be part of a COA,<br>because the builder wants to keep the complex attractive and highly<br>valued.<br><br>**Regardless, in a free country, you should ALWAYS have the choice as to<br>whether or not you buy into one.**<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
