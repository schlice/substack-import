<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [The Supreme Court ruled that any state bans on gay<br>marriage are unconstitutional in 2015. The Federal Defense of Marriage<br>Act was, for all intents and purposes, thus ruled unconstitutional.\<br>\<br>So perhaps by 2025, any state constitution which still has a \"marriage<br>is between one man and one woman\" wording will finally have it<br>repealed. Not the other way around.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
