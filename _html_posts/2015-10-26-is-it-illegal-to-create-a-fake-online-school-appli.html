<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [This walks a fine line. While it may not be *illegal* so<br>long as you don\'t attempt to actually use the fake account to enroll in<br>classes or to apply for student loans, it will almost definitely violate<br>the terms of service of the website, which almost alway specifies that<br>the information you give must not be fake.\<br>\<br>If you\'re just checking out the site, and you need an account to do<br>that, I would guess that it\'s probably not illegal (i.e. not something<br>you could be arrested for). So long as you don\'t actually use the fake<br>account to do anything with at all, other than look around, you will<br>probably be fine.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
