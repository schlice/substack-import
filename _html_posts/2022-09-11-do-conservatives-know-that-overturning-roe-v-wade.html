<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Nowhere in the Constitution can you find a standard for<br>"born-alive." There is no statement in the Constitution, nor in the<br>Amendments, that establishes such a principle. Yes, it is true that the<br>14th Amendment is intended to grant citizenship to all persons "born" in<br>the United States. But the goal of that Amendment was to grant<br>citizenship to *recently freed slaves*, not to define that you have to<br>be "born" before you become a citizen.<br><br>And actually, case law tends to speak against "born-alive" as a legal<br>standard, since even before *Roe* was overturned, 38 states had **fetal<br>homicide** laws. Laws such as the Fetal Protection Act, the Preborn<br>Victims of Violence Act and the Unborn Victim of Violence Act prove that<br>most of the country agrees that you do not have to be a born citizen in<br>order to receive the rights conferred to all "citizens" under the 14th<br>Amendment.<br><br>Additionally, "citizenship" is not a determining factor when deciding<br>whether or not Constitutional protections are afforded to a person.<br>Indeed, mere presence in the United States affords a person the equal<br>protection of the law.<br><br>Also, it has been the goal of many conservatives to pass a "citizenship<br>amendment" that would make pre-born people "citizens" and declare that<br>they are also covered by all of the Constitution's protections,<br>including the right to not have your life taken without due process of<br>law. If there was some Constitutional standard (either viability or<br>born-alive), no such amendment would be necessary.<br><br>Finally, the *Dobbs* decision **only affected abortions and nothing<br>else.** Gorsuch's concurrence even stated this explicitly, because the<br>dissent was so vehement that other opinions like *Obergefell* were now<br>in the crosshairs (mostly because Clarence Thomas alluded to the fact<br>that other holdings were similar to *Dobbs*). *Dobbs* is about stating<br>that there is no Constitutional right to an abortion, full stop.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Do Conservatives know that overturning Roe v. Wade changed the<br>constitution standard from Viability back to Born-Alive?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
