<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Did she call the police? Have you been arrested? If so, *get a lawyer.*<br><br>Is she just telling anyone and everyone that you raped her? Well, she<br>has a free speech right. You can't really stop her from telling "her<br>side" of the story.<br><br>That is, unless her side of the story begins to cost you monetarily.<br>Once it does, you will have to get a lawyer and sue her for slander and<br>defamation of character. Hopefully it never comes to that.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
