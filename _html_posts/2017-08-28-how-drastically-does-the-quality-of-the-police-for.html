<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>It does differ drastically, but not between states. It differs between<br>*jurisdictions*.<br><br>I can guarantee you that the standards which have been applied to the<br>Backwater, MiddleOfNowhere Sheriff's Office where there is one Sheriff<br>and one deputy for about 500 square miles where 20 people live would<br>pale in comparison to the LAPD or the NYPD or the Chicago or Denver PD.<br><br>In other words, the quality of the police force is directly proportional<br>to the needs of the community it serves.<br><br>I should qualify. Does that mean that the Sheriff of Backwater,<br>MiddleOfNowhere is *unqualified?* Hardly. It simply means that the needs<br>of his jurisdiction are far less than what is needed in Chicago or LA or<br>Manhattan. The quality of his work meets the needs of his jurisdiction.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
