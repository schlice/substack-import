<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>There's so much wrong with this question, I don't even know where to<br>start.<br><br>1.  It's not a "Republican Supreme Court." It's a "traditionalist"<br>    Supreme Court. Traditionalist members of the Court interpret the<br>    Constitution as it is written, based on the understanding when it<br>    was written. Their view is that the Constitution is an unchanging<br>    document, unless you go through the process to change it.<br>2.  They didn't "rule" that Federal authorities can search your house in<br>    the Border Enforcement Zone. Federal agents have always been able to<br>    do that.<br>3.  What they were *actually* looking at in that case was an excessive<br>    force claim, and they found that *Bivens v. Six Unknown Federal<br>    Agents* was wrongly decided, and Border Patrol agents are not<br>    subject to lawsuits for punitive or compensatory damages.<br>4.  Republicans do care about the Constitution, but the Constitution<br>    doesn't say anything about Border Patrol agents or filing lawsuits<br>    against Border Patrol agents. So it's not really relevant.<br><br>Just a terrible question all around.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Since the republican supreme court just ruled that federal authorities<br>can search your house, if you are 100 miles from the border, without<br>warrant, is it safe to say that republicans don\'t actually care about<br>the constitution?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
