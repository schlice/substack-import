<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Why doesn\'t Donald Trump have to show his taxes?<br><br>Let's ask the opposite question of you:<br><br>*Why would Donald Trump have to show his taxes?* Is there a law which<br>would require him to do so? And if your answer includes something along<br>the lines of, "Well, every other politician who runs for office shows<br>their taxes, why can't he?"<br><br>The answer to that is: ***Politicians who release their taxes structure<br>them in such a way as to be presentable to the public.***<br><br>Politicians know that their taxes will eventually see the light of day,<br>despite there being no law which requires their release. However,<br>knowing that their taxes *will* become public, politicians work with tax<br>attorneys and CPAs to structure their finances *so that they look<br>acceptable on a 1040.*<br><br>Trump, being a political outsider, has *years* of taxes which don't look<br>good on a 1040. Nothing illegal (even though that would be within the<br>purview of the IRS to address), but certainly not things that look good.<br>What doesn't look good? Deductions the size of the GDP of many small<br>countries. Taking advantage of tax credits that the candidate may rail<br>against, but were necessary for the proper functioning of his business.<br>Other payments and credits that the candidate may not necessarily be<br>interested in explaining. In short, if one is not a career politician<br>performing this little tax dance for many years, structuring their<br>finances in such a way that their 1040s look squeaky clean, *releasing<br>taxes does not benefit you at all.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
