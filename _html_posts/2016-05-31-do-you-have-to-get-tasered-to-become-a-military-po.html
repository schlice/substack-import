Assuming your do, you<br>have to take the ride to get qualified to carry the TASER.\<br>\<br>Law Enforcement functions in military police units may or may not carry<br>a TASER. Security Police functions (resource and asset protection) will<br>likely not carry TASERs. For them, there is one level of force. You can<br>either follow directions or deadly force is authorized. Don\'t expect to<br>be TASERed if you cross a boundary on a flight line with nuclear<br>armaments and ignore police directives.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
