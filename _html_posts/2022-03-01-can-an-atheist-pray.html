<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Sure, but it doesn't make sense. It makes as much sense for an atheist<br>to pray as it does for me to go to the church of the Flying Spaghetti<br>Monster. I can physically be in the room and do all the things they do,<br>but if I don't believe in it, it doesn't make me a Pastafarian.<br><br>Same holds true for the atheist. Atheists can pray, but if there is no<br>belief behind what they say, they're just speaking words.<br><br>It is the *faith* that gives the prayer its power, not the *words*.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Can an atheist pray?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
