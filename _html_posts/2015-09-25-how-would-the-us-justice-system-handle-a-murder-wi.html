Since it\'s clear<br>that only one person perpetrated the crime, the situation you have<br>described means that it\'s not time to charge either one, because you<br>either have evidence that implicates both of them, or you don\'t have<br>enough evidence to implicate one over the other.\<br>\<br>The police would be remanded to continue gathering<br>evidence.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
