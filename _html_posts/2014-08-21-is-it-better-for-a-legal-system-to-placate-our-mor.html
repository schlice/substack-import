<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Great question, by the way.\<br>\<br>The problem here is in the definition. You use the word *justice*<br>interchangeably with the word *revenge* and that\'s the fundamental<br>problem.\<br>\<br>\"Moral outrage\" does not fuel a need for justice. It fuels a need for<br>*revenge*. Revenge can be a valid outcome of a justice system, but<br>revenge is not the only motivation. Justice can serve several moral<br>imperatives, such as rehabilitation, restitution, and yes, retaliation.<br>All of these, to varying degrees, are appropriate responses for a<br>justice system to produce. The people, to whom the justice system is<br>responsible, want all of these moral imperatives, to one degree or<br>another. No one should be trumped over the others, as all are<br>valid.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
