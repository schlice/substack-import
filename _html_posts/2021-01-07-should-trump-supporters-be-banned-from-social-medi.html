<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Should Trump supporters be banned from social media and financial<br>platforms once Biden is in the Oval Office?**<br><br>Yes!<br><br>Social media companies should ban anyone they choose from their<br>platforms.<br><br>However, they should not then be afforded safe harbor protections under<br>Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. The law allows for online<br>platforms to voluntarily take actions "in good faith" to moderate<br>content.<br><br>**Let's be clear: censoring political views which you don't agree with<br>is not good-faith moderation.**<br><br>To that end, doing so causes you to lose your protection as a neutral<br>platform. By acting unilaterally to curate content, you become a<br>*content publisher*, and not just an open online platform. This means<br>you lose immunity from liability for what your users post.<br><br>And you can be sued for it. If Yelp or TripAdvisor ban Trump supporters<br>and lose Section 230 protection, they could be sued for the content of<br>users who post bad reviews about restaurants or hotels. If Facebook or<br>Twitter ban Trump supporters and subsequently lose protections under<br>Section 230, they could be sued for libel for allowing content which<br>causes harm to anyone.<br><br>It would be the death of those platforms. But maybe, if public opinion<br>supports this sort of banning, maybe it's time for them to die. Maybe<br>they should die in favor of something else.<br><br>So by all means, determine which people are "suitable" to post on your<br>platform.<br><br>But be prepared for the consequences.<br><br>\<br><br>*For the time being, I have re-enabled comments on selected answers.<br>Some people like to comment. Some people like to engage with me in a<br>civil manner, and I did kinda miss that\...a little. But do not<br>misunderstand, I take this step very cautiously, and I have no tolerance<br>for harassing or inane behavior. If you don\'t like what I wrote, tough<br>shit. If my answer is grammatically low-quality or is un-cited opinion<br>masquerading as fact, downvote it. If you think I\'m wrong, write your<br>own answer. But Quora is a question-and-answer site, not a debate site.<br>If you are simply commenting to tell me \"ackshually, you\'re wrong,\"<br>don\'t be surprised if I quietly delete your comment. Put anything<br>vaguely harassing in there, and your deletion will be followed by a<br>block/mute, and a BNBR report. I will do this immediately and with no<br>compunction. You have been warned. Be nice.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
