It does not have to be<br>limited in time though; a pardon can be for any "past" or "future"<br>conviction for that specific crime.<br><br>Other crimes, including the same crime at the state level, can still be<br>charged.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
