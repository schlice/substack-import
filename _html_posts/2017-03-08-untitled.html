<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>In government employment, it operates very much like union workers do,<br>but without the actual union. They cannot work overtime if there is no<br>overtime funding available. They must be approved for overtime, and if<br>overtime is not approved, they leave when the clock says to leave.<br><br>It also takes an Act of God and Congress to fire someone from a<br>government job. Unless you've killed your co-workers in the office, it<br>is a cumbersome process to remove a government employee from his or her<br>job. You must show a consistent pattern of failure to achieve results<br>(over a number of performance reports over a number of years) before you<br>can be fired, and usually you are just relocated to another department<br>because it is easier.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/I'm-quitting-my-job-after-working-there-for-only-a-week-and-I-would-like-to-request-that-they-don't-pay-me-provide-any-benefits-I-want-it-to-be-clear-that-I'm-quitting-for-non-monetary-reasons-Can-they-withhold-payments-if-I-request-it-in-writing/answer/Dan-B-1472<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
