<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: [I\'ll add my \$.02 at this point.\<br>\<br>I am not an FBI agent, and I have never applied to the Bureau. However,<br>I do hold a Top Secret clearance with the DoD, and have held it for over<br>20 years. I know what thorough background investigations look like.\<br>\<br>I will tell you that the FBI, along with every government agency out<br>there, realizes that people are people. They know that people make<br>mistakes. It\'s part of life. But expect them to find out.\<br>\<br>So the advice: be up front with the investigators. About everything.<br>Because they will find out. They will interview everyone and anyone with<br>whom you have had significant contact over the previous 15 years.\<br>\<br>Also, it\'s actually good to not appear squeaky clean. It\'s rare for<br>anyone to never have made a mistake in their life. Tell them about your<br>errors, because it\'s okay to have made them.\<br>\<br>Understand though that if you have made many, significant mistakes, they<br>will use those to judge your character. There is a fine line between a<br>mistake and a lifestyle.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/How-should-I-prepare-as-a-teenager-to-give-myself-a-better-chance-of-becoming-an-FBI-agent/answer/Tim-Dees<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
