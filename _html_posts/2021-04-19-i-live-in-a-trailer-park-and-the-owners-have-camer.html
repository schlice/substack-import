<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The answer, as is the answer to all legal questions, is "it depends."<br>And what it depends on is *state law*.<br><br>In many states, you can record video in private places with consent. In<br>some states, you can consent to recording by passing a prominent sign<br>which states that recording devices are in use and proceeding further<br>constitutes consent to such recording.<br><br>However, in virtually all states, in public spaces (or more precisely,<br>privately-owned property which is open to the public), you can be video<br>recorded and no signage is needed.<br><br>In the vast majority of cases, the law turns on what is a ***reasonable<br>expectation of privacy***. If you are in, say, a locker room, you<br>probably have a reasonable expectation of privacy. However, if you were<br>on a private street between rows of trailer homes, you probably would<br>*not* have a reasonable expectation of privacy.<br><br>One private location where security camera monitoring may be in effect<br>is in fitting rooms in department stores. But these locations would have<br>very clearly marked signage indicating that video surveillance is in<br>use, and in order to enter the facility, you would see the signs. This<br>video helps to deter shoplifting.<br><br>In all cases, if you are going to install cameras, to best avoid legal<br>trouble, you should have the cameras in plain sight, and post a notice<br>that video surveillance is in use. But the notice is not required in<br>most states when the cameras are in plain sight and are in a public<br>location.<br><br>If the camera records *audio* along with the video, other rules about<br>the usability of that audio in court exist.<br><br>\<br><br>Original Question:<br><br>"I live in a trailer park and the owners have cameras up for security<br>reasons. Do there have to be signs indicating there are cameras in use?"<br><br>\<br><br>*This answer is not professional legal advice, nor is it a substitute<br>for professional legal advice, or a solicitation to offer professional<br>legal advice. This answer is for GENERAL INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. If<br>you ignore this warning and convey confidential information in a private<br>message or comment, there is no duty to keep that information<br>confidential or to forego representation adverse to your interests. Seek<br>the advice of a licensed attorney in the appropriate jurisdiction before<br>taking any action that may affect your rights. If you believe you have a<br>claim against someone, consult an attorney immediately, otherwise there<br>is a risk that the time allotted to bring your claim may expire.*<br><br>*Quora users who provide responses to legal questions are intended third<br>party beneficiaries under Quora\'s* [[*Terms of<br>Service*](https://www.quora.com/about/tos)]{.qlink_container}*.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
