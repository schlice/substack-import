<br/><br/>Answer Comment<br/><br/><br/>Content: [Yes, it is not as easy for a gay couple to bind their<br/>lives the same way that married couples do, but I think you are slightly<br/>overstating the consequences for the gay couple. You need a healthcare<br/>durable power of attorney at the hospital (one or two pages). You need<br/>to have survivorship documents when buying a house or getting a mortgage<br/>(no more than 5 pages). And these documents can be maintained online,<br/>already signed and authenticated, and delivered to anyone with an email<br/>address within seconds, using a smartphone.\<br/>\<br/>Since marriage in the state sense (not the religious sense at all) is<br/>only about creating generativity for children, gay couples who desire<br/>the right to marry simply to make paperwork easier are fooling<br/>themselves. First, in order to enter into an institution that makes no<br/>sense for them is to lie about why marriage exists in the first place.<br/>Second, because heterosexual marriage often fails is not a reason to<br/>further erode the institution. And why would a gay couple want to pay<br/>extra taxes and make dissolution of their union a lengthy and costly<br/>proposition? I really think you overstate the \"benefits\" of marriage.\<br/>\<br/>What gays do benefit from is the psychological and psychic ratification<br/>by the government that a gay relationship is on par with a heterosexual<br/>relationship. This perceived psychic benefit comes at great cost to the<br/>whole of society.]<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Answer:<br/>https://www.quora.com/Why-are-gay-people-asking-for-the-right-to-marry-If-it-is-legal-stuff-they-are-asking-for-cant-they-go-to-some-separate-setup-for-partners/answer/Corregan-Brown<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content language: English<br/><br/><br/>
