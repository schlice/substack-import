<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [In the United States, there is no blanket ban on mobile<br>phones in schools and/or colleges. Mobile phones are generally allowed<br>in the buildings, but in grade schools, they are either not allowed or<br>required to be on mute or vibrate, in the classroom. This is up to the<br>policy of the individual school or district. This is for several<br>reasons:\<br>\<br>]<br><br>1.  They are distracting, and it is impolite to interrupt a lecture with<br>    your phone\'s noises<br>2.  Children at that age are easily distracted, and the teacher would<br>    really like to teach the curriculum with the students\' full<br>    attentions, or as best as they can get it.<br><br>\<br>College is similar, except that in most cases, phones must be on<br>vibrate. Students in college are expected to be more mature, and whether<br>or not they pay attention to the curriculum is their decision.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
