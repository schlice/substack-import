<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Filing a police report doesn\'t really mean anything other<br>than that someone made an official on-the-record statement to police.\<br>\<br>Whether or not the police (and the DA) decide to pursue *criminal<br>charges* against that person is completely up to them.\<br>\<br>The statute of limitations is a time frame that is set on the police and<br>the prosecutor to bring charges against an individual. Statutes of<br>limitations are useful, as memories fade over time, and it simply isn\'t<br>fair or just to attempt to raise criminal charges against someone after<br>so much time has passed and recollections fade. The statute of<br>limitations starts the day of the alleged act, and expires X amount of<br>time from that date.\<br>\<br>In general, for criminal charges, if the person flees the state, the<br>statute of limitations is tolled (the clock is stopped) for that charge.<br>The person does not have to be aware of the charge in order for the<br>charge to be tolled. In general, a statute of limitations can be tolled<br>if:\<br>]<br><br>- Plaintiff is a minor.<br>- Plaintiff has been deemed insane.<br>- Plaintiff has been convicted of a felony and is imprisoned; a major<br>  component of the AEDPA.<br>- Defendant is in bankruptcy.<br>- Defendant is not physically present in a state.<br>- Filing of an action which is later voluntarily dismissed.<br>- Parties were engaged in good-faith negotiations to resolve the<br>  dispute.<br><br>(list courtesy<br>[Wikipedia(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=85233b&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tolling_%2528law%2529){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container})\<br>\<br>There is another statute that provides limitations on filing suit,<br>called the *statute of repose*. Certain lawsuit categories have a<br>statute of repose which bars the bringing of charges in certain<br>circumstances. For example, in product liability law, a particular<br>product may have a 10 year statute of repose (from the date of<br>manufacture), so a claim cannot be brought against the manufacturer<br>after 10 years since the date of manufacture, even if the statute of<br>limitations (from the date of the injury) has not expired.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
