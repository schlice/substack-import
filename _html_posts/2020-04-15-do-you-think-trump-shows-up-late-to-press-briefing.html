<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Do you think Trump shows up late to press briefings to demonstrate his<br>power?**<br><br>No.<br><br>Trump shows up late to press briefings because his last meeting ran<br>long.<br><br>And if you think that there's enough flexibility in the President's<br>schedule that he can delay going into a briefing to "demonstrate his<br>power," you've never seen the true operations of the White House in<br>action.<br><br>He doesn't have gobs of time just waiting for him. He doesn't sit around<br>with nothing to do in between meetings.<br><br>His calendar is full, from start to finish. And he frequently works<br>in his off-time. He has to build off-time into his schedule. By the way,<br>when you have to build free time into your daily schedule, you know you<br>have a busy job.<br><br>Every minute of the day is meticulously scheduled. There is no time<br>available to casually show up late just to prove you're the man in<br>charge. I think he's already pretty effectively done that.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
