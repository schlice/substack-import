<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**I had a wonderful dog in the past, perhaps the best dog. What if I get<br>a new dog and I\'m always comparing her to the old dog?**<br><br>I had a dog in the past. She was the best dog. She still is, even though<br>she's been dead a few years now.<br><br>I got a new dog (by the way, it took me a good four years to get over<br>the first dog because she was, as previously noted, the best dog).<br><br>I do compare my new dog to my old dog, but not in the way you think.<br><br>I say, "Wow, look at what she's doing! Jessie never did that. I really<br>wish Jessie would have done that."<br><br>Or I say, "Grr, that really annoys me when she does that. Jessie never<br>acted like that. I'll have to work on that."<br><br>Both of my dogs were/are Golden Retrievers. Jessie would never actually<br>"retrieve" anything. Her whole life, she never brought anything back.<br>Sadie (my current pup) will retrieve until she passes out. I got one of<br>those ball throwing handles because literally my arm gets tired before<br>she stops bringing the ball back.<br><br>So yeah, that's how you compare the two. You will never stop loving your<br>first dog. You will also love your new dog. Comparing them doesn't mean,<br>"Boy, I wish you were as good as *\<dog_1\>.*" It also doesn't mean<br>you'll love your new dog conditionally, as in "I'll only love you if you<br>are exactly like *\<dog_1\>*." It just means that there will be<br>similarities and differences between the two, and you'll notice them.<br>But that's it. You'll be able to separate the two.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
