Last month, Vice Adm. Andrew Lewis, commander of<br>> the U.S. Second Fleet, told reporters that the Navy is \"probably<br>> going to make it mandatory as soon as we can, just like we do with the<br>> flu vaccine.\"<br>><br>> And the Navy has given ships the OK to relax strict coronavirus rules<br>> if all crew members get vaccinated, including eliminating weeks of<br>> pre-deployment quarantining, enforced social distancing, and<br>> restrictions on port calls and other breaks.<br>><br>> Nearly one-third of troops have turned down the vaccine, Pentagon<br>> officials told lawmakers last month\[1\](#xVglC){#cite-xVglC<br>> .citation_link}<br><br>**TL;DR: While a servicemember can't refuse a vaccine that DoD mandates,<br>DoD cannot mandate a vaccine which is not fully approved by the FDA.<br>COVID-19 vaccines are approved only by Emergency Use Authorization, so<br>under Federal law, they can only be given voluntarily.**<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-xVglC){.citation_index} [[Military May Revisit Making<br>COVID-19 Vaccines Mandatory After FDA Grants<br>Approval](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=50b396&url=https://www.military.com/daily-news/2021/03/01/military-may-revisit-making-covid-19-vaccines-mandatory-after-fda-grants-approval.html){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="military.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
