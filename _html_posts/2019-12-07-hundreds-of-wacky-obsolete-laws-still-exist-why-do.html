<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Hundreds of wacky, obsolete laws still exist. Why don't more states<br>remove them?**<br><br>We are all aware that obsolete laws are never enforced, thanks to the<br>police's ability to selectively enforce laws. and the district<br>attorney's ability to selectively prosecute laws, so long as it is done<br>in a uniform, 14th Amendment-approved manner (i.e. *not* enforcing that<br>law on anyone).<br><br>So why don't we remove these never-enforced, obsolete laws from the law<br>books? There are several reasons.<br><br>1.  There is an administrative cost to removing a law. Law books must be<br>    reprinted. People who require law books (lawyers, police, etc) must<br>    buy new copies of those law books. The law book publishers (i.e.<br>    LexisNexis and others) are quite happy when you remove a law,<br>    because they get to print an addendum and then a new full version of<br>    their law books, but no one else is particularly happy when they<br>    have to shell out bucks to buy an updated copy of the law books.<br>2.  Additionally, there is even further administrative cost to removing<br>    a law. Many states require a vote to remove a law from the state<br>    Constitution, which means all of the administrative cost to add the<br>    question to the ballot, following all of the legal requirements to<br>    do so (which requires lawyers, who will bill their time, of course),<br>    mailing out ballots, tallying ballots, etc.<br>3.  Valuable historical context may be lost. Just because a law doesn't<br>    apply now doesn't mean that this law didn't apply at some point in<br>    our history. Seeing the original law in its original context helps<br>    us shape new laws.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
