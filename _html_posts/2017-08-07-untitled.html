<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Ah, I get what you're saying now. Sorry it took me so long to get it. I<br>have a headache; I guess I'm not thinking as quickly right now.<br><br>Your numbers are close to accurate, *IF* you consider that all of<br>those people you excluded are not actually out in society at large. So<br>if all the people below age 21 and over age 85 stayed home, then yes,<br>that means that the saturation of people who can legally carry would go<br>up because fewer people who objectively would not carry are not present<br>with you at the supermarket or the mall or wherever you may be.<br><br>But they are there.<br><br>That doesn't change your line of reasoning. That simply means that there<br>are an objectively larger or smaller percentage of people who *may* be<br>carrying around you at any one time. For example, if you're in a mall,<br>there would likely be a larger percentage of people under age 21, so the<br>likelihood of encountering a legal concealed carrier is lower. But if<br>you are at a hardware store, you're in the exact target demographic:<br>majority males between age 21 and 85.<br><br>So I get what you're saying, but your numbers only make sense if you<br>*exclude* those who are unlikely to be carrying from participation in<br>society. But since they still do actively participate, their numbers<br>still figure in to the X people in 100 who might be carrying.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/How-many-Americans-own-a-gun-How-often-do-they-carry-them/answer/Bill-Stein<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
