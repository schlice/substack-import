<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The United States was never a democracy.<br><br>It was never designed to be, either. Democracies do not work, because it<br>makes it too easy for a candidate to game the system.<br><br>We have *representative government* and a *federation of independent<br>states.* We are not one big United State of Amerika. We are 50<br>independent states in one federation.<br><br>If it was, the candidates who appeal to the largest populations of<br>people would win. For example, a candidate could win just the big cities<br>(ahem, Hillary), ignore *large* swaths of the country, and still win<br>the election. This is far from "fair." Plus, *every single vote matters<br>a great deal,* so voter fraud becomes far more important an issue to<br>deal with.<br><br>The Electoral College solves both of those problems. It requires<br>candidates to appeal to a much larger cross-section of the country. And<br>it makes voter fraud, while an important issue, something that less<br>appreciably changes the outcome of the election.<br><br>Finally (and if there is any reasoning for the EC that we can throw<br>out), the Founders were very worried about a central government<br>abrogating too much power onto itself. It was worried about the original<br>plan of Congress electing the President and installing a puppet leader,<br>and Congress having all the power. Clearly, over the decades, the<br>President has been granted far more power than originally designed, so<br>this is less of a concern. The founders solved this by making the<br>following statement:<br><br>- The people elect Congress, but<br>- The states elect the President.<br><br>This makes the states relevant in playing a role in government, since<br>the state (as a whole) elects the President, but the people directly<br>elect their Congressmen. Originally, there was no direct election of the<br>Senate, but that changed as well. That's why the Senate served longer.<br><br>Nevertheless, the Electoral College eliminates the bias that big cities<br>have over less densely populated areas. Without the EC, politicians<br>would completely ignore small states and areas with small populations.<br>They would fight over the big cities and the population centers in the<br>country, and that's far from fair.<br><br>No one wants a true democracy when only 2/3 of eligible voters actually<br>participate.<br><br>Please take literally five minutes out of your life and watch this<br>video:<br><br>[https://youtu.be/V6s7jB6-GoU?lis\...(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=51e660&url=https://youtu.be/V6s7jB6-GoU?list%3DPLIBtb_NuIJ1zs1gI2nYdZk6wL606nGOQ9){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="youtu.be"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>You might learn something about the United States (plural) of America.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/Why-cant-protesters-just-accept-that-Hillary-lost-and-Donald-Trump-was-elected-fairly/answer/Chris-Donnelly<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
