<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: [*There is no cure i.e. for everyone*\<br>There is no cure, period. As I have mentioned many times on many<br>different forums (including this one), if you were diagnosed with MS and<br>you did XYZ and it \"cured\" your MS, you didn\'t have MS. I challenge<br>you to show me any peer-reviewed medical proof that shows that anything<br>other than what I just stated is actually true.\<br>\<br>That\'s not a controversial statement. It\'s medical fact. Until someone<br>proves otherwise, it is the current medical understanding of MS. The<br>disease is incurable today.\<br>\<br>That said, you can do a lot to slow the progression of the disease and<br>get your body to a point where you hardly notice your MS at all. I\'m<br>coping wonderfully. I hardly notice my MS. That doesn\'t mean I\'m<br>\"cured.\" It\'s not even a \"functional cure\" like you can get with<br>HIV or some other diseases. It\'s simply remission to the point of<br>indistinguishability from normalcy.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/I-am-an-18-year-old-male-and-have-been-diagnosed-with-multiple-sclerosis-How-can-I-live-happily-and-positively-knowing-that-there-is-no-cure-and-the-problems-Im-going-to-face-in-the-future/answer/Bill-Stein<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
