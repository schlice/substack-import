<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Yes, even God cannot do certain things.<br><br>An omnipotent God cannot deny His own nature.<br><br>> if we are faithless,\<br>> he remains faithful,\<br>> for he cannot disown himself. --- 2 Timothy 2:13 NIV<br><br>God cannot deny Himself. If He were to break His promise to those who<br>have believed in Him, that would be a denial of Himself and His<br>righteous character. To those who fear that God is standing over them<br>waiting to cast them out if they deny Him or if they fail to have enough<br>belief or if they are unfaithful in their ministries, Paul says that God<br>always remains faithful. His faithfulness is a matter of His own<br>character.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
