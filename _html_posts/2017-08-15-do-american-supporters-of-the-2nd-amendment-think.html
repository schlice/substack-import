<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Absolutely not. The American flag he has on his chest is backwards.<br><br>Since the link is wonky, let me post a link to the image and the image<br>itself:<br><br>[https://metrouk2.files.wordpress\...(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=11d8a7&url=https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/pri_49385930.jpg?w%3D964%26h%3D667%26crop%3D1%26amp%3Bimgrefurl%3Dhttp://metro.co.uk/2017/08/13/white-supremacist-militia-seen-patrolling-charlottesville-rally-with-assault-rifles-6849661/%26amp%3Bdocid%3DX14KZm6kop-YAM%26amp%3Btbnid%3DLm0uK0uCFEJehM:%26amp%3Bw%3D964%26amp%3Bh%3D667%26amp%3Bsource%3Dsh/x/im){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wordpress.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-12625e42078351666002f8488d93ad22){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-12625e42078351666002f8488d93ad22" master_w="964"<br>master_h="667"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>It's kinda hard to see behind the scope, but the American flag patch he<br>has on his chest should have the field of stars on the left. You can see<br>the flag printed on his T-shirt on his right arm; that flag is in the<br>correct orientation.<br><br>Oh, you meant the whole "carrying a rifle" thing? Well, he does have the<br>dust cover on the ejection port open, but that just means he's going to<br>go home with a dirty bolt, but that's not my problem.<br><br>So no, I don't see anything wrong with what he's doing. He doesn't<br>appear to be threatening anyone. He doesn't appear to be doing anything<br>illegal.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
