<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>[[Joshua<br>Alexander](https://www.quora.com/profile/Joshua-Alexander-356)]{.qlink_container}<br>did a great job explaining the enlisted side. I'll explain the officer<br>side.<br><br>Enlisteds enlist for a set period of time. At the conclusion of each<br>enlistment, hey can "re-enlist" for more set periods of time. There's no<br>formal re-enlistment ceremony, but enlisteds need an officer to sign the<br>form that approves their decision to re-enlist. Many of my troops would<br>do a small ceremony with me, which I gladly did for them. We'd find an<br>American flag and stand in front of it, and we used a form of the<br>commissioning oath which officers take when they accept their<br>commission. It's actually an old enlisted swearing-in ceremony, which is<br>mostly unused today, but we did it when they wanted to do a ceremony for<br>re-enlistment:<br><br>*I, \<state your name\>, do solemnly swear that I will support and<br>defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies,<br>foreign or domestic, that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the<br>same, that I will obey the orders of the President of the United States,<br>and the orders of those appointed over me, according to regulation and<br>the Uniform Code of Military Justice, so help me God.*<br><br>Then I'd sign the form and the enlisted member would be good for another<br>few years.<br><br>Officers, on the other hand, are "commissioned" and that commission is<br>not bound by time. Your single commission as a military officer will<br>last you your entire service.<br><br>Most officers will have anywhere from a three to five year ADSC upon<br>commissioning. As [[Tim<br>Dees](https://www.quora.com/profile/Tim-Dees)]{.qlink_container}<br>mentioned, Academy graduates have a five year ADSC following graduation.<br>USAFA grads who were not pilots also had 5 year ADSCs. "Five and dive"<br>was the colloquialism for non-pilots. They are not required to leave,<br>but once your Active Duty Service Commitment is fulfilled, you can leave<br>at any time. That said, if there was some schooling you took to get into<br>the military which was partially paid for by the government, or if you<br>earn a degree using government tuition assistance, you repay this money<br>using time in service. This will be tacked on to your "Active Duty<br>Service Commitment" or the amount of time you are required to remain on<br>active duty. When I got my master's degree, I had two years added to my<br>ADSC. Thankfully, that commitment ran *concurrently* with any other<br>commitments I had, and I still had a 5 year commitment from the Academy.<br>Pilots, on the other hand, have a much higher ADSC than non-pilots. When<br>I was active, a pilot picked up a nine year ADSC following the<br>completion of Undergraduate Pilot Training (UPT), and generally seven of<br>those years were required to be "in the cockpit," flying jobs. I don't<br>know if this is still the case today.<br><br>The most common time for an officer to leave the military is when an<br>assignment is received. When an officer is assigned to a new duty<br>station, he has seven days to accept the assignment. If he has no ADSC,<br>he can turn down the assignment and begin out-processing instead. This<br>is called the "7-day option" or "7 day opt" for short. So if you hear<br>that a military officer did a 7-day opt, that's what it means.<br>Sometimes, they change that phrase to "7-day out", but you know now that<br>it's really 7-day opt. This is how I left Active Duty, but instead of<br>out-processing from the military, I simply transferred my commission<br>into the Air Force Reserve, and out-processed from my then-current duty<br>station. It was an easy process, and it is entirely permissible to<br>transfer an Active Duty commission into the Reserve component once the<br>ADSC is fulfilled. It helped that I already had a job offer from a<br>civilian company at the time.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
