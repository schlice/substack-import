<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**How do I check if someone has had charges against him or if he is a<br>pedophile?**<br><br>This is two separate questions.<br><br>It's not necessarily easy to see if any particular person has ever had<br>criminal charges filed against them. It's much easier to see if someone<br>has been *convicted* of a crime. Once you've been convicted in<br>court, it becomes public record. You can simply call the court which<br>services the case, and you can find out. There are many public databases<br>which also contain conviction records. Go ahead and search Google, I<br>dare you.<br><br>But records of other things, such as dismissed/acquitted charges or<br>pending charges are not universal from state to state. You may not be<br>able to reliably find that information.<br><br>On the other hand, finding out if someone is a convicted pedophile is<br>much easier. Anyone convicted as a sex offender must register on the<br>[[sex offender<br>registry](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=055c09&url=https://www.nsopw.gov/?AspxAutoDetectCookieSupport%3D1){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="nsopw.gov"}]{.qlink_container} and can very easily be<br>searched.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
