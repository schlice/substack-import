<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The answer is simple, but the details are where everyone gets lost.<br><br>When we boil down the pro-life and the pro-choice movements, they have<br>one very specific issue at their core:<br><br>- The pro-life movement believes that all human life has equal value,<br>  regardless of its age or location.<br>- The pro-choice movement places differential value on human life based<br>  on its age or location.<br><br>That's it. That's the core of both positions.<br><br>So understanding the core issue, let's apply it to your statement that<br>"sperm or egg alone is a potential life, or is life". There is a<br>scientific definition of life, and there is also a scientific definition<br>of what constitutes "human life."<br><br>Sure, a sperm and an egg constitute "potential human life," but does it<br>deserve the same level of protection of its existence as a living human<br>being?<br><br>The answer is no. Since sperm by itself does not qualify as a living<br>human being, and eggs by themselves do not qualify as a living human<br>being, they are not afforded the same right to life as a living human<br>being.<br><br>So when is something classified as a living human being? When it is<br>alive and human. We know that the zygote is human because it has two<br>human parents and it is a unique living organism, replicating and<br>producing human proteins. We know it is alive because it is growing and<br>consuming energy.<br><br>So, just to clarify:<br><br>- Sperm: Not Human.<br>- Egg: Not Human<br>- Zygote/Embryo/Fetus/Baby: Human and alive.<br><br>\<br><br>***NOTE: I am willing to engage in polite discussion, but if you go<br>crazy and start screaming about how I just want to control women and<br>turn them into baby factories or whatever, I'll politely delete your<br>comments and probably block you, depending on how I feel at the<br>moment.***<br><br>In other words, discussion is welcome. *Ad hominem* **attacks<br>are not.**<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
