<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [First of all, it sounds like you have a specific legal<br>question. In such a case, you need to consult an attorney. We can\'t<br>give you specific legal advice in relation to your case.\<br>\<br>We can provide general answers surrounding corporate responsibilities<br>and workplace law. Here are a few items for you to consider:\<br>]<br><br>- In general, employers and employees have an *employment at-will*<br>  arrangement. That means in general, with certain restrictions,<br>  employees and/or companies can terminate the employment arrangement at<br>  any time, for any reason.<br><br><!-- --><br><br>- I can only presume that the company did not let him go because he<br>  \"wasn\'t of sound mind.\" I presume they let him go because his<br>  mental illness created a condition where he wasn\'t able to produce<br>  quality work. He was let go because his work wasn\'t up to par, not<br>  because he had a mental disease or defect.\<br>- Companies are not responsible for the medical care of their employees,<br>  even if they are aware of a particular medical condition. This does<br>  not mean that companies are not responsible for ensuring a healthy and<br>  safe workplace; they are. They are not, however, responsible to ensure<br>  that their employees seek medical care when they need it if an injury,<br>  disease, or condition was caused by something outside the workplace.<br>  They can provide medical insurance as a condition of employment, but<br>  medical issues are covered by doctor-patient privilege, and the<br>  company is not privvy to them just because they foot a portion of the<br>  medical insurance bill.<br><br>If you feel you may have a case for a wrongful death suit, consult with<br>a practicing attorney in your area. However, it sounds like they were<br>offering him an opportunity to get help by requesting that he take time<br>using FMLA to get medical assistance, like perhaps counseling for<br>alcohol addiction, or inpatient rehab. We don\'t know, and only you and<br>your attorney can find out.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
