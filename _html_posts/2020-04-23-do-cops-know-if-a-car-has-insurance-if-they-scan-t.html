<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Can a cop tell if you have insurance by running your plate?<br><br>Yes and no.<br><br>In order to register your car in the first place, in most states you are<br>required to have a minimum amount of insurance. Police can see that your<br>car is registered, so therefore at the time of registration, you had<br>insurance.<br><br>However, it is a manual process for insurance companies to notify states<br>about your policy, and whether or not states accurately track that<br>status is up to the state. In most cases, the police do not see<br>*up-to-date* or *ongoing* insurance status, or that you have maintained<br>the *state-mandated level* of insurance. In order to receive a state<br>insurance card, you have to purchase the state-mandated level of<br>insurance. Your insurance company provides you with a state-standardized<br>insurance card, valid for a certain 6-month period, which shows that you<br>are carrying the state-mandated minimum level of insurance.<br><br>The police cannot see that from your registration. That information<br>is not maintained as part of your state driving record.<br><br>This is why you are required to carry that state-mandated insurance card<br>in your car (in states which require insurance) and it has to be valid.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
