<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Gait problems are one of the most common movement symptoms of MS.<br>Walking trouble can be caused by a number of factors:<br><br>- Weakness. Muscle weakness occurs either through disuse, or nerve<br>  damage. Weakness in the leg muscles can lead to changes in normal<br>  walking stride, which can lead to pain, making walking even more<br>  challenging.<br>- Spasticity. Muscle tightness or twitching can affect walking.<br>- Balance. Balance problems typically produce a swaying, "drunk-like"<br>  walking pattern called *ataxia*.<br>- Sensory problems. Some people with MS have trouble feeling their feet<br>  on the floor, leading to challenges walking. This is also known as<br>  *sensory ataxia*.<br>- Fatigue. Fatigue, or *MS Lassitude*, can induce walking problems when<br>  it happens.<br><br>MS walking difficulties are usually most effectively treated through<br>physical therapy. You can also use appropriate assistive devices, and<br>there are some medications which can be used to treat either the<br>underlying symptoms above, or one specific medication (Ampyra) which can<br>treat walking speed. Ampyra, by the way, is the first medication<br>developed specifically to treat a symptom of MS.<br><br>If you are having difficulty walking due to MS, please talk to your<br>neurologist or your primary care doctor. They can help you develop a<br>strategy to improve your walking and to minimize the effects of the<br>symptoms.<br><br>\<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*This answer is not professional medical advice, nor is it a substitute<br>for professional medical advice.
