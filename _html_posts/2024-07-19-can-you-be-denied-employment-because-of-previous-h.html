<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Technically, you can't be denied because you have a previous health<br>condition. Technically, you would be denied because you have a health<br>condition which prevents you from performing the essential functions of<br>the job.<br><br>What employers are allowed to do is list the essential functions of the<br>job, and then send you (at their expense) to a doctor to evaluate you.<br>If the doctor finds that you have a condition which would prevent you<br>from performing the essential functions of the job, they can pass on<br>hiring you.<br><br>> Asking employees about their pre-existing medical conditions may not<br>> only be a good idea, but legally required for certain high-risk roles.<br>><br>> Employers have strict duties under work health safety legislation to<br>> ensure health and safety, so far as is reasonably practicable, by<br>> eliminating risks to health and safety.<br>><br>> For example, if employees will be engaged in manual labour, it is<br>> reasonably practicable to ask them to disclose any previous or<br>> pre-existing musculoskeletal injuries because they may be aggravated<br>> by the work.<br>><br>> The same goes for occupational specific diseases, such as asking mine<br>> workers to disclose any mine dust lung diseases.<br>><br>> In these sorts of high risk roles the employee should be asked to<br>> disclose any pre-existing medical conditions or injuries and undergo a<br>> pre-employment medical test.\[1\](#PQvnU){#cite-PQvnU<br>> .citation_link}<br><br>That said, the ADA makes it illegal to simply deny employment because of<br>a pre-existing condition. For example, you could rightly deny employment<br>as a mine worker if you have mine dust lung diseases. But you probably<br>could not deny employment as a file clerk with the same disease.<br><br>So in general, you cannot be denied employment because of a pre-existing<br>condition, unless the job requirements state that your ability to be<br>able to perform a task cannot be limited by a pre-existing condition.<br><br>\<br><br>If you are ever denied a position simply because you have a pre-existing<br>condition, and that condition does not impede your ability to perform<br>the essential functions of the job, you will need to seek out an<br>employment attorney in your area who can help you.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-PQvnU){.citation_index} [[Can you ask employees about<br>pre-existing medical<br>conditions?](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=8e81a4&url=https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/can-you-ask-employees-pre-existing-medical-conditions/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="linkedin.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
