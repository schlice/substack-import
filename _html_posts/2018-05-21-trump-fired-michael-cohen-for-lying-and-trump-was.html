<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Trump fired Michael Cohen for lying, and Trump was Michael Flynn\'s<br>boss. So, why can't the American people fire Trump for lying to us as<br>well? After all, aren\'t the American people the \"boss\" of the<br>president?**<br><br>Trump can hire and fire personnel for the Executive Branch as he is the<br>head of that branch. However, to continue the analogy, the American<br>people are not "in charge" of the Office of the President. The President<br>is accountable to the people he serves, but we don't run his office.<br><br>The American people can fire Trump by not voting for him again. It's<br>built in to the Constitution. Congress can fire Trump by impeaching him<br>for "high crimes and misdemeanors." It's also built in to the<br>Constitution.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
