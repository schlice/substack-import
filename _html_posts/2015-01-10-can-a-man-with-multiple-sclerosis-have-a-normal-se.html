<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Short answer: yes.\<br>\<br>Longer answer: It depends on whether or not there is any sexual<br>dysfunction associated with his MS. The [[National MS<br>Society](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=cb8467&url=http://nmss.org){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="nmss.org"}]{.qlink_container} says that in a recent study,<br>63% of men have reported some level of sexual dysfunction. Since sexual<br>arousal begins in the central nervous system, damage along these<br>pathways can cause dysfunction in arousal and orgasm. Other MS symptoms<br>such as fatigue and spasticity can affect sex life, as well as<br>self-esteem and mood changes.\<br>\<br>There are medications and medical devices that can be used to assist men<br>with sexual dysfunction, such as Viagra, Cialis, Levitra, or the MUSE<br>suppository. There are also implants available that can help as well.\<br>\<br>MS does not affect fertility, or the ability to transmit or receive<br>STDs. Men with MS have to take the same basic precautions against<br>unplanned pregnancy and STDs as anyone else.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
