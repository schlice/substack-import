<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I have fire insurance on my home, and I have several fire extinguishers<br>in my house. I've never used them. But I still have them.<br><br>I have a winter kit in my car during the winter season. It has candles,<br>thermal blankets, MREs, and emergency water. I've never used my winter<br>kit. But I still have it.<br><br>We have these things *in case* we need them. If we don't ever use them,<br>was it a stupid idea to have them? Of course not! If we need them, we<br>really need them. If we don't, we're glad we had them in case we needed<br>them.<br><br>It's called being prepared. I would much rather have them and never<br>use them, than to not have them and need them.<br><br>Carrying a gun is the same way. We hope no one will ever find out we are<br>carrying a gun. Because there really should be only one way they find<br>out: if we have to use it.<br><br>I have the training. I have the experience. I have the temperament. So I<br>carry.<br><br>I'd rather have it and not need it than need it and not have it. I would<br>think it would be the most horrible feeling in the world to look at a<br>situation in which I needed my gun and didn't have it.<br><br>As to percentages? We can't give you that number, for the same reasons<br>that we can't tell you the actual number of crimes that were stopped<br>through the use of a gun. And by that, I mean sometimes the simple act<br>of displaying the weapon. It's *estimated* (because that's all we can<br>do) that between one and three million crimes a year are thwarted by<br>the *mere presence* of a firearm, *without a single shot ever being<br>fired*. In most of those cases, the police are never called, so it is<br>impossible to record statistics.<br><br>The one question I can answer: *I am curious though as to the percentage<br>of people who never find themselves in that type of situation.*<br><br>I would say at least 99%.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
