<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Is there a huge morality gap in today\'s Christians faith, when we<br>consider their perverted support for a disgusting immoral, unethical,<br>extreme sinner named Trump? Shall the rest of us assume that these<br>Christians are as immoral & unethical as Trump?**<br><br>As with everything that Christians do, let's refer back to Jesus as our<br>guidepost. What did Jesus do?<br><br>Well, he supported a disgusting, immoral, unethical extreme sinner named<br>Mary Magdalene. Anyone remember her profession? Right, she was a hooker.<br>He also supported those immoral, unethical tax collectors. Remember<br>Zacchias? Yeah, he was a bad guy. Jesus supported him, too.<br><br>Jesus came to *save* those people.<br><br>And now for the zinger: *if Jesus supported prostitutes, tax collectors,<br>and other "disgusting, immoral, unethical, extreme sinners," how could I<br>do less?*<br><br>Trump, while not necessarily fitting the list of badness you said, is<br>indeed bombastic, narcissistic, and misogynistic (and probably a few<br>other "ics" as well). But one thing we learn in the military that the<br>rest of the country would do well to learn is that *you can respect<br>someone as a leader without respecting them as a person.* I've had<br>plenty of bosses that I'd never go have a beer with, but I'll still obey<br>their orders to the letter. Trump is not of the highest moral character,<br>and is indeed many of the things you said, *but he's a good president.*<br><br>And I elected a president, not a pope.<br><br>Trump is not the spiritual leader of the country. Jesus is. And all<br>government is derived from God, for the good of his kingdom. Romans 13:1<br>clearly states that "Every person is to be in subjection to the<br>governing authorities. For there is no authority except from God, and<br>those which exist are established by God." 1 Peter 2:13-14 says "Submit<br>yourselves for the Lord's sake to every human institution, whether to a<br>king as the one in authority, or to governors as sent by him for the<br>punishment of evildoers and the praise of those who do right." So we see<br>that God establishes all governmental leaders in the world, including<br>President Trump. Clearly, he has a plan for us, and it includes Trump.<br><br>Additionally, in case you missed it, *we're all sinners. We've all<br>fallen short of deserving God's forgiveness.* Thankfully, God is<br>*gracious*. Grace is getting what you do not deserve, and God gives us<br>grace.<br><br>Finally, God commands us to *love others,* *not to judge them.* By<br>you saying that we are immoral because we support Trump and he's a<br>sinner, *you are judging both us and him*. That's God's job. He'd<br>probably appreciate it if you did your job and not his. Your job is to<br>love God, and to love your neighbor as you love yourself. Let God do the<br>judging. You do the loving.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
