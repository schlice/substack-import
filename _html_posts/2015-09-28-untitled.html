<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: [I could see myself as clearly in that vet\'s exam room<br>while you described your experience. Mine was so similar, because I too<br>told my wife that once she couldn\'t get herself up to go to the<br>bathroom, we\'d know it was time.\<br>\<br>When we put Jessie down (she was a golden retriever who lived to the<br>ripe old age of 15), she finally relaxed for the first time in a year,<br>and it was very relieving for me to see her relax. She had been fighting<br>non-cancerous tumors throughout her body. The one on her brain stem hit<br>her the hardest, as she lost balance and blood pressure control. She got<br>frequent nosebleeds and could only walk with help (the veterinary<br>neurologist gave us a vest with a \"carry handle\" on it. We knew we<br>were close at that point.\<br>\<br>When they gave Jessie the injection, the same vet who had been her<br>caregiver for all those years cried with us, then quietly left the room.<br>She gave us as much time as we wanted, and then we left the office by<br>the back door. It was painful; I was crushed. Time softens the blow, but<br>the dog-sized hole in your heart never really closes.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/What-did-you-do-after-the-death-of-your-service-dog/answer/Rick-Bruno-1<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
