Can state charges be brought for the same crimes?**<br><br>While in general, a state *could* charge an individual with tax evasion<br>or tax fraud *separately* from the Federal government, in this specific<br>case, it's likely that they cannot.<br><br>In New York, the statute of limitations for tax fraud or tax evasion is<br>either five or six years, depending on the specific charge they would<br>like to levy. Manafort's evasion is purported to have taken place in tax<br>year 2005.<br><br>Therefore it's unlikely that New York would be able to file charges of<br>tax evasion for an incident which took place in 2005.<br><br>In Virginia (where Manafort also owned a residence), they have three<br>years to file for tax fraud (or as their laws state, underpayment of<br>tax).<br><br>So if Trump pardons Manafort for the Federal crimes, it's unlikely that<br>the state would be able to file charges against him for their own<br>crimes.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
