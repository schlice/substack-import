<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>A2A<br><br>Short answer: no.<br><br>Longer answer: Once your initial contract term is up (which was up long<br>ago), you are essentially on a "month-to-month" contract. This contract<br>can be modified or terminated by either party at any time.<br><br>Verizon had been providing its "grandfathered" plans as a gesture of<br>goodwill, not simply pulling the rug out from under you, since you were<br>working well on the old plans. The time in your grandfathered plan was<br>intended for you to be used to find a new plan that would work for you.<br><br>But there comes a point in time when the old plans simply don't work in<br>the new infrastructure. Backend equipment changes, and to be fair,<br>wireless carriers are no longer "tooled" for unlimited data. They are<br>tooled for unlimited voice and text, and metered data.<br><br>Why?<br><br>Data sells. The money is in data. They can offer phone calls and texting<br>for pennies (or simply wrap it into your service when you buy a<br>qualifying data plan). But the money is in data now. More people use<br>data consistently than use voice or text, orders of magnitude more.<br>While SMS is popular, phone companies have always known that charging<br>large amounts of money for texts or limiting texts was a poor business<br>decision, as SMS is literally dirt cheap for the carrier. Plus, with<br>more and more people demanding more and more data (well, not directly,<br>but their apps which use data chew up continually more bandwidth) and<br>smartphones becoming the norm, with even low-end phones as entry-level<br>smartphones, data is at a premium. The infrastructure has to go to data,<br>and the money has to go to data.<br><br>You can't have seen this change happening and not known that your<br>unlimited plan was not long for this world.<br><br>Legally, you weren't under a contract. Your contract with Verizon ended<br>at the end of the contract term, which was long ago (I'm guessing<br>several years). Supporting the equipment which still supported your<br>likely older hardware and your older plan configuration gets expensive.<br><br>In product support, we generally only support N-1 versions of a product.<br>That means we support the current GA (general availability) hardware,<br>and one hardware family previous. Once we pass that point, you can<br>continue to use the old hardware, but support options become far more<br>limited. We simply can't support all the old stuff and continue to<br>provide the new services the vast majority of our customer base demands.<br><br>Sooner or later, it was inevitable that Verizon was going to tell the<br>remaining monthly non-contract users that it was time to switch.<br><br>My advice? Switch to T-Mobile. They will slow your data speed once you<br>pass the amount of data you paid for, but you will still have data, and<br>you won't pay for overages. Plus, they don't count most of the big-use<br>data that are so popular these days. They don't count video streaming<br>services, they don't count music streaming services, and for the next<br>year at least, all of your Pokemon GO data is free.<br><br>So there's that.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
