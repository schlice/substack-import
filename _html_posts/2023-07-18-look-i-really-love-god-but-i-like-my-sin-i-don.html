<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>You can repent of your sin. What I'm seeing in your question is<br>someone who is not truly repentant. If you like your sin you're okay<br>with keeping it. And if you're okay with keeping it, then you are not<br>truly repentant.<br><br>Repentance isn't just "saying sorry." It's a *turning away* from sin.<br>Think of walking in one direction and then swinging around and going the<br>opposite direction. That's repentance. It's an *active rejection* of<br>your former sinful life.<br><br>Take a look at Ephesians 2 -<br><br>> As for you, you were dead in your transgressions and sins, in which<br>> you used to live when you followed the ways of this world and of the<br>> ruler of the kingdom of the air, the spirit who is now at work in<br>> those who are disobedient. All of us also lived among them at one<br>> time, gratifying the cravings of our flesh and following its desires<br>> and thoughts. Like the rest, we were by nature deserving of wrath.<br>> (v.1--3 NIV)<br><br>When you live in sin, you desire sin, because that is the orientation of<br>your heart. You are comfortable in your sin. But worse, you are dead<br>in your sin. Can a dead man save himself? No! We can do nothing to save<br>ourselves from sin's grasp.<br><br>*It is only God who can save us, and He does through His grace.*<br>Paul continues in his letter to the Ephesians:<br><br>> But because of his great love for us, God, who is rich in mercy, made<br>> us alive with Christ even when we were dead in transgressions---it is<br>> by grace you have been saved. (v.4--5 NIV)<br><br>Some of the greatest words in the Bible are right there: BUT GOD.<br>But God. Imagine that. We were dead in our sin, but God chose to<br>save us. We are dead without the intervention of God, and He does so<br>because of His great love for us.<br><br>So the first thing you can do is die to self. Repent of your sin.<br>Turn away from your former sinful life, "in which you used to live when<br>you followed the ways of this world\.\" This is *crucial*, because<br>if you do not repent of your sin, if you do not ***completely reject<br>and turn away from your sin*, you will not be saved.**<br><br>God gives you the power to reject your sin. Nothing is impossible with<br>God. He will provide you with the tools you need to turn away from sin.<br><br>> But I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of<br>> the flesh. For the desires of the flesh are against the Spirit, and<br>> the desires of the Spirit are against the flesh, for these are opposed<br>> to each other, to keep you from doing the things you want to do. But<br>> if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law. Now the works<br>> of the flesh are evident: sexual immorality, impurity, sensuality,<br>> idolatry, sorcery, enmity, strife, jealousy, fits of anger, rivalries,<br>> dissensions, divisions, envy, drunkenness, orgies, and things like<br>> these. I warn you, as I warned you before, that those who do such<br>> things will not inherit the kingdom of God. But the fruit of the<br>> Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness,<br>> faithfulness, gentleness, self-control; against such things there is<br>> no law. And those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh<br>> with its passions and desires. --- Galatians 5:16--24 (ESV)<br><br>That passage tells you that those who belong to Christ have "crucified<br>the flesh" and gain the fruits of the Spirit.<br><br>Repent and believe. That's how we gain eternal life. But to<br>repent, you'll need to "crucify" your old life. You'll need to die to<br>your sin. Die to your old life. Live in your new life. You must truly<br>desire this or you will never get past your sin. If you still like your<br>sin, you'll keep your sin, and your sin will keep you separated from<br>God. You may temporarily feel good, but you'll still be living in sin.<br>You must put to death the desires of the flesh, permanently.<br><br>Salvation is a free gift, but it will cost you your life.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
