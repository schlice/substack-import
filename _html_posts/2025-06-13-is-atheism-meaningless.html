<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Atheism in practice is not meaningless. Atheism in definition is.<br><br>Atheists like to try to shut down debate by claiming that **they have no<br>belief in the existence of god.** But that statement is logically<br>incongruent.<br><br>The truth is that *everyone believes in the truth of something,*<br>especially when the something can only be proven by induction, which can<br>never be 100% true, just degrees of possibility. The truth is that<br>atheists believe that their lack of belief in a god is true.<br>That's a belief.<br><br>And if an atheist ever insists that this is all semantics: they don't<br>believe in the lack of existence of god, they simply have no belief in<br>god; *ask them* *if they truly believe their disbelief is true.* If they<br>say yes, you've proven they have a belief. If they say no, then you've<br>shown them that they don't believe in their disbelief, so the<br>double-negative means that they believe there could be a god.<br><br>But if you meet an intellectually honest atheist who understands that he<br>believes there is no god, you can work with that. That is a topic which<br>can be debated. There's meaning in that debate.<br><br>But fighting about the definition of atheism is meaningless. Trying to<br>argue that you have no belief is silly semantics and it intentionally<br>dodging the question, probably because they have no evidence that there<br>is no god.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
