<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What do you expect to happen in a compliance situation where anyone<br>who self-reports a violation is severely punished, more severely than<br>those caught covering-up?**<br><br>I expect that the behavior which is more harshly punished will be less<br>likely to be voluntarily used than the one that is less harshly<br>punished.<br><br>The idea is to punish less harshly the behavior you want people to do,<br>and punish more harshly the behavior you don't want them to do. This<br>appears to be the opposite.<br><br>Ideally, you should want to punish someone less severely when they<br>self-report. You should want to punish someone far more severely when<br>they are caught covering up their misdeed. Guiding people towards the<br>desired result using severity of punishment is ideal.<br><br>In this scenario, self-reporting is punished more harshly than getting<br>caught. So people will be much less likely to self-report; they'll just<br>wait and see if they get caught, and it won't be too big a deal in that<br>case. There's less incentive to self-report in this scenario, which is<br>somewhat backwards.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
