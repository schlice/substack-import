<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Tell them that you will give them your salary history when they give you<br>the salary histories of all the people who previously held that<br>position.<br><br>Don't worry, they will never do that. It's confidential information. But<br>so is your salary history. That's personal financial information. It's<br>not a "perfectly reasonable" question to ask someone in a job interview.<br>It's a "highly personal" question to ask someone, and it's exceedingly<br>impolite to ask someone you just met about highly personal things.<br><br>If you were selling your car, and someone asked you, "What other offers<br>have you gotten on your car, and what were you offered?" you'd probably<br>tell them to get lost, right? That information is *your bargaining<br>chip.* You're the one offering your services. The company is not in the<br>position of power just because they have a job opening. You are on equal<br>footing with the company. They have a job, you have the talent. They<br>need you just as much as you need them, or they wouldn't be bothering to<br>interview you! You must maintain that mindset.<br><br>To be fair, the more important issue is that **if a recruiter can't<br>figure out how much you are worth without knowing what someone else paid<br>you, they're a really bad recruiter.**<br><br>Once someone has your salary history, you lose all of your negotiating<br>leverage. Some employers have a policy that they won't pay you more than<br>10% more than what you were previously making, because they feel that a<br>10% pay bump is sufficient when moving from one company to another. If<br>they simply refuse to move you forward in the hiring process until you<br>provide that information, *leave*. There is clearly too much distrust<br>and improper employment practices (or apparently in New York, *illegal*<br>hiring practice) to be worth your efforts. Move on. Understand your<br>worth, and know when it is not being respected.<br><br>Liz Ryan over at the [[Human<br>Workplace](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=842fe3&url=http://www.humanworkplace.com/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="humanworkplace.com"}]{.qlink_container} says you need to<br>face the fear of telling a recruiter that your salary history is<br>personal financial information. She poses a possible script to use:<br><br>> INTERVIEWER: What were you earning at your last job, Derek?<br>><br>> YOU: In this job search, I\'m focusing on jobs in the \$50K range. Is<br>> that in the ballpark for this position?<br>><br>> INTERVIEWER: I think it is. I think that could work, but I\'m not the<br>> manager, of course. I have to ask you what you earned at your last<br>> job.<br>><br>> YOU: I completely understand. I know you have questions you\'re<br>> supposed to ask candidates. I think that the \$50K salary target I<br>> mentioned is the right number to write down on your form, because<br>> that\'s what I require in order to come and work here.<br>><br>> INTERVIEWER: Okay, but I\'m supposed to find out what you earned at<br>> your last job, specifically.<br>><br>> YOU: My accountant would kill me if I shared my personal financial<br>> information \-- you can understand. Luckily if the job pays around<br>> fifty thousand it makes sense for us to keep talking.<br>><br>> INTERVIEWER: Okay, I\'ll write that down.\[1\](#mhqhZ){#cite-mhqhZ<br>> .citation_link}<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-mhqhZ){.citation_index}<br>[https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/h\...(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=a40a31&url=https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-answer-what-your-last-salary-liz-ryan){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="linkedin.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
