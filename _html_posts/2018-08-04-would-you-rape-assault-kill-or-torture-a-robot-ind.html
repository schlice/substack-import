<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Would you rape, assault, kill, or torture a robot indulgently since it<br>does not have rights?**<br><br>Ah, so I see you've been watching<br>[*Westworld*(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=9ef183&url=https://www.hbo.com/westworld){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="hbo.com"}]{.qlink_container} then, have you? I'm on to<br>Season 2.<br><br>*Westworld* is a series on HBO which delves into this very question. It<br>explores a future fantasy theme park, where "hosts" (robots) exist in an<br>Old West re-creation. "Guests" can do whatever they like with the<br>"hosts," including raping, assaulting, and "killing" the robots (who go<br>offline when they are shot), only to have their memories wiped and be<br>reset for the next round of guests. The guests cannot be killed by the<br>weapons in the park, so they can live out their fantasies, as either a<br>"white knight" or a "black hat." When one character (William, played by<br>[[Jimmi<br>Simpson](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=ee20e1&url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0801051/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="imdb.com"}]{.qlink_container}) enters the park for the first<br>time, he is actually confronted with the physical choice in color of<br>hat, not too subtly offering him the choice to either be a "good guy" or<br>a "bad guy."<br><br>If you haven't seen the show, I won't ruin it for you.<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-4300d8bdaf67f45129d36fcc729fcfee){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-4300d8bdaf67f45129d36fcc729fcfee" master_w="767"<br>master_h="432"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>At any rate, the show explores the idea that you *can* do these things<br>with robots because they are specifically *not* human. The show also<br>explores when "life" begins and what it means to be alive. *Can* you<br>violate the *rights* of a non-sentient creature? Does a robot have<br>rights? Legally, since a robot is not "alive," you cannot violate its<br>rights, even if it is an expensive, complex, humanoid robot. It cannot<br>be raped or tortured, because those are crimes against *people*. You can<br>no more rape a robot than you can rape a bar stool.<br><br>Now, to the question. Would *I* rape or torture or kill a robot<br>simply because it does not have rights? I don't think so. It's not "fun"<br>for me to rape or torture or kill, and I wouldn't role-play it with a<br>robot simply because I could get away with it because it's not illegal.<br>That's like saying that the only reason I don't rape, torture or kill<br>today is because it's illegal. Like the only thing stopping me from<br>doing it to a *human* is the law. Thankfully, my moral compass is<br>slightly more evolved than that. I'm certain that there are people out<br>there who would, and who are only deterred by the existence of the law.<br>But I am not one of them.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
