<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**When the local law enforcement agency is corrupt and has been that way<br>for so long that it\'s impossible to find an honest cop, how do you get<br>help.?**<br><br>The same way everyone else gets help when local law enforcement is<br>(hypothetically of course) so corrupt that they can no longer function.<br><br>You pay for it.<br><br>If you need something investigated, you hire a private investigator. If<br>you need a crime researched, you go around the police and go to the<br>District Attorney's office. If you need 911 services from the police,<br>you handle it yourself and call the corrupt cops to clean up the mess.<br>Just make sure you have enough payola that they'll look the other way<br>when they figure out that you "might" have done something wrong. Use<br>their corrupt nature to your advantage. Hey, if they're that corrupt,<br>money always works, right?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
