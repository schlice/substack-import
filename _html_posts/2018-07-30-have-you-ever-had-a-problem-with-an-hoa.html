<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I spent three years as the president of our neighborhood's HOA, and<br>I\'ve had problems with other boards, especially on the boards that<br>I\'ve not been a part of.<br><br>Specifically, I have a problem with the board when it doesn\'t follow<br>its own policies. As a legal type person, I spent a lot of time writing<br>and revising the HOA's rules and regulations. Our most controversial<br>rule is the one that says that all owners and long-term guests must park<br>their cars in a driveway or in a garage, not on the street. You have 10<br>days as a guest that you are allowed to park in the street. After that,<br>you are considered a long-term guest, and you are required to follow the<br>parking rules that are laid out for homeowners.<br><br>if that is the case, then why would I receive a courtesy notice about<br>parking in the street after just one day of any vehicle's presence?<br>Either their parking enforcement procedure has become highly efficient,<br>or they\'re sending their courtesy notices just a little bit too early.<br>I should only get a notice in the mail if you see my car in the street<br>for more than 10 days.<br><br>To be fair, our managing agent changed at the same time that I left the<br>board. So I can understand if a few policies are not being implemented<br>exactly the way that I would have. Nevertheless, I still expect the<br>board to follow its own policies.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
