<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Why isn\'t a law background (or mandatory law courses) required for<br>law enforcement officers in the USA?**<br><br>The basic police academies of nearly every police agency in the country<br>include basic law courses covering the criminal laws which the officers<br>will be required to enforce. A general law degree is too broad and<br>covers far more information than a police officer is required to know in<br>order to effectively do his job.<br><br>In other words, police officers are police officers, not lawyers. Sure,<br>it might be nice if your electrician has an EE degree from college, but<br>it's unneeded. It might be useful if your lawn care professional has a<br>biology degree from college, but it's unneeded for his job.<br><br>Similarly, if a police officer had a law degree, he'd become a lawyer,<br>not a police officer.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
