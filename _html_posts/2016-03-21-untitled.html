<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>It\'s more than just a \"chain of command\" issue.<br><br>The National Guard does not work for the President. The President is not<br>the Commander in Chief of any state National Guard. The Governor of that<br>state is the Commander in Chief of that state\'s National Guard. For the<br>National Guard, the buck stops with the Governor.<br><br>The President can (and routinely does) request States to contribute<br>their fully-trained military members during wartime. The Posse Comitatus<br>Act does not specifically prohibit this sort of action. It prohibits the<br>military from being asked to perform state police functions. However, it<br>would not prohibit the National Guard from enforcing state law.<br><br>And in its original construction, the National Guard (which is a formal<br>outgrowth of the militia of all of the people) was a standing army set<br>in place to counter a threat from the federal standing army. Remember,<br>some people were concerned that a standing army could be used against<br>the people (like the King did with his Redcoats).<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-difference-between-the-Air-National-Guard-and-the-Air-Force-Reserve/answer/Bill-Stein<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
