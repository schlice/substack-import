<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [In logic, you can\'t prove a negative assertion.\<br>\<br>You can prove a positive assertion by showing one example from one point<br>in time that proves it. In order to prove the negative assertion<br>(Bigfoot does not exist), you would have to be in all places in all<br>times and prove that no Bigfoot ever existed. Since this is impossible,<br>you cannot ever prove a negative assertion.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
