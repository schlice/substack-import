<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Hi [[Jaime<br>Rosario](https://www.quora.com/profile/Jaime-Rosario-6)]{.qlink_container},<br>thanks for the A2A, not sure I can reasonably contribute more than what<br>you've already heard here.<br><br>But if you read all of these answers, you'll see the same theme:<br>healthcare is neither a privilege nor a right. It is an economic<br>transaction between a patient and a healthcare provider.<br><br>Healthcare can never be a right because it requires the efforts of<br>someone else (a doctor) to realize. If you have a right to healthcare,<br>then you can get it for free, because no one can force you to pay for<br>something to which you have a right. In the United States, I have a<br>right to buy a firearm. No one can force me to pay for the right to buy<br>a firearm. I have the right. Just as I have the right to free speech; I<br>can stand on the street corner and say whatever I choose; no one can<br>force me to pay for the right to speak. I have the right to not have<br>soldiers quartered in my home. No one can force me to pay to keep<br>soldiers out of my home.<br><br>However, someone must pay for healthcare. Even in countries where you<br>get "free" healthcare, *someone* is paying. It's probably you, through<br>your taxes. Therefore, healthcare is always a financial transaction.<br><br>And not a cheap one.<br><br>Doctors go to school for years to learn their practice, usually taking<br>out student loans to do so. They must buy expensive malpractice<br>insurance. They must follow onerous regulations regarding patient<br>privacy, medical records protections, etc. None of this comes cheap.<br>Whether you pay for this out of your paycheck (it's withdrawn every<br>paycheck by your company) and you only see a small copay or coinsurance,<br>or whether you pay for it out of pocket, you or your employer (usually<br>both) are indeed paying for your healthcare.<br><br>Therefore, healthcare is not a right, and it's not really a privilege<br>either. It is a business transaction. You go to the doctor, you pay<br>money (through one form or another), and you receive a service.<br><br>\<br><br>Now before the haters jump all over the comments, the United Nations<br>says that "Free access to healthcare is a human right."<br><br>Let's be clear about this: **everyone in this country has free access to<br>healthcare.**<br><br>That's right, every person, by being a person (aka a human right) can<br>walk into an emergency room anywhere in the United States and be<br>treated, irrespective of their ability to pay. Every person; man, woman,<br>child, citizen, non-citizen, illegal alien, everyone.<br><br>What's important to note is that the human right is to have "free access<br>to healthcare." That means "unimpeded" access to healthcare (no one here<br>will stop you from going to the emergency room). It does *not* mean to<br>have "access to free healthcare" or even "access to affordable<br>healthcare." If you don't pay, the hospital will do everything in its<br>power to try to recoup its costs from you. It will send your bills to<br>collection agencies, it will sue you to garnish your wages or force you<br>to sell your car or your house, etc. It will even look to see if you<br>qualify for government reimbursement for healthcare costs, and will<br>*sign you up for* *those programs* to try to get their money.<br>Eventually, it will give up and eat the lost revenue, but it tries<br>really hard to not do that, because it loses money that way.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
