<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**A leftist article claims 1:315 odds of being shot to death by a<br>criminal in the USA. With more than 315 million people in USA, that<br>requires more than 1 M gunshot victims to be killed to make that 1 in<br>315 number truthful. Is this propaganda?**<br><br>Clearly, the author didn't expect you to use *logic* while reading their<br>article. They just wanted a sensational number to throw at you.<br><br>> *A leftist article claims 1:315 odds of being shot to death by a<br>> criminal in the USA*<br><br>This is a bald-faced lie. There aren't even a million people a year who<br>die from gunshot wounds. At best, you have roughly 33,000 people a year<br>who die from gunshot wounds, and two thirds of those are suicides.<br><br>Of the remaining 11,000, roughly 8000 are *criminals* killing other<br>*criminals* while doing *criminal things*. The largest percentage of<br>deaths in this category is gang violence and violence related to illegal<br>drugs or other illegal activities.<br><br>Within the remaining 3,000 is where you (an honest, law-abiding citizen)<br>could be killed by a criminal. Roughly one third of that 3000 are killed<br>by police (so that's not you). Roughly another 1000 are killed in<br>domestic disputes (while still criminal activity, I'd not count it as<br>part of the figure unless you're trying to scare people). That means<br>that you're lumped in with the remaining 1000 deaths a year which<br>includes accidental shootings and random crimes where one party is an<br>innocent victim.<br><br>That's 1000 deaths out of 330 million people. So instead of the 1 in 315<br>odds (which is just so out of left field it's not even funny), your odds<br>as a law abiding citizen of being killed by a criminal are around 1 in<br>330,000.<br><br>**TL;DR: Engage in unlawful activity and your odds of being killed by a<br>gun go up substantially. But for a law abiding citizen, you're more<br>likely to be struck by lightning twice in your life (odds are 1 in<br>161,856) than to be shot by a criminal.**<br><br>(EDIT) A lot of people are pointing out that the author said these are<br>*lifetime* statistics, so therefore the numbers are right.<br><br>Wrong.<br><br>Even if they are lifetime statistics, does the risk go up over time? If<br>you didn\'t get hit by a car today, are you therefore *more* likely to<br>be hit by a car tomorrow?<br><br>Anyone who has taken high school Algebra has seen at one time a formula<br>for *rates over time.* In this case, the probability of X over Y years<br>is expressed as (P(x))\^y. So the probability of being shot in one year,<br>1 in 330,000, is 0.0000030303. Assuming an average of a 70 year<br>lifespan, that would be (0.0000030303)\^70, which is a number so<br>infinitesimally small that it approaches zero.<br><br>Therefore, as you go on through the years, the risk over time<br>*decreases*. This makes sense, since the time we are measuring is<br>increasing while the actual risk stays the same.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
