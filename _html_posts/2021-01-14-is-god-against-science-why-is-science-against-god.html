<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Is GOD against Science? Why is Science against GOD?<br><br>God is not against science. God IS science. God created the universe and<br>everything in it. So studying the universe is studying God's creation.<br><br>In fact, it was in order to enhance the study of God that modern science<br>developed.<br><br>> Christianity paved the way for modern science in many important ways,<br>> both in terms of some its earliest Catholic "fathers" (such as Ren√©<br>> Descartes, Nicolaus Copernicus, Galileo Galilei, Fr. Gregory Mendel,<br>> and Bishop Nicolas Steno) and some of its most significant champions<br>> (such as Antoine Laurent Lavoisier, Giuseppe Mercalli, and Fr. Georges<br>> Lemaitre). Furthermore, and perhaps even more importantly,<br>> Christianity was also essential to the emergence of modern science by<br>> providing the necessary preconditions for its advent. This is so by<br>> virtue of Christianity's disenchantment \with\ the world and<br>> purification of the human mind of the perceived pervasive activity of<br>> the capricious pagan gods and other fickle lesser beings present<br>> throughout the world. It did so in favor of a divinely ordered and<br>> intrinsically good creation proceeding from the all-powerful, all-wise<br>> God, who is not in any way identical with it. This then opened the way<br>> for an orderly and dependable study of causality within the created<br>> order without fear that it might be inherently unintelligible or that<br>> it might react violently to one's impudent<br>> curiosity.\[1\](#scDwD){#cite-scDwD .citation_link}<br><br>These early Christian "scientists" tried to prove that the Christian God<br>was, in fact, the author of the universe by using scientific inquiry to<br>understand it. Indeed, early scientists like Descartes, Copernicus,<br>Galileo and Mendel actually created the foundation of the scientific<br>method in order to prove that God created the universe, and not some<br>pagan gods being bandied about during their time.<br><br>To wit: if science originally existed to prove God's existence, how can<br>science be against God?<br><br>The truth is that science is not against God. *Scientists* are<br>against God.<br><br>Remember the story of the Tower of Babel from the Bible? Man became<br>quite haughty in his existence, believing that he had mastered the<br>universe. Man decided that he could be "like God" by building a tower to<br>the heavens so that he could congregate with the gods.<br><br>That same level of self-aggrandization has happened with modern<br>scientists. Science has become, essentially, its own religion. You can<br>call it "scienceism." Scienceism believes that it understands *pretty<br>much* everything about how the universe runs, except for the things<br>that, you know, it doesn't understand. But for all of the things which<br>still remain unknown, Scienceism believes that it is only a matter of<br>time until science learns these things. Things like "how did DNA evolve"<br>and "how did organisms reproduce before DNA" and "what existed before<br>the Big Bang" and "how did an amoral universe create beings imbued with<br>moral sense from birth." They have *faith* that science will learn<br>the answers to these questions, in time. This is the foundation of the<br>religion of Scienceism.<br><br>The answer, therefore, is not that science is *against God*. Science has<br>created its own religion. In other words, for the Scienceists, science<br>has *supplanted* God.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-scDwD){.citation_index} [[How Can Modern Science Purify<br>Christianity from Error and<br>Superstition?](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=4b36cc&url=https://churchlifejournal.nd.edu/articles/how-can-modern-science-purify-christianity-from-error-and-superstition/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="nd.edu"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
