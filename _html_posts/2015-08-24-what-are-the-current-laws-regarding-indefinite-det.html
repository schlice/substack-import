<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [There is no relevant law surrounding indefinite<br>detentions. Case law is being created as legal challenges to the<br>detentions in Guantanamo are being heard by the courts.\<br>\<br>The law is tough because the accused are not US citizens, and they are<br>not being held in the United States. They don\'t fall under the<br>(complete) Geneva Convention because they are not fighting for a nation<br>that is a signatory to the Convention, nor are they fighters for a<br>nation, in uniform, under a state flag. There are some provisions that<br>apply (such as the treatment of prisoners of war), but most provisions<br>of the Geneva Convention do not apply to terrorists.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
