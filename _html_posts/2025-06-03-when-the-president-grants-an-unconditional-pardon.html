<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Pardons do not automatically mean any fines the convict paid are<br>refunded. It depends on whether the fines have already been collected<br>and processed by the Treasury Department.<br><br>If the fines have not been paid, or if they have been paid but not yet<br>processed by the Treasury Department, they can be refunded.<br><br>If the fines have already been paid and processed, usually there is no<br>getting it back.<br><br>\<br><br>Now, if you're talking about a *civil* forfeiture (for example, if you<br>were the victim in a criminal case and the person went to jail and then<br>you sued them), the fact that they were pardoned doesn't erase the fact<br>that they engaged in the behavior. It only erases any of the criminal<br>penalties of the conviction. The victim can still sue the perpetrator<br>for damages even if the person was pardoned.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
