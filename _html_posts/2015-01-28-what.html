<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [In Colorado, the state certifies peace officers statewide.<br>All academy courses must be approved by the Colorado POST (Peace Officer<br>Standardization and Training) Board. Once you complete the course, the<br>training staff sends the list of persons who have completed the course<br>back to the POST Board, which approves the list and allows those listed<br>persons to be sworn as Colorado peace officers. Anyone trained and sworn<br>after having been trained in a POST-approved course is considered a<br>Colorado peace officer, regardless of designation or<br>agency.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
