<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The answer is "it depends," because each academy is going to be looking<br>for a different cadet profile in order to meet the needs of that service<br>at that time.<br><br>You're going to meet people who were accepted into multiple service<br>academies. You're going to meet people who were only accepted into one.<br>It all depends on what the individual academies were looking for at that<br>particular time, and how competitive you were at that time for an<br>appointment, in comparison to the rest of the applicant pool for that<br>class.<br><br>If you are a person who is competitive for academy appointment, you<br>should apply to multiple academies, and then secure your nomination to<br>that academy from the source who has slots to give for that school.<br><br>None of the academies are demonstrably harder than the others. In fact,<br>we have exchange programs where we send junior-year cadets intra-Academy<br>for a semester. We'd often have squids and grunts mixed in with the<br>zoomies on the terrazo.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
