<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Once the residents vote to dissolve a mandatory HOA, the members can go<br>through the process to re-establish a new HOA following the rules of<br>that state to establish an HOA in an existing community which does not<br>have one.<br><br>It's two separate processes: one to dissolve a mandatory HOA, and<br>another to establish a new HOA.<br><br>**But no one in their right mind would ever do this, because you're<br>literally doubling the legal cost.**<br><br>It seems like you're asking whether or not one group of homeowners can<br>dissolve an HOA and another group of residents bring it back. And within<br>the boundaries of that particular question, the answer is no.<br><br>The reason is that because each one of those discreet actions<br>(dissolving an HOA or forming a new HOA) either requires a<br>supermajority or unanimous support. And if you have a<br>supermajority of homeowners voting to dissolve an HOA, you're not going<br>to find another supermajority of the same homeowners voting to once<br>again create an HOA.<br><br>The people doing the voting for either dissolving or forming an HOA are<br>*the affected homeowners*. No one else votes to dissolve an existing<br>HOA, or votes to establish an HOA where one did not exist.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
