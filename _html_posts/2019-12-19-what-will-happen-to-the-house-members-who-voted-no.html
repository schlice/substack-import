<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What will happen to the House members who voted not to impeach<br>President Trump?**<br><br>The Republicans will be just fine. No Republicans thought that there was<br>anything to this impeachment sham anyway, so they won't lose any votes<br>back home that they weren't going to get anyway. They may have even<br>picked up a few Independent voters, according to most polls.<br><br>There are a few Democrats who voted against a few Articles. These were<br>Democrats elected in 2018 in red districts which voted for Trump in<br>2016, and they were going to have a really hard time going back to their<br>districts and explaining to all these Trump voters why he/she voted to<br>impeach. So they made a political gamble and split their votes, voting<br>for one article and voting against the other. That way, they can appear<br>studious and thoughtful, as if they really analyzed the situation and<br>voted their conscience. This may allow them the tiniest possibility that<br>they'll be retained in office. But it's a political gamble either way.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
