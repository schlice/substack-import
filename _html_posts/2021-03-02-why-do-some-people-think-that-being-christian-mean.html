<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Why do some people think that being Christian means you get to ignore<br>all the bad things that you have done? Or that it makes you more<br>virtuous? Like it's not really a good defense. It doesn't automatically<br>make you a good person.**<br><br>So there's two things we need to explore here: the state of your past<br>sins, and the difference between salvation and sanctification.<br><br>Yes, people sinned before coming to know Christ. Does accepting Christ<br>as your savior and asking him to come in to your heart make those sins<br>disappear? No, they happened, and the past can't be undone. **But Christ<br>paid for those sins with his blood,** so as far as God is concerned,<br>it's almost as if those past transgressions have been wiped away.<br><br>Think of it this way. When we die, we will stand before the throne and<br>be judged for everything we have done in this life. When we all die and<br>we stand to be judged, the sins we have committed will need to be paid<br>for. For those who have not accepted Christ, *they* will have to pay for<br>their sins themselves, which means eternal separation from God. In the<br>case of the believer, Christ has already paid for those sins with his<br>blood. Believers will stand before the throne, therefore, and be<br>*rewarded* for their good deeds in life, not judged for their sins.<br><br>So while "ignoring" what you did in the past doesn't help with never<br>doing them again, it's important to know that Christ already paid for<br>them, so they should no longer factor in to your life.<br><br>Becoming Christian by accepting Christ as your savior is an<br>instantaneous process. Salvation is a "one and done" kind of thing. Once<br>you are saved, and Christ has paid for your sins (past, present, and<br>future), you are saved. You can't be "un-saved."<br><br>But on that day begins another process by which God slowly works in you<br>to make you more like him, a little bit each day. That process is called<br>*sanctification*, and it takes a lifetime of work. It may never be<br>complete until we stand before him after we die. So becoming a Christian<br>doesn't instantly make you a good person. God does that, slowly, over<br>time.<br><br>Remember, *salvation* is instantaneous, *sanctification* takes a<br>lifetime of God's effort in your life, and you working to become a<br>better Christian.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
