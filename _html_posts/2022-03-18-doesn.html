<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The Tetragrammaton is the literal 4 letter word for the name of God from<br>the Torah. Transliterated, it comes out to be YHWH, which is most<br>closely pronounced "Yahweh," even though the Hebrew letters are<br>unpronounceable. Some sects transliterate it to YHVH, which would be<br>pronounced "Yehovah," or Americanized as "Jehovah."<br><br>\<br><br>Oirginal question:<br><br>Doesn\'t the name Yahweh sound like ancient Egyptian stuff as opposed to<br>the God of Gods?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
