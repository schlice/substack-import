The murderer could have easily done the same horrific thing<br>with another rifle or handgun.

It's not going to happen, no matter how many high school kids cut<br>class to protest. At best, Congress might pass a law which makes bump<br>stocks an NFA item. Beyond that, there is not only no political will to<br>ban AR-pattern rifles (especially when we know that there are plenty of<br>other popular rifles which also shoot 5.56, have detachable magazines,<br>etc), but *it has already been tried before*, and it has accomplished<br>nothing.<br><br>The adults know that it's up to the drive-by media to "drive-by" this<br>story, and once they do, we'll be back to fixing the real issues.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
