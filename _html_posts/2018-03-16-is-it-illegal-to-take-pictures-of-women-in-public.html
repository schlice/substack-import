<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Is it illegal to take pictures of women in public place without their<br>consent?**<br><br>As with all legal questions, the answer is "it depends." And in this<br>case, it depends first on what country you are in.<br><br>In the United States, if you are in public, and in public view, someone<br>can take a picture of you. They can even post the picture online. If you<br>are in public, you have no expectation of privacy, and in general, "if<br>you can see it, you can shoot it." There are, of course, specific<br>exceptions to this law, but this is in general.<br><br>What you cannot do is *profit* off of the photos. You cannot sell them.<br>You cannot charge a subscription fee to have someone see them. The<br>photos would then be considered *commercial use* and you must have the<br>permission of the subject in order to make money off of the photos.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
