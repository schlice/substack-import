<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>So I get it, some people find the trappings of Christmas to be<br>unbiblical. But the whole idea of Santa Claus is not satanic.<br><br>Santa Claus is based on the legend of *Sinterklaas* as brought to New<br>Amsterdam (New York today) by Dutch immigrants in the 19th century. It's<br>also loosely based on St. Nicholas, the gift-giving patron saint of<br>children.<br><br>The legend of St. Nicholas isn't incompatible with God. Giving gifts is<br>certainly compatible, as Jesus is the greatest gift that the world has<br>ever received. And we can use the Christmas season to remember that gift<br>and to spread that Gospel message throughout our communities.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
