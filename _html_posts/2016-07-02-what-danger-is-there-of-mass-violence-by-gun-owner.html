<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The danger is mostly silly talk.<br><br>What would most likely happen is that overnight, the government would<br>create millions of new criminals.<br><br>First, in order to do this, you'd either need a radical<br>re-interpretation of the Second Amendment (and it is radical if you look<br>in comparison to the original intent of the authors of the Constitution)<br>or a wholesale repeal of the Second Amendment. The former might be<br>doable (but fraught with legal challenges for decades); the latter is<br>next to impossible. But for hypothetical argument's sake, let's assume<br>that it happened.<br><br>*Banning* *guns* means a few different things. You could make it illegal<br>to purchase a gun. This wouldn't have any effect on existing gun owners,<br>though. *Ex post facto* laws (laws which make previous activities<br>illegal) are also forbidden by the Constitution. If it was legal to<br>purchase guns when I made the purchase, making it illegal now doesn't<br>affect me.<br><br>Making it illegal to keep guns in your home (again, a Constitutional<br>violation, but we're talking hypotheticals here) would simply create a<br>new class of criminals. The vast majority of people would make a choice:<br>do I comply with the law, or do I sit tight and become a criminal? Since<br>the law would be nearly impossible to enforce without also violating the<br>fourth and fifth amendments as well, most gun owners would probably<br>leave their guns in their gun safes (right where they were before) and<br>wait it out.<br><br>So I wouldn't expect the "blood in the streets" scenario that the<br>crazies like to talk about. But I would expect that you would see a<br>brand new law that most gun owners would simply fail to follow. Unless<br>you also throw out the other Constitutional protections of citizen's<br>rights from government overreach, and once you did that, you did<br>door-to-door searches and included scans of the property with<br>ground-penetrating radar, such a law would be next to impossible to<br>enforce.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
