<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>[[Joshua<br>Alexander](https://www.quora.com/profile/Joshua-Alexander-356)]{.qlink_container}'<br>answer explains why more men pass than women.<br><br>Your question, though, is assuming that the bar is set where it is<br>*specifically* to weed out the physically weaker females. Your<br>question assumes that the bar is where it is because the desire is to<br>keep women out, so knowing that women will not meet the bar is the<br>reason the bar is set so high.<br><br>This is not so.<br><br>**The bar is set where it is because that's the level of ability the job<br>requires.**<br><br>Jon explained very well why more men meet that bar than women. However,<br>the bar is there because that's the level of ability we need in that<br>job. Male or female, you have to be able to perform at that level of<br>ability. Making an "easier" test for women means that the job only<br>requires that level of ability, and that's not the case.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
