<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Your Governing Documents (more specifically, your Bylaws) contain all<br>the information about when elections must be held and how residents must<br>be notified about those elections. Read your Bylaws and make sure your<br>HOA is abiding by them.<br><br>If you are not getting answers, request (in writing) a meeting with the<br>Board. As a resident, you have the right to meet with the Board.<br><br>If they are still unresponsive, you may be forced to bring legal action<br>against the Board (as is your right as a resident) for failing to act in<br>the best interests of the community, perform its duties reasonably and<br>fairly, and not act in a discriminatory or capricious manner. Failing to<br>meet with homeowners when requested and provide governance information,<br>in an apparent attempt to prevent homeowners from seeking nomination to<br>run for a Board position, would definitely qualify. Also, if the Board<br>is not holding fair elections in accordance with the Bylaws, this is<br>also grounds for legal action. While you hope that it would never come<br>to legal action, sometimes a recalcitrant Board must be compelled into<br>action.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>We have an overly zealous HOA board and I want to nominate myself to<br>become a board member when the next voting occurs. There is some<br>hostility in our building now and all questions about when voting takes<br>place are not forthcoming. what to do?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
