<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Multiple Sclerosis is "autoimmune" not because of the blood-brain<br>barrier, but because it is the immune system that is mistakenly<br>attacking normal, healthy body tissue. The definition of an autoimmune<br>disease is one in which the body's own immune system turns on it and<br>attacks normal body tissue.<br><br>In the case of MS, T lymphocytes will attack the myelin sheath<br>surrounding nerve fibers in the CNS (yes, after penetrating the<br>blood-brain barrier) and leaves plaques, or "scars" in its place where<br>nerve signals are degraded. This is why the disease is called "multiple<br>sclerosis," or "many scars."<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
