<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Why would a parent have the police \"fake arrest\" their small<br>child?**<br><br>Because they are cruel, selfish parents who want to give up the<br>parenting job and let the state be the big bad parent. They don't want<br>to be the "bad guy" and would rather have the police act as the bad guy.<br><br>In case you're not following, this is a terrible idea.<br><br>It's a terrible idea for a number of reasons. The first is the one I<br>already mentioned: parents want to abdicate their role as the rule-maker<br>and turn that role over to the police. They want to be their child's<br>"friend" instead of being their child's "parent." Children are looking<br>for parents, not friends. They have plenty of friends at school. Be a<br>parent first.<br><br>Second, it teaches young children to fear the police, which is exactly<br>the opposite of what you want to teach a young child. This doesn't mean<br>that we should indoctrinate children to always trust police officers<br>because they're always good people, but it does mean that you can't<br>teach a child that a police officer is someone to be "feared." For<br>example, a child goes missing and the police are out looking for him.<br>The child will not come out of hiding when police call him for "fear" of<br>getting "in trouble" and being "arrested." Again, not something we want<br>to teach young children.<br><br>Finally (and not insignificantly), abdicating parental responsibility to<br>the state increases the power of the state and weakens the family unit.<br>It is thinking like this which will eventually destroy the family unit,<br>the basic unit of learning and indoctrination of life skills we have in<br>society. If you're a fan of the type of Orwellian government of *1984*,<br>then this is right up your alley.<br><br>Parents: if you think you want to have the police "fake arrest" your<br>children, think again. Don't tell your kids that they have to eat their<br>vegetables or the policeman will come arrest them. Don't tell your kids<br>that they'd better sit still and not disturb everyone else in the<br>restaurant or the policeman will come arrest them. This is bad<br>parenting.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
