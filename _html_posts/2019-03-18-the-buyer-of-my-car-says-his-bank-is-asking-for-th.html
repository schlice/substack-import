<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**The buyer of my car says his bank is asking for the bill of sale. Is<br>it safer to give him a purchase agreement rather than the bill of sale<br>since the car has not been sold?**<br><br>Never give out a bill of sale until the car is actually sold.<br><br>The bill of sale grants the holder certain powers, including the power<br>to *invalidate the previous title and print a new one.* All he has to do<br>is to go in to DMV, show the bill of sale, and tell them that you lost<br>your title. They re-title the car to the new owner, as indicated in the<br>bill of sale.<br><br>The bill of sale shows that the car has been sold. You don't issue a<br>bill of sale until the car is sold and money is transferred.<br><br>The person is either trying to scam you, or is misrepresenting something<br>to you, his bank, or both.<br><br>No money, no sale. No bill of sale. You transfer the bill of sale at the<br>same time you transfer the title. In most states, the buyer keeps the<br>bill of sale and can drive the car *with no license plates* for up<br>to 72 hours (depending on state) after the sale has been made. The bill<br>of sale indicates the time and date of the sale for this purpose.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
