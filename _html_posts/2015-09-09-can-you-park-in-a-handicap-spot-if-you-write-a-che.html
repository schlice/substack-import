<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [No, you can\'t pre-pay your parking tickets before you<br>receive them, as it would smell too much like a \"pay-to-park\" scheme,<br>even if it is \$100 or more per offense. As rates and fees can and often<br>do change, you need the actual ticket to write your check against.<br>Additionally, officers usually cannot directly process payments; they<br>must be made against a ticket directly to the state.\<br>\<br>Ticket first, then check in the mail. Or credit card online. You may be<br>able to use your phone to pay the ticket once you get back to the car,<br>depending on how advanced payment processing is in your state\'s<br>department of revenue. But you still have to enter the ticket number to<br>match the payment to.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
