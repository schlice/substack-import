<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The law says they cannot directly ask about your disability, but if you<br>bring a service animal into the workplace, they can absolutely *assume*<br>you have a disability, **especially when you answer the two questions<br>that they are allowed to ask**:<br><br>- Is that animal required because of a disability?<br>- What work or task is that animal trained to perform?<br><br>These questions may not be asked if the need for the service animal is<br>obvious. So if the person is clearly blind, there is no need to ask if<br>it is a seeing-eye dog.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
