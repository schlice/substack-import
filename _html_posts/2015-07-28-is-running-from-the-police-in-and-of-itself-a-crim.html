<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>> *Original question details:*<br>><br>> *Assume the following:*<br>><br>> - *You were not stopped by the police before you started running, just<br>>   bolted when you saw them.*<br>> - *You are unarmed, and have no contraband*<br>> - *There are no warrants for your arrest, you are not on parole or<br>>   probation and have never been convicted of anything more than a<br>>   minor traffic offense.*<br>><br>> *I\'m not asking about whether or not you\'ll be arrested, but whether<br>> it is actually a crime to do so.*<br><br>TL;DR: in most localities, running away from the police is not, in and<br>of itself, a crime.<br><br>If you\'re allowed to walk away from the police (which you are, assuming<br>you were not stoppped by the police, you\'re not being investigated by<br>the police, etc), who cares how fast you go?<br><br>There are some very narrow exceptions to this rule. Some high crime<br>areas have had ordinances passed which allow running from the police to<br>be considered reasonable suspicion that a crime has, or is going to<br>be, committed. This allows the police to catch the runner and perform a<br>*Terry* search on that person. If the search reveals evidence of the<br>crime, or evidence that a person is going to commit a crime, that person<br>can then be arrested. However, in that instance, the police have to be<br>performing general investigation in that area, searching for evidence of<br>that crime, and the evidence found on the suspect must match the<br>evidence which the police were searching for.<br><br>Will someone who runs from the police raise suspicion? Absolutely. If<br>the police are already in the area searching for a suspect in a recent<br>crime, and if you vaguely fit that description, and you see the police<br>and run, the police have their reasonable suspicion right there. In<br>practice, it\'s a fair chance that the police can find reasonable<br>suspicion to stop you anyway; running simply compounds the suspicion and<br>makes their initial suspicion more plausible.<br><br>Put simply: running is a bad idea.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
