<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Does multiple sclerosis progression vary from person to person?<br><br>Just as the symptoms of the disease vary from person to person, and just<br>as two people with the same symptoms can experience them differently,<br>the disease progression will indeed vary between patients.<br><br>The number one factor influencing the rate of progression is whether or<br>not a patient is taking one of the approved MS therapy drugs. While they<br>may act differently, the approved MS therapy drugs universally will slow<br>down the progression of the disease. While we can't stop the disease, we<br>can slow it down.<br><br>If you are taking an approved therapy drug, you also have to realize<br>that they work differently, and some may work better in some people than<br>others. The drugs all have different *efficacies*, or ability to produce<br>the desired outcome. Some drugs have higher efficacies than others, but<br>they are administered in a more efficient manner or in a more palatable<br>manner. For example, you may be terrified of needles, and so giving<br>yourself daily or periodic injections is a non-starter. Maybe infusion<br>or orals would work better for you, but their efficacies may be lower.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
