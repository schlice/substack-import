<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Yes, recent Supreme Court actions suggest a significant shift that<br>appears to negate Congress\'s choice of agency bipartisanship and<br>independence, in favor instead of the "unitary executive" theory which<br>posits that the Constitution supports the idea that Congress cannot<br>unduly limit the President's authority to remove executive officers.<br>This more "strict constructionist" Court seems likely to continue to<br>advance the "unitary executive" theory.<br><br>Historically, the Supreme Court\'s 1935 decision in *Humphrey\'s<br>Executor v. United States* established a precedent that limited the<br>President\'s power to remove commissioners of independent agencies. This<br>ruling held that for agencies performing quasi-legislative or<br>quasi-judicial functions, Congress could insulate their members from<br>at-will presidential removal, requiring \"for cause\" removal (e.g., for<br>inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance). This was seen as crucial<br>for maintaining the independence and non-partisanship of these agencies.<br>That said, while these agency heads were indeed insulated from removal,<br>their appointments were seen as politically biased to begin with<br><br>However, recent Supreme Court rulings, particularly those involving<br>President Trump\'s removal of appointees from the National Labor<br>Relations Board (NLRB), the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB), and<br>most recently, the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), have<br>chipped away at this long-standing precedent.<br><br>On July 23, 2025, the Supreme Court \"greenlighted\" President Trump\'s<br>ability to remove three Democratic appointees from the CPSC, despite a<br>federal judge having previously reinstated them based on *Humphrey\'s<br>Executor*. This followed similar decisions in May 2025 regarding the<br>NLRB and MSPB.<br><br>The key takeaway from these recent decisions, particularly as expressed<br>in dissenting opinions, is that by allowing the President to remove<br>commissioners for reasons like political affiliation, the Court is<br>indeed \"negating Congress\'s choice of agency bipartisanship and<br>independence.\" The conservative majority on the Court has repeatedly<br>sided with the view that the Constitution grants the President broad<br>executive authority, including the power to fire agency officials<br>without cause, even for agencies that Congress intended to be<br>independent.<br><br>This trend reflects a strengthening of the \"unitary executive" theory,<br>which posits that the President has sole authority over the executive<br>branch and that Congress cannot unduly restrict the President\'s power<br>to remove executive officers. While *Humphrey\'s Executor* distinguished<br>between \"purely executive officers\" (removable at will, as established<br>in *Myers v. United States*) and those with quasi-legislative/judicial<br>functions, the recent rulings seem to be narrowing or even overturning<br>that distinction, particularly for multi-member independent commissions.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
