<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Since some security companies require you to be tased or pepper<br>sprayed before being allowed to carry those tools, why don\'t they<br>require the same for a firearm?**<br><br>Let's start with the obvious: **Requiring you to be pepper sprayed or<br>tased is stupid.**<br><br>There is no manufacturer requirement that you have to feel what it feels<br>like before you can be certified to carry it.<br><br>They only do it (police departments included) for one of two reasons:<br><br>- It's a rite of passage<br>- They want you to understand what you might be inflicting on others, so<br>  that you don't do so willy-nilly simply because it is non-lethal force<br><br>It doesn't "enhance the training" or do anything else of the sort. It<br>doesn't make the training more "relatable" or anything else. Otherwise,<br>you could, as the OP did, apply the same logic to the firearm.<br><br>However, you cannot do the same with a firearm because it is lethal<br>force, any time it is used. Where can you be shot that you can guarantee<br>will not kill you?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
