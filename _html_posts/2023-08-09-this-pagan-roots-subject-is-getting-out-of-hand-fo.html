title: '"This pagan roots subject is getting out of hand for me, I dont know what
  to do.  Apparently these things are pagan from what Ive seen:  - Jazz - Christmas,
  Easter - Weddings, Funerals - Wedding Rings - Yoga - Days of the Week - Months of
  the Week - A car brand I dont remember.  Are we seriously suppose to not participate
  in any of this. I dont want to be liberal or legalistic."'

<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>If you want to be neither liberal nor legalistic, remember the<br>following:<br><br>It is certainly possible that all of these things had pagan origins.<br>Many things we do today are traditions that began hundreds or even<br>thousands of years ago, some even as pagan ceremonies.<br><br>**But what is important is not where a tradition came from. What is<br>important is the significance of the tradition to us today as believers<br>in Christ.**<br><br>For example, the Bible does not say that Jesus was born on December<br>25th. In fact, it's most likely that December 25th was chosen<br>specifically to replace pagan festivals on that date. The Roman Catholic<br>Church started celebrating Christmas on December 25th in the year 336 AD<br>during the reign of Emperor Constantine. Constantine was working to make<br>Christianity the effective religion of the empire, and the date was<br>chosen intentionally to cause Christmas to outshine existing pagan<br>Winter Solstice celebrations on that day.<br><br>So since the Bible doesn't say that December 25th is Jesus' birthday, we<br>cannot be completely dogmatic about it one way or the other. But even if<br>the date is completely wrong, there is still the opportunity for<br>thousands of people who wouldn't go to church any other time of the year<br>to go on Christmas Day and hear the good news about the baby born in a<br>stable and laid in a humble manger, who would go on to save the world.<br>There is no reason to deny that celebration when it has such powerful<br>evangelism as its end.<br><br>If you are fully convinced that you cannot, in good conscience, observe<br>one, some, or any of the things you listed because they had pagan roots,<br>then don't. If you are fully convinced that any of these are simply too<br>deeply rooted in paganism in order to honor God in any way, then don't<br>observe them. Personally, I'd be more concerned about Halloween than<br>anything you've listed here, but I digress...<br><br>But if you believe that you can honor God by participating in a<br>particular tradition, then by all means, participate in that tradition.<br>When Paul was ministering to the people in Rome (the most pagan place in<br>the world at that time), he gave them this advice:<br><br>> *One person considers one day more sacred than another; another<br>> considers every day alike. Each of them should be fully convinced in<br>> their own mind. --- Romans 14:5 NIV*<br><br>How you worship God is up to you. If you feel that you can honor God by<br>participating in a particular tradition, then do it! Honor and worship<br>God!<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
