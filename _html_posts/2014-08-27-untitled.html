<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: [I think you\'re right that eventually there will be legal<br>challenges to all video, and the departments will have to show the chain<br>of custody and prove the video was not edited. But the solutions in<br>place help to maintain that chain of custody and to maintain the<br>sanctity of the actual video.\<br>\<br>Dash-mounted video only goes so far, and yes, we can require our law<br>enforcement professionals to wear a video camera, both for their<br>protection and for the suspect\'s. That way, there is a complete video<br>recording of the entire proceeding being made, and the officer can<br>reference the video to help him when writing his reports. I think it\'s<br>a great tool, but I want others\' opinions who have far more experience<br>than I. Why would a police union say that most officers out there don\'t<br>want video on their persons?]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/Do-cops-want-video-on-their-bodies/answer/Deborah-Gahm<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
