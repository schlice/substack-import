<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Do you think that the homeowners\' association should be made<br>illegal?**<br><br>Of course not. There are *far* better choices available than forcing<br>communities to abandon HOAs, especially if the community wants the HOA.<br><br>- If a community decides they don't want a homeowner's association, they<br>  can dissolve it. It requires a real estate attorney's assistance<br>  (because there are things which need to be done, like dealing with<br>  HOA-owned properties), and depending on where you live, it could<br>  require either a supermajority or a unanimous vote of the members of<br>  that HOA. But this decision should be made by the whole community, not<br>  just by one or two people.<br>- The homeowner is always free to sell his home and move to a community<br>  which is not governed by an HOA. Even in our community which is, by a<br>  large majority, in favor of our HOA, there were several homeowners who<br>  were so against HOAs in general, and their restrictions in specific,<br>  that they sold their homes and moved to locations not governed by<br>  HOAs.<br><br>The decision to keep or disband the HOA is something that should be left<br>to the residents of that community, not the government forcing<br>communities to abandon HOAs that they may want.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
