<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Should the military retirement pay received by military former spouses<br>be subject to garnishment to pay child support owed to service members<br>by the former spouse?**<br><br>So I'm trying to understand your wording. Let's try to deconstruct what<br>you asked.<br><br>You said "should the pay received by military former spouses". Spouses<br>of military members are not paid. So if you are a former spouse of a<br>military member and you are being paid, it is by court order. This<br>court-ordered payment is often referred to as "alimony" or "maintenance"<br>(depending on what state you live in).<br><br>Then you said that the pay would be "garnished" to pay child support<br>owed to the service member by the former spouse.<br><br>In this case, the money is already going to the service member. It<br>sounds like what is happening, therefore, is that your maintenance is<br>being reduced by the amount of the child support owed by you to the<br>servicemember.<br><br>This is not a military pay issue, and it is not a "garnishment" issue,<br>as garnishment is a function which can be applied directly to military<br>pay. This is purely a legal, court issue. If you are receiving<br>maintenance payments, it is from a court order, not from the government.<br>That pay does not get "garnished," but it can be reduced if you, in<br>turn, owe child support payments back to the servicemember who is paying<br>you maintenance money.<br><br>If this reduction in your maintenance was not done through a court<br>order, you should contact your attorney and advise him of everything<br>that is going on, including what you owe in child support and how much<br>you have paid, along with canceled checks. The servicemember does not<br>have the right to unilaterally ignore court-determined maintenance just<br>because you owe child support payments. It would be up to the<br>servicemember to return to court to re-negotiate a reduction in<br>maintenance in order to satisfy both his maintenance requirement, and<br>your child support requirement. The court can order your maintenance be<br>reduced by the amount of child support you owe, but that's up to the<br>court to decide. If the servicemember is doing this on his own, tell<br>your lawyer. It's up to a judge to make that determination.<br><br>\<br><br>> *This answer is not a substitute for professional legal advice.
