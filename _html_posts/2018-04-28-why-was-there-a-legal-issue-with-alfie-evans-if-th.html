<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Why was there a legal issue with Alfie Evans: if the parents had<br>alternative providers they preferred, is there some law in the U.K. that<br>prevents them from treating their child as they see fit?**<br><br>Doctors said that Alfie suffered from a degenerative brain condition,<br>and they determined that not only was continued care futile, it was not<br>in his best interest. The doctors intended on removing Alfie's life<br>support.<br><br>Alfie's parents appealed to the courts to allow him to be transferred to<br>another facility. The parents fought for months to get permission to<br>relocate him to another facility, and eventually even appealed to Rome,<br>and the Pope attempted to intercede as well. Italy was prepared to grant<br>Alfie citizenship, and the Vatican was prepared to take him to Vatican<br>Children's Hospital for continued care.<br><br>However, the courts in the UK always side with the child, even over the<br>wishes of "well-meaning, but often misguided," parents. UK courts will<br>always keep the child's best interest first, and the courts decided that<br>the doctors were correct, that there was nothing more that could be<br>done, and that keeping Alfie on life support was not in his best<br>interest.<br><br>For those of you in the United States reading this: **this is what<br>single-payer, state-run healthcare looks like.** Parents no longer get<br>to decide what is in your child's best interest. The state gets to<br>decide, since the state is the doctor and the state is the payer.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
