<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>No nation wants to go to war with the United States (except for maybe<br>North Korea, but they're just bat-shit crazy). Just the threat of war<br>with our country is enough to keep the vast majority of nations at bay.<br>So it's highly unlikely that a nation would launch fighters against Air<br>Force One.<br><br>The rogue actors are the ones you need to worry about, and they don't<br>own fighter jets. But they can buy rockets. Surface to air missiles are<br>bigger threats than manned fighter jets operated by a nation.<br><br>While the exact loadout is classified, Air Force One has countermeasures<br>on board to defeat incoming missiles.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
