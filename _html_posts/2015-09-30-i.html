<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Some people do have chronic pain. And in some cases,<br>medically there is nothing that can be done.\<br>\<br>Have you seen a pain specialist? There may be things you can do<br>homeopathically. But drugs may be involved. Talking to a pain specialist<br>is your best option.\<br>\<br>I don\'t want to include a Google link beause it may not work correctly<br>for you, but try Googling \"pain management\" and if your browser is set<br>up correctly, you should see a map with locations of pain doctors near<br>you.\<br>\<br>And cannabis can be the answer even if you\'re not interested in smoking<br>it. CBD is one of the active ingredients in cannabis, but it doesn\'t<br>produce the psychoactive effects. That comes from THC. If you live in a<br>state which allows medical marijuana, you can get cannabis oil with THC<br>removed so you get the benefits without the \"high.\"\<br>\<br>The notable example is [[Montel<br>Williams.](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=6ac030&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montel-Williams){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container} From his book, he<br>mentions that he uses a cannabis oil to control his neurological pain<br>from MS. He says it\'s the only thing that will control his pain, and<br>he\'s tried every pain medication out there. As a TV personality, he has<br>the money to do just that, so I have no doubt that he has tried<br>everything out there. He says a few drops of cannabis oil on his dinner<br>takes his pain level from a 10 to a 3 so he can actually sleep at night.<br>And it doesn\'t make him \"high\". It just fixes his pain, naturally.\<br>\<br>Keep fighting!]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
