Being convicted of a crime almost never causes a person<br>to lose their military pension.<br><br>The exception to this would be for crimes related to disloyalty to the<br>United States: treason, espionage, etc.<br><br>Flynn was convicted of lying to a Federal agent. Not enough to cause him<br>to lose his pension.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
