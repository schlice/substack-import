<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>*If* he is convicted of indecent exposure (which is seems likely that he<br>will be), he will be required to register on the sex offender registry.<br><br>*Will* he be? That\'s up to the court to decide. Where I live, indecent<br>exposure involves exposure of the genitals with the intent \"to<br>arouse or to satisfy the sexual desires of anyone.\" The \"anyone\"<br>could be himself, a known viewer, or an unknown viewer. Our law is<br>written with an intent clause. Here, it would be up to the prosecution<br>to prove that there was intent to cause sexual arousal.<br><br>However, the defendant is in Arizona. There, indecent exposure is listed<br>as: \"Intentionally exposing your private parts (genitals or anus, or a<br>female exposing the areola or nipple of her breast) and another person<br>is present. The defendant must be reckless about the fact that the other<br>person may be offended.\"<br><br>This young man\'s conduct clearly meets this standard. The fact remains<br>that no one caught the offensive picture and it was published. He was<br>reckless in allowing the picture to be taken and to be used. He made no<br>effort to inform anyone of his prank and allowed the picture to be used,<br>which was reckless. Under Arizona law, this would be considered indecent<br>exposure.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
