But at the same time, the<br>United States places no restriction on the ability to occupy the Office<br>of the President based on felony conviction status.<br><br>So Canada, legally, under their standard immigration law, could deny<br>President Trump entry into their country because of his felony status.<br><br>But *should they*?
