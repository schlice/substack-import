<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Good question. To make the point, ask the next person who tells you that<br>a transwoman is a woman to define what a woman is. They'll likely tell<br>you that "a woman is anyone who says they are a woman."<br><br>But you'll be ready, because such an answer is a logical fallacy called<br>"circular reasoning." It's exactly like saying "The Bible is true<br>because the Bible says it is true."<br><br>If a woman is anyone who says they are a woman, does that same logic<br>hold true for anything? Is a doctor anyone who says they are a doctor?<br>Is a black person anyone who says they are a black person? Is a child<br>anyone who says they are a child?<br><br>\<br><br>The point is, you do not "define biological sex." Biological sex is<br>exactly what it is. It is immutable: that means it cannot be<br>changed. It is real: that's just the way it is and everyone knows<br>it, and it is binary: there are only two sexes, not three, not four,<br>and not fifty-seven.<br><br>By the way, this is true throughout the plant and animal kingdoms. An<br>organism's sex is defined by the type of gamete (sperm or ova) it can or<br>would produce. Males have the function of producing sperm, or small<br>gametes; and females, ova, or large ones. There is no third gamete type.<br>There are only two.<br><br>Gender activists try to confuse terms by pointing to "intersex" people,<br>a very small number of people who have genitalia that *appear* ambiguous<br>or mixed. These gender activists claim the existence of such conditions<br>renders the categories "male" and "female" meaningless.<br><br>But the existence of intersex people doesn't change the sex binary.<br>Intersex people, those who are physically sexually ambiguous, are not a<br>"third sex." But gender activists try to confuse you into thinking that<br>because intersex people exist, transgender people must exist as well.<br><br>But there is a *very massive difference* between intersex and<br>transgender people. Intersex people have an extremely rare condition<br>that results in apparent sex ambiguity. Transgender people, however,<br>*aren't sexually ambiguous at all* but merely claim to identify as<br>something other than their biological sex. Their biological sex is<br>*very* clear.<br><br>There is no massive surge in people born with ambiguous genitalia in the<br>world today. But there is a dramatic surge in people who are<br>*unambiguously one sex* claiming to "identify" as the opposite sex, or<br>as something other than male or female altogether.<br><br>\<br><br>So to answer your question, you identify biological sex in the same way<br>you always identified biological sex: what gametes you can or would<br>produce, what internal reproductive structures you are born with (which,<br>in the vast majority of cases, match the gametes you can or would<br>produce), and in the vast majority of cases, what external genitalia you<br>have.<br><br>This is how you determine biological sex: through biology.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
