<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>You cannot be charged with murder if the victim is alive. It's as simple<br>as that. Murder is the unlawful taking of a life, and depending on the<br>severity, with forethought and malice. If there is no taking of a life,<br>there is no murder.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
