<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Besides the fact that you are comparing apples to oranges, your facts<br>are also incorrect.<br><br>Capitalism is an economic system wherein the market is allowed to<br>control prices. That means prices for everything from goods to services.<br>It runs off of an economic principle called *supply and demand*. In<br>general, what this means is that, all else being equal, supply is<br>inversely proportional to price, and demand is directly proportional to<br>price. For example (again all else being equal), if supply goes up and<br>demand stays constant, price goes down. If demand goes up and supply<br>stays constant, price goes up. This includes supply and demand for<br>everything, including labor.<br><br>"Ignoring laws" and "shooting people simply because you own a gun" is<br>not capitalism. It's actually not an *economic* system at all. It's a<br>system of government called *anarchy* wherein laws do not exist. It has<br>absolutely nothing to do with economics.<br><br>Apples and oranges.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
