<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: [*Running round in military gear pointing weapons at<br>unarmed civilians and reporters, confiscating recording devices etc*\<br>This is called \"riot control\". And as we learned with Michael Brown,<br>\"unarmed\" does not equate to \"not dangerous.\"\<br>\<br>*The concept thes cops either ignored or were never taught is called<br>escalation*\<br>The cops do not escalate. The people escalated. Notice that the cops<br>didn\'t start the riots. They responded.\<br>\<br>*\A<br>d the military are trained not to aim at people till necessary.*\<br>Really? We have special \"aiming\" training in the military? Must\'ve<br>missed that class\...\<br>\<br>You are spending a lot of time equating the police to the military. They<br>may look similar, but they are different. Different missions, different<br>bosses, different customers, etc. False equivalency.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/Is-the-2nd-Amendment-outdated-Is-it-necessary/answer/Chris-Craddock<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
