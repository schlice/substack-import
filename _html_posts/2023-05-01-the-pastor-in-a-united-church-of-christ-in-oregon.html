<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>It's interesting, because these people are so very worried about not<br>misgendering people, but they have no problem misgendering God.<br><br>The answer is God's preferred pronouns are He/Him.<br><br>Right about now, they'd say, *Really? How do you know?* God has said in<br>many places throughout Scripture that He wishes to be known as a Father.<br><br>> Scripture contains approximately 170 references to God as the<br>> "Father." By necessity, one cannot be a father unless one is male. If<br>> God had chosen to be revealed to man in a female form, then the word<br>> "mother" would have occurred in these places, not "father." In the Old<br>> and New Testaments, masculine pronouns are used over and over again in<br>> reference to God.<br>><br>> Jesus Christ referred to God as the Father several times and in other<br>> cases used masculine pronouns in reference to God. In the Gospels<br>> alone, Christ uses the term "Father" in direct reference to God nearly<br>> 160 times. Of particular interest is Christ's statement in John 10:30:<br>> "I and the Father are one." Obviously, Jesus Christ came in the form<br>> of a human man to die on the cross as payment for the sins of the<br>> world. Like God the Father, Jesus was revealed to humanity in a male<br>> form. Scripture records numerous other instances where Christ utilized<br>> masculine nouns and pronouns in reference to God.<br>><br>> The New Testament Epistles (from Acts to Revelation) also contain<br>> nearly 900 verses where the word theos---a masculine noun in the<br>> Greek---is used in direct reference to God. In countless references to<br>> God in Scripture, there is clearly a consistent pattern of His being<br>> referred to with masculine titles, nouns, and pronouns. While God is<br>> not a man, He chose a masculine form in order to reveal Himself to<br>> humanity. Likewise, Jesus Christ, who is constantly referred to with<br>> masculine titles, nouns, and pronouns, took a male form while He<br>> walked on the earth. The prophets of the Old Testament and the<br>> apostles of the New Testament refer to both God and Jesus Christ with<br>> masculine names and titles. God chose to be revealed in this form in<br>> order for man to more easily grasp who He is. While God makes<br>> allowances in order to help us understand Him, it is important to not<br>> try to "force God into a box," so to speak, by placing limitations on<br>> Him that are not appropriate to His nature.\[1\](#DZdZd){#cite-DZdZd<br>> .citation_link}<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-DZdZd){.citation_index} [[Is God male or<br>female?](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=83460c&url=https://www.gotquestions.org/God-male-female.html){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="gotquestions.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
