<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>First of all, none of us were there. None of us actually experienced<br>what the participants went through. It's easy to "Monday morning<br>quarterback" this thing, but while we do that, we should be careful not<br>to condemn anyone personally for their actions. We may have acted<br>similarly in a similar situation; until it happens to you, you don't<br>know.<br><br>All we can do is review the actions and see if anything could have been<br>done better. I believe that it could have been handled differently.<br><br>For starters, *Officer Yanez could have avoided giving Castile<br>conflicting directives in the first place*. He ordered Castile to<br>retrieve his license, but when Castile said he was carrying a gun<br>(legally), he was told not to reach for his gun.<br><br>IF THERE WAS A QUESTION whether following one order would have led<br>to violating a second order, Castile should have stopped, put both of<br>his hands on the steering wheel, and indicated that his gun was near his<br>license and he wouldn't be able to reach for one without reaching for<br>the other.<br><br>It's like any time you have two conflicting orders. You can't do one<br>without violating the second. *Castile should have stopped moving and<br>requested clearer directions*. Especially as the officer was continuing<br>to think that he was reaching for his gun, he should have stopped<br>reaching.<br><br>Once Castile indicated that he had a gun, if the officer was still<br>concerned that Castile could not reach for his license without reaching<br>for his gun, the officer should have taken him out of the car and<br>disarmed him, which in most places where concealed carry is legal, is<br>legal to do for the duration of the traffic stop.<br><br>The incident was a tragedy. That the officer was not held to account for<br>the error that he induced which led to the conditions that made the<br>officer fear for his own life is a miscarriage of justice.<br><br>I suspect the officer will face a wrongful death lawsuit (which he will<br>lose) and his conflicting orders leading to the death of a civilian will<br>likely cost him his badge.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
