<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What if you haven\'t been arrested, and you have not read your rights,<br>but you answer questions by the law enforcement that could possibly be<br>incriminating?**<br><br>*In general*, voluntary, non-coerced statements by people who are not in<br>custody are still admissible in court; simply because you were not<br>Mirandized before you answered a question does not always mean that your<br>statement is inadmissible in court. There are many circumstances which<br>could cause your statement to be considered involuntary (i.e.<br>confessions extracted by force, coercion, extended time, being held<br>"incommunicado," deprivation, threats or promises, etc). Absent these<br>mitigating factors which would indicate some sort of involuntary nature<br>to the statement, truly voluntary statements not found to have been<br>coerced can be admissible.<br><br>If this has happened to you, you had better be talking to a lawyer now.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
