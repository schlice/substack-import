As a liberal I know many of my similarly minded brethren have<br>been armed all along and are currently the fastest growing segment of<br>the gun buying public.**<br><br>Let's tear it down since you have three statements in here.<br><br>> ***What makes conservatives so certain that all liberals are for gun<br>> control?***<br><br>The only thing that is certain is that anyone who uses absolutes is<br>engaging in the logical fallacy of the "argument from omniscience."<br>Unless you're God, you can't know that all liberals are for or<br>against gun control. You also can't know what all conservatives are<br>thinking either.<br><br>More correctly: most conservatives understand that most liberals are<br>indeed in favor of some form of gun control, and it's the kind of gun<br>control which involves some form of denying law-abiding citizens access<br>to guns. But of course, not all liberals are interested in gun control.<br>And not all conservatives understand that not all liberals are<br>interested in gun control. But I don't speak in absolutes.<br><br>> ***As a liberal I know many of my similarly minded brethren have been<br>> armed all along***<br><br>Good! You and your similarly-minded brethren should work on the kookoos<br>who actually do want to disarm law-abiding citizens.<br><br>> ***\We\ are currently the fastest growing segment of the gun buying<br>> public.***<br><br>Unless you have some statistics to back this up, I highly doubt this<br>claim. No one asks your political persuasion when you buy a gun, so gun<br>stores won't have this information, so unless you got this information<br>through a nationwide poll (on which people are known to lie), I highly<br>doubt the veracity of this claim.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
