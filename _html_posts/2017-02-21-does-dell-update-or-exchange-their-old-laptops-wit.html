They do not have a<br>buyback program for commercial laptops.<br><br>Dell will help you trade in your laptop and will give you a Dell gift<br>card for doing so, but they will not buy back or exchange old laptops.<br><br>If you want to get more significant money for your laptop, I suggest<br>selling it yourself on eBay or some other marketplace.<br><br>If you're more interested in simply recycling the old laptop and getting<br>a little money for your trouble, [[Dell will help you with<br>that](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=38988b&url=http://www.dell.com/learn/us/en/19/campaigns/trade-in-program){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="dell.com"}]{.qlink_container}.
