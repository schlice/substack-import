<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The chance in the general population of getting MS is about 1 in 750.<br>Having a first degree relative (parent or sibling) with MS changes that<br>risk to anywhere between 1 in 100 to 1 in 40.<br><br>But genetics is not the whole story. If you take two identical twins<br>(who share identical DNA) and one gets MS, the chance of the other<br>getting MS is 1 in 4. If it were all genetics, then the twin would be<br>guaranteed to get it.<br><br>There are other factors that influence MS risk, such as ethnicity,<br>geography of childhood, and exposure to an as-of-yet unidentified<br>infectious trigger.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
