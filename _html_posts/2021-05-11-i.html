<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**I'm 13 and my nude that I was coerced into sending was leaked on<br>Discord. A lot of people have them and I visibly have my necklace,<br>house, and hair in it. What do I do?**<br><br>I'm sorry this has happened to you. The problem, of course, is that once<br>that information makes it to the Internet, it's forever. While it pains<br>me to say this, if it makes it out there uncontrolled like it has, there<br>is a very good chance that you will never be able to completely get rid<br>of it.<br><br>You have the option of using a data deletion service like<br>[DeleteMe(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=3a6c18&url=https://joindeleteme.com){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="joindeleteme.com"}]{.qlink_container} (not a sponsor), but<br>it's not free. They have a pretty impressive record of removing<br>information you don't want out there anymore, and after a year or so,<br>they will probably have gotten most copies of the picture removed, but<br>again, this is the Internet we're talking about; you will probably not<br>be able to get all copies gone from everywhere.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
