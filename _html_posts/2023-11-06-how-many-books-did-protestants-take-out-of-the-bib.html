<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>These are fourteen books that come in what we call the<br>intertestamental period between the Old Testament and the New Testament.<br>They are indeed recognized as canonical in the Roman Catholic Church,<br>but Protestants do not recognize them as canonical.<br><br>But how did we get here? Let me give you a brief history about how the<br>various Bibles came about in their current forms.<br><br>By the (roughly) 3rd century before Jesus, Greek was the most common<br>language. Hebrew had become sort of a "specialist language." The Torah<br>was in Hebrew, but most of the Jewish community at that time could not<br>read Hebrew. It was mostly the religious scholars and the rabbis who<br>could. And much like modern-day believers who wanted the Bible<br>translated into English (or German, or French), there was a strong<br>movement at the time to translate the Scriptures into a common language<br>that the people could understand. To that end, the Scriptures were<br>translated into Greek, a translation known as the Septuagint (in<br>Roman Numerals, LXX). It is what most people of that time understood by<br>"the Scriptures."<br><br>When the Roman Catholic Church canonized their Bible, they simply<br>accepted those Jewish scriptures without comment. They then translated<br>the entirety of their canonized scriptures into Latin, a translation<br>known as the Vulgate.<br><br>This is how things stood in the church until the Protestant Reformation.<br>Having rejected the authority of the Roman Catholic Church, Protestants<br>focused church authority in the Bible. But which Bible should they use?<br>Since Protestants decided that all things Roman Catholic were hereby<br>"bad," that meant that the Vulgate was out.<br><br>Thankfully, as it turns out, the Jewish community had their own<br>"revival" movement in about the ninth century, and produced the<br>"Masoretic Text," all in Hebrew. But there were some books in the LXX<br>which had always been in Greek, never in Hebrew. The books we now call<br>the Apocrypha *were too new to have originally been in Hebrew,* so the<br>Masoretic Text rejected them. Those reformers did not consider them as<br>part of the Torah. This version became the standard text of what the<br>Jews understood as Holy Scripture.<br><br>When Protestants canonized *their* Bible, they simply did exactly what<br>the Roman Catholic church did in the 4th century, and used the Scripture<br>that the Jews were using as canon. The Masoretic Texts were used as the<br>starting point for the Bible, not the Septuagint, and since the<br>Masoretic Texts excluded the books written only in Greek, so too did the<br>Protestant Bible.<br><br>In essence, both the Roman Catholics and the Protestants accepted as<br>"gospel" what the Jews of their time accepted as "gospel." It simply<br>resulted in two different groups of books, because the Jews reformed<br>their own Scriptures in the intervening period.<br><br>*(Note that there is a lot of history I am leaving out here. I am not<br>claiming this to be an authoritative reading of history. It simply is<br>enough to provide some background as to how the various versions of the<br>Bible were assembled, and what happened to the apocrypha. There is* much<br>more *to the story than just this, but this is a basic outline.)*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
