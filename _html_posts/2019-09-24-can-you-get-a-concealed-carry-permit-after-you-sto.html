<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Can you get a concealed carry permit after you stop working in the<br>marijuana industry in Colorado?**<br><br>The answer, as with all legal answers, is "it depends."<br><br>The marijuana industry is controlled at the state and local level, while<br>concealed carry permits are issued by a county sheriff in Colorado.<br><br>In most cases, persons working in the marijuana industry are not barred<br>from concealed carry. However, some county concealed carry applications<br>ask if you "unlawfully use or are addicted to a controlled substance<br>that\'s illegal at the federal level." If you answer honestly and say<br>that you also use as well as being employed in the industry, it is<br>possible that a sheriff *may* deny your application, since marijuana is<br>still illegal at the federal level.<br><br>So depending on how you answer the application questionnaire, you *may*<br>be denied a permit if you use marijuana along with working in the<br>industry. But of course, this is always at the discretion of the county<br>sheriff in the county in which you are applying.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
