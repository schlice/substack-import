<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Charges? First, the only charge I can think of is "false reporting," and<br>it is unclear whether or not this applies to the police. Second, you're<br>going to have a tough row to hoe to prove that the police knew facts<br>other than what they entered into the report. Third, why would they lie?<br>There's no real reason I can think of that they would want to<br>deliberately falsify a report that they submit.<br><br>Falsifying a report can only hurt them, as it would be more in violation<br>of department policy than law, which means that they can be<br>administratively punished (or potentially lose their jobs) if the<br>falsification is found to be deliberate for some reason.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
