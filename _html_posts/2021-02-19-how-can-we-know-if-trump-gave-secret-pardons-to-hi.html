<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**How can we know if Trump gave secret pardons to himself and his<br>family?**<br><br>You can't. Because they're secret.<br><br>But from what we can tell, if they exist, they're probably<br>unconstitutional. We won't know until Trump tries to use one, assuming<br>he issued a secret pardon and then stuffed it in a safe deposit box to<br>be withdrawn if he is ever tried for a crime. It's never been done<br>before, so there is no precedent. I'm also pretty sure that the courts<br>would not look too kindly on the validity of a secret pardon.<br><br>While there is no specific format for which pardons must follow, the<br>framers knew that the check against presidential abuse of the pardon<br>power was the fact that they are public. The public has the opportunity<br>to judge the behavior of the president and vote accordingly, and this<br>includes his use of his pardon power.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
