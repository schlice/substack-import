<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Most laws about child porn include not only possession but consumption.<br>The reason that they do this, and the reason that consumption of child<br>porn is illegal, is because the government is trying to shape the<br>marketplace for child porn through the law. If we make it illegal to<br>watch, some people might not do it. If they don't do it, they won't buy<br>it, thereby shrinking the market for such material. There are indeed<br>some people who don't do things simply because it's illegal to do.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Why is it illegal to watch child pornography, but it isn\'t illegal to<br>watch videos of people getting murdered?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
