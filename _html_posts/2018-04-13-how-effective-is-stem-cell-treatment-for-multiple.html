<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The question is, **How effective is stem cell treatment for multiple<br>sclerosis?**<br><br>The actual answer is, we don't know. Currently, stem cell treatment<br>is experimental, and thus carries a great deal of risk.<br><br>As you've seen in some of the other answers here, there is anecdotal<br>evidence that treatment with adult stem cells may be effective. However,<br>it is important to note that this treatment is bleeding-edge and simply<br>hasn't been proven yet. We haven't even figured out *if* it is<br>effective; we're still years away from determining *how* effective it<br>might be.<br><br>I love this statement from the National MS Society (emphasis mine)<br>regarding the current state of stem cell therapy:<br><br>> *Many types of stem cells are being explored for their potential<br>> benefits for treating multiple sclerosis.* ***Only when the results of<br>> these and subsequent clinical trials are available will it be possible<br>> to determine what the optimal cells, delivery methods, safety and<br>> actual effectiveness of these current experimental therapies might be<br>> for people with MS.***<br>><br>> *Although cell based therapy has generated a great deal of interest<br>> and holds promise, the field is in its infancy and much more research<br>> is needed before cell based therapies become a MS treatment option.*<br>> \[1\](#wOthn){#cite-wOthn .citation_link}<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-wOthn){.citation_index} [[Stem Cells in<br>MS](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=bd0527&url=https://www.nationalmssociety.org/Research/Research-News-Progress/Stem-Cells-in-MS){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="nationalmssociety.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*This answer is not professional medical advice**, nor is it a<br>substitute for professional medical advice.
