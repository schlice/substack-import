<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I've answered this a few times already, but you're conflating two terms<br>which are actually very different: patriotism and nationalism.<br><br>> *Patriotism is fundamental to liberty because pride in one's<br>> nation-state, and a willingness to defend it if necessary, is the<br>> basis of national independence. Patriotism is the courage of national<br>> self-determination.*<br>><br>> *By contrast, nationalism is patriotism transformed into a sentiment<br>> of superiority and aggression toward other countries. Nationalism is<br>> the poisonous idea that one's country is superior to somebody else's.<br>> Nationalism is intrinsically a cause of war and<br>> imperialism.*\[1\](#YlbsP){#cite-YlbsP .citation_link}<br><br>*Patriotism* is a love of country. Patriotism is necessary because to be<br>proud of one's country is the basis for independence.<br><br>*Nationalism*, on the other hand, is patriotism run amok. Nationalism<br>stems from a belief that your system is not *better* than other systems,<br>but is *superior* to other systems, and deserves to be *forcibly<br>exported* to the rest of the world.<br><br>Patriotism causes freedom; nationalism causes wars.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-YlbsP){.citation_index} [[Nationalism vs.<br>patriotism](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=d8df08&url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/nationalism-vs-patriotism/2014/02/23/9129d43a-9afc-11e3-8112-52fdf646027b_story.html?utm_term%3D.cc0a2ffddf43){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="washingtonpost.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
