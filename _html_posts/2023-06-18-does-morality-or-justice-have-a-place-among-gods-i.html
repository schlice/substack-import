<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Let's start with morality and then move to justice.<br><br>You can answer the morality question all on your own, and you can do it<br>by answering just one question: from where do we get our morality?<br><br>For example, everyone just naturally knows that it's wrong to kill an<br>innocent person. We didn't have to be taught this, we just know it.<br>University of Texas at Austin professor J. Budziszewski writes,<br>"Everyone knows certain principles. There is no land where murder is<br>virtue and gratitude vice." C. S. Lewis, who has written profoundly on<br>this topic in his classic work *Mere Christianity* put it this way:<br>"Think of a country where people were admired for running away in<br>battle, or where a man felt proud of double-crossing all the people who<br>had been kindest to him. You might just as well try to imagine a country<br>where two and two made five."<br><br>In other words, a "shared morality" exists between people. So I ask<br>again: from where do we get this shared morality?<br><br>If you think we just naturally evolved, then this shared morality must<br>have come from evolution, the universe. But I fail to see how a<br>meaningless, purposeless, amoral universe could produce creatures (us)<br>who are full of shared morality and who strive for meaning and purpose<br>in their lives. That is a principle which makes no sense, and it<br>violates the Law of Causality, which says (among other things) that an<br>effect must resemble its cause.<br><br>If the universe (clearly) did not provide us with this shared morality,<br>the only other option is that we were created by Something other than<br>the universe, and that Something imbued us with a shared morality.<br><br>There are moral absolutes. And if you don't believe me, maybe we can<br>start treating *you* unfairly and we'll see how you like it. Your<br>reaction will reveal the Moral Law written on your heart.<br><br>\<br><br>Once you come to realize that a Moral Law exists, you understand that<br>the Moral Law is the unchanging basis for justice. Let me go back to C.<br>S. Lewis, who writes: "\As an atheist\ my argument against God was<br>that the universe seemed so cruel and unjust. But how had I got this<br>idea of just and unjust? A man does not call a line crooked unless he<br>has some idea of a straight line. What was I comparing this universe<br>with when I called it unjust?"<br><br>In other words, we can only detect *injustice* because we have an<br>unwavering, unchanging understanding of what *justice* is. You can't<br>know what is evil unless you know what is good. And you can't know what<br>is good unless there is an unchanging standard of goodness which exists<br>outside of yourself. Without that objective standard, any objection to<br>evil is nothing more than your personal opinion.<br><br>\<br><br>Therefore, morality and justice are neither natural phenomenon, nor are<br>they human creations. They are gifts from our Creator who is the one<br>unchanging standard of both morality and justice. He is the standard we<br>emulate, even if we don't recognize that the standard even exists.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
