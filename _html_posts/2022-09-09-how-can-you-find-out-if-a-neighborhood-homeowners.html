<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>It's actually pretty simple, and you can do it all from your PC.<br><br>Step 1: Find the name of the HOA.<br><br>If an HOA exists in an area, it will be noted on the property<br>information located on the county property assessor's website. Property<br>details are public record. So take an address from the neighborhood and<br>plug it in to the county's property assessor's website, and the detailed<br>listing for that property should give you the name of the HOA which<br>controls that neighborhood.<br><br>Step 2. Get info about the HOA<br><br>HOAs aren't "kid's clubs." They are 501(c)(4) non-profit corporations.<br>This means they all have actual corporate filing documents and bylaws<br>and articles of incorporation, which will all be on file with the state.<br>So your next stop will be the state licensing agency which handles<br>corporations within the state. Different agencies handle corporations in<br>each state, but most states seem to allocate that practice under the<br>Secretary of State's office. Regardless, find that office for that state<br>and you can do a record search, plugging in the name of the corporation<br>you learned in Step 1, and get all of its corporate information and<br>Governing Documents.<br><br>There you have it, you can now find HOA information for nearly any<br>neighborhood in the US.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>How can you find out if a neighborhood Homeowners Association (HOA)<br>exists?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
