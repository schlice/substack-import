<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Why are the police in the USA shooting dead, on average so far this<br>year (03/30/18), 3 people per day? Is anybody concerned about this? If<br>so what should be done?**<br><br>In order to be "concerned" about this, a few things would have to be<br>true:<br><br>- The people who are being shot by police were not posing a threat<br>- The number of people shot by police should be a significant number in<br>  comparison to the number of people not shot by police during<br>  police interaction with the public.<br><br>The vast majority of the roughly 1000 people a year shot by police<br>(roughly three per day) are literally shot when they are attacking<br>police. They are shot while they are holding deadly weapons. And they<br>are shot when an officer is in fear for his own life, in the same way<br>that any citizen can defend himself or herself when they are in fear for<br>their own lives, so the people who are shot are generally posing a<br>threat to the officer or to the general public.<br><br>There are literally *millions* of interactions between the police and<br>the public each year, and each year only roughly 1000 people are shot by<br>police, and most of those people were armed and/or threatening an<br>officer. 1000 out of *millions* of interactions is a frighteningly small<br>number that doesn't even move the needle. It tells me that if you are<br>*not* armed and threatening a police officer, your odds of being shot by<br>the police are, comparatively, exceedingly small.<br><br>Each police shooting is thoroughly investigated by three, possibly four<br>agencies: the department itself through its review boards to see if<br>department policy has been violated, the District Attorney's office<br>investigating to see if the officer committed a crime, a lawyer<br>representing the estate of the person killed investigating whether or<br>not the officer could be liable for wrongful death, and possibly the<br>Department of Justice investigating to see if the victim's civil rights<br>were violated. This is 200 to 300% more investigation done against a<br>police officer than a civilian, who is only investigated by the DA's<br>office and possibly a lawyer for the victim's family (but they may not<br>since most people don't have enough money to make such an investigation<br>and subsequent finding a monetarily viable proposition).<br><br>So is anyone concerned by this? Is anyone concerned that this is a<br>thing? Is anyone concerned that nothing is being done about this?<br><br>No.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
