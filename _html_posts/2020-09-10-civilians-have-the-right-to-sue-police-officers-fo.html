<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Civilians have the right to sue police officers for excessive use of<br>force?**<br><br>You cannot directly sue a police officer. Police are protected by what<br>is known as "qualified immunity" which allows them to do their jobs<br>without fear of being sued for doing so.<br><br>However, they have to do their job. If they act outside of their job,<br>they are no longer protected.<br><br>The law says that the police are allowed to use reasonable force to<br>subdue an individual, given the circumstances (a combative individual<br>will require more force to subdue). The courts have never explicitly<br>defined what constitutes excessive force, so it is analyzed on a case by<br>case basis.<br><br>The particular law in question here is the federal Civil Rights Act of<br>1871. Basically, it says that no person acting under the authority of<br>the law has the right to deprive a citizen of their civil rights under<br>the Constitution. So you can file a lawsuit in Federal court alleging<br>that your civil rights were violated. You must prove that the force was<br>excessive. The court will have to look at the details of the crime and<br>whether or not you posed a threat to the officers. It compares the<br>details of the crime and the response to what a "reasonable" police<br>officer would do.<br><br>If you feel that police force was excessive, you should talk to a civil<br>rights attorney, particularly one with experience in police misconduct.<br><br>\<br><br>*This answer is legal information, not legal advice. This answer is not<br>a substitute for professional legal advice, nor is it a solicitation to<br>offer professional legal advice. This answer does not create an<br>attorney-client relationship. This answer is for GENERAL INFORMATIONAL<br>PURPOSES ONLY. If you ignore this warning and convey confidential<br>information in a private message or comment, there is no duty to keep<br>that information confidential or to forego representation adverse to<br>your interests. Seek the advice of a licensed attorney in the<br>appropriate jurisdiction before taking any action that may affect your<br>rights. If you believe you have a claim against someone, consult an<br>attorney immediately, otherwise there is a risk that the time allotted<br>to bring your claim may expire.*<br><br>*Quora users who provide responses to legal questions are intended third<br>party beneficiaries under Quora\'s* [[*Terms of<br>Service*](https://www.quora.com/about/tos)]{.qlink_container}*.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
