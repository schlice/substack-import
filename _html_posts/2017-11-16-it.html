<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>In the United States, we didn't need a law against texting and driving.<br>We already have laws against distracted driving.<br><br>Legislators just wanted to be seen "doing something" about texting and<br>driving.<br><br>It's like if you have a law that says "do not enter this room" and then<br>you write another law that says, "do not skip into this room." Entering<br>the room is already illegal; how you enter the room is already covered.<br><br>So there really was no need for the texting and driving law in the first<br>place, which is what tends to confuse people about doing other things.<br>"Well it says I can't 'text and drive' but it doesn't say I can't 'read<br>e-mails and drive' or 'play Angry Birds and drive' so I can do those,<br>right?"<br><br>No, you can't. Distracted driving is already a moving violation in<br>almost every jurisdiction I'm aware of.<br><br>So in case you missed it by now, writing a letter while driving is<br>illegal as it is considered distracted driving.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
