<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**How were sodomy laws and other anti-gay laws previously constitutional<br>in the US if there was no reasonable secular justification for them?**<br><br>First of all, where do you get the idea that somehow you need secular<br>justification for a law? Many of our laws came directly out of our<br>Judeo-Christian foundation as a nation, and no one ever thought that was<br>an issue until someone raised the issue.<br><br>Sodomy laws were struck down *because* of religion, not *in defiance* of<br>it. The landmark decision was *Lawrence v. Texas*, which struck down a<br>Texas sodomy law, and thus invalidated sodomy laws in thirteen other<br>states. It did this not because there was no secular justification for<br>the law, but because the law violated the substantive due process clause<br>in the 14th Amendment, reaffirming that intimate consensual sexual<br>activity of any kind was indeed protected by the due process clause.<br><br>Wasn't it a clear violation of the separation of church/state?<br><br>Not even close.<br><br>The only thing that would be a violation of the 1st Amendment is if the<br>state mandated a religion, or if the state prevented the practice of a<br>religion. There is nothing at all unconstitutional about passing a law<br>that is based in part on a tenet of any one particular religion.<br>However, as was true in *Lawrence*, any law could potentially violate<br>due process, regardless of its original source or intent.<br><br>"Separation of church and state" is a concept, not a law.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
