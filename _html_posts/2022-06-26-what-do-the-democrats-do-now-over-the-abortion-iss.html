<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>They do exactly what they can do: *lobby for laws they agree with.*<br><br>The Supreme Court basically said there is no Constitutional right to an<br>abortion. That means that states can make laws either making abortion<br>legal, making it illegal, or something in between. You'll note that the<br>majority of states have done the last one (allowing some abortion, but<br>making it illegal after a certain time, and that time varies from state<br>to state).<br><br>So what can Democrats do now?<br><br>1.  **Work at the national level to pass nationwide abortion laws that<br>    make sense.** The last attempt at passing an abortion law was<br>    basically taking *Roe* and turning it into law: unfettered access to<br>    abortion until the baby is born. The majority of people don't want<br>    that. In fact, the majority of the people want some form of<br>    legalized abortion early in pregnancy, but understand that a growing<br>    fetus eventually has some rights and can't be arbitrarily killed<br>    after a certain point. So far from an "all or nothing" solution,<br>    most people support something in the middle.\<br>    \<br>    So Congress should work to pass a *sensible* abortion law. Something<br>    that guarantees that a woman can have an abortion at the beginning<br>    of her pregnancy, but protects the baby near the end of her<br>    pregnancy.<br>2.  **Work at the state level to pass state abortion laws that make<br>    sense**. Just as important as lobbying Congress, Democrats can work<br>    at the state level to pass reasonable abortion laws that mirror what<br>    is being suggested at the Federal level.<br>3.  Have real conversations with real people about real issues.<br>    Democrats tend to find the *emotion* in an issue instead of the<br>    *facts* in an issue. If the baby doesn't have a right to life, then<br>    explain why. Convince people, because people's opinions can now<br>    shape the laws in each state. So it's time to go back to Forensics<br>    and get some *convincing* arguments as to why your side is right.<br>4.  Work to amend the Constitution to add a right to abortion. If<br>    you truly believe that the right to an abortion is a natural right,<br>    then you should be focused on amending the Constitution to enshrine<br>    that right. Remember that *Roe* was overturned because the Court<br>    found no right to an abortion in the Constitution. So add one! You<br>    should easily be able to get 2/3 of Congress and 3/4 of the states<br>    to agree to an amendment if support is as widespread as your polls<br>    tell you it is.<br><br>Look, I'm pro-life, no exceptions. But here I am, **literally handing<br>you the playbook to codify abortion into law**. It's no secret. If you<br>want abortion to be legal, this is how you do it. You don't rely on the<br>Courts to create law for you. That's the job of elected legislators, not<br>unelected judges. And you can't fault the judges for fixing bad law,<br>just because you liked the outcome of the bad law. They don't look at<br>outcomes, only whether or not the law is good or bad. And the outcome of<br>the law doesn't make it good or bad, only whether or not it is<br>Constitutional.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
