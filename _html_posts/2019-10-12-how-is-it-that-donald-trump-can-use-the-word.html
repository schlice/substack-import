<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**How is it that Donald Trump can use the word \"bullshit\" to a crowd<br>in Bible Belt Louisiana and be greeted with cheers? How is this<br>acceptable in an American President?**<br><br>It seems you have a pretty high expectation of the person who holds the<br>office of the President. It seems you expect him (or her) to not only be<br>in charge of the Executive Branch, but somehow also be the moral and<br>spiritual leader of the free world.<br><br>News flash: he's not. The office of the President is an important<br>job, to be sure. But is he the moral leader of the country?<br><br>No, and he shouldn't be.<br><br>If you haven't noticed, Trump plays to his crowd. And if his crowd finds<br>that sort of tough talk acceptable, he'll use it. You should also know<br>that Trump knows his audience very well. He knows what his audience<br>would find acceptable, and he uses that.<br><br>And as we've said ever since 2015, Trump is a businessman, not a career<br>politician. He doesn't speak in the way you would expect a politician to<br>speak. He doesn't temper his words. He doesn't hold back either. He's a<br>brash, sometimes boorish New Yorker (I can say that as I am a former<br>brash, boorish New Yorker as well).<br><br>But you can't argue with results. And Trump delivers results.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
