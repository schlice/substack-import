<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Your therapist, as a matter of practice, is bound by doctor-patient<br>privilege. He is only obligated to report you to authorities if he<br>reasonably believes that you may be a danger to yourself or to others.<br><br>However, let's stop for a second. How did you get to your therapist's<br>office? I hope you took the bus, because if you drove your car, that's<br>DUI. If your therapist believes you might be a danger driving yourself<br>home, he can call the police, and that is not covered under<br>doctor-patient privilege.<br><br>I think he would probably spend more time talking to you about the fact<br>that you are stoned in the first place than looking for ways to report<br>you for being stoned in public.<br><br>I'd cancel my appointment and take the penalty for doing it within 24<br>hours if I wasn't bright enough to control my weed habit to such a<br>degree that I could make my appointments without being stoned.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
