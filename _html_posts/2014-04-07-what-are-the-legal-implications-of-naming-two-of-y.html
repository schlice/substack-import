<br/><br/>Answer<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content: [While there are many practical problems with doing so,<br/>legally there is no problem with naming your two children with exactly<br/>the same name. In the US, persons are identified using ***personally<br/>identifying information*** which includes name, Social Security Number,<br/>address, and birthday. Even if they are twins, they will have unique<br/>Social Security Numbers, so they will still be legally identifiable even<br/>if their names are identical.]<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content language: English<br/><br/><br/>
