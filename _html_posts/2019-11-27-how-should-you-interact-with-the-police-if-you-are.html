<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**How should you interact with the police if you are sure they are doing<br>something illegal?**<br><br>*DO EXACTLY WHAT THEY TELL YOU.*<br><br>***DO NOT INTERFERE WITH THEM! Think about it: if they're willing to<br>break the law, they're probably also willing to harm you!!!***<br><br>Once the interaction is concluded, call a criminal defense attorney<br>immediately. I know it's going to cost you money. Get out your credit<br>card.<br><br>I know other people are saying that you should escalate it through the<br>police chain of command. You absolutely should feel like you can do<br>this. However, if the police are doing something illegal, then relying<br>on them to police themselves probably isn't the route I would feel most<br>comfortable pursuing. It would behoove you to get representation who is<br>working directly for you, sooner rather than later. Evidence needs to be<br>collected while it is still fresh, and lawyers can help you, more than<br>the police will.<br><br>Get. A.
