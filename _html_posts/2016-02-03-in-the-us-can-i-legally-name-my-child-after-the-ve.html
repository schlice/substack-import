<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>In the US, you can name your child anything you choose. Vulgarity and<br>public decency standards do apply, but other than that, you can name<br>your child whatever you choose.<br><br>However, I might submit to you the following:<br><br>It\'s not necessarily whether or not you *can*, it\'s whether or not<br>you *should.*<br><br>Do you remember the song, \"A Boy Named Sue\"? I would request that you<br>look up the song, or at least look up the lyrics. You\'ll have to<br>understand what sort of psychological trauma you might be inflicting you<br>your child by your choice of name.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
