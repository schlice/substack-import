<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>> Why does Christianity God make salvation hard?<br><br>HARD? What are you talking about? If you believe that it is hard to be<br>saved, you don't know what it takes to be saved. Being saved is as easy<br>as falling off a log.<br><br>What *IS* hard is *changing how you live* ***once you've been<br>saved.*** Saved people don't act like those who aren't saved. You may<br>have to change your lifestyle. You may have to change your habits. You<br>may have to change your friend groups. All of those lifestyle changes<br>may be difficult because of inertia. It's potentially hard to have to<br>upend your life to live as a saved person lives.<br><br>In other words, **salvation may be free, but it could cost you your<br>life.**<br><br>> **How can you know Jesus resurrected died for your sins is God and<br>> exists when he\'s invisible?**<br><br>Jesus was definitely not invisible when He was here on earth. In fact,<br>after He was resurrected, He physically appeared to over 500 people<br>before He was assumed into Heaven.<br><br>And I don't understand why "being invisible" is a barrier for you. You<br>believe in plenty of things which are invisible. Here's just one<br>example: I'll show you God when you can show me the wind. You may say,<br>"Just look at the trees moving! Just feel the wind on your face!" No,<br>those are *results* of the wind. Show me the actual wind. You can't<br>do it. You know it exists. You can see its effects. You can feel it on<br>your face. But it's invisible. Nevertheless, you are quite rational to<br>believe it exists.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
