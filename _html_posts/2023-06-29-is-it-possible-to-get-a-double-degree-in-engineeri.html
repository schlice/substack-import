<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Probably not. You could double major in an engineering discipline and<br>then in another STEM field, but you probably wouldn't have the time in<br>your schedule to double-major in two engineering disciplines.<br><br>One of my classmates in my graduating squadron double majored in<br>Astronautical Engineering and Math. So I know that it is possible to do<br>it, but I just don't think you have enough time in the schedule to cram<br>two engineering disciplines in, with all of the other Academy<br>commitments on your time.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
