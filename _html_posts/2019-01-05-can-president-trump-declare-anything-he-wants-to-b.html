Are there any limits to his power<br>in declaring a national emergency?**<br><br>Everyone here is correct, the President cannot spend money that has been<br>obligated somewhere else. This would be patently illegal.<br><br>However, if the President does declare a national emergency at the<br>border, he has another option. He can spend "un-obligated money" which<br>is present in the Department of Defense budget, because the law allows<br>the military to fund construction projects during war or emergencies.<br>Title 10 USC gives the military the authority to fund border barrier<br>projects under certain circumstances.<br><br>You can be certain that the President would face a legal challenge, as<br>has every step he has taken since the day he entered office. But if he<br>can justify his declaration of national emergency, it's likely that he<br>can use DoD money.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
