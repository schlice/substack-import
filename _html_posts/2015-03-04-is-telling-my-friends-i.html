<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Let me repeat what I think I read so you can see if I<br>understand you correctly.\<br>\<br>You see notifications in Facebook that your friends are using a<br>particular app, and you\'re wondering about the privacy violations that<br>the app is committing on your friend\'s behalf.\<br>\<br>When you install an app, you have the option to \"connect it to<br>Facebook.\" *This is the opt-in*. Once you have completed the OAuth<br>login, Facebook tells you what the app wants to do. First, it tells you<br>what kind of information it wants from your Facebook profile (i.e. your<br>name, your birthday, your friend list, etc), and you have the option to<br>approve/disapprove that interaction with your profile. Then, Facebook<br>will ask you about what the app wants to do with your timeline (i.e.<br>Facebook would like to post on your behalf). Generally, when it says<br>this, it means that using the app, you will be able to share items<br>directly to Facebook, but in order to allow that, Facebook has to allow<br>the app to post for you.\<br>\<br>So in this way (OAuth, approving your personal account access, and<br>approving the interaction with your timeline), you have given the app<br>*carte blanche* to post whatever relevant information it wants to your<br>Facebook timeline, including to let all your friends know what kind of<br>cool new app you are using.\<br>\<br>Just clicking \"yes\" to User Agreements without reading them and<br>understanding what\'s in them will lead you to ask questions like \"why<br>is App X invading my friend\'s privacy\" when all the while your friend<br>actually allowed the app to post to Facebook (three times, to be<br>precise).]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
