<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Are you shocked that the Trump administration won\'t meet the deadline<br>to reunite migrant children with their families?**<br><br>Of course not. It wasn't an administration official who set the<br>timeline. It wasn't even an administration official who came up with the<br>timeline. It was a judge. A judge who clearly either a) has no idea how<br>much time it takes to move a child into safe housing, thus how much time<br>it would take to undo that process, or b) doesn't care. Maybe c) both a<br>and b.<br><br>So, shocking? Nah. What's *really* shocking is that this was a thing<br>in the first place. It's shocking that no one was screaming about the<br>injustice when the Obama administration was doing the **exact. same.<br>thing.** with kids who came into this country. He threw them on buses<br>and planes and shipped them off to foster homes all over the country.<br>And these were kids who came into the country illegally, with someone<br>who was not their parent.<br><br>It's shocking that no one cares that it was during the Obama<br>administration that the law was reviewed by the 9th Circus that **forced<br>ICE to separate parents from children in the first place!** The<br>proponents of the law said that it was *inhumane* to keep kids in<br>incarceration. They called it child abuse.<br><br>It's shocking that people are so oblivious to the obviously manufactured<br>media kerfuffle that wasn't a thing until the media made it a thing, and<br>even well before then, when it was still actually a thing, because the<br>media didn't report on it, it wasn't a thing to the average American.<br><br>It's shocking that people don't care when mainstream politicians call<br>for the abolishment of a Federal administration office. They'd never<br>think twice to rail against abolishment of the FCC, or the EPA, or the<br>Department of Education. But ICE? Which actually protects you and<br>actually protects the actual border from actual criminals and<br>terrorists? Yeah, who needs that nonsense? They'd abolish all law<br>enforcement in this country if they could get away with it, because it's<br>all corrupt, killing unarmed kids and unarmed blacks. Because racism.<br>Mmm hmm. Is it out there? I'm sure that it is. But does it constitute<br>the majority of law enforcement interaction? It doesn't even constitute<br>a simple majority of law enforcement interactions. It's so insignificant<br>it barely moves the needle.<br><br>Shocking? More like *status quo* from this nation's court system.<br><br>\<br><br>*By the way, I'm disabling comments on this one. Too much negativity by<br>too many ignorant people. I'm not willing to deal with it today.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
