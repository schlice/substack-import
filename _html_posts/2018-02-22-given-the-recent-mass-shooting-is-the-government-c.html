Once those are all repealed, then it's time to bury your guns,<br>because then and only then will the government be legally permitted to<br>start coming door-to-door to confiscate all the guns they can find.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
