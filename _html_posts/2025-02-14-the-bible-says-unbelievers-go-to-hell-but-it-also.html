<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>> **The Bible says unbelievers go to hell but it also says every knee<br>> will eventually confess to god and that he is all loving?**<br><br>All three of those things can be true at the same time, because none of<br>them are in conflict:<br><br>- Unbelievers will go to hell. Unbelievers are people who know the truth<br>  and actively reject it.<br>- Every knee will bow, and every tongue will confess that Christ is Lord<br>  (Phillipians 2:10--11). Even those who did not believe will eventually<br>  believe. But if they do so unwillingly, they should not expect<br>  leniency.<br>- God is indeed infinitely loving. But He is also infinitely just, and<br>  He can be both at the same time. His commands are for our good<br>  (Jeremiah 29:11). It is perfectly loving to say that if you willingly<br>  violate His commands, you receive the due results of your actions. It<br>  would be patently unloving to have rules in place that you don't<br>  enforce.<br><br>> **So why do evangelicals still think they have a right to decide if<br>> people go to hell or not?**<br><br>"Evangelicals" do not decide if people go to hell or not. That's<br>entirely up to God.<br><br>That said, we can (and we are commanded to) point out things that<br>believers might be doing which is sinful. In fact, it would be<br>*unloving* to not point out sin in others for which they may not<br>have repented.<br><br>> Don't unbelievers have a chance?<br><br>People who are willfully ignorant have already had their shot. Indeed,<br>the Bible says that everyone knows about God through simply viewing His<br>creation, as well as what is written on their hearts<br><br>> *For his invisible attributes, namely, his eternal power and divine<br>> nature, have been clearly perceived, ever since the creation of the<br>> world, in the things that have been made. So they are without excuse.<br>> \-- Romans 1:20 ESV*<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>**The Bible says unbelievers go to hell but it also says every knee will<br>eventually confess to god and that he is all loving? So why do<br>evangelicals still think they have a right to decide if people go to<br>hell or not?
