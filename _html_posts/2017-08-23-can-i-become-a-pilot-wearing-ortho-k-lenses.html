<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The question is about becoming a pilot. I will address private pilots<br>and orthokeratology (Ortho-K), since it is a non-starter for military<br>service. Any condition corrected by Ortho-K is [[disqualifying for<br>military<br>service](https://www.quora.com/Is-eyesight-required-for-the-US-Army)]{.qlink_container}.<br><br>As far as the FAA is concerned, they have the following to say about<br>Ortho-K:<br><br>> Orthokeratology (Ortho-K) is the use of rigid gas-permeable contact<br>> lenses, normally worn only during sleep, to improve vision through<br>> reshaping of the cornea. It is used as an alternative to eyeglasses,<br>> refractive surgery, or for those who prefer not to wear contact lenses<br>> while awake. The correction is not permanent and visual acuity can<br>> regress while not wearing the Ortho-K lenses. There is no reasonable<br>> or reliable way to determine standards for the entire period the<br>> lenses are removed.<br>><br>> Therefore, to be found qualified, applicants who use Ortho-K lenses<br>> **must meet the applicable vision standard while wearing the Ortho-K<br>> lenses AND must wear the Ortho-K lenses while piloting aircraft**. The<br>> limitation must use Ortho-K lenses while performing pilot duties<br>> must be placed on the medical certificate. \[1\](#PeGvq){#cite-PeGvq<br>> .citation_link}<br><br>**TL;DR: You can become a pilot using Ortho-K lenses. The caveat: While<br>Ortho-K lenses are supposed to be worn at night, you will have to be<br>able to meet the vision standards while wearing Ortho-K lenses, AND you<br>will have to wear your lenses while you fly.**<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-PeGvq){.citation_index} [[Guide for Aviation Medical<br>Examiners](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=e86ab1&url=https://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/avs/offices/aam/ame/guide/app_process/exam_tech/et/31-34/ok/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="faa.gov"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
