What kind of testing should I expect? My nearest<br>neurologist is 40 miles away, will any of the tests require me to bring<br>a back up driver?**<br><br>Your GP can refer you to a neurologist because all the signs point to<br>MS, but it takes a neurologist to make a final diagnosis of MS. Your GP<br>can't make that diagnosis. So you haven't been diagnosed with MS yet;<br>you're suspected of having MS.<br><br>Regardless, your GP should have at least ordered you an MRI of your<br>brain (they should be able to do that without a neurologist). A<br>radiologist should read your MRI and will (or will not) indicate that<br>you show the signs of someone with MS.<br><br>Your neurologist will then order a series of blood tests to check for<br>any disease or condition which might cause white spots on an MRI. They<br>will do a full neurological workup and exam, including clinical history.<br>He may or may not order additional tests, such as a lumbar puncture<br>(otherwise known as a spinal tap). You might consider having a driver<br>when you go to your LP appointment (which won't be the same day as your<br>first neuro appointment). There are other tests that can be ordered,<br>such as a visual evoked potential test. All of these exams contribute to<br>the body of evidence which can be used to diagnose MS.<br><br>MS is a complex disease and requires a great deal of research before<br>coming to a definitive diagnosis. But medicine is progressing at a<br>breakneck speed. We are making significant progress. Take heart; even if<br>you do have MS, there are some excellent treatment options.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
