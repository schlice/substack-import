<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Since Congressional action is needed to protect our election<br>integrity, isn't the President's full cooperation needed to do so? Isn't<br>then his feuding with them, in itself, Obstruction?**<br><br>Let's start with your first claim: **Congressional action is needed to<br>protect our election integrity.**<br><br>Do you have any evidence to support this claim? Also, elections take<br>place at the state level, not the national level. It is incumbent upon<br>the states to secure their own elections, and to ensure the integrity of<br>the same. I am not entirely certain that Congressional action is needed.<br>Additionally, since states are unique (which is why the state is the<br>best government to enable a system of election), I also can't see what<br>national-level action can be implemented that wouldn't violate the<br>Constitution. The 10th Amendment says essentially that if the<br>Constitution doesn't allow the federal government to do something, that<br>something belongs to the states and to the people, respectively, to do.<br>This means that since the Constitution doesn't call for the Federal<br>government controlling elections across the states, then elections are a<br>state responsibility. So not only does it seem improper for the federal<br>government to step in, it also seems unconstitutionally broad for them<br>to do so as well.<br><br>Now the second claim (and your first question): **Isn't the President's<br>full cooperation needed to do so?**<br><br>Is the President's cooperation needed to pass a law? Yes, it is. If the<br>President disagrees with a law, he vetoes it. This is an indication that<br>he does not agree with the law becoming a law, and Constitutionally,<br>this is part of the process. The President is authorized to disagree<br>with Congress about the implementation of a law. Therefore, in order to<br>*pass* a law, the President's full cooperation is needed. In order to<br>*block* the passage of a law, the President must disagree with Congress.<br><br>Which should lead us to the answer to your second question: **Isn't then<br>his feuding with them, in itself, Obstruction?**<br><br>No, it is not. It is the normal functioning of government. The President<br>would disagree with Congress naturally, but the President disagreeing<br>with Congress does not prevent Congress from passing a bill on to the<br>President's desk for signature. No amount of "feuding" actually<br>obstructs Congress' ability to do their job and get a bill to the<br>President's desk for signature. Whether or not he disagrees is not<br>relevant. He can "feud" with Congress all he likes; this does not<br>prevent Congress from doing its job.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
