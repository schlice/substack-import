<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>You don't really have to worry about the details, because you can't do<br>it without an attorney's help. The attorney will take care of the<br>specifics.<br><br>The laws are different in every state, but there are some things which<br>are universal. First and foremost, a vote for dissolution will need to<br>be done. The entire HOA will need to vote, and in most states, you need<br>no less than 80% of the owners to approve the dissolution. Some states<br>may have less (like a simple majority or 60%) and some states may<br>require more. Remember that because dissolving an HOA will have to be<br>placed to a vote, if the vote fails, you may be inciting further<br>division among the residents.<br><br>Additionally, most HOAs are actually 501(c)(4) non-profit corporations<br>which are governed by state laws for corporations. There are separate<br>dissolution requirements for them as well. Your attorney will help you<br>with those as well.<br><br>Some of the things which will need to be resolved prior to the HOA<br>dissolving:<br><br>- Ownership of common property. Someone will have to be ceded ownership<br>  of any of the common property the HOA used to own. The property will<br>  either need to be gifted or sold to the new owners. Utilities and<br>  deeds will need to be transferred and re-filed. In the case of water<br>  systems (i.e. sprinklers in common areas), plumbing changes may need<br>  to be made to tie in previously separate systems.<br>- Along with changing the ownership of the common property comes changes<br>  to the insurance coverage on the property.<br>- The former duties of the HOA will have to be taken on by someone. This<br>  includes common area maintenance and facilities management.<br>- Every condo owner's deed is going to have to be amended and re-filed<br>  to show that there is no longer a condo association. This will require<br>  signatures of 100% of the condo owners.<br>- The HOA will need to resolve any outstanding debts before it is<br>  closed.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
