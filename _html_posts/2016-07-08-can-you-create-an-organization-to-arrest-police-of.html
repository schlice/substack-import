It's called the police.<br><br>I know what you're thinking. *The police will never arrest a police<br>officer.*<br><br>[Wrong(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=8ede7f&url=http://www.wbrz.com/news/police-officers-arrested-for-shooting-killing-6-year-old/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wbrz.com"}]{.qlink_container}.<br>[Happens(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=c3300e&url=http://www.denverpost.com/2016/06/02/ault-police-officer-arrested-fatal-road-rage-collision/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="denverpost.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br>[all(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=8f6303&url=http://www.al.com/news/index.ssf/2016/06/alabama_police_officer_arreste_1.html){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="al.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br>[the(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=cc2e29&url=http://www.koaa.com/story/29645966/cspd-officer-arrested){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="koaa.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br>[time(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=c7cee2&url=http://www.csindy.com/coloradosprings/cops-busted-for-perjury-theft/Content?oid%3D1111023){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="csindy.com"}]{.qlink_container}. If a police officer has<br>committed a crime, he goes to jail. Don't forget, police are under twice<br>or three times the scrutiny that civilians are under when they fire<br>their weapons. Not only is the district attorney investigating (just as<br>a civilian), but the police run their own internal investigation to<br>ensure the officer followed all department regulations and guidelines,<br>that his training was up to date, and that he didn't violate any<br>department policy. There could also be a third investigation by the US<br>Justice Department to ensure that there were no civil rights violations.<br><br>But to clarify your statement, police don't get arrested if they are<br>wrong. Actually, police are protected from honest mistakes by the law.<br>If they make honest mistakes of fact, fully believing they were<br>following the law and their department's policies, they are legally<br>indemnified against lawsuits.<br><br>Police get arrested if they break the law, just like anyone else.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
