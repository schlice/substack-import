It's because you don't know the difference between proof and<br>evidence.<br><br>There is indeed a great amount of evidence which proves that the<br>universe had a beginning, life on this planet had an intelligent cause,<br>and that the set of circumstances by which the universe and we came into<br>existence are best explained by the existence of an intelligent creator<br>rather than by random chance.<br><br>Proof is something different altogether. Evidence exists, but whether it<br>rises to the level of *proof* for you depends on whether you believe the<br>evidence leaves any *reasonable* doubt. I believe the evidence<br>suggests *beyond a reasonable doubt* the work of an intelligent<br>creator. You may not believe this.<br><br>The truth is that *this is by design*. The existence of free will proves<br>that we can both look at the same body of evidence and rationally<br>conclude that it either does or does not meet our burden of<br>proof.<br><br>But whether we believe it to be proof is on us, not on the<br>evidence. The evidence is what it is. If you choose to believe the<br>proposition which has less evidence behind it, you are indeed free<br>to do so. But if you actually examine the available evidence, you will<br>find that there is abundant evidence to show that the universe and<br>everything in it was created by an intelligent creator, and the idea<br>that the universe randomly sprang into existence out of sheer chance has<br>shockingly little actual evidence behind it.<br><br>By the way, that gap between what we can glean through evidence and what<br>we consider proof is what we call *faith*. The less evidence we<br>have, the more faith we need to reach proof.<br><br>Therefore, the position that the universe randomly sprang into existence<br>without a cause, the position which has shockingly little evidence to<br>support it, requires more faith to believe.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
