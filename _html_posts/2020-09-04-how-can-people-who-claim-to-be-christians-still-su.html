If your children exhibited<br>the behavior that he does wouldn't you correct them?**<br><br>I presume you want me to say something like "As a Christian, I am<br>appalled at Trump's bombastic behavior. It's so un-Christianlike! I<br>simply cannot support such a boorish man."<br><br>Sorry, not in this answer.<br><br>I am not responsible for Trump's behavior. There are plenty of things I<br>wish he would do differently, but Trump is Trump, and Trump's gonna<br>Trump.<br><br>I am only responsible for my childrens' behaviors. I tell them that the<br>President has a tough job and sometimes he gets angry, just like I do.<br>Sometimes, he doesn't choose his words carefully, just like I do. The<br>bottom line is that *he is the President, not the Pope.*<br><br>He is the political leader of the country, not the moral leader<br>of the country. Nor should he be. People should be free to build up<br>their childrens' morals and ethics as they see fit. Many people may<br>choose to use Christian morality (found in the Bible) to do this; others<br>will not. All of that is perfectly okay.<br><br>I do not think myself so noble that I must withhold support of the<br>President because he doesn't act the way I'd like him to. He is human,<br>plain and simple. If I was looking for a spiritual leader to give me my<br>ethical roadmap (even if I didn't have one already), I wouldn't be<br>looking to the White House.<br><br>The reason why a Christian can still support the President when he acts<br>in a decidedly un-Christianlike manner is that **Christians do not love<br>based on others' actions**. We are all sinners and have all fallen short<br>of the grace of God. I am no better than Trump in that regard.<br><br>But God loves us all the same. He sent his son to take on human form and<br>*die*. For us. So that we could be made right with him. He did that for<br>all of us. Trump included.<br><br>So I know that even in Trump's imperfection, God still loves every one<br>of us.<br><br>> *But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still<br>> sinners, Christ died for us.*<br>><br>> ---Romans 5:8 NIV<br><br>Use Trump as a teaching opportunity. Teach your children not to judge<br>others, despite what they say or do. Judgement is up to God. Our job is<br>to love God and love our neighbors as we love ourselves. Let God take<br>care of God's job.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
