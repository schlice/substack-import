<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I\'m going to buck the trend, I guess.<br><br>**No one should ever be held criminally responsible other than the<br>criminal, and anyone else who commits the crime with them, for<br>committing a crime.**<br><br>If your area has safe storage laws, parents can be held responsible if<br>they fail to follow those.<br><br>Parents might also be held liable for a neglect charge, or something<br>similar.<br><br>But holding a party criminally responsible when they did not participate<br>in, know about, or otherwise knowingly facilitate the crime in question?<br>No.<br><br>If you want such a law, first you have to pass safe storage laws (and<br>deal with the Constitutional issues around that) and then make it a<br>crime to violate that law. Then you can charge them with reckless<br>endangerment or something like that, too.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
