<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>This reminds me of a story.<br><br>Two hunters were walking through African hunting lands when they<br>stumbled on a den of lions. As the females slowly stretched standing up,<br>eyeing their next meal, one hunter casually knelt down and untied his<br>shoes, taking a pair of running shoes out of his backpack.<br><br>His companion was incredulous. "What are you doing??? You can't outrun a<br>*lion!*"<br><br>The first hunter replied, "I don't have to outrun a lion. I only have to<br>outrun *you.*"<br><br>You don't have to make your home a fortress to stop a burglar. You just<br>have to make your home *less of a desirable target than your neighbor's<br>homes.* And what makes a home desirable for a burglar? Darkness and<br>concealment.<br><br>To do that, employ a "defense in depth" strategy. To wit:<br><br>1.  Keep your exterior lights on all night. Seems like a bit of a<br>    waste until you realize that LED lights are *extremely* energy<br>    efficient. You can run all of them from dusk till dawn for less than<br>    the cost of running a single 40-watt incandescent bulb. You can get<br>    a "dusk to dawn" timer which replaces your switch for your outdoor<br>    lights for less than \$20.<br>2.  Remove camouflage from around your windows. Trim back shrubs, or<br>    plant thorny rose bushes beneath windows, so that the windows remain<br>    exposed.<br>3.  Get a dog. Or if you're not a dog person, you can get some very<br>    realistic-sounding dog bark simulator devices on Amazon which listen<br>    for noise and then start a dog bark sound. Burglars are not<br>    interested in messing with a dog in a well-lit house where they have<br>    to work out in the open.<br><br>TL;DR: The best way to stop burglars from robbing your home is to<br>make your house less desirable to burglars than your neighbor's house.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
