<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Why do pro-Trump supporters think that Congressional oversight does<br>not apply to him?**<br><br>Because unless that oversight is directly related to drafting or<br>improving a law or ensuring laws are being executed as written, then<br>direct Congressional oversight does not apply to him.<br><br>Congressional oversight is a tool which is specifically designed to<br>allow Congress to evaluate the effectiveness of the laws they write, so<br>that they can improve their laws, or maybe even write better laws. They<br>can also ensure that laws are being executed in the way in which they<br>intended, and if they are not, the laws can be amended, or new laws can<br>be written. For example, if Congress believes an agency is not operating<br>in accordance with its original mandate, it can pass a law to "refocus"<br>that agency on the principles upon which it was originally established.<br><br>There is nothing in the Constitution that allows Congress to oversee<br>Federal agencies. It is an *implied* power rather than a enumerated<br>power. But in all cases, it has to do specifically with laws written,<br>and how efficiently or effectively Federal agencies are implementing the<br>law.<br><br>Oversight entails a number of overlapping objectives:<br><br>> - improve the efficiency, economy, and effectiveness of governmental<br>>   operations;<br>> - evaluate programs and performance;<br>> - detect and prevent poor administration, waste, abuse, arbitrary and<br>>   capricious behavior, or illegal and unconstitutional conduct;<br>> - protect civil liberties and constitutional rights;<br>> - inform the general public and ensure that executive policies reflect<br>>   the public interest;<br>> - gather information to develop new legislative proposals or to amend<br>>   existing statutes;<br>> - ensure administrative compliance with legislative intent; and<br>> - prevent executive encroachment on legislative authority and<br>>   prerogatives.\[1\](#mMoQo){#cite-mMoQo .citation_link}<br><br>Notice that all of these reasons why Congress has oversight authority<br>over the Executive are all rooted in *legislation*. The ultimate reason<br>why Congress watches the Executive is to ensure that their laws are<br>being carried out as effectively and efficiently as possible.<br><br>Congress writes laws. Congress does not investigate crimes.<br><br>If Congress believes a crime was committed, it is incumbent on Congress<br>to report this information to the judiciary, or to the Attorney General.<br>They would normally report this information to the Court of Appeals for<br>the DC Circuit, or directly to the Attorney General's office and the<br>Department of Justice. The AG can then engage the FBI to investigate the<br>allegation. They can also engage the Inspector General's office in the<br>particular agency in which the alleged crime was discovered.<br><br>***But Congressional oversight is not about searching for crimes. That's<br>literally not their job.***<br><br>The only other Constitutional remedy Congress has if they believe an<br>appointed Federal official is committing crimes is impeachment. The<br>House Judiciary Committee is well within its authority to draft a<br>resolution to open an impeachment inquiry. That they have not done this<br>smacks of political dinner theater rather than actual Congressional<br>authority to oversee the legislative process.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-mMoQo){.citation_index} [[Congressional oversight -<br>Wikipedia](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=27dc8b&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congressional_oversight){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
