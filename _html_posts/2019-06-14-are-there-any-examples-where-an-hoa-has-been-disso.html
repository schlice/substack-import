The<br>only reason I could see an HOA dissolved without the consent of all of<br>the members is if the HOA was fraudulently formed.<br><br>If an HOA is doing something not in accordance with its own bylaws, the<br>remedy is a lawsuit. The directors would probably be removed, and could<br>face charges of their own, especially if they were knowingly violating<br>the bylaws.<br><br>The only way to dissolve an HOA is with the consent of the members. It<br>varies by state what percentage of the signing members must consent, but<br>it's somewhere between 75 and 100%, depending on state. There are other<br>factors to consider: contracts which need to be re-written or dissolved,<br>community property which must be disposed of, watering bills which need<br>to be paid by someone, insurance policies on common areas which must be<br>owned by someone, etc. A real estate attorney must do this work.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
