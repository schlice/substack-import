<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Wow, lots of questions here. Let's see if we can do this a step at a<br>time.<br><br>> How do police officers know the exact law when issuing a ticket? Do<br>> they truly memorize that speeding is page 50 paragraph 25 section 12?<br><br>If you issued that many tickets every single day for the same<br>infraction, you'd have it memorized, too.<br><br>> What happens if they get the reference wrong?<br><br>The court will allow the prosecutor to amend the ticket to correct the<br>error. They won't throw the ticket out because of a clerical error.<br>That's a myth.<br><br>> Can I demand to see the book they\'re referring to before signing?<br><br>Nope. They are under no obligation to show you any of that. They would<br>be under obligation to show the *judge* in traffic court, but not you.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>How do police officers know the exact law when issuing a ticket?
