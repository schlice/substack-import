<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Is this White House \"order\" legal? The WH \"order\" is that a key<br>executive branch witness may not testify before Congress when subpoenaed<br>during the evidence-gathering phase of the impeachment process.**<br><br>Yes, it is legal. But a court may rule that they must testify anyway.<br><br>In order to frame this discussion properly, you must understand that we<br>have three co-equal branches of government. This means that no one<br>branch is any more powerful than the others. No one branch holds more<br>power over one than another.<br><br>So when the White House exerts *executive privilege* to protect<br>privileged information, it is not doing so in order to spite the<br>Congress, or in direct violation of a Congressional order. It is instead<br>asserting that it has a privilege which it is legally authorized to<br>protect.<br><br>At this point, it is up to Congress to petition the court to enforce the<br>subpoena. The court will determine if Congress has the right to the<br>information over the objection of the Executive, which is claiming<br>privilege over the information.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
