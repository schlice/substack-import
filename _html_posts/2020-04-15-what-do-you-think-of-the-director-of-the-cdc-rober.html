Nope, just an<br>announcement that we're not going to continue to donate to a charity<br>organization which is affirmatively trying to hurt us, or is at best<br>ambivalent to our circumstances.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
