<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>One of the things Fox has done effectively is to separate their two<br>programming branches: opinion programming and news programming.<br>The other networks haven't even attempted to do this.<br><br>What Fox has *not* done well is to distinguish the two to their viewers.<br><br>I would like to see Fox improve this. I would like to see them change<br>their scroll somehow, to indicate that the currently airing program is<br>coming from the Opinion Programming department or from the News<br>Programming department. While they do an admirable job keeping the two<br>separate, they do not do a very good job at identifying which<br>programming department is currently airing a segment.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
