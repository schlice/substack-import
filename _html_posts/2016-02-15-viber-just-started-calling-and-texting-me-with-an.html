The system will then send<br>you a SMS message with a confirmation code you must enter back in the<br>site. This closes the loop, ensuring the number is correct, and ensuring<br>someone is not trying to sign you up for something without your<br>knowledge. It\'s a security feature.<br><br>Looks like in this case, someone was trying to sign themselves up and<br>they mis-typed their phone number. The mistype ended up being your<br>number.<br><br>It is safe to ignore those messages.<br><br>When the person discovers that he is not getting his SMS message, he<br>will check his information and discover his error.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
