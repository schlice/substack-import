<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>This has happened twice to me. Slightly different each time, but the<br>location and time of day was the same.<br><br>I was driving to work at 4:15 AM on the Interstate. It was literally the<br>middle of the night and there was no one on the road. I was even sorta<br>half asleep, driving on autopilot as I have done so many days before.<br><br>I was exceeding the speed limit by a bit.<br><br>To be fair, the speed limit was artificially low through that section of<br>interstate, and to prove that, it has since been raised. But it was<br>still lower (by about 15 miles an hour) than I was going.<br><br>The officer decided to have a little fun with me rather than just<br>flashing his lights.<br><br>My guess is that he was on one of the overpasses when he clocked me. He<br>came down the overpass with all of his lights off (even his headlights),<br>and passed me on my left at a much higher rate of speed than I was<br>travelling, and right about when he hit my blind spot, he turned on his<br>full light bar and his siren.<br><br>Scared. The. Crap. Out. Of. Me.<br><br>I literally jumped in my seat as he screamed past me and shut all his<br>lights off. He got off at the next exit, presumably to turn around and<br>go scare someone else. I'm sure he was absolutely rolling with laughter<br>after instantly raising my heart rate and my breathing rate.<br><br>Another early morning drive, probably a different officer. I was in the<br>right lane, again no one around but me. This officer approached in the<br>far left lane, flashed his light bar, hit his siren switch one time, and<br>then turned off his light bar and turned on his "alley light," which is<br>a white spotlight on the light bar which shines at a 90 degree angle<br>from the direction of the patrol car.<br><br>This was a clear statement: "YOU, who I'm now illuminating with a<br>spotlight, slow down."<br><br>I slowed down.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
