You cannot vote to recall your<br>member of Congress. Your best option is to not re-elect that person at<br>the next election. Work to ensure that someone else gets elected.<br>Remember that House members are elected every two years, and Senators<br>are elected every six years. There are no term limits.<br><br>Your state may have *recall* procedures for your *state* representative.<br>Voters in 19 states can recall elected officials at the state level.<br>Those states are Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Georgia, Idaho,<br>Illinois, Kansas, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, Nevada, New<br>Jersey, North Dakota, Oregon, Rhode Island, Washington, and Wisconsin.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
