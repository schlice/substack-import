<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>What are the best enlisted jobs in the United States Air Force?<br><br>No one can tell you what the best job is, because that's a matter of<br>opinion. Your opinion about what a "good" job and what a "bad" job are<br>depend mostly on you.<br><br>So instead of telling you what the "best" job (or what the "worst" job)<br>is, I'll instead tell you how to look for the "best" job for you.<br><br>Ask yourself some questions:<br><br>- Do you want a job where the skills you learn will transfer well to a<br>  civilian job? If so, then "fixing the turret on a tank" probably isn't<br>  the best job for you, but "fixing a jet engine" might be.<br>- Do you want a job that will be exciting and action-packed? All jobs<br>  have exciting aspects to them, but not all jobs will be constantly<br>  adrenaline-filled all the time. No one can live like that.<br><br>In short, it's up to you to decide what makes a good job and what makes<br>a bad job. And the simple existence of the phrase, "When life gives you<br>lemons, make lemonade" means that even if you get a "bad" job, you can<br>turn it into an opportunity for something useful and meaningful.<br><br>The Air Force is lots of people playing small parts to achieve a big<br>result; it's not these larger-than-life heroes doing Herculean things<br>all the time saving the world. It's the very essence of teamwork. Going<br>into it with the right attitude will also help you a lot.<br><br>Good luck!<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
