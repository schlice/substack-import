<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>No.<br><br>The simple answer is that guns exist, and they are Constitutionally<br>protected. Over 300 million of them exist in the United States.<br><br>The truth is that ***no amount of legislation or wishful thinking or<br>celebrity endorsements or "buyback programs" will ever make them go<br>away. Ever.***<br><br>Even the "successful" buyback program in Australia only took *at most*<br>1/3 of the nation's guns out of circulation. In the United States, that<br>would still leave over 200 million guns in the country.<br><br>If you read that bold sentence and said, "But we have to do *something*,<br>and something is better than nothing," well that's good. It's good to<br>want to do something.<br><br>*But blaming the car when a drunk driver runs down a family is simply<br>illogical.*<br><br>Additionally, we've tried to legislate things out of existence before.<br>Remember Prohibition? Did it get rid of alcohol? Also, in case you're<br>unaware, drugs are illegal. We have completely legislated drugs away, in<br>just the same way you'd like to legislate guns away. And yet, kids in<br>American high schools can buy drugs easier than they can buy lunch. So<br>you can see just how effective it is when you try to legislate your<br>problems away.<br><br>We need to focus on *why* people wish to take up guns in the first<br>place. Gun massacres occur because people are so upset about something<br>that they are prepared to kill over it, *and* they have mental issues<br>which lead them to believe that killing is not only morally justified,<br>but it will make their problem better rather than worse.<br><br>But that is much harder to accomplish, because it is a *societal*<br>problem. It's not something you can legislate away. It's much easier to<br>focus on the gun rather than the shooter.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
