<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [So you have no context in your question. Why should<br>creepypasta be outlawed? What laws it is breaking? Is it violating some<br>sort of ethical code? I\'m just confused.\<br>\<br>For those who don\'t know, \"creepypasta\" is an outgrowth of<br>\"copypasta\", which is phrases or text that is repeatedly copied and<br>re-posted on the Internet, except that these are wildly-undocumented,<br>scary stories meant to startle the reader/viewer.\<br>\<br>But from what I can tell, the only potential legal issues I see here are<br>the fact that the videos and text may be copyrighted and would require<br>the permission of the content owners before they could be re-posted, in<br>which case a DMCA \"takedown\" notice would be issued to the owners of<br>[creepypasta.com(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=aad98d&url=http://creepypasta.com){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="creepypasta.com"}]{.qlink_container}.\<br>\<br>Are you presuming that this content should not be shown to anyone?<br>Unfortunately in that case, the First Amendment protects the content, as<br>scary/gory as it may be.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
