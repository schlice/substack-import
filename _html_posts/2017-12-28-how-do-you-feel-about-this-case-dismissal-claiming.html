<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>It makes perfect sense. Only the injured party can bring suit, and<br>according to the judge:<br><br>> *As the only political branch with the power to consent to violations<br>> of the Foreign Emoluments Clause, Congress is the appropriate body to<br>> determine whether, and to what extent, Defendant's conduct unlawfully<br>> infringes on that power. If Congress determines that an infringement<br>> has occurred, it is up to Congress to decide whether to challenge or<br>> acquiesce to Defendant's conduct. As such, this case presents a<br>> non-justiciable political question.*<br><br>In other words, violations of the Emoluments Clause are political<br>questions for Congress to address, not legal questions for lawsuits to<br>address.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
