<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Is there anything I can do about my nieghbor parking his car in front<br>of my property? I have heard that the road is still concidered public<br>space and we don\'t have an HOA where I live, so I don\'t think I can do<br>anything. What do you think?**<br><br>You can do the neighborly thing and talk to your neighbor. Tell him why<br>it's so important that you have the opportunity to park in front of your<br>own property and ask that he show you the same courtesy.<br><br>Beyond that, there is nothing legal you can do. The road is owned by<br>your local government, and if they don't restrict on-street parking,<br>then anyone can park there.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
