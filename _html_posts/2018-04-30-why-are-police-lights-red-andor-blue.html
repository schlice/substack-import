<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Why does the police have red siren lights and blue siren lights?<br><br>In the United States, the colors of emergency vehicle lights is governed<br>by state law. Most states allow both red and blue lights on emergency<br>vehicles, while other states designate colors for certain functions<br>(i.e. red for police, blue for fire, green for ambulance, etc).<br><br>The colors tend to be historical in nature. When cars were first<br>produced, they were all black. Red vehicles were unheard of, so they<br>stood out very easily. Similarly, red flashing lights on a red vehicle<br>were very visible, as even lights on vehicles did not flash frequently.<br>A rotating light producing a flashing effect was added to emergency<br>vehicles to draw your attention to it, so that you can stay out of its<br>way. Most frequently, that light was red.<br><br>As cars advanced (and started to change color), the red color was<br>retained by most fire vehicles, but mostly through historical<br>preference. These days, emergency vehicles have been adopting other<br>colors which are not found on passenger cars, such as fluorescent<br>yellow.<br><br>[[Why are some fire trucks yellow and why are some<br>red?](https://www.quora.com/Why-are-some-fire-trucks-yellow-and-why-are-some-red)]{.qlink_container}<br><br>Blue was added to light bars along with red because studies have shown<br>that blue flashing lights are visible from greater distances than red<br>flashing lights. Additionally, white flashing lights are also highly<br>visible from distance. You will also notice that along with the light<br>bar, the vehicle high beams are wired to a "winker" switch. This<br>alternates the high beams from left to right, producing a very visible<br>strobe pattern.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
