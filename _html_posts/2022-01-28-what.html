<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>DNA.<br><br>DNA is a message. It's what we call *specified complexity.* DNA contains<br>the equivalent of 1,000 encyclopedias of specific information, **in the<br>smallest single-celled organism.**<br><br>Science has shown us that messages are only created by intelligence.<br>Messages are not created by random chemical interactions. Messages only<br>come from mind.<br><br>*If there is a message, there must be a message-giver.*<br><br>We know that human beings were intelligently designed.<br><br>We know that the universe was not the intelligent designer, because the<br>universe is not eternal. The universe had a beginning. Therefore, the<br>universe must have had a *beginner*, or someone to create it. Either the<br>universe is eternal and uncaused, or the universe had a beginning and a<br>cause. Can't be both. It's either/or.<br><br>Therefore, God must exist.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>What is your \'proof\' that a god exists?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
