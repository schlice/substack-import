<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [I was in a situation similar to<br>[I.L.Mitchell(https://www.quora.com/profile/I-L-Mitchell)]{.qlink_container}\'s<br>story: I was testing a radar detector with my dad (who was still active,<br>so I\'m not actually answering the question, sorry about that) on a<br>stretch of road that should have been, by all rights, completely<br>deserted at that time of year. It was November, and we were on Ocean<br>Parkway, just off of Jones and Tobay Beach. Those are the barrier<br>beaches on the south side of Long Island. The beaches were completely<br>deserted on that day, since it was cold and misty. We were testing a<br>radar detector as well as a new car I just got. Yes, it was a sports<br>car. Needless to say, we were exceeding the speed limit (by a lot). We<br>discovered that the car can go really fast and you\'d hardly feel it. We<br>also discovered (the hard way) that the radar detector (which my dad<br>bought second-hand) didn\'t work at all. The officer brought his<br>handheld RADAR gun out of the car and blasted it directly at the<br>detector, and it didn\'t wink at all. Completely worthless.\<br>\<br>The speed was way scarier than being pulled over.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
