<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>No one is individually responsible for protecting you but you.<br><br>The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment forbids the<br>government to deprive individuals of life, liberty, or property without<br>\"due process of law.\"<br><br>There have not been cases which "absolve the police of responsibility,"<br>but instead there have been cases that show that the Constitution does<br>not require the state to protect any individuals specifically. In 1989<br>the U.S. Supreme Court in *DeShaney v. Winnebago County Department of<br>Social Services (489 U.S. 189)* stated, \"Nothing in the language of the<br>Due Process Clause itself requires the State to protect the life,<br>liberty, and property of its citizens against invasion by private<br>actors.\" Generally, the Due Process Clause does not provide an<br>affirmative right to government aid, \"even where such aid may be<br>necessary to secure life, liberty, or property interests of which the<br>government itself may not deprive the individual.\"<br><br>There are some exceptions, especially where a special relationship<br>exists prior to the act, or where a "state-created danger" exists (i.e.<br>law enforcement left a person in a situation that was more dangerous<br>than the one they found him in).<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
