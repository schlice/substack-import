<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If US forces wanted to, could they takeout Syrian air defense<br>locations and then continue striking the country with higher<br>efficiency?**<br><br>*Of course* they can.<br><br>However, one of the tenets of this particular strike was that it was not<br>intended to be *utterly and completely destructive to all of Syria's<br>military.*<br><br>In other words, the strike was measured and precise.<br><br>We struck exactly what we wanted to strike: the laboratories and<br>factories which were producing chemical weapons, as well as some other<br>important targets. But we didn't strike *every* possible target we could<br>have.<br><br>The attack was designed to do a few things:<br><br>- Hamper Syria's ability to continue to produce chemical weapons<br>- Hamper Syria's ability to use chemical weapons against its own people<br>- Send a very strong message that the use of chemical weapons will not<br>  be tolerated.<br><br>There were some other considerations as well. Most importantly that<br>there were Russian military units at those air defense locations, and we<br>were careful to strike *Syria*, not *Russia* or Russian assets in Syria.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
