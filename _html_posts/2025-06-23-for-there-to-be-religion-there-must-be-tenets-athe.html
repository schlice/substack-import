title: '"For there to be religion, there must be tenets. Atheism has two. Does that
  make it a religion? The first is lack of belief in god (idolatry), G-d (monotheism),
  and gods (polytheism). The second is that atheism lacks a constitution for atheist
  action."'

<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>First of all, I dispute your very first statement: "for there to be<br>religion, there must be tenets."<br><br>Says who?<br><br>Where is there a universal determination of what constitutes a religion?<br>Because if "tenets" are the only requirement, then most businesses which<br>have mission and vision statements (which are indeed tenets of<br>operation) should also qualify as a religion.<br><br>So let's break down the comparison between atheism and theism (which we<br>all implicitly agree is a religion) and see if there are any<br>comparisons. Let's look at some defining characteristics of a theistic<br>religion and see if atheism (a specifically non-theistic practice) could<br>be considered a religion:<br><br>- Saints. Saints are people who were important leaders in their<br>  religion that have died but are remembered for their contributions.<br>  Atheism has these: Christopher Hitchens, Carl Sagan, David Hume, etc.<br>- Preachers. Preachers are people who stand on the stage and deliver<br>  a message to those with similar beliefs. Atheism has these: Richard<br>  Dawkins, Sam Harris, Matt Dillahunty, etc.<br>- Core texts. Core texts (which are sacred or holy in theistic<br>  religions) are books or literature written by man that claims to tell<br>  its readers important truths about their beliefs. Atheists most<br>  definitely have these: *The God Delusion, God is Not Great, The End of<br>  Faith,* etc*.*<br>- Blasphemy. Blasphemy would be acts or statements that are so<br>  offensive to their religion that they might cause emotion or anger in<br>  the listener. To see if blasphemy exists in atheism, try this: tell an<br>  atheist that God exists, and if the atheist is emotional or upset at<br>  hearing this, does that not imply the atheist feels he is being<br>  blasphemed against? Just wait for the comments section and you'll see<br>  what I mean by exposing blasphemy. Which leads me directly to...<br>- Apologetics. The definition of apologetics is "debate and<br>  argumentation that attempts to defend a religious belief against<br>  attack." There\'s a reason all the atheists are about to swarm the<br>  comments section: *to defend their religious beliefs*. If they truly<br>  believe in nothing (if they truly have a lack of belief in god), then<br>  there is no reason to defend nothing. Definitionally, "nothing" needs<br>  no defense, as it doesn't exist. A lack of belief does not need to be<br>  defended. Me blathering on about nothing shouldn't even be noteworthy.<br>  It should be nothing worth commenting on. So by responding, atheists,<br>  you are demonstrating the presence of something which is worthy of<br>  defense. And that can't be "nothing."<br>- Churches. Church is traditionally defined as a building (e.g. I<br>  went to church), but as was demonstrated during Covid, the church<br>  clearly identified that it is not a building, but a collection of<br>  like-minded people with similar beliefs. Do not atheists have this?<br>  American Atheists? Atheist Alliance International? Freedom From<br>  Religion Foundation? Do not these organizations meet periodically to<br>  discuss insights about their beliefs? Sounds a lot like a non-theistic<br>  church to me.<br><br>Also, atheists can have *degrees of belief* **just as theists<br>can.** Not all atheists follow atheism religiously, just as not all<br>theists follow theism religiously. For example, just as some Christians<br>might not go to church, listen to pastors, or know the Bible very well,<br>they can still be somewhat religious, or even not religious at all,<br>while still believing in the core philosophy of their religion. In fact,<br>people tell me all the time that they are Christian while either not<br>acting like a Christian, or *even while holding non-Christian beliefs.*<br>In precisely the same way, an atheist may not know anything about<br>important and influential atheist figures, or associate with atheist<br>organizations, or go out seeking to engage in debate or apologetics<br>about atheism, and still just hold a quiet and private belief that God<br>does not exist.<br><br>With this in mind, I'd say that for these reasons, atheism is indeed a<br>non-theistic religion.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
