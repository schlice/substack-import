<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I do appreciate your question, because it discusses the morality of law.<br><br>The question boils down to which came first: the morality or the law?<br><br>To that end: what is morality? The [[book<br>definition](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=e2c452&url=https://www.google.com/search?q%3Dmorality){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="google.com"}]{.qlink_container} is "principles concerning<br>the distinction between right and wrong or good and bad behavior. A<br>particular system of values and principles of conduct, especially one<br>held by a specified person or society." From where do you get your<br>morality? Depends on your frame of reference. If you believe in God,<br>your morality probably stems from your beliefs. In fact, a recent report<br>in *Psychology Today* concluded: \"The most significant predictor of a<br>person\'s moral behavior may be religious commitment. People who<br>consider themselves very religious were least likely to report deceiving<br>their friends, having extramarital affairs, cheating on their expenses<br>accounts, or even parking illegally.\" \[1\](#nUrje){#cite-nUrje<br>.citation_link}Ultimately, what this means is that if you believe in<br>God, it most likely has an effect on your thinking and your behavior. If<br>you don't believe in a God, or in any form of higher power, your only<br>moral code is the one your parents defined for you, or the one you<br>create for yourself. In the United States, since we don't have defined<br>or mandatory religious practices, you only have to follow the law, you<br>are free to create whatever moral code you choose.<br><br>However, since you are free to have your own moral code (and we don't<br>have a dictatorship), whose moral code is right?<br><br>Instead, we have laws. Laws, therefore, define a base level of morality<br>(don't kill, don't steal, leave your neighbor alone and they will leave<br>you alone). These are essentially "morals," but they are a minimum level<br>of morality which we as a society have defined in order to live<br>together. This was done over many hundreds of years; ours, in fact, come<br>from old western European traditions: the Magna Carta, writings from Sir<br>William Blackstone discussing "natural law," these things influenced the<br>founders greatly when defining a basic set of laws founded on the morals<br>of the time. Surprisingly, this set of basic morals codified into law<br>has changed little across the more than 200 years in which it has been<br>in place. By the way, this answers the optional question *what do you<br>think are the values on which the modern western concept of justice is<br>founded.*<br><br>So now, with that framework, let's answer your questions.<br><br>*Do we have a moral imperative to unconditionally observe certain<br>fundamental human rights?* The short answer is no. In a free society,<br>everyone is free to define their own moral code. *You* may have a<br>moral imperative which tells you to observe some fundamental (to you)<br>human rights, but do we as a society have an obligation to do the same?<br>As a society, we are only obligated to follow the law (which, as we<br>learned, is a function of morality, but is a base moral guideline for<br>all citizens to follow). We are under no obligation to follow any other<br>moral code other than our own. Your moral code may hold you to a higher<br>standard, but even if your morality says killing is acceptable, the law<br>does not. This is why the law defines a base level of morality that all<br>citizens must follow in order to live peacefully together.<br><br>Since I answered no, the next question is *what makes something<br>acceptable vs. criminal?* As we have determined, our base morality was<br>codified into law. Therefore, the only thing that makes something<br>criminal is the law. Morality does not make criminality. Only law can<br>make an act criminal. Criminality, therefore, is a legal definition, not<br>a moral one.<br><br>Hope this helps.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-nUrje){.citation_index}<br>[Morality(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=7d3e27&url=http://www.allaboutphilosophy.org/morality.htm){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="allaboutphilosophy.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
