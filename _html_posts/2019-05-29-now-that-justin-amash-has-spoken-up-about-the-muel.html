If<br>they don't, but they feel that enough evidence exists that a crime *may*<br>have been committed, they can pass a resolution opening up an<br>impeachment inquiry.<br><br>But they must act. It is time now for Congress to shit or get off the<br>pot.<br><br>Either file articles of impeachment, open an impeachment inquiry, or<br>leave it alone and stop "speaking up." You're Congress!<br><br>DO SOMETHING!<br><br>OR DON'T!<br><br>Either impeach the man, or get back to the business of passing laws.<br><br>But continuously "speaking up" does nothing.<br><br>*Do, or do not. There is no try. ---Yoda*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
