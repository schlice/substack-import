How you<br>do this:<br><br>- Establish and add funding methods to a PayPal account<br>- Select "Send Money"<br>- Enter the phone number of the person you wish to pay, and the amount<br>  of money you wish to pay.<br>- The person will get a text message inviting them to join PayPal in<br>  order to receive their money.<br><br>[[Send Money, Pay Online or Set Up a Merchant Account -<br>PayPal](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=f36c4d&url=https://www.paypal.com){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="paypal.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>\<br><br>I'm certain there are other ways to send money to someone simply with a<br>phone number, but PayPal is the one I know off the top of my head that<br>allows you to explicitly send money to someone with only a mobile phone<br>number.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
