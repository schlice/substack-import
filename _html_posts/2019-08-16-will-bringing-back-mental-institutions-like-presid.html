<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Will bringing back mental institutions like President Trump fix some<br>of the issues going on with the violence?**<br><br>It's a start.<br><br>But it needs to happen within the framework of a broader improvement<br>with how we handle mental illness in this country.<br><br>The push for deinstitutionalization was not centrally about closing<br>mental hospitals (although that was the hook they used to get people to<br>buy in to it). The push for deinstitutionalization was a belief that<br>*drugs can solve all mental problems*. Politicians along with<br>pharmaceutical manufacturers (gee, where have I heard *that* song<br>before) convinced people that mental institutions were no longer needed.<br>We could treat the vast majority of the mentally ill with drugs,<br>distributed in neighborhood clinics, not from large, cold mental<br>hospitals which are understaffed and abuse their charges.<br><br>This led to more than just deinstitutionalization. It led to a<br>de-emphasis on, and a stigmatization of, mental illness as a real issue.<br>It's just something you can pop a pill and manage; it's not a real<br>issue.<br><br>We need to re-focus on mental illness. We need continuing funding into<br>mental illness and how these medications actually work. There is much we<br>do not know, and yet we continue to "throw drugs" at the problem. Many<br>need help, but the nature of mental illness is such that it causes the<br>patient to believe that they are perfectly normal. Under our current<br>system, a person who really needs help can deny that help; they can't be<br>compelled to seek treatment unless they first bump into the legal system<br>and are declared "mentally defective." And yes, we do need vastly<br>improved facilities for mental illness treatment,<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
