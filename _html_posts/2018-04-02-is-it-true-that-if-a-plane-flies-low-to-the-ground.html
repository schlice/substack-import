<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Is it true that if a plane flies low to the ground, they won't be<br>visible on radar?**<br><br>Basically, yes.<br><br>Traditional ground-based radar is "line of sight," in that the curvature<br>of the earth allows aircraft to essentially be "under the radar" if they<br>are low to the ground. For reference, at 1,000 feet in flat terrain, the<br>lower radar horizon is at about 33 nautical miles away. So if an<br>aircraft is more than 33 nautical miles from the radar unit below 1,000<br>feet above ground level, he becomes invisible. The problem is<br>exacerbated with small aircraft which can fly very low to the ground<br>(between 100 and 500 feet off the ground) because their radar signature<br>blends in to the "scatter" or "noise" from the ground. Doppler radar has<br>somewhat overcome this problem, but not completely.<br><br>This, understandably, is a big problem along our southern border, where<br>drug smuggling aircraft will attempt to fly in at low altitude,<br>presumably "below the radar." To combat this, the US has deployed the<br>[[Tethered Aerostat Radar<br>System](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=e97d3e&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tethered_Aerostat_Radar_System){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container} along our southern<br>border. It is a system of aerostats with attached downward-looking<br>radar. This radar can see aircraft all the way to ground level.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
