<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Are non-pornographic naked child images considered child porn if they<br>are watched pornographically?**<br><br>The answer is no, but the full answer is more nuanced than this.<br><br>You can't make an image pornography when it is not. The definition of<br>child pornography is the depiction of sexually explicit conduct<br>involving a minor. The legal definition of "sexually explicit conduct"<br>does not require that an image depict a child engaging in sexual<br>activity. A picture of a naked child may constitute illegal child<br>pornography if it is "sufficiently sexually suggestive." Additionally,<br>the age of consent for sexual activity in a given state is irrelevant;<br>any depiction of a minor under 18 years of age engaging in sexually<br>explicit conduct is illegal.<br><br>Therefore, if an image of a naked child is "sufficiently sexually<br>suggestive," it is child pornography. Otherwise, it is not.<br><br>The frame of mind one uses when viewing a picture does not change the<br>fundamental nature of the picture. If a picture of a child is not<br>sufficiently sexually suggestive, it is not child pornography. How it is<br>viewed is irrelevant.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
