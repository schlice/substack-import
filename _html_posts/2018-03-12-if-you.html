<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If you're charged with a crime, is it always better to plead guilty<br>even if you are actually innocent?**<br><br>*Why would you voluntarily go to jail when you didn't do it?*<br><br>First of all, if you're charged with a crime, get a lawyer.<br><br>Then, depending on your case, do what your lawyer tells you to do.<br><br>The only time you would be pleading guilty is if you are involved in a<br>plea bargain (i.e. you agree to plead guilty in order to receive an<br>agreed-upon lighter sentence so that you can avoid a trial).<br><br>But on its own, pleading guilty to a crime comes with a whole host of<br>ramifications which follow that pleading. You will be labeled a "felon,"<br>and many of your Constitutional rights will be stripped from you. It<br>will become nearly impossible to get a good job, or to do simple things<br>like apply for a loan. Want to rent an apartment, or financing for a<br>car? Good luck. Filling out any official document becomes quite<br>difficult. Second, simply pleading guilty when you are not guilty is a<br>perversion of the justice system, and doesn't serve anyone's best<br>interest: the state, the accuser, nor the defendant.<br><br>Some people may do this anyway because they're "covering" for someone<br>else --- a family member, a child, etc. They choose to "take the<br>punishment" for someone else, so they claim they did it. When a<br>prosecutor gets an unsolicited, unexpected guilty plea, he's always<br>suspicious of these alternate reasons for such a plea. That's noble, but<br>it doesn't help anyone get to the bottom of the case. Yes, someone goes<br>to jail, but a) it's not the right person, and b) we never find out the<br>real reason for the crime. There are things which can be done if the<br>offender is a minor, or if there are extenuating circumstances.<br><br>Ideally, we want the *right* person to go to jail, not just *a* person.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
