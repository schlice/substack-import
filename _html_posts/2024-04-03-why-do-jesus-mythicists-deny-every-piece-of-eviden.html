<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Because no one can agree on what "evidence" is acceptable. The<br>"evidence" that is acceptable to some is completely useless to others.<br><br>So it's not about the evidence. It's about what evidence you would find<br>acceptable.<br><br>To check yourself, change the sentence thusly, and think about how you<br>would answer it:<br><br>> **Why do Alexander the Great mythicists deny every piece of evidence<br>> that a historical Alexander the Great existed?**<br><br>Then answer this question for yourself. Once you're done, look at the<br>evidence and ask yourself: *why is the evidence suitable for Alexander<br>the Great, but not for Jesus?*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
