<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**When Bloomberg says "What I have asked for... are background checks,<br>we shouldn't be selling guns to minors, to people with psychiatric<br>problems, or people with criminal records", do they not realize these<br>are laws already ?**<br><br>For the most part, yes. The problem is they equivocate on the details.<br>Let's review:<br><br>Minors: Um, we don't sell guns to minors. My guess is the<br>equivocation here is what you consider a *minor*. You're no longer a<br>minor at 18 in the United States. However, we do restrict handgun sales<br>to 21 or older. Perhaps they want to universally impose a 21 year old<br>age limit for all gun sales. Some states say this is a Second Amendment<br>violation, and other states are already doing this. These cases will<br>soon be coming to the SCOTUS, with more and more cities and states<br>restricting all firearms sales to those 21 and older.<br><br>Background checks: You do know that there are many places you can<br>buy guns without a background check, right? It's called *private sales*.<br>Now, obviously this is legal and it is how the system was designed, but<br>they don't like it. They feel like it's an *end run* around the<br>background check system. When they say they want "universal background<br>checks," what they are really asking for is the elimination of the<br>private sale exception.<br><br>However, to do that means to expand the NICS system and allow access to<br>anyone. But that opens up a whole new can of worms, not the least of<br>which is how to pay for such a massive NICS upgrade. But typically of<br>those who espouse this particular gun control measure, they're<br>relatively unconcerned with where the money to upgrade NICS will come<br>from. The other significant NICS-for-all speedbump is the privacy issue,<br>which gets even worse when we get to the next point:<br><br>People with psychiatric problems: I think we can all agree that we<br>don't want the criminally insane to be able to purchase firearms, and<br>currently they can't. However, they contend, most of the mass shooters<br>did not violate any current laws and, they argue, probably had mental<br>issues. Their issue is that we're not doing *enough*.<br><br>But that, of course, poses immense new problems, the elephant in the<br>room being *what constitutes a psychiatric problem*? I was diagnosed<br>with depression about 10 years back. I'm better now. Do I lose my gun<br>rights? What about veterans who require financial assistance? [[They've<br>already been denied gun<br>rights](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=333dc6&url=https://thehill.com/blogs/pundits-blog/defense/295484-va-is-restricting-veterans-gun-rights-without-due-process){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="thehill.com"}]{.qlink_container}! That's right, if you<br>requested fiduciary assistance from the VA, they are similarly claiming<br>that you are not mentally capable of owning a gun. The arbitrary and<br>capricious application of labels is a major concern, and without a major<br>overhaul of the mental health evaluation system in this country, will be<br>amazingly difficult to implement fairly. Also of note is the privacy<br>concerns mentioned in the first bullet. Health information is protected<br>by HIPAA. You can't publish that kind of thing in a database which is<br>open to the public, but we want people to be able to use NICS before<br>they engage in a private sale. This will require a complete overhaul of<br>NICS, from the ground up.<br><br>Illinois' FOID card system is not a bad way to go. You are investigated<br>once, and if you are allowed to own a firearm, you receive a card, with<br>a number. Any time a potential firearms sale is to occur, the card is<br>validated. A simple website where you enter the FOID card number and you<br>receive a YES or NO response based on your NICS eligibility is all you<br>need to confirm the purchaser is still valid. That transaction against<br>that FOID card would be logged, and you'd get a confirmation number.<br>Keeping the confirmation number along with the bill of sale would be all<br>that is necessary for record keeping (i.e. I saw the FOID card, I<br>confirmed it was valid, so I made the sale). Now you have universal<br>background checks, and they are divorced from the actual transaction of<br>the firearm. It will cost money to revamp the system and issue everyone<br>eligible a FOID card, but it can be done. Perhaps we could leverage the<br>Social Security Administration or at a local level, the DMV, to assist<br>with getting those cards issued.<br><br>People with criminal records: Today, violent felons lose their right<br>to firearms, but I guess that doesn't go far enough either. The<br>question, of course, is what exactly does this mean? Is it only violent<br>felonies? We have that today. Is it domestic violence? We also have that<br>today. Is it shoplifting? Is it jaywalking? What crimes, exactly, should<br>we restrict Constitutional rights once you commit them?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
