<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Can a legal expert tell my why you MUST give up your right to remain<br>silent to provide your name and date of birth when arrested? There is<br>nothing in the 5th Amendment about this.**<br><br>Actually, it is very clearly in the 5th Amendment.<br><br>Here's the whole thing, with the important bit highlighted:<br><br>> No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous<br>> crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury, except<br>> in cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in the Militia, when<br>> in actual service in time of War or public danger; nor shall any<br>> person be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of<br>> life or limb; **nor shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a<br>> witness against himself,** nor be deprived of life, liberty, or<br>> property, without due process of law; nor shall private property be<br>> taken for public use, without just compensation.<br><br>The important bit is "nor shall be compelled in any criminal case to be<br>a witness against himself\.\"<br><br>"Being a witness against yourself" basically is the definition of<br>"self-incrimination." You say something that proves your own guilt. For<br>example, if you revealed something that only someone at the scene of the<br>crime while it was being committed would know, it would prove that you<br>were present at the crime. Not answering based on the grounds that you<br>may become a witness against yourself, or "pleading the 5th," is exactly<br>that.<br><br>Positively identifying yourself (i.e. providing your real name and date<br>of birth) does not cause you to self-incriminate. Therefore, it is not<br>covered by the 5th Amendment.<br><br>To that end, nearly all states do have laws which require you to give<br>your real name and other personally identifying information (but not<br>necessarily protected information like your Social Security Number) to<br>police when asked. And police don't have to have you arrested; when<br>police conduct a *Terry stop*, they can also ask you for your real name<br>and you must provide it, or you can similarly be detained until they<br>figure out your real name (another example of a "process crime" like<br>lying to a Federal agent). It goes without saying that when I said<br>"nearly all states," what I meant was that all states are different.<br>Specifics about when exactly in the process you must provide your real<br>name differ between states.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
