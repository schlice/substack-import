<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>1.  Don't use one. I know you're worried about your screen scratching,<br>    but the Samsung phones with in-display fingerprint sensors use<br>    Gorilla Glass, which doesn't start scratching until they encounter<br>    something on the Mohs hardness scale at level 6 (with deeper groves<br>    at level 7)\*. Anyway, only put your phone in your pocket, and keep<br>    your pockets clean, and you should be just fine.<br>2.  Use a PIN or passcode instead. An 8-digit passcode is just as secure<br>    as your fingerprint.<br>3.  Set up face detection. While you can do this, it is notoriously<br>    unreliable, and it is far too insecure as it does not use 3D face<br>    mapping like Apple's FaceID or Google's dual infrared cameras making<br>    a 3D representation of your face. This means you can hold up a<br>    picture of yourself and it will unlock your phone. So while you<br>    *can* do this, I recommend that you do not.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>How do I handle the issue with a screen protector interfering with the<br>fingerprint sensor on a Samsung phone?<br><br>\* Hopefully, some of you get that reference.
