<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Probably none. The drafts are not classified like information at the<br>DoD, and previous leakers have been prosecuted for leaking classified<br>information.<br><br>If the leaker was an employee in one of the Justice's offices, the<br>person *could potentially* be charged with theft of government property<br>if they weren't authorized to have it. If the leaker was a clerk<br>(themselves credentialed lawyers), they would probably be disbarred.<br>Regardless, whoever the person was (a clerk or another employee in one<br>of the Justice's offices), they will lose their jobs and will likely<br>never work in law again. Breaching trust is not looked upon kindly by<br>the profession.<br><br>Interestingly, if the leaker was actually one of the Justices, there<br>really is no "crime" other than breach of SCOTUS protocol. The only real<br>punishment they could face would be impeachment and removal from the<br>Court. The last time a SCOTUS Justice was impeached was 1805 (Justice<br>Samuel Chase), and he was acquitted by the Senate, so he was not removed<br>from the Court.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>What will the legal consequences be for the Supreme Court employee that<br>leaked the draft decision on Roe v.
