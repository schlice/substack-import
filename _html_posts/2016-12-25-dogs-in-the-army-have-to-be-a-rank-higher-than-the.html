<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>We\'ll call this a hypothetical question since you assume many things<br>which are incorrect.<br><br>- Dogs do not have rank. They are "assets," not \"personnel." Assets are<br>  unranked. They may receive honorary rank, but nothing official.<br>- Officers are not dog handlers (sadly, because I would have loved to be<br>  a dog handler).<br>- But even if they were, generals would not be in a job which required<br>  handling a dog. General officer level leadership positions drive the<br>  ship, they don\'t operate the throttle.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
