<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I support actual "gun safety" legislation. Universal background checks<br>don't make anyone safer. Nearly every mass shooter passed all his<br>background checks; mandating more background checks won't make anyone<br>safer.<br><br>I would support background checks for all gun transfers so long as we<br>can simplify and expand NICS, which will take many many federal dollars,<br>so I don't see it happening. Passing yet another cost on to gun owners<br>is also not the right thing to do, as you yet again limit access to guns<br>to the people who can afford all the government requirements.<br><br>I support licensing guns in the same way we license drivers. Make<br>easily-accessible testing, make inexpensive testing, make licenses valid<br>in all 50 states, etc.<br><br>Despite the home security argument, I support safe storage requirements.<br>You may believe differently, but I believe technology has come far<br>enough that you can nearly instantaneously get into your gun safe; fast<br>enough that you can safely arm yourself within seconds, and still keep<br>your gun out of the hands of criminals and the untrained/unauthorized.<br>Mandating safe storage will also help to further separate legal and<br>illegal gun transactions, and mandatory theft reporting will clearly<br>show when a gun goes from legal to illegal. It will also prevent most<br>guns from becoming illegal guns through theft. I think government should<br>be (partially, at least) paying for gun safes in homes. I remember the<br>last time we tried this; it was never mandated and they included enough<br>funds to provide free cable locks for long guns. What a waste. If you're<br>going to fund it, do it right.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
