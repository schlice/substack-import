<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If we\'re going to require teachers to be armed to fight school<br>shooters, why don\'t we just require students to be armed as well just<br>in case the teachers get shot?**<br><br>A common misconception. We're not *requiring* teachers to be armed.<br><br>We're *allowing* teachers ***who choose to be independently licensed<br>and certified*** to do so.<br><br>You might find it interesting to know that many teachers, on their own,<br>are already gun owners and are already concealed carry holders, but they<br>are not authorized to carry their firearms in a school. What we're doing<br>is allowing them to exercise the rights they already have within their<br>state, within a school.<br><br>Arming students is therefore unnecessary.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
