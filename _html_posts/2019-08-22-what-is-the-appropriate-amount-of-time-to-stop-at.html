<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>How long must you stop at a stop sign?<br><br>The vehicle must completely cease motion. The way this is visualized is<br>that the tires will stop turning. Once the vehicle has ceased its<br>forward motion, you can check the intersection to see if it is clear to<br>proceed. Then you may proceed with forward motion again.<br><br>So the answer is that you must stop long enough for your vehicle to come<br>to a complete stop and for you to check for cross traffic.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
