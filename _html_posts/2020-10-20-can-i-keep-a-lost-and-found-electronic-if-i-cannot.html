<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Can I keep a lost and found electronic if I cannot locate the owner?<br><br>As with all legal questions, the answer is "it depends." And in this<br>case, it mostly depends on where you find the property.<br><br>In the United States, you have to start with the definitions. "Lost<br>property" is defined as personal property that was unintentionally left<br>by its true owner. For example, a cell phone which falls out of<br>someone's pocket is considered lost property. For completeness, "real<br>property" cannot be lost. You can't "lose" your house.<br><br>Most jurisdictions in the US have laws regarding found property.<br>Typically, those laws require turning over the lost property to the<br>proper authorities. If the property is not retrieved within a set period<br>of time, that property is returned to the finder, and the original<br>owner's rights to the property are terminated.<br><br>So if you've found something that can be electronically tracked (like a<br>cell phone), your best bet is to return it to the nearest retail<br>location of that phone's carrier. If the phone is registered on their<br>network, they can reach out to the true owner and get the property<br>returned. If you've found something that is not electronically<br>traceable, you should reach out to your local police department<br>(non-emergency number, please) and ask what the procedure is in your<br>local area to report finding property.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
