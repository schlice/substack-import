If the building is on public land,<br>anyone can lodge a complaint and the police will investigate.\<br>\<br>There are a few places in a few states that police will not enforce<br>laws, but they are very few. Police normally have jurisdiction anywhere<br>within their area of responsibility (AOR).]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
