<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The question comes down to what you accept as "proof" or "evidence."<br><br>If you're talking about "evidence" as "scientific findings following<br>empirical testing using the scientific method," that wouldn't make<br>sense. There are plenty of things that science can't prove, but we're<br>all rational to believe. For example:<br><br>1.  Math and logic. Science can't prove them, because science<br>    presupposes them.<br>2.  Metaphysical truths, such as there are minds that exist outside of<br>    my own.<br>3.  Moral judgements. Science can't prove that the Nazis were evil.<br>4.  Aesthetic judgements. The beautiful, like the good, can't be proven<br>    by science.\<br>    \<br>    And surprisingly,<br>5.  Science itself. The belief that the scientific method accurately<br>    discovers truth itself can't be proven by the scientific method.<br><br>You may be able to use logic or reason to gain enough "evidence" to<br>believe something, even if science can't prove it.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
