<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>*Is it though?*<br><br>The problem we have is that "anal sex" is never specifically mentioned<br>in the Bible. What *is* mentioned is "homosexual activity," which<br>also routinely includes anal sex.<br><br>Part of the problem is the story of Sodom, from where the word "sodomy"<br>comes from. Interestingly, there are no Bible verses that contain the<br>words "sodomy," "sodomite" or "sodomites," except for the NASB and NKJV<br>versions. This is because **there are no Hebrew or Greek words that are<br>properly translated as "sodomy," "sodomite" or "sodomites."** For<br>example, the NASB translates the Hebrew word *qades* as "sodomites" in 1<br>Kings 22:46. But *qades* actually refers to temple prostitutes, which<br>may also include male prostitutes. The word "sodomites" occurs in the<br>NKJV in 1 Timothy 1:10. But the Greek word translated as "sodomites" is<br>*arsenokoites* is more properly translated as "homosexuals." Therefore,<br>most modern Bibles do not include the words "sodomy" or "sodomites."<br><br>Yet, the words "sodomy" and "sodomites" have been adopted as a reference<br>to anal sex. That is, "sodomy" has historically included anal sex, and<br>the word "sodomy" has been used as a reference to anal sex. When people<br>hear "sodomy," they naturally think "anal sex." And homosexuality is<br>commonly associated with anal sex.<br><br>But homosexual sex isn't characterized by what you do, it's<br>characterized by who you do it with.<br><br>Every time the Bible discusses sex, it discusses who you do it with. In<br>other words, it's either a heterosexual married couple, or it is "men<br>sleeping with men" or "women sleeping with women." Here's just a few of<br>the many references to homosexual activity from the Bible:<br><br>> Do not have sexual relations with a man as one does with a woman; that<br>> is detestable. --- Leviticus 18:22<br>><br>> If a man has sexual relations with a man as one does with a woman,<br>> both of them have done what is detestable. They are to be put to<br>> death; their blood will be on their own heads. --- Leviticus 20:13<br>><br>> Or do you not know that wrongdoers will not inherit the kingdom of<br>> God? Do not be deceived: Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters<br>> nor adulterers nor men who have sex with men nor thieves nor the<br>> greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the<br>> kingdom of God. --- 1 Corinthians 6:9-10<br>><br>> We also know that the law is made not for the righteous but for<br>> lawbreakers and rebels, the ungodly and sinful, the unholy and<br>> irreligious, for those who kill their fathers or mothers, for<br>> murderers, for the sexually immoral, for those practicing<br>> homosexuality, for slave traders and liars and perjurers---and for<br>> whatever else is contrary to the sound doctrine --- 1 Timothy 1:9-10<br>><br>> Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their<br>> women exchanged natural sexual relations for unnatural ones. In the<br>> same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were<br>> inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed shameful acts with<br>> other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their error.<br>> --- Romans 1:26--27<br><br>The Romans 1 reference is probably the one which might directly condemn<br>anal sex specifically, as it calls out "exchanging natural relations for<br>unnatural ones." Since the anus is not designed for the penis, but the<br>vagina is, you could say that inserting the penis into the anus is<br>"unnatural relations." However, as I mentioned earlier, all these<br>passages (including Romans 1) discuss these "unnatural relations" in<br>terms of men committing shameful acts with other men and women doing the<br>same. So while anal sex might not be *natural* in terms of intended<br>function, it is not specifically called out as *sinful*.<br><br>I'm not going to get into whether or not a heterosexual Christian<br>married couple *should* or *should not* engage in anal sex. That's a<br>personal decision the Christian married couple can prayerfully make<br>together. We already know that anal sex is riskier than vaginal sex to<br>overall health. But it can be done safely, carefully, and lovingly. If<br>the couple chooses together to engage in the activity, in a loving,<br>God-honoring, and marriage-strengthening way, then it isn't sinful.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
