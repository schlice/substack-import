<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>A2A<br><br>Yes, war can be made illegal. But that would be illogical.<br><br>We would be removing the ability of our own country to fight back if<br>another country chose to invade us. We would be tying our own hands and<br>signaling to the world that we no longer intended to remain a sovereign<br>nation, as any nation could invade us and it would be illegal for us to<br>retaliate.<br><br>Therefore, wars can only be legitimized in the United States through act<br>of Congress. While the President has first-strike authorization, he must<br>get approval from Congress to continue. It is up to Congress to approve<br>the war and to fund it.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
