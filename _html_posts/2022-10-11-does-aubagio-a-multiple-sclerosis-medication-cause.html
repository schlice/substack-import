<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The short answer is that it hasn't been fully investigated.<br><br>There may be a relationship between taking Aubagio and some periodontal<br>conditions which may have pre-existed in some patients. This is unclear<br>at the moment. But the hypothesis today is that the action of<br>teriflunomide allows certain types of infections to flourish.<br><br>This is not uncommon in MS drugs. There are indeed MS drugs which<br>suppress the immune system in a very specific way which allows some<br>infections and viral activity to flourish (I'm thinking of Tysabri and<br>the JC virus). So it is not outside of the realm of possibility that<br>teriflunomide allows certain endodontic bacterial infections to<br>flourish, specifically ones that cause pulpitis, and allows other<br>endodontic infections and periapical reactions to occur unchecked, which<br>can be followed by teeth loss.<br><br>It is imperative, therefore, that anyone starting or taking Aubagio stay<br>current on their dental health. Checkups and cleanings every six months<br>should be the minimum. Any endodontic issues should be dealt with right<br>away, or the risk of tooth loss may be accelerated. Always practice good<br>oral hygiene, as it is posited by the NIH that "\p\oor oral hygiene is<br>common in MS patients."\[1\](#wEHsF){#cite-wEHsF .citation_link} I'm<br>not sure where they came up with that statistic, but they said it.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-wEHsF){.citation_index} [[Teeth loss after teriflunomide<br>treatment: Casual or causal?
