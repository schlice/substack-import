<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Can you be a Christian if you don\'t believe that Jesus was/is God?<br><br>Of course you can be a Christian! We welcome everyone into the club!<br><br>The *real* question you should be asking, however, is:<br><br>*Can you be saved if you don't believe that Jesus was/is God?*<br><br>And that answer, my dear friends, is no.<br><br>As for evidence, I need only point you to the most important verse of<br>the New Testament: John 3:16<br><br>> *For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that<br>> whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.\<br>> - John 3:16*<br><br>Let's break this verse down:<br><br>For God so loved the world: God actually loves His creation<br><br>that he gave his one and only Son: despite your interpretation of<br>"Son," there are many passages in the Bible which explain that Jesus is<br>both fully human and fully divine, and that Jesus is one of the three<br>beings in the Trinity<br><br>that whoever believes in him: this is the one thing you have to do:<br>*believe that Jesus is God and that He died for your sins*<br><br>shall not perish: this indicates that some will perish;<br>specifically, those who don't believe in Him<br><br>but have eternal life: pretty self-explanatory, the opposite of<br>those who "shall perish."<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
