<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Sometimes, inclement weather or mechanical problems cause a crew which<br>was scheduled to come off of one plane and board another to be delayed.<br>It happens. As I understand it, the crew that was supposed to take over<br>the flight in Louisville was delayed, and they did not have another<br>standby crew available.<br><br>It's not cost effective to station a standby crew in *every airport* to<br>bounce onto a flight to take over if a flight crew gets delayed. Often,<br>you will have to get the standby crew from where they *are* to where<br>they *need to be*. That usually involves putting them on another flight.<br><br>*When* this happens is not something that can be planned for. It's a<br>*contingency.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
