<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The "sabbath" is the seventh day of the week. In a week that begins on<br>Sunday as the first day of the week, the sabbath would be Saturday. The<br>Bible is replete with examples, starting from Genesis, where God labored<br>for six days and rested on the seventh, and the Ten Commandments<br>commands us to do the same.<br><br>Both Jesus and the apostles observed the sabbath, and it wasn't until<br>long after Jesus and the apostles had left that anything began to<br>change.<br><br>The earliest authentic recognition of worshipping on Sunday began in<br>Italy, in the middle of the second century AD. For much of that time<br>then, Christians would rest on the Sabbath, and worship on Sunday, "the<br>Lord's Day." In other words, they observed *both* days.<br><br>It wasn't until Emperor Constantine that this practice was changed. On<br>March 7, 321 AD, Constantine issued the first civil Sunday law, which<br>commanded all those in the Roman Empire (except farmers) to rest on<br>Sunday. This, combined with five other pieces of legislation concerning<br>Sunday, became the very first legal precedent for resting and<br>worshipping on Sunday.<br><br>Then, in the 4th Century AD, the Council of Laodicea recommended to<br>Christians that they honor Sunday by abstaining from work on that day,<br>and prohibited them from abstaining from work on the Sabbath. This<br>officially marked the end of rest on the Sabbath and a transition to<br>resting and worshipping on Sunday.<br><br>But *why did they do this?*<br><br>The clear intent of the Council was to distinguish Christianity from<br>Judaism, and they strongly cautioned Christians to avoid "Judaizing" the<br>Sabbath. Jews worship on the seventh day, the Sabbath. Christians<br>worship on the eighth day of Creation, the Lord\'s Day, to commemorate<br>the day of the Resurrection. Basically, the logic says that if Christ<br>has fulfilled the law, we no longer need to keep the old laws. This is<br>why Christians do not celebrate the Passover, nor are they required by<br>their religion to be circumcised, etc. But when, then, do Christians<br>worship, if the law about keeping the Sabbath no longer has to be kept?<br>The answer is The Lord's Day, commemorating the day of Resurrection.<br>This is confirmed by Athanasius (who was a contemporary of the council<br>and probably took part), saying:<br><br>> The Sabbath was the end of the first creation, the Lord's day was the<br>> beginning of the second, in which he renewed and restored the old in<br>> the same way as he prescribed that they should formerly observe the<br>> Sabbath as a memorial of the end of the first things, so we honor the<br>> Lord's day as being the memorial of the new creation --- *On Sabbath<br>> and Circumcision* 3 \A.D. 345\.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Why is there a confusion of the Sabbath day, while some observe it on<br>saturday and some observe it on sunday?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
