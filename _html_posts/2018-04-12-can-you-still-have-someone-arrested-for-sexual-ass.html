<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Can you still have someone arrested for sexual assault even if it was<br>38 years ago?**<br><br>The answer, as with all legal questions, is "it depends."<br><br>The statute of limitations is different in each state. You must check<br>the law in the state in which you plan on filing charges.<br><br>The statute may change based on the age of the victim at the time of the<br>crime and other factors.<br><br>In general, unless the victim was underage, the statute of limitations<br>is usually not longer than 10 years. However, your mileage may vary.<br><br>I suggest you contact the district attorney's office if you have<br>questions about whether or not they can file charges.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
