<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**When I was 13 years old, one of my close relative sexually abused me<br>multiple times, then he grew old and supportive to me and my family<br>while I was broke, now that my situation has changed, should I Sue him<br>or forgive him?**<br><br>That's not an "either/or."<br><br>You can both forgive him and if grounds to do so exist (and you are<br>still legally permitted after so much time), you can sue him. Start by<br>checking with a personal injury lawyer in your area to see if you still<br>have standing to sue.<br><br>But start with forgiveness. You should not be harboring guilt, nor<br>should you be harboring ill will. Vengeance belongs to God. Let Him<br>worry about it. You need to move on with your life. That doesn't mean<br>you forget what he did and welcome him back into your home and your<br>life, but it does mean that you remove the anger and bitterness from<br>your heart. Absolutely forgive him. Seek out survivor groups if you are<br>sincere in your desire for forgiveness; they can help you navigate your<br>feelings and reach a place where you're able to forgive.<br><br>After you've done so, ask yourself if you've suffered so much that you<br>think that exacting a monetary penalty is appropriate. If you do think<br>so, then perhaps a personal injury lawsuit is appropriate. However, it<br>does sound like a fairly significant amount of time has passed, and in<br>most states, you don't have more than two to five years to file a<br>personal injury lawsuit. Remember, in most states, you don't need<br>actual, physical "injury" to file a lawsuit for assault and battery.<br><br>If, *after* you've healed from your forgiveness, you still want to sue,<br>and you still have standing, go back to your personal injury lawyer and<br>file that personal injury lawsuit.<br><br>\<br><br>*This answer is not a substitute for professional legal advice. I am not<br>an attorney, nor am I* *your* *attorney. This answer does not create<br>an attorney-client relationship, nor is it a solicitation to offer legal<br>advice. This answer is for GENERAL INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. If you<br>ignore this warning and convey confidential information in a private<br>message or comment, there is no duty to keep that information<br>confidential or forego representation adverse to your interests. Seek<br>the advice of a licensed attorney in the appropriate jurisdiction before<br>taking any action that may affect your rights. If you believe you have a<br>claim against someone, consult an attorney immediately, otherwise there<br>is a risk that the time allotted to bring your claim may expire.*<br><br>*Quora users who provide responses to legal questions are intended<br>third-party beneficiaries with certain rights under Quora\'s* [[*Terms<br>of Service*](https://www.quora.com/about/tos)]{.qlink_container}*.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
