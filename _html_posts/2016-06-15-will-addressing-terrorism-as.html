<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The president is indeed correct in saying that calling it by a specific<br>moniker doesn't change our stance towards extremism.<br><br>*But he's missing the point*.<br><br>Rather than me bumbling my way through it, let me leave the answer to<br>the great Maha Rushie, El Rushbo, [[Rush<br>Limbaugh](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=6df1fe&url=http://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2016/06/14/barack_obama_attorney_for_the_defense){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="rushlimbaugh.com"}]{.qlink_container} (emphasis mine):<br><br>> He is entirely missing the point of why people are raising the issue<br>> that neither he nor anybody in his Regime will actually identify what<br>> we are up against.<br>><br>> It\'s not that using a label to describe them will affect them.<br>> **It\'s that people have a legitimate question of whether or not Obama<br>> opposes them.** Or, rather, if they\'re just the latest enemy of the<br>> day, that there\'s nothing unique about them, they\'re just your<br>> average anti-American protest militant group that happens to be pretty<br>> brutal. **People are trying to decide, people are trying to determine<br>> if our president is serious about this. That\'s what this all means.**<br>> And he, of course, is skirting all around that.<br>><br>> He\'s talking about this label as being pointless in terms of<br>> strategy, pointless in terms of it being intimidating. Just \'cause we<br>> call \'em radical Islamists, it doesn\'t mean they\'re gonna lay down<br>> their arms, doesn\'t mean they\'re gonna start crying, doesn\'t mean<br>> they\'re gonna retreat. And just because we call \'em radical<br>> Islamists does not make our effort any stronger, does not make our<br>> weapons any more powerful, it doesn\'t make our strategy any better.<br>> So I don\'t get the point, he says, I don\'t get the point, what<br>> difference does it make?<br>><br>> Now, is he being honest or is this more Obama cluelessness? We never<br>> had any problem calling the Nazis Nazis, right? We weren\'t worried<br>> about what they might think. And, by the way, the Nazis were<br>> perverting a great ideology: socialism. I\'m being facetious, but the<br>> left thinks socialism\'s the greatest thing on earth, and the Nazis<br>> were socialists, in addition to everything else they did.<br>><br>> :::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>> ::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>> !(images/qimg-e4e0a6ae244003e8473e6ddefd32f02b){.landscape<br>> .qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>> master_src="images/qimg-e4e0a6ae244003e8473e6ddefd32f02b"<br>> master_w="585" master_h="250"}<br>> :::<br>> ::::<br>><br>> Could we not say the Nazis were perverting a great ideology? And we<br>> still call them the Nazis. We call \'em worse than that. We didn\'t<br>> shy away from naming our enemies in the Pacific theater. The Japanese.<br>> There were other names used. They\'re not acceptable anymore. No, no.<br>> Now we have to get up every day and see that Donald Trump is Adolf<br>> Hitler.<br>><br>> And there are no militant Islamists. No, no, it\'s a right-wing<br>> creation. It\'s designed to get these right-wingers who do nothing but<br>> listen to Rush Limbaugh in the VFW halls all worked up into a frenzy.<br>> That\'s Obama and his vision of America at this time of day every day.<br>> A bunch of Republican drunkards at the VFW hall reliving old war<br>> stories and ripping into militant Islam while listening to Rush<br>> Limbaugh. Bitter clingers.<br>><br>> **He\'s been clear about how extremist groups are perverting Islam.<br>> I\'m sorry. But they\'re not. They\'re doing Islam. They are<br>> practicing Islam. This is no perversion.** Now, again, is that<br>> Obama being clueless, or is this Obama trying to keep the peace? Is<br>> this Obama trying to be politically correct, or does Obama really just<br>> not know what he\'s talking about?<br><br>I can answer Rush's question right there. He knows *exactly* what he's<br>talking about. He is defending the "Religion of Peace" because he<br>believes that by defending Islam, he somehow makes America seem more<br>"inclusive." He does this because he truly believes that *terrorists<br>will stop being bad if America stops being bad first*. If they have no<br>reason to hate us, they will stop being terrorists, right?<br><br>Except for that fact that "they hate us because they ain't us." Which<br>means they will never stop hating us. It also means that nothing he can<br>do will stop them from hating us.<br><br>This is why labels matter. It helps you to focus on what is really at<br>issue. Americans deplore his lack of labeling because they don't know<br>that he really knows what he is fighting.<br><br>Until he can wrap his brain around the fact that he is truly battling<br>"radical Islam," no one will have full confidence that he has determined<br>the objective of the war.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
