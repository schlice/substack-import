They will use<br>speeds of the vehicle passing stationary objects to determine the speed<br>of the police car itself, and then will use that number to calculate<br>other speeds. Most in-car units will calculate and continuously display<br>the speed of the fastest car in the vicinity, the nearest car in the<br>vicinity, and will also display the speed of oncoming vehicles.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
