<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If one wanted to be a U.S. military officer in an aviation-related<br>field, would the United States Air Force Academy be the best service<br>academy to go to?**<br><br>Yes, and not just because USAFA is the best service academy (I may be a<br>little biased in that opinion, though).<br><br>If you want to go into aviation, *you have the best opportunity of<br>achieving that goal by going to the Air Force Academy because the Air<br>Force has more pilot opportunities than any of the other service<br>academies.*<br><br>Don't get me wrong, this doesn't mean you can't become a Naval Aviator<br>after attending Annapolis, or that you can't go in to Aviation after<br>attending West Point, or that you can't (eventually) get into Aviation<br>after attending the US Coast Guard Academy, because you absolutely can.<br><br>But if you're looking for the service academy which will give you the<br>best chance of becoming an officer in an aviation-related field, there's<br>no better service than the one *dedicated as a primary mission to<br>aviation*.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
