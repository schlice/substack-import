<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Clearly, there is more to the story here that we do not know.<br><br>Jesus gives us a blueprint for handling sin within the believers of a<br>congregation:<br><br>> "If your brother or sister sins, go and point out their fault, just<br>> between the two of you. If they listen to you, you have won them over.<br>> But if they will not listen, take one or two others along, so that<br>> 'every matter may be established by the testimony of two or three<br>> witnesses.' If they still refuse to listen, tell it to the church; and<br>> if they refuse to listen even to the church, treat them as you would a<br>> pagan or a tax collector." --- Matthew 18:15--17<br><br>This is a very clear blueprint for how the church handles sin from its<br>members.<br><br>It's an interesting passage, because *we are all sinners*. The pastor<br>and the elders, along with all of the congregants, are all sinners. So<br>what sins do we confront? According to the Bible, the answer is the<br>"lifestyle" sins which are committed by those who will not inherit the<br>kingdom of God. For reference, see [[1 Corinthians<br>6:9--10](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=8df650&url=https://biblia.com/bible/esv/1%2520Cor%25206.9%25E2%2580%259310){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="biblia.com"}]{.qlink_container} and [[Galatians<br>5:19--20](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=06b7b0&url=https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Gal%25205.19%25E2%2580%259320){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="biblia.com"}]{.qlink_container}; see also [[Titus<br>3:10--11](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=60e857&url=https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Titus%25203.10%25E2%2580%259311){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="biblia.com"}]{.qlink_container}. These types of sins are<br>*public, ongoing, sinful life* *choices* which are different from<br>the sins we commit in our minds and hearts because we are human and<br>sinful by nature. So for example, a Christian who is struggling with<br>impure thoughts would not be disciplined through this church discipline<br>process. We all struggle with abberant thoughts from time to time, but<br>not intentionally, and we continually ask God for forgiveness from those<br>sins. But a Christian who is living in *open, unrepentant* adultery,<br>sexual immorality, drunkenness, or any of the other sins Paul lists<br>would have to be confronted in this way.<br><br>Pastors are subject to exactly the same discipline. "Those elders who<br>are sinning you are to reprove before everyone, so that the others may<br>take warning" ([[1 Timothy<br>5:20](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=3df9a2&url=https://biblia.com/bible/esv/1%2520Tim%25205.20){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="biblia.com"}]{.qlink_container}). So a pastor who says that<br>he has to leave his job because of his sin seems like he is making a<br>choice: the church or the sin. And he's leaving the church because he is<br>choosing his sin over his church. He could make a full public confession<br>and he would have been "won over" and the issue would disappear. But if<br>he is leaving the church, it is because he cannot overcome his sin and<br>chooses to live in sin than to live as part of the church.<br><br>In that case, we are commanded to "treat them as you would a pagan or a<br>tax collector" which would rightly include excluding them from the body<br>of Christ. That doesn't mean we shame his children, but they need to<br>know that their father's willful choices are what is separating them<br>from their previous community.<br><br>The church is nothing more than a group of like-minded believers.<br>It's not a building, or a place. It's a group of people who share common<br>beliefs. And those beliefs are the only thing that separates a church<br>from any other social gathering. In sharing those beliefs among that<br>group, we also share the responsibility to maintain the integrity of<br>those beliefs. Unfortunately, many churches today never practice church<br>discipline, even in glaring instances of impropriety and obvious sin.<br>The result is that the ministry of the church is undermined and the<br>legitimacy of its message cast in doubt. If the Bible says that<br>Christians don't do *X*, but there are Christians in our church who are<br>doing *X*, with no consequences, then outsiders are right to wonder<br>whether we take the Bible seriously.<br><br>Standing up and doing what's right is a matter of principle and personal<br>integrity. Standing up *as a church body* and doing what's right **even<br>in the face of public backlash** is a matter of spiritual and Biblical<br>integrity.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
