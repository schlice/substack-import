<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The only items that the President can summarily overturn are anything<br>that a previous President has enacted via Executive Order. Therefore,<br>anything in that list which was enacted by Executive Order can be<br>rescinded by Executive Order.<br><br>Everything else was done through Congress, who actually writes law. The<br>new President can *recommend*, even *strongly recommend* creation and<br>passage of a particular law, but if Congress is disinclined to do so, it<br>doesn't get done.<br><br>Any Executive Orders which were passed because "Congress failed to act"<br>should be rescinded. If Congress failed to act, it's because Congress<br>lacked the political will to act (which also means the people did not<br>provide the requisite support to act, either). The President overrides<br>both the Constitution and the will of the people when he acts<br>unilaterally because "Congress failed to act." A failure to act is an<br>action in and of itself. Congress is deliberate in its inaction, just as<br>it is deliberate in its action. Failure to act doesn't mean they ran out<br>of time, or they couldn't figure it out. Failure to act means they<br>chose not to act. That is a deliberate choice.<br><br>And since Obamacare passed with no Republican votes whatsoever and<br>only passed because Democrats use a Parliamentary trick reserved for<br>budget negotiations (which Congress has also failed to do for years)<br>called *reconciliation,* don't be surprised if Republicans repeal<br>Obamacare using reconciliation as well. The only hope of such a tactic<br>working is with a Republican president.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
