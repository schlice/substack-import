<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>First, are you absolutely sure they are dead? If they went MIA (missing<br>in action), are you certain that they died? During the Vietnam War, Lt<br>Col Robinson Risner spent seven years in the \"Hanoi Hilton\". Howard<br>Rutledge was there for almost 7 1/2 years. I bet their families thought<br>they were dead. Or did they? Did they hold out hope that they were still<br>alive?<br><br>It is for this reason that families want to know the true status of<br>their loved ones. They want to be sure. It is a concept called<br>*closure*, being able to officially \"close\" that chapter of your life.<br>Closure is an integral part of the healing process. It allows the family<br>to know that their loved one is now \"at rest\" and is finally \"at<br>peace.\"<br><br>Also, there are several cultural and religious schools of thought which<br>teach that burial shows respect for the dead (as allowing the body to<br>remain exposed to scavengers is disrespectful to the dead in many<br>cultures). Many religions believe in an afterlife, and part of entry<br>into that afterlife includes proper interment.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
