<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>We don't know, and Samsung's not talking. They're investigating. We<br>should either hear by today or early next week what the exact issue is.<br><br>In response to the issue, Samsung has announced that it is recalling all<br>Note 7's. They have already pulled them off of store shelves, and they<br>plan on starting a full recall of the devices when replacement plans<br>have been made.<br><br>An anonymous Samsung employee has confirmed they think the problem is<br>with the battery, but they also claim that the issue affects "less than<br>0.1 percent" of the Note 7s sold to date. They also state that the<br>batteries for the Note 7 are sourced from China and Korea, and it is the<br>Korean batteries that are experiencing the issue. The issue only occurs<br>when the phone is being charged. Even though only the Korean batteries<br>appear to be affected, Samsung is proceeding with a full recall.<br><br>To date, 35 cases of the issue have been reported. Based on the number<br>sold, this issue affects approximately one in every 42,000 devices.<br><br>This is a big deal for Samsung, as over a million phones will need to be<br>replaced, and the recall is happening during their initial rollout<br>phase. The phone has already shipped to ten countries, and this is not<br>the best time to have a recall. The Note 7 is projected to be the most<br>popular Samsung phone to date, so this is a huge problem for Samsung.<br>They want to get this fixed and shipping again.<br><br>(EDIT) Our friends over at Engadget have answers on what the carriers<br>will do with your handsets:<br><br>> T-Mobile will offer a full refund on the handset and any accessories<br>> without restocking or shipping fees, but customers can keep the free<br>> Netflix subscription they received for pre-ordering. Verizon will also<br>> allow returns and offer refunds through the end of the month. Sprint<br>> is taking a slightly different approach: Customers can visit their<br>> local store to get \"a similar device until the issue is resolved.\"<br>> Last but now least, AT&T announced it will allow customers to exchange<br>> the Note 7 for a new handset and return any<br>> accessories.\[1\](#OHKWR){#cite-OHKWR .citation_link}<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-OHKWR){.citation_index} [[Samsung recalls the Galaxy Note<br>7 amid battery fears<br>(updated)](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=9b5003&url=https://www.engadget.com/2016/09/02/samsung-recalls-the-galaxy-note-7-amid-battery-fears/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="engadget.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
