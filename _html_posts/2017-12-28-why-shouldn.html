<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Chocolate and "crisps" (you must be from the UK, in America they are<br>potato chips) are fine to serve as "treats." Even daily. There's nothing<br>inherently "wrong" with either chocolate or crisps.<br><br>However, there are several reasons why you should delay the introduction<br>of sweets and high-fat, high-sodium, high-calorie foods as long as you<br>can. The main reason is that while you still have control over their<br>diets, you want to introduce healthy eating habits, demonstrate healthy<br>eating habits, and encourage those habits. If you can do this while<br>showing that chocolate and crisps should be eaten in moderation, and<br>only as "treats," then by all means, go ahead.<br><br>Also, while your children are developing (and 18 months is during the<br>"critical" development periods, while their brains are developing at the<br>most rapid rates), and since you want to give your kids the best<br>possible chance at a good, healthy life, giving them the most nutritious<br>meals you can give them is crucial. Giving them "empty" calories (foods<br>which are high calorie and high fat with very little additional<br>nutrition) is not beneficial to their growth and development. During<br>this period, they need the most nutritious foods you can give them, and<br>snack foods are not them.<br><br>Again, not to disparage chocolate and crisps as they are lovely, but<br>while you have the opportunity to set your kids on the healthiest, best<br>path, wouldn't you do so?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
