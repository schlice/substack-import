<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I love the people who are saying that Disney can just pack up and move,<br>like it's a traveling circus. They have invested *hundreds of billions<br>of dollars* into the infrastructure and experiences near Lake Buena<br>Vista and Bay Lake. Walt chose this location specifically because of its<br>favorable year-round climate, proximity to an international airport and<br>seaport, and the sweetheart deal he worked out with the State of Florida<br>for special district status.<br><br>In other words, it would take *years* to relocate Walt Disney World to<br>somewhere else, even if contiguous property somewhere near an<br>international airport in an area with favorable year-round weather could<br>be cobbled together.<br><br>And with Disney Parks, Experiences, and Products being the only<br>profitable business unity in TWDC, they simply can't divert any of that<br>revenue anywhere else. It would literally kill the company.<br><br>Let's not forget the climate that generates this kind of thinking. Less<br>than ten years ago, corporations were pushing businesses around.<br>Remember the fights over religious freedom which morphed into fights<br>over gay rights? Corporations were pulling out of locations left and<br>right. Atlanta lost the All-Star game. North Carolina lost NBA and NCAA<br>events because of House Bill 2 defining bathroom usage.<br><br>Republicans would previously cave to such pressure, despite being<br>frustrated about it.<br><br>But even though Atlanta lost the All-Star Game, Georgia's voting laws<br>still stand. Even though Greensboro lost the NCAA tourney, its bathroom<br>rules still stand. Republicans these days *must* stand up to woke<br>corporations flexing their muscle against the will of the state (and<br>thus the people in that state).<br><br>DeSantis was reading from the same playbook when handling Disney. The<br>Parental Rights in Education Act didn't affect Disney at all, but they<br>still decided to speak out over the state's actions. DeSantis contends<br>that as a family-friendly business, they should understand parents not<br>wanting young children taught about gender identity in public schools.<br><br>Republicans' disenchantment with big business throwing their weight<br>behind social issues will continue to play out like this in states<br>controlled by Republicans.<br><br>\<br><br>But now to the question: realistically, what are Disney's options?<br>Realistically (meaning, without hurting their bottom line, as Disney is<br>beholden to its shareholders), they don't have many. They will not<br>prevail in this fight; history has shown us that the state always wins<br>in these fights.<br><br>The only way for them to prevail is to ride it out and wait for a more<br>sympathetic government. Governments go in cycles. Disney has been in<br>Florida for more than 60 years; they can wait for a new administration<br>to take over in the state.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
