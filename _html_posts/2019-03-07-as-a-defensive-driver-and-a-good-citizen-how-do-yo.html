<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**As a defensive driver and a good citizen, how do you respond when<br>someone is tailgating you when you are going the speed limit in the<br>right-most lane, in a city where such tailgating is commonplace?**<br><br>You have several choices, but the most recommended ones:<br><br>1.  Slow down and create a larger gap in front of your car than you<br>    normally would (between you and the car in front of you). This will<br>    allow you to slow down more gradually if you have to stop suddenly,<br>    thus hopefully preventing a rear-end collision. And also, since<br>    you'll now be going slower than the speed limit, you may convince<br>    your tailgater to go tailgate someone else.<br>2.  Move to another lane.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
