<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If a guy with a gun in his pocket, deliberately gets drunk, then kills<br>someone by shooting them, but doesn\'t remember it because he was drunk,<br>should it be considered first degree murder because he deliberately got<br>drunk with a gun?**<br><br>No, because it doesn't meet the definition of first-degree murder.<br><br>The crime of first-degree murder requires three elements:<br><br>1.  The unlawful taking of a life<br>2.  with forethought<br>3.  and malice.<br><br>The malice (or the *mens rea*, the guilty mind) simply isn't there in<br>this case.<br><br>This is *possibly* a case of second-degree murder, but that is<br>unlikely.<br><br>This is *most likely* a case of criminally-negligent homicide.<br><br>Second degree murder requires only the first two (the unlawful taking of<br>a life with forethought). The *mens rea* is not there. It could be<br>argued that carrying a gun while getting drunk constitutes forethought,<br>but it's unlikely that the person got drunk with a gun planning on it<br>leading to someone's death. In some cases though, it could be argued as<br>such, so we'll leave it in there, but it's unlikely.<br><br>What we are most likely looking at is criminal negligence.<br>Negligence is a word in law which means a failure to exercise reasonable<br>care, either through careless action, or inaction. Reasonableness is<br>based on the "reasonable person" test: what would a reasonable person do<br>in the same situation. *Criminal* negligence is negligence that a<br>reasonable person would know, or should know, could result in someone's<br>death.<br><br>Carrying a gun while drinking is, without a doubt, criminal negligence.<br><br>Carrying a gun while drinking is not first-degree murder.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
