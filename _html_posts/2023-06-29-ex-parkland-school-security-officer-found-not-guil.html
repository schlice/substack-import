<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>> Do you think that was the right call?<br><br>Yes, it was the right call. There is no law that requires a police<br>officer to put themselves in the line of fire, or risk their lives<br>during a shooting, so prosecutors chose to charge him with felony child<br>neglect.<br><br>The case, therefore, came down to whether or not a law enforcement<br>officer had a "duty to protect" like a teacher who acts *in loco<br>parentis*.<br><br>The court found that, clearly, he did not. This follows decades of legal<br>precedent which states unequivocally that law enforcement officers do<br>not have a duty to protect any one individual. They have a "general duty<br>to the public at large," but they do not have any legally mandated duty<br>to protect any one person or group of people.<br><br>> What about his moral responsibility?<br><br>Morals are different for everyone. As those who are quick to tell us<br>that there is a bright-line distinction between church and state, since<br>there is no overarching moral authority, one person's morals may be<br>unique and different from everyone else.<br><br>Since there is no legally-accepted moral standard, our standard in this<br>country is the law. And the law says that a law enforcement officer<br>does not have a duty to protect.<br><br>Regardless of whether or not you feel his actions were "cowardly" (which<br>they may have been), his actions were clearly not illegal. Any opinions<br>about whether or not he may have violated some ambiguous moral standard<br>are just that: opinion.<br><br>For all you atheists out there who are fuming that this guy was just a<br>coward, you reap what you sow. Morals are only legislated as far as they<br>are enshrined in the law.<br><br>> Should there be any civil liability?<br><br>No. Since the deputy was working as a law enforcement officer at the<br>time, and he has either not been charged with any crimes, or has been<br>found not guilty of others, then qualified immunity shields him from<br>civil liability while performing his duties. The only case they could<br>attempt to bring against him was felony child neglect, but the court<br>found that he did not qualify as a caregiver in his capacity as a law<br>enforcement officer.<br><br>Therefore, he is protected by qualified immunity. Any civil charges<br>against him directly would be moot.<br><br>Since officers are shielded by qualified immunity, lawsuits for damages<br>are usually directed at the state or Federal government. In this case,<br>the Justice Department settled all of the 40 civil cases arising out of<br>the Parkland shooting in March of 2022. The<br>[settlement(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=d0f297&url=https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-announces-civil-settlement-cases-arising-2018-school-shooting-parkland){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="justice.gov"}]{.qlink_container} for \$127.5 million does<br>not admit any wrongdoing by the government. The parties have been in<br>litigation since late 2018, when the survivors of the shooting, and the<br>families of 16 people killed, sued the government for damages.<br><br>\<br><br>Again, this doesn't sit well with people, because everyone has this<br>image that "if you're a cop, you automatically run towards the bullets<br>and kill the bad guy and say something pithy when he goes down." And<br>while I agree with you in spirit, there is nothing in the police<br>officer's job description which reads "gets killed when necessary." Cops<br>wear soft body armor (Level IIIA) most of the time, which can stop<br>handgun calibers. Anyone with a rifle will punch right through that<br>stuff. So you're pitting a cop with basically no body protection and a<br>handgun against a potentially well-armed, more accurate shooter with a<br>rifle, who could take you out at a distance you can't hope to be<br>accurate at. You might feel like he *should have*, and you may be angry<br>at him for *not* blindly running in there, regardless of the risk, but<br>there's nothing in his job description, or in the requisite law,<br>which says that he was *required to do so*.<br><br>In other words, *you may think he's a big fat coward, but attempting to<br>charge him with a crime for being a coward just isn't going to fly.*<br><br>I don't like it any more than you do. It's a terrible situation all<br>around. But it's not one to be handled in the courts.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
