<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Looking at it from a purely Constitutional view (which is<br>what the Supreme Court should be doing) shows that the Constitution is<br>silent on whether or not the nation should recognize marriages of any<br>kind. Justice Alito wrote in his dissent of the DOMA ruling in 2013,<br>\"Same-sex marriage presents a highly emotional and important question<br>of public policy \-- but not a difficult question of Constitutional<br>law.\" The Constitution is neutral on whether or not recognizing<br>same-sex marriage will help or hurt the institution.\<br>\<br>The Constitution does not require states legalize same-sex marriage, nor<br>does it prevent them from doing so. But last year\'s DOMA ruling (where<br>SCOTUS declined to review the decision that states need not recognize<br>same-sex marriages from other states) is an indication that the court<br>could make sweeping changes to marriage law when the time is right.\<br>\<br>I think Justice Kennedy\'s key word \-- \"millenia\" \-- shows that the<br>Court is unlikely to overturn an institution which has existed for that<br>amount of time, and spans the globe, as one man and one woman. It won\'t<br>prohibit states from making their own laws, but I don\'t think that a<br>nationwide directive that \"same-sex marriage is now Constitutionally<br>protected\" is forthcoming.\<br>\<br>But the court has come up with justification for laws supposedly derived<br>from the Constitution that are really, really difficult to find in<br>there, in the past. So who knows.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
