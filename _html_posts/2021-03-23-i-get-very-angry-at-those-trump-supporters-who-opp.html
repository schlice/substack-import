<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I get very angry at those Trump supporters who oppose abortion.<br><br>Well, that's a very specific group of people who receive your anger. Why<br>not all pro-life people? Why only pro-life people who are Trump<br>supporters? Doesn't seem really logical.<br><br>**We need to show them what it feels like to meddle in the affairs of<br>other people.**<br><br>Why do "we" need to do this? My mother meddles in the affairs of my life<br>all the time, yet there is no need to "show her what it feels like" to<br>meddle in someone else's affairs.<br><br>**Why can\'t we ban rivals of Joe Biden from having sex in their<br>bedrooms?**<br><br>I don't understand this statement at all. What does disliking the<br>policies of the current president have to do at all with sex?<br><br>Your question is just really confusing. Maybe you can clarify why you're<br>so angry, and at such a specific group of people.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
