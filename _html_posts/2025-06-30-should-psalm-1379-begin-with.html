<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The Hebrew word used in the Psalm is אֶשֶׁר, or *esher*, which literally<br>means either happy or blessed. Various translations render that word as<br>either "happy" or "blessed," but both translations are correct.<br><br>But being happy or blessed to smash babies against rocks seems like an<br>odd thing to have as part of God's word, doesn't it?<br><br>That's why *context matters*. **For text, without context, is just<br>pretext. And the most important context: *Psalm 137 wasn't spoken by<br>God.***<br><br>Psalm 137:9 is probably one of the most quoted verses of the Bible, and<br>equally as often misunderstood. This psalm is known as an<br>\"imprecatory\" psalm. Imprecatory psalms were written as prayers<br>begging for God's intercession in a specific, negative way against<br>Israel's enemies. In this case, it was the Babylonians.<br><br>This particular psalm was written by an Israelite, who was captured by<br>Babylon. In his anger, he prays for Babylon to experience exactly the<br>same thing that Israel had happen to them when they were conquered.<br>Smashing the heads of little babies against rocks was a common<br>occurrence during conquest.<br><br>But what's important about his prayer is that he is not asking God to do<br>this in order to "get revenge" against the Babylonians. He's also not<br>providing *direction* for anyone to go carry this out (so it's not<br>like he's condoning smashing babies' heads). He's actually just speaking<br>his frustration and leaving it for God to take the vengeance. While the<br>Bible does discuss not taking vengeance yourself and leaving it to God<br>(see Proverbs 19:11 and Romans 12:19), the Bible does encourage people<br>to pray that God's justice be done (see Psalm 7:6 and Revelation 6:10).<br>You might also be surprised to find out that the Bible does predict that<br>what Babylon did to Israel will indeed come back around on them (see<br>Jeremiah 25:14).<br><br>The most important takeaway here is that even throughout the imprecatory<br>psalms, there is no hint of vengeance; it's always a plea for God to<br>take His vengeance in His time.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
