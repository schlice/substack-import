<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The Supreme Court did not declare the land was stolen, and claims that<br>the court found that the US illegally took the land are most definitely<br>incorrect.<br><br>The land was given to the Sioux under the Fort Laramie Treaty. Then in<br>1877, the portion of land around Mount Rushmore and the Black Hills was<br>taken back under eminent domain, which is legal under the Constitution.<br>However, the 1877 treaty failed to properly categorize this as a<br>"taking" which would require just compensation. Instead, the 1877 treaty<br>which took the Black Hills offered "subsistence rations for as long as<br>they would be needed."<br><br>The Supreme Court decision in 1980 in *United States v. Sioux Nation of<br>Indians* (448 US 371, 1980) found that through the various machinations<br>over the years, the acquisition of the Black Hills was, in fact, a<br>"taking" under eminent domain, and that just compensation was due to the<br>Sioux, and that subsistence rations were not appropriate under the<br>compensation clause of eminent domain. The court found that the Sioux<br>were due \$17.1 million for the land. They then found that this taking<br>was also subject to interest payments, which they had not figured in the<br>1942 and 1987 claims. This amounts to a grand total of \$108 million due<br>to the Sioux Nation.<br><br>The Sioux still believe that the Fort Laramie Treaty was violated and<br>are claiming that their right to own the Black Hills has remained since<br>the original treaty. Regardless, the Supreme Court has ruled several<br>times on this issue, and some claims have been barred by *res judicata.*<br>According to the Courts, the taking of the Black Hills was<br>constitutional under eminent domain. Just as any other American, the<br>Sioux are entitled to just compensation for the taking. Because they<br>"didn't want to sell the land" is not relevant. The \$108 million<br>continues to be held in trust until the Sioux take the money.<br><br>**TL;DR: The United States is able to take land from citizens under the<br>Constitutional provision known as "eminent domain."**<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
