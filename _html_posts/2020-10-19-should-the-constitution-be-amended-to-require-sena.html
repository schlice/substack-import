<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Should the Constitution be amended to require Senate-approved members<br>of the executive branch to appear before House or Senate when called to<br>do so?**<br><br>No, for several reasons.<br><br>1.  A Constitutional amendment is unnecessary. We already have a<br>    mechanism to bring government officials before Congress. It's called<br>    a congressional subpoena.<br>2.  A Constitutional amendment would ignore the fact that Executive<br>    Branch appointees are merely *consented* by the Senate, not<br>    *appointed*. These appointees work for the Executive, not Congress.<br>3.  This Constitutionalizes a *power over* the Executive Branch, making<br>    the Legislative Branch arguably more powerful than the Executive<br>    Branch. In theory, the three branches of government are co-equal.<br>    1.  Along with this, this removes the ability of the Executive<br>        Branch to exercise *Executive Privilege,* erasing decades of<br>        judicial precedent.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
