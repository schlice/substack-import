<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Legally, does Fox News have to specify it's not actually news but an<br>entertainment program?**<br><br>Please detail for me the law which requires any media outlet to<br>categorize any broadcast in any particular way.<br><br>But every "news" program is guilty of intermingling their "news" anchors<br>with their "entertainment" anchors. For any avid watcher of Fox, the<br>difference is easy to see. But for someone just tuning in for the first<br>time, it would be very difficult to tell, on first blush, that a program<br>is entertainment or news.<br><br>Previously, in the time of the Edward R. Murrows of the world, it was<br>left to news agencies to maintain their neutrality and integrity, and<br>they prided themselves on that.<br><br>Now that this has changed among all broadcast media, perhaps the law<br>should change with it. I have no idea how you implement something like<br>that, as the 1st Amendment will make this challenging, but it's an<br>interesting thought experiment.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
