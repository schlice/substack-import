<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>*TRIGGER WARNING:* *We will be discussing the Constitutional basis<br>for Roe v. Wade. We are* *NOT* *discussing whether or not abortion<br>is a good idea. Comments which discuss the issue instead of the Court's<br>ruling will be deleted. We're not discussion abortion. We're discussing<br>the Court's decision and the Constitutionality of that decision.*<br><br>*Abortion is a very emotional topic. We are not discussing abortion in<br>this answer. This answer is only about the law and the Constitution, not<br>about the ethics or morality of abortion itself.*<br><br>\<br><br>Virtually zero. I can't say actually zero because I'm unaware of the<br>Court's complete docket, but I have not heard of any cases challenging<br>the Constitutionality of the *Obergefell* ruling.<br><br>So before you flip out over *Roe* triggering some massive overturning of<br>all of your favorite Court decisions*,* remember that in order for<br>SCOTUS to reverse a previous ruling, it has to be hearing a case which<br>makes a valid Constitution argument against a previous ruling.<br><br>In this case, there is a very solid Constitutional argument in favor of<br>overturning *Roe*, namely that the basis for *Roe* was completely<br>unconstitutional.<br><br>*Roe* used a previous ruling in a marital privacy case, *Griswold v.<br>Connecticut. Griswold* was a case out of Connecticut wherein at the time<br>in the 1950s, it was illegal to use "any drug, medicinal article, or<br>instrument for the purpose of preventing conception\...\". Violators<br>could be \"\... fined not less than fifty dollars or imprisoned not less<br>than sixty days nor more than one year or be both fined and<br>imprisoned.\" The Court overturned the Connecticut law by claiming that<br>the law violated the right to marital privacy, which it claimed existed<br>in the Constitution.<br><br>To be clear, there is no amendment to the Constitution which recognizes<br>the right of the people to have privacy, in their marriage or anywhere<br>else. What the Court did was to look at the characteristics of existing<br>amendments, and decide that what the Framers *intended* was that the<br>basis of all of the other rights was a right to privacy. The Court<br>reasoned that the provisions of the Bill of Rights created<br>\"emanations\" of protection, and these emanations created \"penumbras\"<br>within which rights could still exist, even if they were not explicitly<br>enumerated in the Constitution. The Court concluded that the right to<br>marital privacy fell within this protection.<br><br>*Roe* then used this right to privacy (which the decision in *Griswold*<br>created) to argue that a woman has a right to privacy in her person, and<br>that abortion is covered by that right to privacy.<br><br>So there is good Constitutional basis to reverse *Roe*, because it was a<br>bad decision based on a nonexistent right.<br><br>No such argument exists for *Obergefell*.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>A leaked document shows that SCOTUS is set to strike down Roe v Wade,<br>which has been in place for 50 years. What\'s the probability that the<br>current SCOTUS will next move to strike down same sex marriage within<br>the year?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
