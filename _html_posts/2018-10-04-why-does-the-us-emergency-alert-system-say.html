<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Why does the US emergency alert system say \"Presidential Alert\"<br>instead of just something like \"National Alert\"?**<br><br>Alerts that come in as "Presidential Alerts" are issued by the<br>President. Primarily, that's why they are called "Presidential Alerts."<br>The government has the ability to issue three types of messages:<br><br>- Presidential Alerts, alerts issued directly from the President<br>- Alerts regarding imminent danger to life. There are two subcategories<br>  of these alerts: Extreme Threat or Severe Threat<br>- AMBER Alerts<br><br>According to Commercial Mobile Alert System (CMAS) regulations, end<br>users are not supposed to be able to disable "Presidential Alerts,"<br>which is why they are in a separate category from other CMAS alerts.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
