<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>How often should you work out when you have multiple sclerosis?<br><br>As MS is different for every individual, so too should your workout be<br>individually tailored to your specific needs and abilities.<br><br>The general rule of thumb is to not over-exert yourself. You already<br>know that [[MS<br>lassitude](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=828f93&url=https://www.nationalmssociety.org/Symptoms-Diagnosis/MS-Symptoms/Fatigue){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="nationalmssociety.org"}]{.qlink_container} is a thing, but<br>again, how it affects you is different than how it affects me. It's<br>important that you tailor your workout to ensure you're not causing<br>yourself to get fatigued such that you can't continue your day.<br><br>Overall, the goal should be building up endurance and muscle mass in<br>advance of a period of time where you may be unable to do these things.<br>MS tries to prevent you from moving, and muscles that don't move will<br>atrophy. Understanding the possibility that this eventuality may come to<br>pass, your workout should strive to increase lean muscle mass as well as<br>strength and endurance.<br><br>And as always (which should go without saying), you should always work<br>with your doctor before you start or change an exercise plan, to ensure<br>you'll be safe doing it.<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*This answer is not professional medical advice**, nor is it a<br>substitute for professional medical advice.
