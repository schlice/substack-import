<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>It doesn\'t seem as if anyone answered the question from a purely legal<br>(US) perspective, and despite all the good-natured<br>who-I-might-morally-desire-to-help-first answers, it really falls down<br>like this:<br><br>- I have no legal duty to render aid. I\'m not a doctor. I\'m not an<br>  EMT. Yes I\'m trained as a first responder, but I'm only protected by<br>  Good Samaritan laws, and we know those are not foolproof. If I treat<br>  the rider, and I hurt him in the process, Good Sam laws or not, I'm<br>  likely going to be the target of a negligence lawsuit. Doesn't sound<br>  like the perfect recipe for a happy day to me.<br>- The motorbike damaged my property (my dog). Dogs are not people, they<br>  are property under the law. My property, which is my<br>  responsibility, was damaged.<br><br>Therefore, I'm going to tend to my damaged property (my dog) while I<br>take pictures of the bike and its license plate so that I can prepare to<br>file suit to recoup the costs to repair my damaged property (i.e. my vet<br>bills caused by the rider, whether through accident or negligence), and<br>maybe, if I have time, as I'm taking my dog to the vet, I'll call 911 to<br>report that a motorbike hit something and the rider fell off and<br>probably needs an ambulance.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
