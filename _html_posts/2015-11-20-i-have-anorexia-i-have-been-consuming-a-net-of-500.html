<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Seriously. Listen to these people here. Turn off Quora and<br>see a doctor. I don\'t care what doctor you see. See your PCP (Primary<br>Care Physician). See an ER doc. See a psychiatrist if you have direct<br>access to one.\<br>\<br>But please go see someone. Now. If I could reach through this monitor,<br>I\'d drag you there myself. But all I can do is implore you to go see a<br>doctor.\<br>\<br>Do not wait. Go now.]<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*This answer is not professional medical advice**, nor is it a<br>substitute for professional medical advice.
