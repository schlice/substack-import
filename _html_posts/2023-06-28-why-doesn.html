<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Hello [[Sijin<br>Mo](https://www.quora.com/profile/Sijin-Mo)]{.qlink_container}, thank<br>you for posting this question.<br><br>It is clear from your (very slim) profile that you are a supporter of<br>China and the CCP. Nothing wrong with that. You do you.<br><br>But it's also clear from your profile that you have some pretty<br>interesting thoughts about the future of the United States:<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-f16330f4646d3d24d5e4ffd94a503f8a){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-f16330f4646d3d24d5e4ffd94a503f8a" master_w="562"<br>master_h="103"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>Yeah, you don't really know all that much about the United States if you<br>think that "the future of the United States" involves us removing states<br>from the Union.<br><br>Can you see what we might think if you declare your love for China and<br>the CCP...<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-f4cde4bd94b14d8d36f7ead97e7a0bfa){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-f4cde4bd94b14d8d36f7ead97e7a0bfa" master_w="594"<br>master_h="545"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>and then ask "statements phrased like questions" about the future of the<br>United States?<br><br>Now, is it possible you're a troll? Yes. In fact, it's virtually<br>guaranteed that this is a fake troll account. But it's just as possible<br>that you're a real supporter of China and the CCP.<br><br>\<br><br>With that backdrop, should we even think to answer the question?<br><br>I can understand someone who embraces socialism would think that "giving<br>up personal safety" is a great way to ensure public safety.<br><br>But as you probably are already aware, *that's not us*. We are not a<br>nation of socialists. We do not believe in a government leading us to<br>common good. Ben Franklin said, "Those who would give up essential<br>Liberty, to purchase a little temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty<br>nor Safety." We live like that. We believe in *individuals* working<br>together to achieve more, and government being a "necessary evil" which<br>performs limited, well-defined functions and nothing more.<br><br>\<br><br>But anyway, I digress. I needed to answer the question, lest my answer<br>be collapsed for not actually answering the question.<br><br>Not that you really care. You're not really interested in my answer.<br>You're interested in making statements thinly veiled as questions.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
