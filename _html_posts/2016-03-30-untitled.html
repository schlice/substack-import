<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>*but that logic would justify the actions of Al Qaeda or Isis, carried<br>to it\'s logical conclusion*<br><br>Absolutely! If I were Al Qaeda or ISIS, I would absolutely use these<br>principles of war. Indeed, this is exactly what they do today, *sans*<br>nukes. \"Terror\" groups try to break the fighting spirit of a people.<br>That is their entire purpose. Make them pliable, make them unresistant<br>to change\...and then take over. Remember that their ultimate goal,<br>their \"end-game\" is the establishment of a worldwide Islamic caliphate<br>under Sharia.<br><br>*which is why the Geneva convention (these days at least) is usually<br>interpreted as outlawing such \'strategic\' actions.*<br><br>The Geneva Convention talks about what are \"appropriate\" things to do<br>during wartime. Shooting people is appropriate during wartime. We use<br>FMJ rounds so that the round will go cleanly through the warrior, with<br>the least chance that he will be killed. Hollow-points which are<br>designed to expand and release all of their energy in one person,<br>preventing over-penetration, are not considered appropriate, because<br>they have more chance of causing death than a full-metal-jacketed round,<br>which deforms far less when traveling through a person. The goal when<br>shooting someone, under the GC, is to \"take them out of the fight\"<br>while giving them the best chance for survival when treated by field<br>medics.<br><br>However, strategic warfare is indeed part of the GC. Hitting large<br>targets like factories which produce weapons and bullets, supply depots,<br>roads, bridges, communication systems, power grids, water/sewage<br>systems, etc. are all strategic targets designed to slow down the<br>military machine, cut off supply lines, and demoralize the people in<br>general. Will non-combatants be killed during those operations? Yes,<br>most likely. They are considered \"collateral damage\" and, while<br>tragic, are part of the cost of warfare. If at all possible, we try to<br>minimize non-combatant casualties. Remember the \"luckiest man in Iraq\"<br>video that Gen. Schwartzkopf showed of the bomb striking the bridge<br>immediately following the civilian vehicle crossing it? That person was,<br>in fact, lucky. The bomb strike was not timed to miss him. If he would<br>have died, it\'s likely we wouldn\'t have showed that video to the<br>press. But because he miraculously survived, we showed it. If he would<br>have died, the strike would have had the same strategic effect, but<br>there would have been one non-combatant casualty.<br><br>Another question: is carpet-bombing a city a valid technique under the<br>GC? Yes it is. If there are military operations which take place from<br>that city, carpet-bombing can disrupt those operations. We don\'t do it<br>any more because we don\'t have to, ***not because the GC says we<br>can\'t***. We can fly a cruise missile halfway around the world and<br>through the window of the operations center within a city, dramatically<br>reducing the amount of collateral damage done over a technique like<br>carpet bombing or dropping strategic nukes. The GC should be updated. In<br>the meantime, there\'s nothing that says that our tactical and strategic<br>warfare decisions can\'t be updated over time, within the confines of<br>the GC.<br><br>So why did we drop strategic nukes on cities in Japan? Several reasons<br>come to mind.<br><br>1.  We were (rightly) outraged over what we saw as a cowardly<br>    sneak-attack in Pearl Harbor.<br>2.  We needed a decisive turning point that would simultaneously break<br>    the fighting spirit of the people and convince the military leaders<br>    that continuing on a war path would be political, as well as<br>    physical, suicide.<br>3.  We needed to show the world the destructive power of this new weapon<br>    we had developed. The targeting committee had considered other<br>    targets, such as remote military bases. But at that time, we were<br>    already carpet-bombing and firebombing cities, killing thousands. We<br>    needed this bomb to kill. Hiroshima was a \"compact\" target. One<br>    bomb, from one plane, would wipe out an entire city. That was the<br>    effect that we wanted to impress on them, and it\'s exactly what we<br>    did.<br>4.  Also, Hiroshima was a valid military target city; there were<br>    factories and other military targets there. It was \"compact\"<br>    meaning if we dropped a bomb right in the center it would take out<br>    the whole city.<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-7f495f6b33ef13b0ee73d7732efee06e){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-7f495f6b33ef13b0ee73d7732efee06e" master_w="485"<br>master_h="403"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>(photo courtesy<br>[AP(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=791684&url=http://www.npr.org/2015/08/06/429433621/why-did-the-u-s-choose-hiroshima){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="npr.org"}]{.qlink_container})<br><br>This is why the threat of the use of a nuclear option has been enough to<br>deter other nations from attempting such tactics.<br><br>But think about this. The Japanese were prepared to defend Tokyo to the<br>last man, woman, and child. The invasions of Iwo Jima and Okinawa had<br>been incredibly costly in terms of lives lost. An invasion of the<br>Japanese mainland by ground forces was expected to end millions of<br>lives, on both sides. Therefore, even many Japanese people today agree<br>that dropping the bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki saved as many, if not<br>more, lives than it took.<br><br>While the continued threat of nuclear annihilation may deter most<br>third-world nations from considering developing or using nukes against<br>the West, Al Qaeda and ISIS may be different. Once Iran finishes its<br>development of a nuclear weapon and gives it to one of these groups, we<br>will see just how far our kindness towards the \"peaceful<br>religion\"/political system of Islam extends, and how many Islamic<br>nations and sympathizers become \"collateral damage.\"<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/If-an-unidentified-passenger-plane-flew-into-the-American-mainland-and-ignored-all-attempts-at-communicating-with-it-how-would-the-military-respond/answer/Bill-Stein<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
