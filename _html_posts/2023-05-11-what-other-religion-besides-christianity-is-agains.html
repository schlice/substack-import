<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I'm totally not even going to go down the rabbit hole of<br>abortion-as-population control. That was an idea floated because the<br>founders of Planned Parenthood were card-carrying eugenicists. What<br>their motivations were, I can't be certain. But I can tell you that the<br>Supreme Court did not have eugenics in mind when they made their<br>decision.<br><br>As for world religions and abortion, first of all, you can't say that<br>"Christianity is against abortion." There are several sub-groups within<br>Christianity (and other sects and cults which identify as Christian)<br>which have widely diverging views on abortion.<br><br>For example, the Roman Catholic Church and the Southern Baptist<br>Convention are strictly against abortion, even though the public<br>position of the SBC allows abortion in the case of saving the life of<br>the mother. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (Mormons)<br>and the Assemblies of God also are against abortion. However, the United<br>Church of Christ and the Unitarian Universalist Association believe that<br>abortion is completely permitted. The National Baptist Convention (a<br>historically black Protestant denomination in the US) allows each<br>congregation to decide their view for themselves. The Episcopalians, the<br>Presbyterians, and the Methodists believe that abortion is allowed, but<br>they temper this support with the call for some limits on when a woman<br>can terminate her pregnancy. For instance, while the Episcopal Church<br>opposes statutory limits on abortion, it teaches that "it should be used<br>only in extreme situations."<br><br>Outside of Christianity, there are also many differences, and other<br>situations which are not clear-cut. Hinduism is generally opposed to<br>abortion, while Reform and Conservative Jews permit it with few<br>exceptions. Islam has a range of views and differences about when life<br>begins, and thus when abortion is morally acceptable, as they have no<br>centralized organizational authority. Orthodox Jews are still in<br>disagreement amongst themselves, with rabbis and scholars continuing to<br>debate the issue.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
