<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Why does the responsible, legal gun owner have to foot<br>that particular bill? If this is a problem with education, or mental<br>illness, or social services, why add *more tax* (there\'s already sales<br>tax on firearms) for those services? Why not tax everyone and increase<br>funding to those services?\<br>\<br>So your real question should be \"Why doesn\'t the US just spend<br>more on education, rehabilitation, social services, etc.\" Ask *that*<br>question and you might find some answers as to why those services are in<br>the state they are.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
