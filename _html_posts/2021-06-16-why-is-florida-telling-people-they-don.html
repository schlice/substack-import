<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>First, please cite one example of "Florida" telling people they don't<br>need to be vaccinated. I'll wait. Florida is doing pretty well<br>considering they are the third largest state in terms of population.<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-b99bc4a75b6584c1c23c0cc2993cb89a){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-b99bc4a75b6584c1c23c0cc2993cb89a" master_w="954"<br>master_h="618"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>Second, the cases of mucormycosis (aka "black fungus") are not caused by<br>COVID-19 or a variant.<br><br>When a patient is critically ill with COVID-19, they will sometimes<br>receive corticosteroids to reduce inflammation. But they also reduce<br>immunity, which is allowing a very rare fungal infection to occur.<br><br>> Doctors believe mucormycosis, which has an overall mortality rate of<br>> 50%, may be being triggered by the use of steroids, a life-saving<br>> treatment for severe and critically ill Covid-19 patients.<br>><br>> Steroids reduce inflammation in the lungs for Covid-19 and appear to<br>> help stop some of the damage that can happen when the body\'s immune<br>> system goes into overdrive to fight off coronavirus. But they also<br>> reduce immunity and push up blood sugar levels in both diabetics and<br>> non-diabetic Covid-19 patients.<br>><br>> It\'s thought that this drop in immunity could be triggering these<br>> cases of mucormycosis.\[1\](#GeMOp){#cite-GeMOp .citation_link}<br><br>So it's not COVID-19 causing the infection. It's the treatment for a<br>rare critical case of COVID-19 causing the conditions to be ripe for<br>someone to get a *secondary infection*.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Why is Florida telling people they don't have to get vaccinated, when<br>there is a new variant that causes black fungus, which eventually eats<br>your face offðŸ˜³?
