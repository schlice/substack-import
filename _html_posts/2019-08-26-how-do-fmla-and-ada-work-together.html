<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>How do FMLA and ADA work together?<br><br>Generally, you will find these two working together when it comes to<br>disability discrimination and wrongful termination lawsuits.<br><br>I'll give you a perfect example right here in my own back yard: **Hayes<br>v. SkyWest Airlines (2017),** which was heard by a Federal jury in<br>Denver.<br><br>The basics of the story:<br><br>> John Hayes worked as a trainer for SkyWest at Denver International<br>> Airport from 2006 to 2014. Prior to his health issues, Hayes had an<br>> excellent work record and was by all accounts a great employee.<br>><br>> In 2013, Hayes was diagnosed with kidney disease. He had to start<br>> receiving regular dialysis treatment, for which he used his FMLA<br>> leave. In August 2014, Hayes' doctor cleared him to return to work.<br>> His only restriction prohibited him from lifting anything over 30<br>> pounds.<br>><br>> Since he was a supervisor and never lifted things in the past, the<br>> accommodation should not have been an issue. Initially, SkyWest<br>> approved the restriction and Hayes resumed his position as a trainer.<br>> Within a week, however, SkyWest informed him that it would not honor<br>> his accommodation. SkyWest barred him from returning to work unless<br>> Hayes could lift over 30 pounds. Hayes requested SkyWest transfer him<br>> to a different position. SkyWest refused. Hayes then applied for six<br>> other positions within the company but wasn't offered any, thereby<br>> ending his employment with SkyWest.<br>><br>> Hayes initially filed an internal complaint with SkyWest for<br>> discrimination and then with the EEOC. He then filed a lawsuit against<br>> his former employer, alleging violations of the ADA and FMLA. SkyWest<br>> sought to explain John's dismissal with seemingly contradictory<br>> arguments. First, they asserted that he was part of a mass layoff in<br>> 2014 involving over 600 employees. But SkyWest had offered those<br>> employees out-of-state transfers or year-long furloughs. SkyWest also<br>> argued that John's termination was necessary because he suffered a<br>> "medical incident" while at work. The incident in question was a bout<br>> of dizziness that John experienced shortly after returning to work in<br>> August 2014. John's doctor confirmed that occasional dizziness was a<br>> common issue for dialysis patients and would not impact his ability to<br>> fulfill his job duties.<br>><br>> The jury did not find SkyWest's arguments convincing. It awarded John<br>> a judgment consisting of \$450,000.00 in actual damages, plus \$2<br>> million in punitive damages. SkyWest's apparent financial incentive to<br>> get rid of John Hayes was likely a factor contributing to the verdict.<br>> SkyWest self-funds its health insurance. It would save a lot of money<br>> if it fired John, rather than insuring him.\[1\](#JDOmw){#cite-JDOmw<br>> .citation_link}<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-JDOmw){.citation_index} [[Wrongful Termination under the<br>ADA and FMLA - Norton Frickey<br>P.C.](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=ba5e32&url=https://www.coloradolaw.com/2017/10/05/wrongful-termination-ada-fmla/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="coloradolaw.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
