<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>You have two questions in here.<br><br>What do American Christians think of British Christians?<br><br>**What do Americans who don\'t like socialized medicine think of Britons<br>who love Socialist \sic\ medicine?**<br><br>So let me answer the first because it\'s the easiest: *What do American<br>Christians think of British Christians?* Well, nothing in particular,<br>other than they happen to be Christians in a different part of the<br>world. I wonder if they face any unique struggles in the land where the<br>Church of England was born.<br><br>As for the second question, *What do Americans who don\'t like<br>socialized medicine think of Britons who love Socialist* \sic\<br>*medicine?* And I think part of your answer lies in your spelling error.<br>I consider myself somewhere between a conservative and a libertarian.<br>Therefore I\'m somewhere between small federal government and personal<br>freedoms are the order of the day. That said, I am no fan of socialism,<br>because it can never work in reality. It works on paper, where everyone<br>is perfect and all resources are abundant. However, any system would<br>work perfectly in those conditions (capitalism, socialism, fascism, and<br>communism).<br><br>*But we\'re not in those conditions.* We are imperfect people, in an<br>imperfect world, with limited resources. So you\'re actually comparing<br>*imperfect Capitalism* to *imperfect Socialism*, and under those<br>conditions, Socialism fails, every time, in every place in which it has<br>been tried.<br><br>Socialism promises Utopia and can\'t deliver. Neither can Capitalism,<br>but it\'s not promising anything.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
