<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The food is much better in the Air Force than in any other service. No<br>disrespect to any of my other-service colleagues, but it just is.<br><br>The Air Force is the youngest service, only being around since 1947. The<br>Army, Navy, and Marine Corps have been around as long as the country has<br>been around. The Air Force is smaller, leaner, and generally less<br>encumbered by \"the way things have always been done\" than any of the<br>other services. The Air Force is generally more technologically<br>advanced, followed closely by the Navy, and flies all of the<br>reconnaissance aircraft and satellites, so much of their work is<br>directly tied to intelligence.<br><br>It is true that physical fitness standards, and how they are exercised<br>and measured, are different amongst the services. But this is primarily<br>due to their missions. The Army and the Marine Corps are the most<br>physically fit, and exercise regularly, together as a unit. Their<br>missions involve them fighting, physically, hand-to-hand, on the ground.<br>The Air Force has physical standards that must be maintained (body fat<br>percentage, physical standards in sit ups, push ups, pull ups, and<br>aerobics), but they allow their personnel to work out on their own.<br>Their mission is not directly tied to the physical fitness of their<br>personnel (except for some career fields), but physical fitness is<br>emphasized to a lesser degree than the other services. The mission comes<br>first.<br><br>It\'s a study in irony: it\'s called the Air Force, but only 13% of the<br>people who work in it can actually fly airplanes. UAVs change that<br>number, as more people who are traditionally not pilot-qualified can<br>still fly. In stark contrast, everyone in the Marine Corps is a Rifleman<br>first and foremost, and then can have a different career field from<br>there.<br><br>That said, the career field offerings in the Air Force are some of the<br>most technologically challenging (and necessary) career fields in the<br>known world. The people who work there are some of the smartest, most<br>driven individuals you will ever hope to meet, who love their country<br>dearly, and would give their lives in her defense (as the members of any<br>of our military branches would do).<br><br>We do like to do a lot of good-natured teasing of the other services<br>(for example, our names: grunts, squids, jarheads and zoomies), but we<br>are all there for the same purpose: to support and defend the<br>Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic.<br><br>Here\'s my whole answer in a nutshell:<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-d6cf96e644fc8326570825826ee1ef0c){.portrait .qtext_image<br>.zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-d6cf96e644fc8326570825826ee1ef0c" master_w="236"<br>master_h="271"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>Note that this is only partially true, as the Air Force\'s whole mission<br>is Aviation, and this is only an Army/Air Force comparison. But it\'s<br>pretty much accurate. I hated when cable was out. Because when it was, I<br>had to go fix it.<br><br>\<br><br>Hi readers! I'm moving! No, not my house, my column!
