<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Nope. I have little to no hope of changing your mind. You have already<br>declared yourself "pro-choice," so you've already determined that the<br>convenience of the mother trumps the life of the baby.<br><br>Maybe you've got a pocketful of "Buts" that keeps you on the pro-choice<br>side:<br><br>But what about rape? This is the only place that I will give a<br>little ground, because the woman was an *unwilling participant* in the<br>act creating a child. Any argument which discusses responsibility cannot<br>include a rape victim.<br><br>But I'll only give a little ground. Why? *The baby is a victim, too.*<br>Since when do we kill innocent third-parties when someone else was the<br>victim of a crime? Does that really sound like the appropriate answer?<br><br>I may not think it is, but I am willing to consider reasonable solutions<br>(i.e. at the conclusion of the police investigation which initially<br>establishes that the woman was not lying about being raped, she is given<br>an abortifactent).<br><br>**But what if the woman did not consent to carrying a baby? What if she<br>used protection?** No ground given here. The woman consented to carrying<br>a baby the moment she allowed a penis to enter her vagina. The woman was<br>a *willing participant* in the very act that creates children.<br><br>Let's say I stick my hand in a blast furnace, but I'm wearing a<br>fireproof glove. Can I still get burned? Of course I can. The glove<br>could fail. I could be wearing it incorrectly. Regardless of why, I knew<br>that such was the possibility the moment I stuck my gloved hand into the<br>blast furnace. Believing that a condom-wrapped penis is a 100% guarantee<br>against accidental impregnation is clearly a mistake; it's even clearly<br>written on the box. Claiming that you did not consent to carrying a<br>child because of it is plain, unadulterated ignorance. Birth control<br>never has been 100% effective. There is always the possibility that you<br>can get pregnant, even while using birth control.<br><br>But what about healthcare? Isn't abortion health care? No, it is<br>not. Abortion is very, very rarely part of normal women's health care.<br>And even if it was required to save the life of the mother, it would be<br>permitted. No one would ever seek to override a doctor who said that it<br>was either the mom or the baby, but only one would live. But those<br>incidents are shockingly rare. Modern health care (which includes<br>obstetric care) means that giving birth is very, very safe. I won't get<br>into the corner cases, because corner cases always exist, but I also<br>won't allow all abortions simply because corner cases exist.<br><br>**But you just want to control women! You want to keep them barefoot and<br>pregnant in the kitchen!** Um, no I don't. I'm really not interested in<br>controlling women. I'm simply interested in saving lives, and to me, it<br>appears that pro-choice advocates are simply ignoring the fact that<br>pregnancy involves *two lives*, the life of the mother, and the life<br>of the baby. Why isn't the baby's life ever considered?<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-c7f2aa1f7efb591f3f029b855f8861c6){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-c7f2aa1f7efb591f3f029b855f8861c6"<br>master_w="1000" master_h="1000"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>And I know we as a country have a long way to go to improve the<br>adoption process in this country. We must make it easier for women<br>to give up their babies for adoption. We must make it easier for<br>prospective parents to adopt babies. We must provide assistance to<br>adoptive parents in just the same way we incentivize single motherhood<br>today. I don't deny any of that. This transition wouldn't be easy.<br><br>But we must try. Continually justifying 99% of abortions out of<br>convenience because 1% of abortions are due to rape is unacceptable to<br>me.<br><br>But yeah, none of this will likely change your mind. Because if you're<br>truly pro-choice, most of you already have formulated snappy comebacks<br>to each one of these arguments. I don't want to hear them, because I've<br>already heard them all and you can't change my mind. The rest of you<br>probably want to harass me as a sexist or misogynist, or some other<br>"ist" and tell me that because I have a penis I can't have an opinion.<br>I'll save you from yourselves, help you not get into BNBR trouble, and<br>just turn off comments now.<br><br>\<br><br>*Sorry, no comments on this one.*<br><br>*If you don\'t like what I wrote, tough shit. If my answer is<br>grammatically low-quality or is un-cited opinion masquerading as fact,<br>downvote it. If you think I\'m wrong, write your own answer. But Quora<br>is a question-and-answer site, not a debate site. If you were simply<br>going to comment to tell me \"ackshually, you\'re wrong,\" then you're<br>the reason why I disable comments. Well done, Karen. You ruined it for<br>everyone.*<br><br>\<br><br>Originally answered:<br><br>I\'m pro-choice.
