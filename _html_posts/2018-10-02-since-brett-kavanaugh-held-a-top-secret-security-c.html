<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Since Brett Kavanaugh held a top secret security clearance in the Bush<br>administration, do you believe the FBI background investigation process<br>is flawed?**<br><br>Maybe I don't understand what you're asking.<br><br>Are you asking whether or not Kavanaugh should have ever received a TS<br>clearance if he's such a sexual predator? Meaning the FBI should have<br>caught this? I'll presume that's what you're asking.<br><br>As the subject of continuous background investigations and Periodic<br>Reviews (PRs), I feel reasonably qualified to answer your question.<br><br>Maybe if he underwent just one background investigation, the<br>investigators might have missed something. A second probably would have<br>picked up any missing information from the first. Three investigations?<br>By the third, they're just re-hashing everything they have already<br>found; there is nothing new to find. Judge Kavanaugh has been the<br>subject of seven background investigations. It is nearly a<br>statistical impossibility that over the course of seven background<br>investigations that information such as this would not be revealed.<br><br>Therefore, to answer your question, there are two possibilities.<br><br>1.  *The FBI background investigation process is flawed*. There is<br>    something that they are intentionally or procedurally missing, and<br>    it is causing them to overlook key details of a person's life, such<br>    that Kavanaugh's sexual assault history could have been completely<br>    missed over the course of seven background investigations.<br>2.  *The FBI background investigation process is not flawed at all*.<br>    Maybe it's working just fine, and there's simply nothing to find.<br><br>Is it more plausible to say that the background investigation process is<br>*flawed* such that key components of an individual's background are<br>being missed, or is it more plausible to say that the background<br>investigation process is *not flawed* and there is simply nothing to<br>find?<br><br>It's more plausible to say that the FBI knows exactly what they are<br>doing when it comes to *their core responsibility, the one that's in<br>their name:* *investigation.*<br><br>**Therefore, it's far more likely that the background investigation<br>process is not flawed, and there's simply nothing there to find.**<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
