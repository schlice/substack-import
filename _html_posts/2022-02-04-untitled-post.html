<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The municipal judge did what he was supposed to do, in cases where<br>children want abortions without parental consent, and appeal to the<br>court. Florida makes them prove they are intelligent enough to<br>understand their choice. The judge evaluated everything the law told him<br>to evaluate, and that included intelligence.<br><br>She claimed she was a B student but her grades showed she had a 2.0 GPA<br>(which, in case you don't know letter grades, is not a B). The judge<br>said because of that, she was either lying, or stupid. Or, in<br>judge-speak, "she either has a lack of intelligence, or a lack of<br>credibility."<br><br>She won on appeal, because the local court judge did not allow her to<br>clarify her statement. Yes, she had a 2.0 GPA, but she was now making<br>B's and was hoping to pull up her GPA. She acknowledged she was not<br>ready to be a mother. She also researched, and found she did not want to<br>carry the baby to term to give it up for adoption, and she also stated<br>she wanted to consult with her doctor (which also requires parental<br>consent, or a court order).<br><br>Hope that helps to clear it up a little.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>\"either a lack of intelligence or credibility\", is why a judge denied<br>a 17 yr old an abortion without parental consent. This is in Florida.<br>Would a lack of those attributes be a good reason to become a parent at<br>any age? She did appeal and won.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
