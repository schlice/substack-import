<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Good old fashioned gumshoe detective work.<br><br>You can use the interview tactic. Bring them into the office and tell<br>them that another employee rolled over on them and you're going to have<br>to fire them unless they come clean about the theft. But this is<br>dangerous because it's possible that they didn't actually do what you<br>claim they did. You have to be certain beyond a reasonable doubt that<br>they are the thief. The detective's mantra: you never ask a question<br>which you don't already know the answer to.<br><br>You could also continue to watch and collect circumstantial evidence.<br>Eventually, when you get enough evidence, even without "catching them<br>red-handed," you'll be able to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that they<br>are the thief, and you can fire them for it.<br><br>Or finally, you can simply relocate them to another position that has no<br>access to the item they are stealing, or you can fire them for something<br>else. In the United States, at-will employment means that the employer<br>can fire the employee for any reason (except for legally protected<br>reasons), so find another reason to fire them, and do it.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>How could I prove an employee is stealing when they never do it on<br>camera and I can\'t just search them?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
