<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>No.<br><br>The definition of murder is to unlawfully take a life. You could also<br>say that murder is the taking of a life without justification.<br><br>Thus, taking a life *with justification* is not murder. It is<br>homicide (the killing of a human), but it is *justified homicide*<br>(which we call "justifiable homicide," or the taking of a life with<br>justification).<br><br>Murder is specifically taking a life without justification.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
