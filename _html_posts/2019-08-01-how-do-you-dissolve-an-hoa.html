State law determines what is required<br>in your state. All required homeowners will have to sign an official<br>legal document expressing their approval of the disbanding.<br><br>You will also need to hire a real estate attorney to assist with the<br>transaction, as there is usually community property which will need to<br>be disposed of, and utilities and general liability insurance which will<br>need to be paid by someone. There are also filing fees with the city<br>which will need to be paid. Often, there are charitable organizations<br>who will take over the community property; your attorney can help put<br>you in touch with them. The city must also approve, and any back taxes<br>will need to be paid.<br><br>Once all the community property is disposed of and agreements have been<br>made about paying for insurance and utilities, and all homeowners agree,<br>the lawyer helps you execute the document and files with the city.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
