<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**How do you get justice if the statute of limitations has expired in a<br>sexual assault (non rape) on a minor case?**<br><br>Ah, I see you want "justice," eh? Well then, I have a few questions:<br><br>- What is "justice?" How is it different from "fairness?"<br>- Why do we have a statute of limitations?<br>- Why can't we bring a charge after the statute of limitations has<br>  expired?<br>- Finally, are you sure you want "justice," or maybe do you want<br>  something else?<br><br>So first, let's look at this concept of "justice." Justice means *to<br>deliver a consequence which is just*. Notice that it does not say "to<br>deliver a consequence which is fair" or "to deliver a consequence which<br>punishes someone." It says "to deliver a consequence which is just."<br>What does that mean? Let me illustrate with an example. One of my three<br>children does something awesome, deserving of a treat, which he<br>receives. One of my other children sees this and says, "Hey, I didn't<br>get a treat! That's not fair!" I say, "Are you sure you want everything<br>to be fair? Because that means that I'll have to be fair in everything,<br>both good and bad. Which means the next time he does something wrong,<br>you'll also receive his punishment, because that's fair. Does that sound<br>like something you want?" Of course, they say no. I conclude: "So are<br>you sure you want what's fair? Or do you instead want what's *just*?<br>That everyone gets exactly what they deserve?"<br><br>My children just learned the difference between *justice* and *fairness*<br>(and now you did, too).<br><br>So is it *just* to have a statute of limitations, after which you cannot<br>bring a charge for a specific crime? To answer that question, you must<br>answer whether or not it is just to allow a trial to take place when we<br>have admittedly poor or fuzzy memories of an incident, when physical<br>evidence has degraded to such a degree that it becomes virtually<br>unusable to prove or disprove anything. To proceed to trial with such<br>evidence, would this be *just*? It might, but it certainly is not<br>*fair*. Fairness in trials means that everyone has an *equal<br>opportunity* to receive justice. Is it fair to have a trial 20 years<br>after an incident and expect justice to be served in the same way as it<br>would be served only two weeks after an incident? It is clearly unfair,<br>to all parties involved. Therefore, we can say that it would be *unjust*<br>to allow a trial to proceed with such weak evidence. It is unfair<br>because it does not provide an equal opportunity to receive justice<br>under the law.<br><br>If you're reading this and thinking to yourself, "Yeah, but after X<br>amount of time (and after the statute of limitations has expired), the<br>guy gets away with it! Someone has to pay!" then you're probably not<br>looking for *justice*. Instead, you're looking for "an eye for an eye,"<br>you're looking for "a pound of flesh," you're looking for someone to pay<br>for what has happened to you. You are, instead, looking for<br>*retribution*, not *justice*. If you are looking for justice, then it is<br>just that a trial not proceed after the statute of limitations has<br>expired, and justice is indeed served. It always irks me when an<br>accused killer is found not guilty of murder and the family gets in<br>front of the cameras and says that "justice was not served." They don't<br>want justice. They want retribution. They want someone to pay for what<br>happened. They don't actually want to see "justice" done.<br><br>So to answer your question: **How do you get justice if the statute of<br>limitations has expired in a sexual assault (non rape) on a minor<br>case?** You understand that if this much time has elapsed since the<br>incident, then justice has indeed been served, as the appropriate<br>outcome at this time in this case has taken place: there will be no<br>criminal trial. That is justice: everyone gets exactly what they<br>deserve. And even defendants deserve to have a fair trial. And if you<br>can't have a fair trial, then it is just that no trial be held.<br><br>Maybe you should be asking how you get closure and how you can stop<br>dwelling on it and move on after such an incident instead of how you get<br>justice. That's a whole different question, and you don't ask it of<br>people who comment on the law. The law deals with justice. Counselors<br>and psychologists deal with closure.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
