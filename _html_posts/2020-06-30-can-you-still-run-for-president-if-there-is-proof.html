<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Can you still run for president if there is proof that you are a<br>traitor?**<br><br>Yes. Proof of a war crime is not a disqualification from being elected<br>president. In fact, the Constitution only lists *qualifications* for the<br>Presidency, not *conditions which may disqualify you*.<br><br>On the other hand, if you have been found guilty of treason, you<br>probably won't be running for President any time soon, as you will<br>likely be on Death Row.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
