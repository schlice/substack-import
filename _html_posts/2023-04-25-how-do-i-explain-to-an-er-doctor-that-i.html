<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>You say, "I'm having an MS exacerbation and I need solumedrol via IV."<br><br>The true answer is that while you'll be able to (eventually) convince<br>them of the former, you won't be able to tell them that you need<br>corticosteroids. They will have to come to that conclusion on their own.<br><br>Therefore, you should prepare now for the eventuality that you'll need<br>to explain to an emergency room doctor that you have MS.<br><br>*But how do you do that?* You should have copies of your MRIs with you<br>at all times, copies of the radiologist readings from your MRIs, and<br>copies of your neurologist's medical records (or online access to them).<br>Clearly, you don't want to spend your life lugging around either films<br>or CDs, so you'll need to be able to electronically save those things.<br><br>*But how do you do* *that**?* What I have done is created "ISO<br>images" of my CDs from my MRIs. The name ISO was taken from the name of<br>the file system used by optical media, which is usually ISO 9660. You<br>can think of an ISO image as a complete copy of everything stored on a<br>physical optical disc like CD, DVD, or Blu-ray disc---including the file<br>system itself. They are a sector-by-sector copy of the disc, and no<br>compression is used. The idea behind ISO images is that you can archive<br>an exact digital copy of a disc, and then later use that image to burn a<br>new disc that's in turn an exact copy of the original.<br><br>Think of ISO images as a pile of wet sand. You take an object and press<br>it down into the sand, and it leaves an "image" behind. Fill that image<br>with wax or latex and you can re-create the object using the image. ISO<br>images work the same way.<br><br>Additionally, software exists which allows you to load an ISO image into<br>a virtual CD drive and simply read it as if it was already written to a<br>CD.<br><br>You can use free (donationware) software such as<br>[ImgBurn(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=9fe271&url=https://www.imgburn.com/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="imgburn.com"}]{.qlink_container} to create ISOs from your<br>CDs or DVDs with your MRIs on them. Don't have your DVDs? Every time you<br>get an MRI, you should get a DVD with your images on it. They didn't<br>hand you one? Ask for one! They will burn one for you in just a few<br>minutes. Then, using a computer with a physical DVD drive (which is<br>becoming rarer and rarer these days), you can take an ISO image of the<br>DVD.<br><br>Now, take all those ISO images and load them out to your favorite cloud<br>storage provider (Google Drive, OneDrive, etc). Now you always have your<br>MRI CDs everywhere you go! I also store the radiologist reports out<br>there. I have about 15 years of MRIs and radiologist reports stored in<br>my Google Drive, and can share them anywhere as needed. I also have<br>online access to my neurologist's notes and reports, and can also grant<br>that access as needed.<br><br>Once the ER doc realizes you have MS, they should do a neurology consult<br>to determine how best to help you. Expect this to take some time in the<br>ER.<br><br>Ultimately they will help you, but it may take some time for them to<br>come to the correct conclusion regarding the help you need.<br><br>\<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*This answer is not professional medical advice, nor is it a substitute<br>for professional medical advice. This answer is for GENERAL<br>INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. If you think you are experiencing a medical<br>emergency, call your local emergency number (in the United States, 911)<br>immediately.
