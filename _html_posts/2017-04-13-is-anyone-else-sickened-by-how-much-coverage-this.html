<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I'm not seeing the same thing you are.<br><br>It must be where we are getting our news from that is the problem. My<br>guess is you are following the mainstream media, and they have an agenda<br>to push. It's the same agenda that Leftists (who are different from<br>liberals) are pushing: **corporations are bad and evil and need to be<br>tightly controlled.** So they will do whatever they need to do to<br>advance their agenda, including wall-to-wall coverage of the "little<br>guy" fighting back against the "evil corporation." So I bet you're<br>seeing continuous coverage of every statement the guy's lawyer is<br>making, and anything else they can dredge up about him or United<br>Airlines.<br><br>It plays right into our overall frustration with airlines in general, so<br>it's a compelling story. United is one of the world's biggest carriers,<br>so it's natural for the mainstreams to stick with this story like it's<br>going out of style.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
