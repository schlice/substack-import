<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What\'s a homeowners association, how is it legal, and why can\'t you<br>just ignore their rules and live however you want in your own home?**<br><br>A Homeowner's Association (HOA) is generally a 501(c)4 non-profit<br>corporation. Its primary mission is to keep home values in a specific<br>area as high as possible. They do this by creating and maintaining<br>policies that keep the neighborhood neat, keeping homes looking good,<br>and providing other services for homeowners. HOAs provide a benefit to<br>homeowners by keeping your home's value as high as possible by<br>maintaining a great community that people want to live in. That<br>perceived value keeps your individual home values high. They do this not<br>by controlling what you do with your home, they do this by making sure<br>that your *neighbors* don't do things that will negatively impact your<br>home's value.<br><br>When you buy a house in a community controlled by an HOA, you sign a<br>contract. That's what makes it legal. You agreed to HOA control when you<br>bought your house. The contract is called a "covenant." You may have<br>heard the phrase, "a covenant-controlled community." That means that all<br>of the homeowners have signed on to a "covenant" which is basically a<br>shared contract that everyone agrees to follow.<br><br>You could sign on to an HOA and then ignore their rules, but you risk<br>your finances by doing this. The HOA can fine you, and if you do not pay<br>your fines, they can put a lien on your home. This is part of the<br>covenants: the HOA has a financial interest in your property. If the HOA<br>puts a lien on your home, you can't sell or refinance until that lien is<br>satisfied. If you still don't pay, the HOA can *foreclose* on your lien<br>in order to satisfy their unpaid debt. This usually means that they will<br>have to sell your house, right out from under you, to pay that debt.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
