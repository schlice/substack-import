<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Thanks for the question<br>[Isak(https://www.quora.com/profile/Isak-Pau)]{.qlink_container}.<br><br>From the Academy Admissions website:<br><br>> In order to be considered for admission to the United States Air Force<br>> Academy you must be nominated by your country. Nominations from your<br>> government are processed through the United States Defense Attaché<br>> Office/American Embassy serving your country. Nominations must be<br>> received by the Air Force Academy by 14 December for the class<br>> entering the following June.<br>><br>> To apply for a nomination, write your country's government. Your<br>> letter should contain complete details about your background and your<br>> potential for success at the Academy. It should be received at least<br>> one year prior to the date of admission. The Defense Attaché Office at<br>> the American Embassy can direct you to the correct ministry in your<br>> country. DO NOT apply directly to the Air Force Academy or other<br>> United States government officials.<br><br>I would just write the letter. Add bullets if you like.
