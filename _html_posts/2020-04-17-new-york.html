<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**New York\'s governor just signed an executive order requiring everyone<br>to wear a face covering. Why did this come so late?**<br><br>*What leads you to believe that this is late?*<br><br>The state was already under a mandatory stay-at-home order, so mandatory<br>face coverings were largely unnecessary, as most non-essential<br>businesses were closed anyway. The governor is now trying to set the<br>conditions under which he can start advising people to go back to work<br>and re-open the state. He has decided that everyone wearing face<br>coverings in public is a start. It's such a good start, that he's doing<br>it now for everyone. If we can't slow the spread with social distancing<br>only, we'll help slow the spread by mandating face coverings.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
