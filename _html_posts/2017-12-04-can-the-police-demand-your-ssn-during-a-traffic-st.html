  stopped last night, gave his required documents & said the cop asked him for his
  SSN. He said he was reluctant but the cop told him it was the law that he had to
  provide it."'

<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>As a driver, you are required to give your real name to police, and in<br>almost all states, failing to provide your real name is against the law.<br><br>**Your Social Security Number is not part of the information required<br>during a traffic stop.**<br><br>You are required to give your name and your address. You are required<br>(if you are the driver) to provide your real driver's license, proof of<br>insurance, and vehicle registration.<br><br>You are not required to answer any other questions.<br><br>I'm becoming much more attune to when I should be giving out my PII<br>(personally identifying information) and when I should not. I was<br>checking my son into the ER (he's okay now) and they wanted my insurance<br>card (of course) and my credit card (also, of course), but they also<br>asked me for my SSN. I said, "Why? You already have my insurance card."<br>She said, "Yeah, it usually helps if the person doesn't have insurance."<br>I said, "Well then, let's try leaving it out and see if the system<br>accepts it, shall we?" And we did, and it seemed to work.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
