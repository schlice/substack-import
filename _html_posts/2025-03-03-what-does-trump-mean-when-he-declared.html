<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>We've already spent billions of dollars in Ukraine with no strings<br>attached. We're not going to continue funding an unwinnable war.<br><br>What does that mean, *unwinnable*? Let's be honest. What's Zelenskyy's<br>end game here? Is he going to overthrow Russia? Does he think that he<br>can completely force Russia out of Ukraine and ignore Russia's claim on<br>the territory? The Donbas region has been *actively* disputed between<br>the two countries for at least ten years, but has been *actually*<br>disputed for much longer. Who gets it? Who are we to determine who gets<br>it? Ukraine says they won't sign any peace deal that cedes any territory<br>to Russia. At some point, compromise is going to have to be reached. And<br>peace deals necessarily involve compromise. That means that no one will<br>be 100% happy. That's the very nature of compromise.<br><br>Trump has been trying to bring both sides to the table to negotiate a<br>peace deal. But if both sides are going to be intransigent, then nothing<br>is going to be accomplished. Zelenskyy is going to have to realize that<br>he's going to have to give up something in order to end this war. Russia<br>will have to realize that annexing all of Ukraine is off the table. And<br>our America First president isn't going to enforce any deals unless<br>America is repaid for the billions we wasted funding an unwinnable war.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
