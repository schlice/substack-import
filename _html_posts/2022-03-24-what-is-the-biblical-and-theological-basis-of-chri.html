<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The vast majority of Christians do not have a religious basis to oppose<br>vaccinations. There are no denominations of Christianity which have come<br>out in opposition to vaccines, and actually, many churches and<br>denominations have publicly endorsed them. So it will be an uphill<br>battle for a Christian to request a religious exemption.<br><br>We are indeed concerned about those who are not sincerely religious<br>abusing the waiver system in order to avoid vaccination. Abusing the<br>waiver system threatens the ability to receive waivers at all, including<br>for the people who truly need it. Some states are looking at removing<br>religious exemptions completely because of the influx of people seeking<br>religious waivers.<br><br>Some Christians may object to the fact that the vaccine was tested using<br>cells which were derived from an abortion in the 70's. This is a valid<br>exception, but in order to substantiate this exception, these Christians<br>must also show that they have rejected every other vaccine which was<br>tested on those cells, such as the vaccines against Chickenpox,<br>Hepatitis A & B, Typhoid, Measles-Mumps-Rubella (MMR), Polio, Rabies,<br>and Shingles. Otherwise, their opposition to the COVID-19 vaccine on<br>those grounds might be seen as inconsistent, and may even be regarded as<br>being made in bad faith. Granted, many of those vaccines may have been<br>administered while the person was a baby (so it was outside of their<br>personal control), but any vaccine which was tested on those cells for<br>which they had personal control, during the time that they were active<br>in their faith, should have also been similarly rejected.<br><br>Before a Christian refuses a vaccine on religious grounds, they should<br>do some very serious investigation to see if they actually have the<br>grounds to request the exemption. Requesting religious exemptions when<br>they do not apply harms others who have actual religious exemptions by<br>unknowingly abusing rules that are meant to protect others.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>What is the biblical and theological basis of Christian opposition to<br>vaccines and vaccination?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
