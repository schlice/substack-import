<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Yes, most states will issue fines for jurors skipping out on jury duty.<br>The possibility exists that you can also be cited for contempt of court<br>under state law, or if you're called to a Federal jury, under 28 U.S.C.<br>ยง 1966(g). Contempt of court charges for failing to show up in court<br>could land you in jail for up to three days for a federal case. State<br>laws differ, but you can face jail time.<br><br>In most cases, jail is reserved for habitual jury summons ignorers. Here<br>in Florida, it's estimated that around 3/4 of the people served with<br>jury summonses will ignore them. Most of those people actually have<br>legitimate exemptions from jury service and are excused. In Broward<br>County, over a decade's time, only 33 people faced contempt charges for<br>skipping jury duty, and only four were jailed.<br><br>So it's highly unlikely that you'd go to jail. It's far more likely that<br>you'll be fined. In Florida, you'll be fined \$100 for failing to show<br>for jury duty.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
