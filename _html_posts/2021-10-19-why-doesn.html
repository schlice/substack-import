<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Android does allow root access as a permission. Smartphone<br>manufacturers and carriers do not.**<br><br>You can include an open-source operating system on a closed-source<br>device and then proceed to lock down the open-source operating system.<br>This is what happens in the case of Android.<br><br>When Android is bundled with carrier and manufacturer software, their<br>software overlays remove the ability for Android users to gain root<br>access in order to protect the integrity of some of their hardware and<br>software features, and also in order to maintain the stability of the<br>devices and provide the best overall user experience.<br><br>For example, Samsung phones include Knox software to provide for a<br>*trusted computing base* (TCB) on which app providers can build apps<br>securely, like banking apps, and can also allow users to load virtual<br>credit cards and other items which require special protection and<br>handling. But it is only the stability and security of the TCB which<br>allows these software writers to make these apps and provide any sort of<br>guarantee to their users (and to the banks that issue the credit cards)<br>that their information is safe within the app from hackers. In other<br>words, when you lock your phone, your data within the TCB is secure and<br>cannot be obtained until you unlock your phone. The TCB provides this.<br><br>Root-level access could bypass the security protocols in Knox and<br>invalidate the security of the TCB. So if you root your Samsung phone,<br>an e-fuse is tripped, and Knox software will no longer function because<br>the safety and stability of the TCB can no longer be guaranteed.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Why doesn\'t Android allow root access as just another permission (or<br>via an opt-in option in the developer menu)?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
