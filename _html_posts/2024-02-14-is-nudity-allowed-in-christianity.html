<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>After Adam and Eve sinned, their eyes were opened and they realized they<br>were naked, and they felt *shame* and *embarrassment* at their nudity.<br>In a sad attempt to cover their shame, they used fig leaves to attempt<br>to cover themselves. This shows us that our fallen nature as humans has<br>caused us to be instinctively aware that our nudity is something<br>*shameful*, something we should keep hidden or covered. This is also<br>highlighted by the fact that God created coverings of skin for the pair,<br>something a bit more substantial and permanent than those woven fig<br>leaves. God was demonstrating that, in a newly fallen world, clothing is<br>both appropriate and necessary.<br><br>We still live in a fallen world, surrounded by lust, immorality, and<br>perversion. The innocence of Eden is gone. We should be cautious about<br>nudity, and reserve it for our spouses only. This is the only place in<br>which nudity is permitted in Christianity: within the confines of<br>marriage.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
