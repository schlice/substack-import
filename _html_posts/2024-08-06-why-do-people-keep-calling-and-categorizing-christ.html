<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I'm going to take umbrage with a few of your assertions (okay, all of<br>them):<br><br>1.  Christianity is a religion, if you hold to the traditional<br>    definition of what we consider to be a religion. It's true, there is<br>    no complete scholarly consensus over what precisely constitutes a<br>    religion, but we know that religion in general is a personal set, or<br>    institutionalized system, of religious attitudes, beliefs, and<br>    practices, the service and worship of God or the supernatural, and a<br>    commitment or devotion to religious faith or observance.<br>2.  Jesus wasn't against religious establishment in and of itself. He<br>    was against faith in the religion *over faith in God*. He was<br>    against making the practice of religion into a religion all on its<br>    own. When this happens, the religion aspect takes on more importance<br>    than the worship of God. Judaism had this problem during the time of<br>    the Sanhedrin just as Roman Catholicism faces similar issues today.<br>3.  Jesus' mission was not to "project the last frontier of human<br>    consciousness." Jesus as both fully human and fully divine will<br>    only be experienced by Jesus. We will receive **new perfected<br>    bodies** after we are resurrected, but we will not be fully divine<br>    like Jesus. We will not become gods. We will remain, as we are<br>    today, *children of God*, adopted into His Kingdom, made righteous<br>    by His sacrifice.\<br>    \<br>    Jesus' mission was to reconnect us to God. He came to restore us to<br>    our Heavenly Father. He was the only one who could. And He did.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
