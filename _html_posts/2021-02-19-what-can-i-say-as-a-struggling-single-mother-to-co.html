<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What can I say as a struggling single mother to convince my landlord<br>not to evict me after 4 months of inability to pay?**<br><br>You asked this question on February 19th, 2021 (and I'm answering it the<br>same day). We've already been hit hard for nearly a year by an economic<br>shutdown precipitated by the government's response to COVID-19.<br><br>So what do you tell him? Read the news.<br><br>[[Biden extends the national ban on evictions through March<br>2021](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=6579f1&url=https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/20/biden-to-extend-the-national-ban-on-evictions-through-march-2021.html){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="cnbc.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>You have at least one more month before you can be evicted if you lost<br>your job because of COVID-19.<br><br>I would suggest using that month to find a new place to live if you<br>cannot pay for your current place. This is a gift; you do not want an<br>eviction on your credit report as a single mother.<br><br>Find a place to go. If you have no friends or family who can take you<br>in, contact a local church in your area. Any one. You don't even have to<br>be a member (but if I may be so bold, find a Christian church near you).<br>If you don't want to go the church route, you can always try local<br>government assistance agencies, womens' shelters, or even the Red Cross.<br>They can all help you find at least a temporary place for you and your<br>child.<br><br>But whatever you do, move out before you are evicted.<br><br>You must understand that under most conditions, landlords do not own<br>*outright* the buildings they are leasing. They've taken out mortgages,<br>or they work for another company which owns the property, which also<br>leveraged funds to purchase the property. *THAT* money is going to come<br>due at some point. You literally cannot kick the can down the road<br>forever. Sooner or later, even these chickens will come home to roost,<br>and someone will have to pay. You can bet your bottom dollar that it<br>will eventually be you.<br><br>So do yourself a favor and if you cannot find work, spend your time<br>trying to find some kind of temporary housing for yourself and your<br>child, and then go.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
