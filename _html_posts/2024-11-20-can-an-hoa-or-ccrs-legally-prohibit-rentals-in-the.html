<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Yes.<br><br>HOAs can prevent rentals for a variety of reasons. The neighborhood may<br>choose to favor long-term residents over temporary residents. They may<br>also believe that when the owner lives in the house they own, they take<br>better care of it than someone who does not own the house they live in.<br>There could be a variety of reasons that an HOA may choose to prohibit<br>rentals. The bottom line is that yes, the CC&Rs of a HOA-controlled<br>neighborhood can prohibit rentals.<br><br>Normally, what they do these days is prevent *short-term rentals* like<br>AirBnBs or VRBOs. They may say something like rental contracts must be<br>for a period of no less than six months. They may even make owners<br>submit a copy of the rental agreement to the HOA for approval before it<br>is signed.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
