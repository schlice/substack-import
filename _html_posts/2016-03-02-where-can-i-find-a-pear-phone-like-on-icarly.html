<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Sadly, the pear phone and the pear pad that they use on Nickelodeon<br>shows such as *iCarly* and *Victorious* is not real. It is a prop, and a<br>pretty blatant take on Apple products (get it? Apple, Pear, both fruits<br>roughly the same size, etc)<br><br>You can get a pear phone case and pear phone stickers to theme your<br>iPhone to look like a pear phone. But in reality, there is no such thing<br>as a pear phone. It\'s a TV prop.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
