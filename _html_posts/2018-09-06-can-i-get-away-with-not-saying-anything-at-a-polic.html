<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Can I get away with not saying anything at a police stop?<br><br>The answer is "it depends."<br><br>If you are the driver of a vehicle and a "police stop" means a traffic<br>stop, you must identify yourself and you must provide your driver's<br>license, registration, and proof of insurance (if required). You can<br>refuse to answer any other questions not related to your actions while<br>driving your car. However, driver's licenses are administrative<br>documents, and your driving privilege is administered by the state as an<br>administrative program, so it is not covered by the 5th Amendment. Your<br>silence can be used as evidence against you, and your license can be<br>suspended or revoked, using your silence as a piece of evidence. For<br>example, you can refuse to take the breath test, or you can refuse to<br>take the field sobriety test, but those actions can cause you to lose<br>your license. If you refuse the breath test in the police station,<br>you're almost universally going to automatically lose your license for a<br>minimum of 6 moths.<br><br>If, by "police stop," you mean randomly stopping you on the street, you<br>still must give your real name. Beyond that, you don't have to answer<br>any questions at all. Doing so might help to speed you on your way, but<br>not doing so is not illegal. You also don't have to tell the truth about<br>anything (except for your name). You can lie all you like. You can<br>continually ask if you're free to go, until you're either arrested, or<br>released.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
