<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>People would know that the world has ended.<br><br>Science cannot prove non-existence. Legal scholar and philosopher<br>Mortimer Adler says, \"An affirmative existential proposition can be<br>proved, but a negative existential proposition---one that denies the<br>existence of something---cannot be proved.\"<br><br>For example, I could tell you that red squirrels exist, and you could<br>tell me that red squirrels do not exist. To prove my statement, I only<br>need to find evidence of one red squirrel somewhere. But to prove your<br>statement, you would literally need to be everywhere all at once in all<br>of history so that you could prove that red squirrels do not exist, and<br>never did exist. Doing that is literally not possible.<br><br>And just because you haven't discovered a red squirrel doesn't mean that<br>one does not exist.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
