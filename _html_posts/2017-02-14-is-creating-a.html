<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The answer with all things legal is, "it depends." And in most cases, it<br>depends on the site on which you are creating the account.<br><br>Most social media sites allow "groups" to be created. Anyone can create<br>any group about anyone or anything. Of course, as you rightly stated,<br>you can't slander (or more correctly, libel) anyone, especially the<br>person on whom the group is based. You are allowed by the First<br>Amendment to be disrespectful, but that may violate the site's terms of<br>service (such as the BNBR policy here).<br><br>Sites counter this by using "verified" tags for celebrities and people<br>who are well-known (i.e. authors, media talent, other celebrities, etc).<br>They have folks who will verify the authenticity of a famous person and<br>will then put a little blue check box next to their picture or name.<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-601d4ebb7081bd20baf9139804e8a161){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-601d4ebb7081bd20baf9139804e8a161" master_w="417"<br>master_h="177"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>*This is an example of a "Verified" person. I should hope so, it's*<br>[[*Jimmy<br>Wales*](https://www.quora.com/profile/Jimmy-Wales)]{.qlink_container}<br>*and that is his real account.*<br><br>Many sites have policies against impersonating others (such as Quora's<br>"real name" policy), but again, that is dependent on the site.<br><br>Of course, if you impersonate someone in an attempt to get some sort of<br>gain from the impersonation, that is patently illegal.<br><br>Specifically for Instagram, they state:<br><br>> - You must not defame, stalk, bully, abuse, harass, threaten,<br>>   impersonate or intimidate people or entities and you must not<br>>   post private or confidential information via the Service, including,<br>>   without limitation, your or any other person\'s credit card<br>>   information, social security or alternate national identity numbers,<br>>   non-public phone numbers or non-public email addresses.<br><br>This means I can't go to Instagram and make an account calling myself<br>Jimmy Wales and purport to be Jimmy. That would violate Instagram's<br>terms of service.<br><br>You also can't create an account that is actually a trademarked business<br>name. So I can't create a Coca-Cola Instagram account, as it would be<br>pretty quickly taken down.<br><br>I'd suggest doing this on Facebook, where you can quickly and easily<br>create a "group" about anything or anyone you like.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
