<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: [Shootings are never taken lightly. Shootings are fully<br>investigated, and if officers were not in fear for their lives, they<br>will then be in fear for their careers, or facing jail time.\<br>\<br>But if I told someone to get on the ground and they said I have bad<br>knees, I can\'t get down there, and I could see that their hands were<br>empty, I\'d still consider them a threat because I could imagine lots of<br>situations where people have used \"fake\" medical conditions to avoid<br>compliance.\<br>\<br>The fact that they couldn\'t get down would not justify shooting them.<br>The fact that they acted threatening and posed a real threat would. If<br>they said they had trouble moving and then started lunging at people<br>with a sharpened screwdriver, I think I wouldn\'t believe the whole \"I<br>can\'t move\" thing.\<br>\<br>That\'s where common sense comes into play.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/Why-should-I-comply-when-a-police-officer-says-Get-on-the-ground-Do-it-now/answer/Bill-Stein<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
