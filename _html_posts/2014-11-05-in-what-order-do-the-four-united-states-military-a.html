<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [[[Alan<br>Cohen](https://www.quora.com/profile/Alan-Cohen-1)]{.qlink_container}\'s<br>answer is almost correct; all the service academies require the same<br>level of physical fitness. Except that there are five service academies<br>which can introduce commissioned officers into the United States Armed<br>Forces:\<br>\<br>- US Military Academy at West Point, NY\<br>- US Naval Academy in Annapolis, MD\<br>- US Coast Guard Academy in New London, CT\<br>- US Merchant Marine Academy in Kings Point, NY\<br>- US Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, CO\<br>\<br>But consider this: at all of the others, you\'re at sea level (at<br>Annapolis, the Coast Guard Academy, and at Kings Point, you are actually<br>training to work at sea level). At the Air Force Academy, you have to do<br>the same Physical Fitness Test (PFT), but at 7258 feet above sea level.<br>Air is rare up there. It just might be a bit more<br>challenging.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
