So it is clear that God is spirit.<br><br>In Luke 24:39, Jesus said, "Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I<br>myself. Handle me and see, for a spirit does not have flesh and bones as<br>you see I have." So he makes it clear that a spirit does not have flesh<br>and bones, and we know that God is spirit.<br><br>Paul frequently wrote about the "invisible" God (Romans 1:20, Colossians<br>1:15, 1 Timothy 1:17, 1 Timothy 6:16).<br><br>We also know that God acts as a spirit, so it is less of a physical<br>description, but a mode of action. John 6:63 says, " The Spirit gives<br>life; the flesh counts for nothing. The words I have spoken to<br>you---they are full of the Spirit and life."<br><br>I think there is ample evidence in the Bible that God is spirit, and a<br>spirit has no physical body.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Does God, according to the Old and New Testament, have a body of bone<br>and flesh, or is he formless?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
