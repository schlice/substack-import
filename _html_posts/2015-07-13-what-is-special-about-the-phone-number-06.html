<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Nothing special about it, other than it\'s the designation<br>that on most phones and using most programming will produce the IMEI<br>number of the phone without having to look on a sticker or underneath<br>the battery. When I type it on my phone, it produces the IMEI and the SN<br>of the phone, along with scannable bar codes to make entry easier. This<br>is especially important with modern phones which do not have removable<br>batteries, so the IMEI is generally not printed on the outside of the<br>phone anywhere. Having a software code which will produce it is<br>important.\<br>\<br>Note that on most modern smartphones, you can go into the \"About\...\"<br>section of your phone\'s Settings and also find the IMEI and the Serial<br>Number of the phone.\<br>\<br>These programming codes were developed alongside the original mobile<br>phones which only had a traditional \"ten-key\" keypad. Most of those<br>codes became obsolete when smart phones were introduced, but some of<br>them remained.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
