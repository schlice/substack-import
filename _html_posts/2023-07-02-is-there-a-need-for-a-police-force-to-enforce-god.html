<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>A police force?<br><br>God will not force you to follow Him. God allows you to *choose* your<br>ultimate destiny.<br><br>God wants you *so badly* to choose Him, but he will never coerce you<br>into doing so.<br><br>> If you're not willing to accept Christianity, then you're free to<br>> reject it. This freedom to make choices---even the freedom to reject<br>> truth---is what makes us moral creatures and enables each of us to<br>> choose our ultimate destiny.<br>><br>> This really hits at the heart of why we exist at all, and why God<br>> might not be as overt in revealing himself to us as some would like.<br>> For if the Bible is true, then God has provided each of us with the<br>> opportunity to make an eternal choice to either accept Him or reject<br>> Him. And in order to ensure that our choice is truly free, He puts us<br>> in an environment that is filled with evidence of his existence, but<br>> without his *direct* presence---a presence so powerful that it could<br>> overwhelm our freedom and thus negate our ability to reject him.<br>><br>> In other words, *God has provided enough evidence in this life to<br>> convince anyone willing to believe, yet he has also left some<br>> ambiguity so as not to compel the unwilling.*<br>><br>> In this way, God gives us the opportunity either to love Him or to<br>> reject Him without violating our freedom. In fact, the purpose of this<br>> life is to make that choice freely and without coercion. For love, by<br>> definition, must be freely given. It cannot be coerced. That's why C.<br>> S. Lewis wrote, "the Irresistible and the Indisputable are the two<br>> weapons which the very nature of \God's\ scheme forbids Him to use.<br>> Merely to override a human will (as His felt presence in any but the<br>> faintest and most mitigated degree would certainly do) would be for<br>> Him useless. He cannot ravish. He can only<br>> woo."\[1\](#CsPub){#cite-CsPub .citation_link}<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-CsPub){.citation_index} [[I Don\'t Have Enough Faith to Be<br>an Atheist: Geisler, Norman L., Turek, Frank, Limbaugh, David:<br>9781433580758: Amazon.com:<br>Books](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=770f5b&url=https://www.amazon.com/Dont-Have-Enough-Faith-Atheist/dp/1433580756){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="amazon.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
