<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Our HOA has a rule that says that informational/celebratory/seasonal<br>signs can be up for 7 days without approval, longer if you seek<br>approval.<br><br>We also have a rule that says that you can't have signage in your<br>windows facing the street without approval.<br><br>There is nothing unconstitutional about an HOA enacting rules in<br>accordance with their Governing Documents which they can use to control<br>how the neighborhood looks. You voluntarily entered that agreement when<br>you bought a house in an HOA-controlled neighborhood. And that's where<br>you are being confused. You voluntarily allowed the HOA to control how<br>your house looks from the outside when you bought a house in a mandatory<br>HOA neighborhood.<br><br>We have a house right now that has a MAGA-leaning sign in their window,<br>and we're fighting against that one, too.<br><br>Remember, it's not the content of the sign that the HOA is concerned<br>about, it's the overall look of the neighborhood and the potential hit<br>to resale value for neighbors.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Has the Supreme Court upheld the right for people to put a sign in their<br>windows inside their own houses that can be seen from the street. A link<br>to such a case? My HOA doesn't want BLM signs inside our houses that can<br>be seen from the street.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
