<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>There is absolutely no way that the police could do such a thing.<br><br>Let's break it down:<br><br>1.  "Cops" are not one organized group. There are over 18,000 police<br>    organizations across federal, state, and local authorities,<br>    comprising on the order of a million sworn officers. There is not<br>    one "cops" organization.<br>2.  In order to get away with an organized genocide, they would all have<br>    to universally keep the secret, and their management chains would<br>    have not not only be complicit, but quiet. A cover-up of this<br>    magnitude could never be kept. There would be at least one<br>    whistleblower in the bunch.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Could cops get away with genocide of the melanated clan?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
