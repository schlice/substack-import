Yes, he can. He is the Commander-in-Chief. If he actually<br>chose to do something like that, he could.<br><br>*Would* he? No way in hell.<br><br>Besides being advised by **every single aide and military<br>representative, including every Chief of Staff and even his own<br>SecDef**, to not do such a thing, it would be *political suicide* to do<br>it, even if he was correct.<br><br>The President knows his place. He gives orders, and his generals carry<br>them out. He doesn't do the generals' jobs, just as he expects the<br>generals to not do his job, and when they presume to do his job, he<br>fires them.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
