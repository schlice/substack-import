<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>All departments train differently, but officers most definitely learn<br>this during baton training. The idea is incapacitation with a single,<br>quick blow to avoid the appearance of "beating" the suspect with<br>repeated strikes. Ideally, you want the minimum number of strikes to<br>incapacitate the suspect, at which time you can finish the takedown and<br>handcuff the suspect.<br><br>This is a part of police training called "arrest control."<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
