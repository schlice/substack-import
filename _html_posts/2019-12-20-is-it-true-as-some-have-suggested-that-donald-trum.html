<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Is it true, as some have suggested, that President Trump is ineligible<br>for any future presidential pardons because he has now been impeached?**<br><br>A Presidential pardon affects a Federal criminal conviction.<br><br>Article II, section 2 of the Constitution says that presidents "shall<br>have Power to grant Reprieves and Pardons for Offences against the<br>United States, except in Cases of Impeachment."<br><br>This means pardons don't apply to impeachment. Since impeachment is a<br>political process, pardons don't apply to impeachment. The president<br>cannot pardon any other elected official who has been impeached, and he<br>can't pardon himself and nullify the impeachment.<br><br>He can, however, be pardoned by a future president if he is convicted of<br>a Federal crime. The fact that he has been impeached does not preclude<br>him being pardoned by another president in the future.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
