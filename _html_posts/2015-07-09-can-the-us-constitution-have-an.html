<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [To answer the Constitutional question, no. There is<br>nothing you can add to an amendment that would make it unable to be<br>repealed or overridden by a later amendment.\<br>\<br>To answer the moon question, only the United States is bound by the<br>Constitution, no one else amongst \"mankind\" is bound by it. So adding<br>an amendment saying \"The moon belongs to all mankind\" only binds<br>Americans, not the rest of the world.\<br>\<br>The moon belongs to all mankind through international treaty, not the<br>Constitution. It\'s up to each individual member country to uphold that<br>treaty. Antarctica is treated the same way as the moon, although it\'s<br>much easier for a nation to get to Antarctica than to get to the<br>moon.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
