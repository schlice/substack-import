And the opposite of truth is<br>false.<br><br>Therefore, if Christians believe that the Bible describes absolute<br>truth, and that the Bible is the inspired word of God, then anything<br>opposed to it is false.<br><br>The gods of other religions are in direct opposition to the Christian<br>God, as the Bible says that YHWH is the one and only god. It's literally<br>the first of the Ten Commandments.<br><br>Therefore, any other god is false.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
