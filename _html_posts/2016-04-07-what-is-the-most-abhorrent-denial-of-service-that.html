<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>If you are referring to H.B. 2 in North Carolina, or Mississippi\'s<br>related bill, the answer is that the business can choose to run its<br>business the same way it always has: biological men use the men\'s room,<br>biological women use the women\'s room. Or it can choose to change how<br>it runs its business, allowing people who identify as something other<br>than their biological sex to use whichever restroom they feel<br>comfortable in. Or it can say that private or public restrooms are<br>available for anyone, and not specify a reason to use one or the other.<br>And people can frequent whichever businesses meet their needs and<br>whichever businesses are accommodating in the way they feel a business<br>should accommodate, and the free market will decide which businesses<br>succeed and which businesses fail.<br><br>So to answer your question, the most abhorrent denial of service that<br>could occur due to the latest religious freedom acts is that an LGBT<br>customer may be forced to use the restroom of their biological sex<br>because a business may choose to not accommodate them, and the state<br>will not force them to act otherwise. The business may choose to keep<br>everything as is, allow people to use facilities based on gender<br>identity, or provide public and private facilities.<br><br>The bills simply say that government cannot tell businesses how to<br>operate. A business is free to operate based on its own conscience, and<br>the free market will determine whether or not that business remains<br>viable after that decision.<br><br>In North Carolina, the entire legislature, the governor, and over 70% of<br>the state voted for that legislation.<br><br>And despite all the threats by big businesses and sports teams, you<br>still manage to see businesses advertising during the NCAA Championship<br>in Houston, even after Houston voted in similar legislation. You didn\'t<br>see the NCAA Championship games moved out of Houston.<br><br>(EDIT) The other thing that I find interesting is that these businesses<br>which claim to be exercising their conscience rights by not doing<br>business in locations like North Carolina or Mississippi haven\'t<br>adopted ANY of the very same policies that they are boycotting in the<br>states. Does PayPal allow transgender people to choose restrooms based<br>on their perceived sex in their corporate offices? Does the NBA allow<br>transgender players to use whatever showers they choose? (hint: the<br>answer starts with n and ends with o).<br><br>And PayPal is probably the biggest hypocrite in the bunch, as it is an<br>international corporation which does business with  *no fewer than<br>25 countries where homosexual behavior is illegal,* ***and 5 where the<br>penalty for such behavior is death.*** But they are objecting to North<br>Carolina overturning misguided legislation about letting men use<br>women\'s showers? North Carolina hasn't outlawed homosexuality or<br>discriminated against anyone. It hasn't even barred men from women's<br>restrooms. All it did was guarantee that businesses have the freedom to<br>set those policies themselves!<br><br>If Target\'s announcement that it will allow transgender people into any<br>restroom they choose, and the associated backlash they have received<br>(almost a half a million consumers signing the pledge to never shop at<br>Target again), you can tell that policies designed to appease 0.3% of<br>the population might potentially be unpopular with much of the other<br>99.7%.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
