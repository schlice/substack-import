<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>> Question details:<br>><br>> Basic Training as I understood focuses on soldier-ifying you. I\'ve<br>> heard you become \'property\' and you do what you are told, and obey.<br>> You become a \"thing\" upon which drill sergeants act, so you lose<br>> your will, your mind, your body. How does that affect your spirit?<br>> What is the greater purpose?<br><br>While not quite as harsh as you make it out to be, the basic answer is<br>yes, Basic Training manipulates you.<br><br>Allow me to explain.<br><br>You come into the military as an *individual*. You have your own style,<br>you have your own philosophies on life and everything around it, you<br>have your own social and moral standards. You leave Basic Training as a<br>*team member*, part of an organization that is greater than yourself.<br>The way to think of it is ***the whole is greater than the sum of its<br>parts***.<br><br>The military tears down the parts of you that made you an<br>individual. You had a hair style? They shave off your hair. You had a<br>clothing style? They put you all in the same clothes. You had individual<br>freedom? You don\'t do anything unless your DI (drill instructor) tells<br>you to. Famously, you don\'t \"eat, sleep, move, shit, or breathe\"<br>unless the DI tells you to. You learn very quickly that someone else is<br>in charge, and you do exactly what you are told or you face<br>consequences. The military then builds you back up into the soldier<br>and the team that they need you to be. This is the greater purpose.<br><br>Patton said it best: \"If you can\'t get them to salute when they should<br>salute, or wear the clothes you tell them to wear, how are you going to<br>get them to die for their country?\" The soldier must be able to receive<br>an order that will bring him to *almost certain death* and still be able<br>to do his job and accomplish that mission because he is obeying orders.<br>This is not normal human behavior, and takes a special sort of training<br>to accomplish.<br><br>You lose a good portion of your freedoms, because losing freedom is<br>important to understanding what it is that you\'re doing in the<br>military. \"You haven\'t lived \'till you\'ve almost died. And for those<br>who have tasted it, freedom has a flavor the protected will never<br>know.\" In order to really understand freedom, you have to lose it. You<br>understand that freedom is precious, and freedom must be protected, and<br>for those of us in the United States who have grown up knowing nothing<br>but freedom, it\'s hard to understand what it\'s like to *not* be free,<br>or that our hold on freedom is so tenuous.<br><br>Reagan said, \"**Freedom is never more than one generation away from<br>extinction.** We didn't pass it on to our children in the bloodstream.<br>It must be fought for, protected, and handed on for them to do the same,<br>or one day we will spend our sunset years telling our children and our<br>children\'s children what it was once like in the United States where<br>men were free.\" Basic Training shows you this.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
