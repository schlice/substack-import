When ingested, it releases hydrogen cyanide, which is<br>thought to have some anti-cancer properties. Laetrile has shown to have<br>little effect in animal testing and has shown no effect in human<br>testing.<br><br>Laetrile is not approved for use in the United States, and the action of<br>the medication is unrelated to the disease course in Multiple Sclerosis.<br><br>So the answer to the question is no, cyanide would not help in treating<br>MS.<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*This answer is not professional medical advice**, nor is it a<br>substitute for professional medical advice.
