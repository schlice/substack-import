<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Wow, I know I've seen "questions" with incorrect statements, but this<br>one is just full of them.<br><br>Let's start from the beginning:<br><br>> Trump\'s Supreme Court<br><br>It's not Trump's Supreme Court. Every president, while he is in office,<br>has the power to appoint Supreme Court justices if vacancies occur<br>during his tenure. That doesn't make it the President's court. Supreme<br>Court justices are beholden to the Constitution, not to a president.<br>That's why they are appointed for life; they don't have to appease<br>anyone or vie for political points to make voters happy. They only have<br>to do what is right by the Constitution.<br><br>> \The\ Supreme Court ruling on abortion now affects all health issues<br>> of women in anti-abortion states,<br><br>No it doesn't. It only says that abortion is not a Constitutional right.<br>THAT'S IT. Nothing else. The decision returns control of whether or<br>not, and when, a state will allow abortions back to the states and their<br>elected officials. The power is returned to the people.<br><br>> now any medical issue like cancer can be tied to abortion<br><br>Under what legal doctrine? Are you trying to suggest that treatment for<br>cancer causes abortions?<br><br>Because that's not how doctors see it. If the mother undergoes<br>lifesaving treatment, and the baby dies as a result, **this is not an<br>abortion**. Intentionally taking medical steps to kill a baby in the<br>womb is an abortion. Saving the mother's life which *incidentally*<br>results in the death of the baby **is not an abortion*. There's an<br>ocean's worth of difference between saving the mother's life and the<br>baby dying as a result, and intentionally killing the baby.***<br><br>> and the female patient arrested for attempted murder.<br><br>No, the mother is not arrested. If a doctor performs an illegal<br>abortion, the penalty is against the doctor, never against the mother.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
