<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Since you\'re talking about water crashes, the Combiation<br>Voice and Data Recorder (CVDR) unit is stuck inside aircraft wreckage,<br>which is usually not floating. In order to float, the unit would have to<br>jettison from the aircraft just before it crashes. The entire fleet of<br>F/A-18 Hornets has ejectable CVDR units, since many more of those<br>aircraft fly over water than US commercial aircraft. Less than 10% of<br>the US aviation fleet flies over water, so requiring all CVDR units to<br>be jettisonable and buoyant is a monetary cost that the aviation<br>industry finds unnecessary.\<br>\<br>And while the NTSB can make recommendations on how to build CVDR units,<br>it is the FAA that makes policy. FAA policy doesn\'t require fully<br>buoyant CVDRs or transponders on CVDR units, just \"pingers\" which make<br>noise underwater. They would be heard by underwater microphones.\<br>\<br>In the case of MH370, we couldn\'t find the CVDR before the pinger\'s<br>battery died.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
