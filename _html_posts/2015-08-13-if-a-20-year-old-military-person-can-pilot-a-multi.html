  submarine or surface vessel, command a multi-million dollar tank or aircraft or
  lead a group of men into armed conflict, then why is it still illegal for them to
  drink alcohol in most of the United States?"'

<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Because *piloting* a submarine does not take the same<br>higher reasoning skills required to *command* the submarine. Air<br>Force aircraft are piloted by officers, and they are older than 20. Men<br>are not led by 20-year old enlistees; men are led by NCOs or officers<br>who are most assuredly older than 20, and those groups are<br>*commanded* by senior officers. So yes, the driver of the sub is a<br>20 year old enlisted person. The driver of the tank is a 20 year old<br>enlisted person. But just because they are stick and wheel actuators<br>doesn\'t mean they have free rein as to where those vehicles go. The<br>*commander* of such a vehicle is an officer; the commander of the<br>submarine is an O-5 or better, with 15+ years of military service, and<br>well into his 30s, the commander of the tank is an O-3 or better, and he<br>too is probably 25 or older, the age at which higher reasoning skills in<br>the brain are said to have fully developed.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
