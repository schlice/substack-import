<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>In the United States, there is no duty to assist unless you are engaged<br>in the particular profession of providing assistance (i.e. a doctor, a<br>police officer, etc). Only then, in some states, there may be a duty to<br>assist. Otherwise, Good Samaritan laws merely serve to protect the<br>person who *does* choose to assist from lawsuits alleging that the Good<br>Samaritan actually *harmed* the victim, or made the situation worse.<br><br>Can you believe that? You stop to help someone, and they sue you. That's<br>gratitude for you.<br><br>But there are no states which *require* the average citizen to render<br>aid.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/What-advantages-do-women-have-that-men-dont/answer/Martyn-V-Halm-Combat-Pragmatist<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
