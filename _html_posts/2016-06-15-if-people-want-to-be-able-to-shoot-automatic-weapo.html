<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Let's answer each of your questions, since you asked two:<br><br>**If people want to be able to shoot automatic weapons for sport, why<br>can\'t we have secure, guarded shooting ranges where they could be<br>rented instead?**<br><br>Yes. We have these. There are several that I know of, all over the<br>country.<br><br>**Couldn't that work as a reasonable compromise between an outright ban<br>and unfettered, private ownership?**<br><br>We already have an appropriate "reasonable compromise" which has worked<br>very well for automatic weapons. You need a Type 1 Federal Firearms<br>License, a \$200 tax stamp, and you can't buy or register any automatic<br>weapon which has been manufactured since 1983, so the entire prospect is<br>really, really expensive. Only collectors own automatic weapons, and<br>only one has ever been used in a crime since these laws were put in<br>place. So I'd say that this is a reasonable compromise. I don't think we<br>need any new compromises on automatic weapons.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
