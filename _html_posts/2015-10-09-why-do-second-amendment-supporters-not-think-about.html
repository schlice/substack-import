<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [I\'ll make the assumption that you\'re talking about armed<br>drones like the Air Force flies. If that\'s the case, and drones start<br>getting used against civilians, then the government has already declared<br>martial law and has essentially stopped following all rules.\<br>\<br>And the states (along with the National Guards of those states) are on<br>their own. So it would become a war between the combined forces of the<br>National Guard vs whatever members of the military were willing to fire<br>on American civilians (the amount of which would be very low). That<br>drone would be one Stinger missile away from not flying any<br>more.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
