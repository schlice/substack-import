<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I am not an atheist, but have spent many years in the rooms of Nar Anon,<br>so I have personal experience. I have also attended NA, AA and Al Anon<br>meetings, so I have a good foundation of that which I speak.<br><br>I'll give you the TL;DR up front: **There should never be "god talk" at<br>an AA meeting. There should be "higher power" talk.**<br><br>Believing in a higher power is important in addiction treatment. In<br>fact, in most 12-step programs, it is Step 2: "Came to believe that a<br>power greater than ourselves could restore us to sanity." But what,<br>exactly, is a power *greater than ourselves,* or a "higher power?"<br><br>A lot of people think that a "higher power" means God. And for many<br>people, it does. *But it doesn't have to be.* **At its heart, a higher<br>power is some power greater than yourself which controls the universe**.<br>It could be God. It could be Nature. It could be the universe itself. Or<br>it could be the "collective consciousness" of all the people in the<br>room. But whatever you choose should be personal and mean something<br>special to you. Following your higher power, whatever it is, can help<br>you stay sober.<br><br>How? When you believe in something greater than yourself, you can more<br>easily forgive yourself and start to change. Belief in a higher power<br>helps you to let go of all of the guilt and pain associated with your<br>addiction. Recovery might occasionally seem daunting to those who are<br>fighting their addictions. It can be scary to confront on your own. But<br>discovering a higher power might give you the courage necessary to move<br>forward. You\'re never alone if you have your higher power. Finally,<br>finding a higher power reduces your chance of relapse. When someone<br>quits using drugs or alcohol, they frequently require a new, positive<br>focus to take its place. That goal could be to commune with a higher<br>power to forge a new spiritual path.<br><br>12-step programs are not religious, but they are spiritual. Belief<br>in a higher power (whatever higher power you choose) is something that<br>addicts find critical in their pursuit of continuing sobriety.<br><br>Decry higher powers all you want; millions of addicts have found<br>serenity and continued sobriety by putting their trust in a higher<br>power.<br><br>\<br><br>(EDIT) An atheist in my comments pointed out that some won't even engage<br>in *spiritual* programs.<br><br>Interesting.<br><br>Okay, if as an atheist you even denounce the *spiritual* instead of just<br>the *religious*, the answer is that there are other **specifically<br>non-spiritual** recovery programs which were intentionally created for<br>people just like you:<br><br>- SMART Recovery - SMART (Self-Management And Recovery Training)<br>  Recovery uses cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and other<br>  evidence-based approaches to behavior change.<br>- Secular Organizations for Sobriety (SOS) - SOS believes people can<br>  stay sober based on personal integrity, values, and beliefs. The SOS<br>  sobriety approach is "sobriety priority." This means that anyone can<br>  stay sober if they make sobriety their number one life priority.<br>- LifeRing Secular Recovery - LifeRing supports participants in<br>  being the leader of their recovery, knowing their triggers and knowing<br>  what they need to overcome them. It focuses on strengthening the<br>  "sober self" and weakening the "addicted self."<br><br>\<br><br>Ultimately, only you can decide if you want to get sober. No one can do<br>it for you. There are spiritual and non-spiritual options to aid you in<br>your journey to recovery.<br><br>But no one can do it for you. Only you can find peace and sobriety. You<br>have to decide that you want to be sober. That's when the healing can<br>begin --- regardless of what path you take to that healing.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
