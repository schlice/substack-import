<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**How can the Castle Doctrine be used for self-defense in another<br>person's home?**<br><br>The fundamental principle in the Castle Doctrine is the idea that<br>you feel safe in your own home. You're not defending your *home*,<br>you're defending your *person.*<br><br>Therefore, the Castle Doctrine stems from the doctrine of<br>*self-defense*. To that end, you can still defend yourself in someone<br>else's home.<br><br>I assume you're talking about the Amber Guyger case, and the Castle<br>Doctrine applies because she *believed* she was in her own home.<br>Prosecutors are trying to argue that she shouldn't have been allowed to<br>defend herself because her belief that she was in her own apartment was<br>not reasonable.<br><br>But that's not what is at issue. What is at issue is *her actions,*<br>assuming that she truly believed she was in her own apartment. Since she<br>did truly believe she was in her own apartment (regardless of how<br>unreasonable that belief may have been), the Castle Doctrine would still<br>apply.<br><br>(EDIT) The jury did come back and say that it didn't matter whether or<br>not she believed she was in her own home. Castle Doctrine did not apply<br>because she was not actually in her own home. She was convicted of<br>murder in this case.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
