<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: [Latest estimates from real reliable sources estimate that<br>almost 50,000 were issued in 2005, and between 1999 and 2005 there have<br>been about 40 that have gone wrong. So even if it was 40 in one year<br>(which it is not), that would still be only one in every 1,250, or<br>0.08%.\<br>\<br>If this qualifies as \"often\" to you, then I believe you are correct.\<br>\<br>To me, this is not even close to often. Yes, mistakes happen, and they<br>are tragic when they do. I don\'t deny that people make mistakes. I just<br>disagree with you as to frequency.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/What-would-it-cost-to-fortify-ones-home-well-enough-that-the-police-cannot-break-into-it/answer/Bill-Stein<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
