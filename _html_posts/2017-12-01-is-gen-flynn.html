<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Is Gen. Flynn\'s indictment the proof of Trump's innocence?<br><br>No, but it's not proof of Trump's guilt, either.<br><br>And even if it was, what is it proof of?<br><br>We already know that Trump directed his national security transition<br>team to start getting in contact with foreign governments, including<br>Russia, before he took over as President, but after the election was<br>concluded.<br><br>This is what Flynn knows. And this is completely normal for a<br>presidential transition team to start reaching out to the officials with<br>whom they will be doing business and start making those contacts.<br><br>He wasn't directed to make secret deals with Russia about rigging the<br>election. Remember, the discussions took place after the election was<br>over, not before.<br><br>He wasn't directed to advise Russia to rig the election. Many<br>investigations have already found that the election was not rigged. Vote<br>totals were not tampered with. Voters were not suppressed.<br><br>As usual, nothing to see here.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
