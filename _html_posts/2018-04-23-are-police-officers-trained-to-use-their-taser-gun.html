<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Are police officers trained to use their taser gun before they fire<br>their real gun at a suspect?**<br><br>Most certainly not.<br><br>When you drive a nail, are you trained to try to drive the nail with<br>your hand first, before you use a hammer? Of course not, because the<br>hammer is the right tool for the job.<br><br>The Taser is appropriate for some situations. The firearm is appropriate<br>for some other situations. Situations that require a Taser do not always<br>escalate to situations which require a firearm. Similarly, not all<br>situations which require a firearm must begin with a Taser.<br><br>The firearm is deadly force. If a situation calls for the use of deadly<br>force, the firearm is used. If a situation does not call for the use of<br>deadly force, the firearm is not used. The Taser may be used. Another<br>less lethal device could also be used, such as pepper spray. It all<br>depends on the situation.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
