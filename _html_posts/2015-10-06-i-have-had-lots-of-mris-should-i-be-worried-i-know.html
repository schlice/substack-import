<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [I too have had \"lots\" of MRIs. High-field MRIs. Of my<br>brain. Every year for the past 8 years; some years saw more than one<br>high-field MRI of my brain; for example, if I was changing medications,<br>or if I was having a relapse or flare-up.\<br>\<br>To the best of our knowledge, there are no adverse side-effects from<br>exposure to high-strength magnetic fields. There are definitely some<br>other side effects though.\<br>\<br>As you already know, any metal in your body can be affected by the MRI<br>scanner. Some older tattoo dyes had metal flakes in them, and have been<br>indicated as potentially being affected by the MRI. Any metal you may<br>have in your body (i.e. clips from surgeries, pacemakers, some<br>chemotherapy drugs, implants, etc) need to be indicated to the techs<br>performing the scan.\<br>\<br>Also, some people have had an adverse reaction to the contrast dye<br>(gadolinium) which is administered during some scans. Most people don\'t<br>have any reaction at all. If I remember correctly, it\'s like 1 in<br>10,000 people will react to gadolinium. All of my scans use Gd for the<br>second half of the scan. For me, active MS lesions will show up bright<br>white in a certain scan when exposed to gadolinium. The neurologist uses<br>this information to determine if any lesions are active, or if they are<br>older and inactive. So I get 20 minutes or so of non-contrast scans, I<br>get pulled out of the tube, get a shot of Gd in my arm, and go back in<br>the tube for another 15-20 minutes of enhancing scans.\<br>\<br>But other than the secondary side effects, there are no known long-term<br>health risks associated with being exposed to high-strength magnetic<br>fields.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
