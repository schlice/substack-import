They are protecting our lives.**<br><br>It's not illegal to give money to someone, unless you're paying for<br>something illegal.<br><br>However, it's not really a great idea to give money to a TSA agent.<br><br>Besides potentially showing impropriety (i.e. they're letting your<br>little pocket knife slip through because you paid them), because TSA is<br>a federal agency, there are massive rules about federal agents receiving<br>gifts. It's usually not allowed.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
