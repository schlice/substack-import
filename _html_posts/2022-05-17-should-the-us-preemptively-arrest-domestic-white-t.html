<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Yes! They should round them all up and charge them with "Potentially<br>Being Domestic Terrorists" which is totally a crime.<br><br>You know what? There's going to be so many of them, perhaps we can build<br>a place to house them all, because there won't be any room in the jails.<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-c23fe5c2cce8af6d2fa6f1472eee57b5){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-c23fe5c2cce8af6d2fa6f1472eee57b5" master_w="661"<br>master_h="377"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>Those places look lovely, don't they? Those are the internment camps we<br>built during World War II, when we *preemptively* arrested all those of<br>Japanese ancestry.<br><br>No civil rights violations there, right?<br><br>\<br><br>There was a lot of sarcasm in that last section of my answer.<br><br>The real answer is that you can't preemptively arrest anyone in the<br>United States. You're not a criminal until you are. It's that simple.<br>American citizens have rights.<br><br>Now, if you're looking for an answer to why crazy people do crazy things<br>and what we do about that, then ask that question. But preemptively<br>arresting people is not the right answer in the United States.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
