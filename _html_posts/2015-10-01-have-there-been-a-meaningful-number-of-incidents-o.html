Removing legal gun ownership will not<br>change the fact that we are terrible at identifying and treating people<br>who are mentally ill until they actually commit a violent crime.\<br>\<br>It\'s iceberg theory. Until we start treating the problem (the mentally<br>ill person) instead of the symptom (the gun they used to hurt people),<br>we will never get a better handle on mass shootings.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
