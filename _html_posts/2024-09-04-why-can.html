<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The trick is, you can. But it's harder.<br><br>For the purposes of this discussion, we'll lump Conservatives and<br>Republicans together and just call them "Republican," and we'll lump<br>Liberals, Progressives, and Democrats together and just call them<br>"Democrat."<br><br>Generally speaking, Republicans prefer smaller government and more<br>individual freedom, while Democrats prefer more governmental oversight<br>of society and the economy. Republicans argue for capitalism, which is<br>free (for the most part) from governmental control, while Democrats have<br>more socialistic tendencies in regards to the government's role. Neither<br>capitalism nor socialism is explicitly endorsed by the Bible. It is<br>believed that governments are endowed with the necessary authority to<br>execute their divinely-inspired responsibilities, which include<br>upholding justice and establishing order within society (Romans 13:1-7).<br>Therefore, with respect to the size and scope of government, Christians<br>can be libertarian, conservative, liberal, or progressive. None of those<br>political worldviews are inherently evil or ungodly. The thing which<br>should drive your choice, as a Christian, should be **which party best<br>allows government to fulfill its God-given role.**<br><br>While issues such as the size and scope of government or specifics about<br>economic systems are not explicitly addressed in the Bible, there<br>definitely are some political issues the Bible does address, such as<br>abortion (Genesis 1:26-27; 9:6; Exodus 21:22-25; Psalm 139:13-16;<br>Jeremiah 1:5), and homosexual sex (Leviticus 18:22; 20:13; 1 Corinthians<br>6:9; 1 Timothy 1:9--10. Romans 1:26--27). For the Bible-believing<br>Christian, abortion is not a matter of a woman's right to choose. It is<br>a matter of the life or death of a human being made in God's image.<br>Endorsing homosexual sex is giving approval to a lifestyle choice the<br>Bible condemns as immoral and unnatural. Whether these two issues should<br>trump all other issues is a matter of personal conviction.<br><br>Finally, and I think that many Christians fail on this point, we must<br>remember thar no matter who is in office, whether we voted for them or<br>not, whether they are of the political party we prefer or not, the Bible<br>commands us to respect and honor them (Romans 13:1-7; 1 Peter 2:13-17).<br>We should also be praying for those placed in authority over us<br>(Colossians 4:2; 1 Thessalonians 5:17). We do not have to agree with<br>them, or even like them, but we do have to honor and respect them.<br>Christians should *never* condone any "not my president" talk. If he or<br>she was duly elected, they *are* your president, and we are commanded to<br>support them, and respect and honor their position.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
