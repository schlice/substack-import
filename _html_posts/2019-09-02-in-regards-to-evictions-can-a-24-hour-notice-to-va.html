Sure, you probably can.<br><br>Can you *enforce* the order? Unlikely. You still need the Sheriff to<br>enforce the order, and the Sheriff will not enforce the order when it is<br>not safe to do so or when it is unlikely the person will have 24 hours<br>in which they have the legal ability to comply with the order. They<br>can't be expected to vacate in the middle of a weather emergency.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
