<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>No. Jesus fully understands that you were created either male or female,<br>and any confusion about that is due to the sin nature infecting your<br>body, just as it infects all of our earthly bodies.<br><br>Often, if there is confusion about a single verse, it's helpful to look<br>at the context. As I've said frequently in answers in this Space,<br>*text, without context, is just pretext.*<br><br>So let's expand out just a touch and take a look at this quote in<br>context:<br><br>> for all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves<br>> with Christ. There is neither Jew nor Gentile, neither slave nor free,<br>> nor is there male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus. ---<br>> Galatians 3:27--28 NIV<br><br>In verse 27, Paul wrote, "For all of you who were baptized into Christ<br>have clothed yourselves with Christ. " In other words, any person<br>baptized into Christ has Christ. He goes on to explain what this means:<br>"There is neither Jew nor Gentile, neither slave nor free, nor is there<br>male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus" (v. 28).<br><br>Here, Paul *grounds* oneness on the condition of baptism. Baptism unites<br>us to Christ. Therefore, from this perspective, every person is "all one<br>in Christ Jesus." The reason why baptism into Christ works, however, is<br>precisely because baptism fulfills the Abrahamic promise. Paul<br>had just stated a little earlier in this letter to the Galatians that<br>"the blessing given to Abraham might come to the Gentiles through Christ<br>Jesus, so that by faith we might receive the promise of the Spirit."<br>(Gal 3:14).<br><br>Therefore, when we are baptized into Christ, there are no distinctions<br>any longer to God. There are no lesser Christians in the family of God.<br>Our earthly identifiers create no value distinction between us in our<br>Father\'s eyes. Jews do not carry a higher rank than Gentiles. Free<br>people hold no greater honor than slaves. Men are not superior to women.<br>No race is a \"master race,\" nor any ethnicity inferior. We "are all<br>one in Christ Jesus."<br><br>\<br><br>So now that we have explained the verse, what does that mean for a<br>Christian being non-binary? As you've seen, being non-binary is not what<br>the Scripture is talking about. Paul wasn't referring to a person living<br>as non-binary. Being non-binary is not referenced in the BIble, because<br>no one at the time of the Bible's writing would have ever even<br>*conceived* of any such thing. No one would have ever though that they<br>were born into the wrong body, or would have ever considered that they<br>were anything other than how God created them.<br><br>More specifically to Christians, being non-binary dishonors the<br>commission given to you by God to live as He created you. It's an insult<br>to the God who created you, boldly telling Him that your *sin* nature is<br>more important to you than your *actual* nature. There is no<br>justification for those who knowingly live in sin. "For the wages of sin<br>is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord."<br>(Romans 6:23). I know that sounds a little harsh, but the ramifications<br>of living in sin are quite severe (eternal separation from God), so we<br>shouldn't sugar-coat this to spare someone's delicate feelings. That<br>word *eternal* is a hard one for humans to wrap their brains around.<br>Eternal literally means *forever*. The time to do things right is *now*.<br>The time to fix your relationship with God is now*.* Don't wait.<br>Don't put it off. There is no better time than the present.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
