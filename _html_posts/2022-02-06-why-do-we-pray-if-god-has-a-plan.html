In other words, *he wants to hear it from you.*<br><br>Of course he knows everything, and he has seen everything. He knows what<br>you need before you even know what you need, let alone ask for it.<br><br>But he still wants you to ask.<br><br>He wants you to recognize what you need, recognize that he is the one<br>who can provide it for you, put your faith and trust in him, and ask<br>him.<br><br>It\'s not that he doesn\'t know. He just wants to hear you say it.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>If everything is already in God\'s plans, what\'s the point of praying?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
