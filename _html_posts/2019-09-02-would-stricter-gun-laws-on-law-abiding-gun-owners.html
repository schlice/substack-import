<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Would stricter gun laws on law abiding gun owners empower shooters of<br>mass shootings?**<br><br>Let's answer your question with a question.<br><br>***Why aren't there any mass shootings at police stations? Why aren't<br>there any mass shootings at gun ranges?***<br><br>The answer is because *while mass shooters are crazy and have lost some<br>form of their grip on reality, they still realize that* ***they can kill<br>more people in places where they know they will meet the smallest amount<br>of armed resistance.***<br><br>This is why mass shootings occur in free-fire zones (er, sorry,<br>"gun-free zones"), which essentially equates to "any place specifically<br>designated to disallow the lawful carry of firearms."<br><br>So you tell me.<br><br>If fewer law abiding citizens are carrying guns, would that make mass<br>shooters *less likely* or *more likely* to carry out their plans? If<br>mass shooters know they are less likely to meet armed resistance, will<br>they be *less likely* or *more likely* to move ahead towards their<br>objective?<br><br>If you say it makes no difference, then answer the question why there<br>aren't more mass shootings in police stations and in gun ranges.<br><br>Now look at it from the criminal's point of view.
