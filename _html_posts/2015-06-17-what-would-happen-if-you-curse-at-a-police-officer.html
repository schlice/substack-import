<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [In his head, he\'d be laughing, hysterically, at your<br>utter lack of intelligence. He\'ll tell stories about you for weeks to<br>his fellow cops, and they\'ll all have a good laugh at your expense.\<br>\<br>Outside, he will show no emotion. He will, however, take a keen interest<br>in what you are doing, why you are doing it, and if you happen to have<br>any warrants. You might find yourself in jail, not necessarily for<br>public profanity, but because of that parking ticket you forgot to pay<br>10 years ago. Oops.\<br>\<br>Maybe it\'d be best not to attract unwanted attention to yourself. I<br>mean, waving a red sheet in a bullfighting arena is not illegal. But you<br>might attract some unwanted attention. Get it?]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
