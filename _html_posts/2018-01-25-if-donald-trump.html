<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If Donald Trump's wife upset him, he might have had sex with a hooker.<br>If someone did not like Trump, would this be a beneficial scandal to<br>promote?**<br><br>I am steering WAY clear of the trap of trying to get into whether or not<br>this actually happened, or whether or not he allegedly did it because<br>"his wife upset him."<br><br>Let's just focus on the last part instead.<br><br>**If someone did not like Trump, would this be a beneficial scandal to<br>promote?**<br><br>In order to "promote" this "scandal," you have to hope your target<br>audience has a very short memory. It was just a few years ago that Bill<br>Clinton was having sex in the Oval Office, and then lied about the whole<br>thing. The House passed impeachment charges, but the Senate didn't think<br>enough of those charges to remove him from office.<br><br>So the message we heard from Washington was, "We know what you did, we<br>know you lied about it, but you can still be President."<br><br>Fast-forward to today. We already know what kind of a man Trump is. He's<br>a pussy grabber. Access Hollywood made sure we knew that, loud and<br>clear.<br><br>Here's the thing though: we knew about all of this before the election,<br>and we (collectively) elected Trump anyway.<br><br>So will this be a beneficial scandal to promote? I doubt it:<br><br>- Most of America (in fact, nearly everyone who voted for Trump), will<br>  probably just shrug. "We already knew he was a pig, so having an<br>  affair is like, 'meh, I could see him do that.'"<br>- Others will be relieved that it was a consensual relationship and not<br>  a sexual assault scandal as is being highlighted by the #metoo<br>  movement. So long as Trump doesn't plan on lecturing me about what a<br>  healthy marriage should look like, what happens between him and the<br>  First Lady should stay between him and the First Lady, unless they<br>  want to talk about it (and I'm not pushing them to do that).<br>- Democrats would probably want to stay far away from this, because they<br>  would have to own up to the double-standard of supporting Clinton's<br>  antics in the Oval Office while simultaneously deriding Trump for<br>  doing the same thing. They would also have to answer to what Hillary<br>  did as part of Bimbo Eruptions, destroying the women who had affairs<br>  with her husband to discredit them, and explain how attacking the<br>  women involved with her husband was okay while deriding Trump's<br>  behavior.<br>- Liberals will have to cope with the liberal media publishing stories<br>  saying that [[it's essentially okay for your spouse to have<br>  extramarital<br>  affairs](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=35ead0&url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/01/25/health/cuckolding-sex-kerner/index.html){.external_link<br>  rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>  onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>  qt-tooltip="cnn.com"}]{.qlink_container}. By the way, that story was<br>  published today, 25 Jan 2018.<br><br>So is this beneficial? I don't really think so.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
