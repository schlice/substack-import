THINK FOR YOURSELF.<br><br>What you're hearing from these "testimonies" are, first of all, not all<br>first-hand knowledge of the phone call and its circumstances. Second,<br>they are peoples' opinions about what they think they know.<br><br>There was no quid pro quo in the phone call. The Ukrainians themselves<br>agree that there was no quid pro quo, and they'd love to get Trump out<br>of office so that someone else more favorable to them would help them<br>with their Russia problem.<br><br>No matter how anyone spins it, the transcript is the transcript, and<br>there was no quid pro quo in the transcript.<br><br>In fact, in his testimony, former Ukraine envoy Kurt Volker pushed back<br>on the claim that Trump was withholding meeting wit the Ukrainians until<br>they investigated Biden and his son, and he also denied that Trump was<br>seeking "dirt" on Biden. These "testimonies" are as damaging for<br>Democrats as Democrats think they are damaging for the President.<br><br>READ THE TRANSCRIPT.
