<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If the Senate refuses to impeach Trump, can they vote to censure in<br>some way thereby acknowledging misdeeds that fail to rise to the level<br>of impeachable offenses?**<br><br>The Senate can do whatever the Senate chooses to do with its time.<br><br>As far as the impeachment goes, the Senate only has the option to vote<br>on each Article of Impeachment and determine whether or not the person<br>impeached will be removed from office. This vote must be a supermajority<br>(67 or more Senators).<br><br>If they vote to remove the person from office, they can then vote by<br>simple majority whether or not the person can ever hold public office<br>again.<br><br>After all this impeachment nonsense is finally done, the Senate can<br>indeed choose to vote to pass an article of censure. Censure is a<br>reprimand issued by one or both houses of Congress. It is documented in<br>the Constitution as a punishment for Members of Congress, but not for<br>non-Members. For them, it is simply a means of formally documenting<br>displeasure with a non-Member.<br><br>There are no consequences tied to censure for non-Members. In fact,<br>since 1800, Members of the House and Senate have introduced resolutions<br>of censure against at least 12 sitting Presidents, so when conduct fails<br>to rise to the level of an impeachable offense, a censure can indeed be<br>used. [[Some of those<br>censures](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=0248c1&url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R45087.pdf){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="fas.org"}]{.qlink_container} included verbiage like<br>*unconstitutional, usurpation, reproof*, and *abuse of power*. Beginning<br>in 1972, the most "censorious" resolutions have actually used the word<br>*censure* in the text.<br><br>So as you can see, abuse of power does not always rise to the level of<br>impeachment. Some abuses of power historically have only resulted in<br>censure.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
