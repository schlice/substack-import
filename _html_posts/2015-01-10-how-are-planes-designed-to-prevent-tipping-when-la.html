<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Also, the plane is still \"flying\" even after it touches<br>down. The control surfaces still work after the wheels have touched<br>down, so the pilot uses the control yoke to keep the aircraft in the<br>correct attitude until the airspeed/ground speed has reduced enough that<br>the wings no longer produce lift.\<br>\<br>In lighter aircraft (gliders, for example), the wings produce so much<br>lift that in a decent headwind (like 10 knots), they continue to produce<br>lift even after the aircraft has come to a complete stop. We could<br>balance a glider on its one wheel after it had come to a complete stop<br>just using the ailerons.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
