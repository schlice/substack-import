<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [I think not responding is a pretty poor choice. You could<br>be opening yourself up to hardships if/when you return to the US.\<br>\<br>In Colorado, we have the option to postpone our jury duty by return mail<br>should we be out of the country. There is also a disqualification<br>section on the return card which you would fill out if you met any of<br>the conditions for disqualification (i.e. have a physical or mental<br>condition, can\'t understand/read/speak English, etc). Check the card<br>you received in the mail to find out exactly how to file for<br>postponement or disqualification.\<br>\<br>If you are not returning to the US any time soon, you will likely have<br>to check with the jurisdiction issuing your jury summons about<br>disqualification from service. I can\'t guarantee leniency as there are<br>very few factors which trigger disqualification from service.\<br>\<br>(EDIT) The original question did not have the question details:\<br>\"I didn\'t receive anything, as far as I know. That is my concern: that<br>I\'m away and won\'t know if I get one.\"\<br>\<br>You should contact the city or county in which your US state driver\'s<br>license is registered. If you own a home in the US, contact the city or<br>county in which your home is located. It\'s easy enough to find on the<br>Internet with a few quick searches. Be proactive about it, and ask them<br>about disqualification/postponement now, not when you\'ve been summoned<br>to jury duty.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
