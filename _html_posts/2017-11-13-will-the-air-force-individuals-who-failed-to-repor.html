<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Short answer: no.<br><br>Reason: they were not obligated to do so.<br><br>In actuality, he got a Bad Conduct Discharge, and the military is not<br>mandated to report those. It's *optional*, so they did nothing wrong.<br>They are only *required* to report Dishonorable Discharges into NICS.<br><br>It's optional because the two legal systems have different burdens of<br>proof and different standards of evidence (i.e. in the military system,<br>you are guilty until proven innocent in a court-martial). Therefore, not<br>all discharges are reported to the civilian judicial system, and only<br>Dishonorable Discharges *must* be reported and entered into NICS.<br><br>If you want change, you would have to re-try every person who gets<br>court-martialed and gets a Bad Conduct Discharge in the civilian legal<br>system after they get out of military prison. It's not double jeopardy<br>to do so, but since the standards of evidence and burden of proof are<br>different between the two systems, they must be re-tried in a civilian<br>court before you can hold them to the same domestic violence punishments<br>as you would a non-military defendant.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
