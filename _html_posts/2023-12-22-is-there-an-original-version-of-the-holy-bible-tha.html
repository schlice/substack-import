<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>First, there isn't an "original version of the Bible." The Bible is<br>actually a compendium of 66 books, written over the course of 1500 years<br>in three languages on three different continents.<br><br>Second, in the vast majority of cases, "churches" have not altered the<br>Bible.ยน But "translation" between languages involves altering some<br>words, out of necessity.<br><br>For example, Hebrew has fewer words than English. So some words in<br>Hebrew have multiple meanings. The translator must determine which<br>meaning was intended by the original author in order to choose the<br>correct English word. Greek has the opposite problem where, for example,<br>there are no fewer than six words in Greek which mean various forms of<br>"love" (i.e. parental love, platonic love, love between close friends,<br>erotic love, etc), yet in English, we just have "love."<br><br>Translation, therefore, involves the alteration of words in order to<br>convey the correct meaning.<br><br>Bible translations can range from "word for word" translations (which<br>accurately translate the words but the meaning may be more difficult to<br>understand) to "thought for thought" translations (where the translator<br>reads an entire sentence in the original language and then writes it in<br>the new language, trying to retain as much of the original words and<br>meaning as possible), or "paraphrase" translations (where an entire<br>paragraph is read and is re-stated without fidelity to the original<br>words whatsoever, but tries to retain the meaning of what was originally<br>written). Generally, as you get towards the "paraphrase" side of the<br>spectrum, the translations are easier to read and understand, but hold<br>less fidelity to the original words, where as you get closer to the<br>"word for word" side, the original words are retained, but you may not<br>get the original author's meaning.<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-6318b071f7b5cf5baf42863acee2fb10){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-6318b071f7b5cf5baf42863acee2fb10" master_w="730"<br>master_h="417"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>\<br><br>ยน The one notable exception is the New World Translation, translated by<br>the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society, which is the first intentional,<br>systematic effort at producing a complete version of the Bible that is<br>edited and revised for the specific purpose of agreeing with their<br>religious doctrine. The Jehovah's Witnesses and the Watchtower Society<br>realized that their beliefs contradicted the Bible. So, rather than<br>conforming their beliefs to the Bible, they altered the Bible to agree<br>with their beliefs.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
