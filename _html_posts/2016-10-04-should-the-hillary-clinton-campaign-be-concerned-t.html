<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Yes, it is indeed a trap. Hillary's gonna get caught up in it, and it's<br>a total non-starter, and here's why:<br><br>1.  The tax returns were most likely obtained illegally. No one who had<br>    legal authority to release them has stated that they have done so,<br>    so it's most likely that someone who did not have legal authority to<br>    release them, did so. This is yet another indication that the<br>    mainstream media has totally abandoned all pretense of impartiality<br>    and are wholly in the tank for Hillary. Remember the University of<br>    East Anglia? That's where the emails were that exposed global<br>    warming as an elaborate hoax. But the New York Times had too much<br>    "journalistic integrity" to publish those because they were the<br>    fruits of an illegal hack (another reason the left can continue to<br>    claim that global climate change is a real man-made thing, because<br>    those emails came from a *hack*). But these private tax returns,<br>    which are also clearly illegal (or at least not clearly legal) are<br>    published before the ink is dry on the manila envelope they were<br>    found in? Nope, totally in the tank for Hillary. It's not even a<br>    question any more, as in if you still believe the media is unbiased,<br>    you've been living under a rock for the past 20 years. Eventually,<br>    the illegality of them will catch up, and Trump will use it to<br>    highlight, again, exactly what lengths the Clinton camp (and their<br>    media arm, the New York Times) will go to in order to try to<br>    discredit him.<br>2.  It highlights the fact that Trump is not a political insider. He has<br>    not structured his tax returns to look good under public scrutiny,<br>    as every other politician has done, including Hillary. His tax<br>    returns read as a businessman's tax returns do, not as a<br>    politician's do.<br>3.  The big story with the taxes is not the fact that \$918 million was<br>    written off. It's that *no laws were broken*. No one is alleging<br>    that Trump did anything illegal. As in, move along folks, *nothing<br>    to see here*<br>4.  It's also well known that Trump lost all kinds of money during<br>    that period of time. As a matter of fact, the New York Times (yes,<br>    the very same birdcage-liner that published the illegally-obtained<br>    returns) [[wrote a<br>    story](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=bcebda&url=http://www.nytimes.com/1995/10/25/nyregion/crowning-the-comeback-king.html){.external_link<br>    rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>    onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>    qt-tooltip="nytimes.com"}]{.qlink_container} in 1995 praising Trump<br>    for losing all that money and then returning to wealth. A quick<br>    quote from that article:\<br>    \<br>    *After the collapse of the real estate market of the 1980\'s, Mr.<br>    Trump\'s company was left holding some \$8.8 billion in debt,<br>    causing his personal net worth to drop to a low of about \$1 billion<br>    in the red by 1991.\*<br>    \<br>    Writing off huge losses is something that you would expect a<br>    business owner to be doing during this period of time. They called<br>    him "the Comeback Kid" and that piece actually inspired Trump to<br>    write his book, "The Art of the Comeback."<br>5.  Hillary is trying to profit off of the returns, but she failed to<br>    remember that both she and the New York Times have used the same<br>    provision in the tax code that Trump did. Carrying over a loss to<br>    the next tax year is part of the tax code, and not only is not a<br>    crime, but everyone has done it, including Hillary and the New York<br>    Times.<br>6.  And seriously, if Hillary can dismiss Benghazi, leaking classified<br>    information by using a private email server, destroying evidence,<br>    pay-to-play, and silencing Bill's side chicks as "no big deal," then<br>    this is by far really no big deal at all. Look, a tax return.<br>    Nothing illegal on it.<br><br>Much ado about nothing.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
