<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**As an American man , how would you feel if you saw your wife having<br>sex with any other man?**<br><br>I also don't understand what the nationality has to do with the<br>question. While the percentage is smaller, there are married men in<br>America who participate in non-traditional marital arrangements. Some<br>married couples practice what they call "open relationships" in which<br>sex with multiple partners is permitted, sometimes even encouraged. Some<br>married couples engage in group sex with multiple partners. In that<br>case, those particular married men may be *excited* or *aroused*<br>watching their spouse have sex with other men. But that's outside of my<br>area of expertise. Perhaps [[Franklin<br>Veaux](https://www.quora.com/profile/Franklin-Veaux)]{.qlink_container}<br>can add some color there.<br><br>For those who are in a monogamous marriage (one in which sex outside of<br>the marriage is not permitted), there would be some very negative<br>emotions which would follow seeing the events you described. Some of<br>those emotions would be *rage, betrayal,* and *sadness*, and may even be<br>described as a *broken heart.* For people who have monogamous<br>relationships, one of the partners violating that trust leads to some<br>very hurt feelings, and a difficult road to repair that relationship.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
