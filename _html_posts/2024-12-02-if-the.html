<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Not exactly,<br>[Lucifer(https://www.quora.com/profile/Lucifer-the-Anti-Christ)]{.qlink_container}.<br><br>Remember, Isaiah 14:14 isn't about you. It's about the king of Babylon.<br>And yes, as people go, he was indeed very powerful and he was a great<br>conqueror. He certainly had his sights set pretty high if he wanted to<br>"rise above the stars of God to become one like the Most High." Usually<br>in the Bible, the *Most High* refers to Yahweh, but in this case, since<br>we're talking about the king of Babylon, he actually wanted to sit on<br>the ancient throne of the Canaanite gods.<br><br>> You said in your heart,\<br>> 'I will ascend to heaven;\<br>> above the stars of God\<br>> I will set my throne on high;\<br>> I will sit on the mount of assembly\<br>> in the far reaches of the north; \-- Isaiah 14:13 ESV<br><br>That means that the *Most High* he was referring to was actually Baal.<br><br>And the name "Lucifer" is sometimes equated with Satan in the Bible, but<br>that is a tenuous connection at best. Ultimately, that wasn't the<br>purpose of Isaiah's writing anyway. It wasn't to write about you, even<br>though some people use this passage to imply that it was you who wanted<br>to sit on God's throne, and Isaiah wasn't saying anything like that at<br>all. Isaiah was merely prophesying the fall of Babylon, nothing more.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
