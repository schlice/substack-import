<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>You'll be charged with a fine for violating that state's traffic laws.<br><br>Whether or not you get points assigned is complicated and depends on the<br>state you're from and the state you're in. Most states will report the<br>ticket back to your home state. 45 states plus the District of Columbia<br>have agreed to the Driver's License Compact (DLC) which requires them to<br>share information about moving violations back to the home state. Points<br>*may* be recorded depending on the state you're from and the state<br>you're in. Some states do assign out of state points, and some do not.<br><br>> A few states, such as Colorado and Pennsylvania, do not record the<br>> violation if it is considered a minor offense, like a speeding ticket.<br>> Other states, like Maryland and Nevada, record the violation but do<br>> not assign points for out-of-state tickets. Florida and Texas place<br>> both the violation and points on your driving record for all<br>> out-of-state convictions -- which will likely increase your car<br>> insurance premium.<br>><br>> Then there are a few states that have unique laws. If you're a New<br>> York resident who received a minor traffic ticket in Quebec or<br>> Ontario, Canada, New York will record it and assess you points. But if<br>> you receive the ticket within the country, it will not go on your<br>> record. New Jersey adds two points for all out-of-state traffic<br>> convictions, even if your points for the violation would have been<br>> different in-state.\[1\](#SkDHA){#cite-SkDHA .citation_link}<br><br>If you want to go to court instead of simply paying the fine, you'll<br>have to return to the state to do so.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-SkDHA){.citation_index} [[Out-of-State Speeding Tickets<br>Follow You<br>Home](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=c4ff50&url=http://www.foxbusiness.com/features/2011/03/11/state-speeding-tickets-follow-home.html){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="foxbusiness.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
