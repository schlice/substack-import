<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>A neighborhood without an HOA can be ruined by one lousy neighbor. Their<br>house can get into disrepair, the lawn can go unkempt, they can fill<br>their driveway with junk cars, etc. While you may think "live and let<br>live," a neighbor like that affects *your* property value. When you try<br>to sell your own house, you will find fewer buyers, and lower offers.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/I-have-seen-several-well-established-residential-neighborhoods-with-no-HOA-Is-HOA-necessary-or-nuisance/answer/Sean-OToole<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
