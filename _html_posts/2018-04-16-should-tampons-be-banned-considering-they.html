<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Should tampons be banned considering they\'re a form of reverse rape<br>and reinforcing patriarchy?**<br><br>I'm not even going to address anything equating tampons and rape. It's<br>like comparing apples to phone booths. The logic is so far off it hurts<br>my brain.<br><br>Reinforcing patriarchy? You really think it's *men* that *force women*<br>to use tampons? Only if using bandages on a bleeding cut is reinforcing<br>the matriarchy.<br><br>If a woman wants to use a tampon, she has the freedom to do so. If she<br>doesn't want to use a tampon, she certainly is under no obligation to do<br>so. No one forces her to do so, and there is no "tampon culture" which I<br>am aware of that pressures a woman into using a tampon, other than her<br>own sincere desire to not bleed all over her clothes.<br><br>So no, tampons should not be banned. If you don't want to use them,<br>don't buy them.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
