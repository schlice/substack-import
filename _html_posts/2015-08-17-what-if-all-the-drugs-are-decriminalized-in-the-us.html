<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I don\'t think it\'s fair to lump all drugs together. So if we simply<br>declare \"all drugs\" legal, I think it would be worse. I\'ll explain.<br><br>In the world of drugs, there is a very clear distinction: *marijuana*<br>and *everything else.*<br><br>Marijuana pales in comparison to other drugs. At worst, consuming too<br>much (especially in an edible) can kill you; it\'s near impossible to<br>smoke enough to kill you. In general, it just makes you mellow and<br>hungry, which is an entreprenurial avenue for some.<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-c1ecf7bb7b17072b7cc800cd3d628b18){.portrait .qtext_image<br>.zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-c1ecf7bb7b17072b7cc800cd3d628b18" master_w="334"<br>master_h="445"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>But drugs like meth are life and body-destroying drugs and should be<br>fought and prevented. It\'s true that people will still do what they<br>want and if there are people who want the drugs then there will always<br>be a market, whether or not it is a legal one. But using the<br>\"prohibition\" logic (we tried to prevent it once and look how well<br>that went; people will use it anyway) is not a reason to make it legal.<br>It would be a challenge to control, as people can still cook it up in<br>their homes if they choose (if they don\'t want to buy the legal stuff,<br>or if it is too expensive). It\'s hard to control the effects on the<br>body, or to be able to consume it on a regular basis without any<br>long-term effects. It\'s not a \"social\" drug like alcohol, where the<br>body\'s metabolism can render it inert with few long-term side effects.<br><br>We have to be careful with legalization because, especially with the<br>younger set, ***legalization implies social and societal<br>acceptability***. Many people won\'t do these drugs simply because they<br>are illegal, and that stigma keeps many who have addictive personalities<br>and tendencies from actually crossing the line and becoming addicts. The<br>answer is not \"let them become addicts and we\'ll fix them in<br>arrears.\" That\'s simply ludicrous. What sort of deficit must we<br>possess for the sanctity and the worth of human life that we simply<br>allow people to destroy it, and then implicitly tell people that<br>it\'s acceptable in this society? Government becomes the willing<br>accomplice in the destruction of human lives and families, simply for<br>political and fiscal expediency (\"let\'s get rid of this costly \'war<br>on drugs\'\"). Government can\'t suddenly declare itself uninterested in<br>the welfare of its citizens. Legalizing all drugs sends that message.<br><br>Need a real-life example? Just look at Colorado, the first state in the<br>country to fully legalize recreational marijuana, and create a real<br>marketplace for it. The studies are coming out (slowly), but we are<br>finding that not only is marijuana harmful to kids, but the fact that it<br>has been recreationally legalized has planted the idea firmly in kids\'<br>heads that it is safe and accepted. Marijuana oil in an e-cig is rapidly<br>becoming the drug of choice in high schools across the state, and the<br>logic behind it is, \"hey, it\'s medicinal, and it\'s legal.\" School<br>Resource Officers here spend a portion of nearly every day running<br>confiscated vape oil through THC testing. I don\'t yet have any stats to<br>show how much they find, but they test every bit of vape oil that they<br>confiscate. I do know they are fighting a losing battle, as the public<br>perception of the drug is softening, and kids feed right into that.<br><br>Also, we have an *epidemic* of 18-25 year old homeless people now in<br>the state. Many of them came from out of state, believing they\'d be<br>able to \"smoke pot, and find some work when we get there, to pay for<br>our pot.\" The \"smoke pot\" goal was easily realized; the \"find work\"<br>goal was not. Entry-level unskilled labor jobs for that age range are<br>next to unavailable statewide. So they show up, smoke away what money<br>they came with, and end up in the (already overcrowded) homeless<br>shelter, or on the streets, panhandling for drug money, or worse.<br><br>Legalizing and controlling some drugs may help to reduce unnecessary<br>enforcement. And it certainly will reduce the amount of money we spend<br>prosecuting drug offenses. It\'s the right thing to do to legalize<br>marijuana. But applying that same formulary to all drugs is simply<br>wrong-headed.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
