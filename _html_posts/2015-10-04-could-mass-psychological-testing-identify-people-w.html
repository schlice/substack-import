<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [The testing, or which tests should be used, isn\'t the<br>actual problem. Performing mass-\<anything\> wastes time and money. And<br>it\'s not fair to only target the people who wish to own a gun for<br>testing, because as I\'ve said many times, people who commit mass<br>shootings may have a mental disorder, but they\'re not stupid. So if<br>buying a gun legally will subject them to mental exams wherein their<br>particular psychosis may be discovered, they\'ll simply buy their guns<br>illegally, or steal them.\<br>\<br>Let\'s just start with the low-hanging fruit.\<br>\<br>Since deinstitutionaliztion, the \"bar\" for committing someone to<br>psychiatric care in this country has been raised far too high. Police in<br>this country cannot commit someone that they confront who is clearly not<br>in his/her right mind. That person must be a \"danger to himself or to<br>others\" before they can then be referred for a \"psych hold.\" This is<br>often referred to by California\'s law number (5150) for psych holds<br>(interestingly, Van Halen named one of their albums after this famous<br>code number as well). However, most people the police encounter who are<br>mentally ill are not a danger to themselves. They simply can\'t (or<br>won\'t) do what they need to do to take care of themselves. The police<br>can do nothing to help them.\<br>\<br>Sending such a person for more detailed testing is not allowed because<br>it violates that person\'s right to make healthcare decisions on their<br>own. But what if they are so mentally ill that they choose not to care<br>for themselves? No one can help them. Until they become violent.\<br>\<br>If we can help to identify the mentally ill and get them the help they<br>need *before* they become violent, we could stop many of these issues<br>before they start.\<br>\<br>People knew James Holmes was mentally ill long before he shot up a movie<br>theater in Aurora. He wasn\'t stupid, however. His mental illness helped<br>him to come up with a theory: \"life credits.\" He postulated that he<br>could \"gain\" life credits by \"taking\" the life credits of others (by<br>killing them). If he got enough life credits before he died, he would be<br>fine, even if he died. He was very intelligent; he was a pre-med<br>student. He was just mentally ill. But everyone who knew he was crazy<br>was enjoined from helping him. They pleaded with him to get help. He was<br>even seeing a counselor. None of them knew he would actually act on his<br>thoughts. How exactly do you stop that?]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
