<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>A2A<br><br>Specifically for the rape charge, it depends on the state. Most states<br>have a statute of limitations of anywhere from 3 years to 30 years. Some<br>states have no statutes of limitations on rape at all.<br><br>So let's assume that there was DNA evidence and an indictment followed<br>from the state in which the alleged rape took place, and the state has<br>either a very long statute of limitations (25 years or longer) or no<br>statute of limitations at all on rape. He would not be arrested, he<br>would be *indicted*. He might be asked to turn himself in, but as the<br>president-elect, it seems unlikely. He's certainly not a flight risk. An<br>indictment does not stop the presidential inauguration process from<br>proceeding, nor does it prevent the president-elect from assuming<br>office. Trump would assume office as normal. Congress could then impeach<br>the president and remove him from office, and the Vice President would<br>become President. They could also potentially refuse to certify the<br>results of the election, but that would be a massive mistake as it would<br>invoke a constitutional crisis.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
