<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Are most traffic tickets just a way for police departments to drum up<br>revenue for new cruisers?**<br><br>No. In most states, ticket revenue goes to the *state*, not directly<br>into the department issuing the ticket. The police enforce state law, so<br>the state collects the revenue, not the department.<br><br>Funding for vehicles comes from a completely separate funding source<br>from state government, not from traffic tickets.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
