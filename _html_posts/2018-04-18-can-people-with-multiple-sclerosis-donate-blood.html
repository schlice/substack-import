<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Can people with multiple sclerosis donate blood?<br><br>(US Answer Only)<br><br>Until recently, people with MS could not donate blood. However, since it<br>has been proven that MS is not contagious and cannot be transmitted by<br>blood, MS patients can now donate blood. As of May, 2007, as long as all<br>other conditions for donating blood are met, MS patients are permitted<br>to donate blood.<br><br>Most medications do not disqualify you from donating blood. However, if<br>you were taking (or are taking) Aubagio for your MS treatment, you are<br>ineligible to donate blood, and cannot donate for two years after you<br>stop treatment. This is likely because the active ingredient in Aubagio,<br>teriflunomide, can cause liver failure.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
