<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Exactly what kind of gun should the teachers be armed with?<br><br>Teachers should be armed with exactly the kind of gun they feel<br>comfortable carrying and concealing, and exactly the gun they have<br>trained with.<br><br>Teachers (or anyone, for that matter) should only conceal a handgun that<br>they feel comfortable firing, drawing from concealment, and placing<br>shots reliably at a pre-determined distance.<br><br>This is almost the wrong question to ask, because it presumes that "we"<br>are "arming teachers." We are not so much arming teachers as we are "not<br>preventing teachers from arming themselves." This means that the onus is<br>on the teacher to meet all the requirements placed on them to get<br>concealed carry permits; the onus is not on us to provide them with<br>arms, or even dictate what is appropriate.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
