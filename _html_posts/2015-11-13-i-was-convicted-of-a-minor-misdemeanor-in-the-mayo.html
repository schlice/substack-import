<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [To expound on [[Matthew<br>Bohrer](https://www.quora.com/profile/Matthew-Bohrer)]{.qlink_container}\'s<br>answer, if you have a bench warrant out on you, you can be arrested<br>anywhere in the country for that warrant. If you\'re not in the<br>jurisdiction where the warrant was issued, you will be detained until<br>the original warrant is pulled, and the original jurisdiction will<br>decide whether or not they want you held for extradition back to the<br>original jurisdiction. If they do want you held, the officer stopping<br>you will have absolutely no choice but to hold you. If not, the<br>complaining officer can let you go.\<br>\<br>The further away from the jurisdiction you get, the less chance you have<br>of being extradited. If you get stopped in the jurisdiction where the<br>warrant is active, you\'ll be arrested. If you get stopped in another<br>jurisdiction within the state, there\'s a good chance you\'ll be<br>transferred back to the warranting jurisdiction. If you\'re out of<br>state, you may or may not be held for extradition.\<br>\<br>That said, I\'m not telling you to leave the jurisdiction. Understand<br>that if you\'re far away from the original jurisdiction, and you know<br>you have a warrant out for your arrest, they\'re going to wonder why you<br>are so far away from the jurisdiction, because it kinda looks like<br>you\'re running from your conviction, which is bad.\<br>\<br>If you don\'t have a criminal defense attorney, it\'s time to retain one<br>and see if you can plead this thing out. You can\'t really live long in<br>this country with any kind of warrant out on you. If it\'s a<br>misdemeanor, you might be able to plead it out to something really<br>small, so just get it done and move on. Running will just make it<br>worse.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
