In the United States, we have noise ordinances which<br>usually are in effect between 11 PM and 7 AM. Excessive noise during<br>this time could warrant a visit from the police.<br><br>But start with the local administration of your living facility. If they<br>do not help, involve the police.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
