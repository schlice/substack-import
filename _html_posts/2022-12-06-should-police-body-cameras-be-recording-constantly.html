<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>As a taxpayer, I have to say no.<br><br>First, the amount of storage that would be required for that amount of<br>data for that amount of time will become enormous, along with the cost<br>to maintain that storage. I don't want my police department's IT group<br>to be the cause of their budget doubling.<br><br>Additionally, there are privacy concerns around that data. Cameras are<br>not permitted in public restrooms, yet police officers are permitted in<br>public restrooms. So you either have to have the ability to turn the<br>camera off, or force police officers to not use public restrooms. I'm<br>sure that police unions will readily approve that. Additionally, what if<br>a police officer interviews a child rape victim? Is this the kind of<br>recording you want readily available to anyone with a FOIA request?<br><br>And finally, what is to be done when an officer's video feed is obscured<br>or non-existent? Do you fire the officer? I mean, what did we do<br>*before* body cameras? We trusted that our police officers were<br>honorable people and that they told the truth, and in reality, the vast<br>majority were. Clearly, there are some bad apples who either joined bad<br>or soured while on the job, and that kind of stuff is always bound to<br>happen, but this effort to constantly be looking over the shoulder of a<br>police officer is tantamount to saying, "I don't trust you with the<br>badge that I entrusted to you."<br><br>And if body cameras are good enough to always be running to keep our<br>police forces in check, how about our politicians? I bet that would<br>eliminate quite a few shady backroom deals, right?<br><br>Body cameras are *tools*, just like every other tool a police officer<br>carries. It is useful for some things, but it is a hindrance for others.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
