<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What do people who actually have Celiac disease think of the \"gluten<br>sensitivity\" claims?**<br><br>I am a "gluten sensitive" person.<br><br>It only make sense. Wheat is one of the biggest GI irritants out there,<br>along with dairy and eggs. It's entirely possible that a person can be<br>sensitive to wheat even without having Celiac disease.<br><br>By the way, my sensitivity is induced by the medication I take for MS.<br><br>When I was going through the worst of my sensitivity, I switched to a<br>gluten-free diet and felt better than I had in years. I stayed on that<br>diet for two years, and then slowly weaned off of it. I had to do it<br>slowly, because the GI sensitivity was still there for me. It still is<br>to this day; I still must take supplements to control the gas and<br>bloating I get if I eat a whole plate of pasta, but I can eat bread<br>(like a bun or sandwich bread) and items with wheat in them without any<br>trouble.<br><br>There is a big difference between Celiac disease and gluten sensitivity.<br>They both exist, and they are both different from each other.<br><br>It's odd; a fast food restaurant I frequent (who shall remain nameless)<br>offers the option to replace your bun on your burger with an iceberg<br>lettuce wrap. When you ask for it, they ask you if it is "allergic or<br>lifestyle." Clearly, they are doing so because they want to know if they<br>need to control allergens or if you just don't want the bun. But the<br>oversimplification tends to illustrate exactly the sort of divide you're<br>assuming in your question. There is more to it than just "Celiac or<br>lifestyle."<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
