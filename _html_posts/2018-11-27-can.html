<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I like Wikipedia's definition of a perjury trap.<br><br>> A perjury trap is a form of prosecutorial misconduct in which a<br>> prosecutor calls a witness to testify, typically before a grand jury,<br>> with the intent of coercing the witness into perjury (intentional<br>> deceit under oath). Most often a perjury trap is employed because the<br>> prosecutor is unable to prosecute the defendant on other charges.<br>><br>> As an example, suppose that a person committed a crime for which they<br>> were never prosecuted, but the statute of limitations on that crime<br>> has expired. A prosecutor could set a perjury trap for them by calling<br>> them as a witness before a grand jury in a case about a different<br>> crime, and ask them about the expired crime. If the witness lies about<br>> the expired crime, that would be perjury---a new crime, which could<br>> then be prosecuted. Prosecution for perjury elicited in this manner<br>> violates due process of law, since the investigatory powers of the<br>> grand jury are exploited to reach beyond their legal limits. It has<br>> been argued by legal scholars whether it constitutes a form of<br>> entrapment.<br>><br>> Claims of a perjury trap are common when perjury charges result from<br>> testimony before a grand jury, but are rarely proven. No US federal<br>> court has ever accepted a motion to dismiss because of claimed perjury<br>> trap. The defense is extremely difficult, because the question that<br>> elicited the perjured testimony must be immaterial to the case in<br>> which it was asked, and courts construe very broadly what questions<br>> count as material to a case.\[1\](#KNrwx){#cite-KNrwx<br>> .citation_link}<br><br>So it isn't just "don't lie." It's clear that the impetus behind a<br>perjury trap is tricking someone into committing perjury.<br><br>So while the answer may be as simple as "don't commit perjury," it's<br>more difficult than it may sound.<br><br>(EDIT) My commenters (who by the way, I really appreciate, thank you)<br>seem to be leaning in the direction of "we don't understand how this is<br>a perjury trap. Can't you just plead the 5th, or refuse to answer the<br>question because it is irrelevant?" Well, yes you can. Of course the<br>correct answer is to plead the 5th. You may have less success with the<br>question of relevancy because there isn't an actual jury present (we'll<br>get there in a sec), but it's certainly an option. The absolute correct<br>answer, though, is to plead the 5th.<br><br>But in the example above, we're talking about a *grand jury*. This is<br>where a prosecutor would try a perjury trap, not in open court with a<br>judge and opposing counsel present. A perjury trap question in open<br>court would be immediately objected to by your lawyer for relevance, and<br>most likely the judge would force the prosecutor to ignore that line of<br>questioning and move on.<br><br>However, in a grand jury, it's just you, the prosecutor, and over 20<br>jurors, in a closed courtroom. No witnesses, no visitors, no judge.<br>There's a fair bit of pressure, and the feeling of a lack of protection.<br>A person of weaker constitution, when faced with one of these questions<br>in such a situation, might be tempted to lie. In that moment, the person<br>goes from "witness" to "accused," and if you're unprepared for that<br>shift, you may be tempted to lie your way out of it...<br><br>...thus, the trap.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-KNrwx){.citation_index} [[Perjury trap -<br>Wikipedia](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=c7894d&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perjury_trap){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
