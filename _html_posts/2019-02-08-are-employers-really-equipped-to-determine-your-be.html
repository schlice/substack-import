<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Are employers really equipped to determine your best options for<br>health insurance?**<br><br>The answer is that they are not. But that's because they don't. They<br>don't actually determine your best options for anything. They offer you<br>health plans that they pay for. That's it. They say, "we contracted with<br>Health Insurance Company X and that's the health insurance we offer."<br>They may actually partner with multiple health insurance companies,<br>depending on how big they are.<br><br>You are under no obligation to accept those plans. You can always<br>opt-out and buy your own insurance if you choose. You can also choose to<br>not work for that company and take their health plans.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
