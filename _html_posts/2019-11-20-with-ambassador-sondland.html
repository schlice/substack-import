<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**With Ambassador Sondland\'s confession, is it sure now that President<br>Trump would be impeached?**<br><br>Even without Ambassador Sondland testimony, it was *always* sure that<br>President Trump would be impeached. You only need a simple majority in<br>the House to pass Articles of Impeachment, and Democrats have a majority<br>in the House. So passing Articles of Impeachment was never a question.<br><br>I don't even need a crystal ball to tell you exactly what will happen:<br><br>- Trump will be impeached by a partisan vote in the House.<br>- Trump will not be found guilty in the Senate trial and **will<br>  not** be removed from office by a partisan vote in the Senate.<br><br>The testimony isn't telling anyone anything. The Representatives who<br>believe Trump is a criminal will be emboldened by this testimony. The<br>Representatives who believe this is all a big show will continue to see<br>that there is nothing here worthy of impeachment. I can bet you that no<br>one will change their votes after all of this testimony.<br><br>Which means that this testimony is for *your benefit*, not the<br>benefit of Congress. Schiff is trying to make the case to *you* that<br>impeachment is warranted. He has enough votes in the House already to<br>pass Articles of Impeachment. However, he needs *you* to be on board<br>with impeachment, or he's in trouble.<br><br>*And on that front, he's failing, because he's changing minds, just not<br>in favor of impeachment.* Democrats who think he is guilty of something<br>impeachable still think he's guilty of something impeachable.<br>Republicans who think there's nothing impeachable here are not swayed by<br>this testimony. Independents, however, are slowly turning against the<br>impeachment, and every week that this inquiry continues, more and more<br>Independents are polling against impeachment instead of for it. Schiff<br>is losing the narrative, and it does not bode well for Democrats<br>retaining control of the House in 2020.<br><br>The American public is on investigation overload. These inquiries don't<br>even move the needle for them. After two years of Mueller investigations<br>that ended in a big nothingburger, now they're trying the Ukraine angle,<br>and people are weary. Democrats in Congress are literally grasping for<br>anything they can in order to try to make the case to get Trump<br>impeached before the election, so that they can hang that around his<br>neck and hopefully score some points for their eventual candidate. Do<br>you really see something so heinous here that the President must be<br>impeached before the election? Do you really think that the American<br>people aren't smart enough to handle this on their own in the 2020<br>elections? In other words, if there's something so bad that Trump<br>shouldn't be in office, you think the American people would still<br>re-elect him? There's only 11 months until the General election, but<br>Congress literally doesn't think you can handle it. They think they need<br>to handle this themselves, they don't think you are smart enough to<br>understand whether or not Trump should stay in office.<br><br>But people also see that nothing is being accomplished in Congress<br>except for endless investigations, and they are even more disappointed<br>with Congress' work than before.<br><br>Which is why Democrats in the House are losing this war. They may win<br>the battle and pass Articles of Impeachment, but I think ultimately they<br>will lose the war.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
