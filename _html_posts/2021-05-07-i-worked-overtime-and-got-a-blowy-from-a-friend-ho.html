<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Ah yes, the Bill Clinton School of Sex: "I. DID NOT. HAVE. SEXUAL.<br>RELATIONS. WITH. THAT. WOMAN."<br><br>In actuality, it was that event that began the change in society wherein<br>oral sex was not considered sex. It's been called the "Clinton-Lewinsky<br>Effect."<br><br>These days, only around 20% of young adults consider oral sex to be sex.<br>They consider it to be "foreplay." But in the eyes of the law and health<br>professionals, it is.<br><br>But that's not the question you asked. The question you asked was **is<br>it cheating**?<br><br>I love this answer to that question:<br><br>> In some ways, it doesn't matter whether you consider oral sex to be<br>> sex as long as you and your partner, if you are in a relationship, see<br>> it the same way. While many people see any type of sexual activities<br>> with someone other than your partner as cheating, some also consider<br>> there to be different levels, or seriousness, of cheating. If your<br>> partner kissed someone else, would that be as bad as if they had sex<br>> with someone? And if there are different levels of seriousness, where<br>> does oral sex fall in that line? Could you forgive your partner for<br>> having oral sex but not for having penetrative sex?<br>><br>> In this context, whether or not you believe oral sex is sex isn't as<br>> important as communicating with your partner about your own<br>> relationship expectations and listening to what theirs<br>> are.\[1\](#STLTx){#cite-STLTx .citation_link}<br><br>So let me ask you this question: if your partner told you that she got a<br>licky from a co-worker and she rubbed him out, but they didn't actually<br>have sex, how would you feel?<br><br>**If you haven't discussed this with your partner, then that's why you<br>feel guilty.**<br><br>Take the time and discuss it. If your partner is not okay with it, then<br>you have a decision to make. Either change your behavior and be more<br>respectful towards your current partner, or leave that relationship.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>I worked overtime and got a blowy from a friend. How come I feel a bit<br>guilty even though I didn\'t actually have sex so not really cheating?<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-STLTx){.citation_index} [[Is Oral Sex Really<br>Sex?](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=74decd&url=https://www.healthcentral.com/article/is-oral-sex-really-sex){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="healthcentral.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
