<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Ah yes, the "abortion as self-defense" argument.<br><br>So let's first start all discussions about abortion with the<br>acknowledgement that pregnancy is hard. It is life-changing for the<br>woman. We fully understand how difficult pregnancy can be on a woman.<br><br>But is it "life-threatening?" Well, it can be. But does that mean we can<br>kill the baby in self-defense? Shouldn't we have the right to protect<br>ourselves, even if it means killing someone, if our life is at risk?<br><br>First, we must understand the difference between a threat and an<br>aggressor. Calling the baby a violent aggressor, even an innocent<br>one, is a misleading description of what happens in pregnancy.<br>**Aggressors directly put others in danger; threats put others in danger<br>only indirectly or without intention, by proximity or circumstance.**<br>For example, if I drop a bowling ball out of the window of a tall<br>building, I'm the *aggressor* towards the person walking below, the<br>bowling ball is only the *threat*. While complications in pregnancy may<br>add risks for the mother, the fetus never *directly* causes the mother<br>harm. While aggressors are *directly* responsible for their actions<br>and subject to punishment, this isn't true of threats. You don't<br>punish the bowling ball for the actions of the dropper. You don't punish<br>the gun for the actions of the gun operator. And **you can't use<br>disproportionate force to repel a threat *without yourself becoming<br>an aggressor*, which makes you the one in the wrong.**<br><br>To that end, it is clear that the baby is not an aggressor (because the<br>baby does not directly put the mother in danger), but only a threat.<br><br>\<br><br>Now that we have determined that the baby is a threat (and not an<br>aggressor), before we determine whether or not we can kill the baby to<br>protect ourselves from the threat, we have to make sure we only use<br>proportionate force to do so. In other words, we need to evaluate *how<br>much* of a risk the baby is to the mother's life. If there is a 75%<br>chance she will die, then morally permissible options look very<br>different from a 10% chance.<br><br>***The risk to the woman's life that pregnancy poses doesn't even come<br>close to a reasonable risk to justify the use of force to end it.***<br><br>It's not a 75% risk. It's not a 10% risk. *It isn't even a 1% risk.* In<br>the United States in 2016, a pregnant woman had a [[**0.017% chance of<br>dying**](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=9daadc&url=https://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/maternal-mortality/pregnancy-mortality-surveillance-system.htm%23ratio){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="cdc.gov"}]{.qlink_container} **because of a<br>pregnancy-related complication.** You actually have a higher risk of<br>death from getting your appendix removed, which is[ [0.21% chance for<br>patients under 60 years<br>old](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=06ef79&url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27535664?fbclid%3DIwAR0_4Mj8SomiMwLXi-j9c-fUGguNtwLaxfhf3BGgfiEmWdTp_1dMh9d7REY){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="nih.gov"}]{.qlink_container}.<br><br>\<br><br>There are some other facets to this argument that must be accepted in<br>order to cogently state that abortion as self-defense is valid, along<br>with the idea that the fetus is an aggressor:<br><br>1.  The idea that abortion is safer for the woman than childbirth.<br>2.  The idea that consent to sex is not consent to pregnancy.<br><br>We can individually evaluate each one of those, but those arguments are<br>not strong either, and you need to make those arguments in order to make<br>the case that abortion is a valid form of self-defense. So the "abortion<br>as self-defense" argument is already weak, and it sits on a foundation<br>of weak premises.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
