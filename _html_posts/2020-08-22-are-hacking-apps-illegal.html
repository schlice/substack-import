<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Are hacking apps illegal?<br><br>We've had this controversy for decades. Does no one remember *The<br>Anarchist Cookbook?*<br><br>[[The Anarchist Cookbook: Powell, William: 9781607966128: Amazon.com:<br>Books](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=6cd00d&url=https://www.amazon.com/Anarchist-Cookbook-William-Powell/dp/1607966123){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="amazon.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>As you can see, it's still freely available on Amazon for purchase. Its<br>product description:<br><br>> The Anarchist Cookbook will shock, it will disturb, it will provoke.<br>> It places in historical perspective an era when \"Turn on, Burn down,<br>> Blow up\" are revolutionary slogans of the day. Says the author\"<br>> \"This book\... is not written for the members of fringe political<br>> groups, such as the Weatherman, or The Minutemen. Those radical groups<br>> don\'t need this book. They already know everything that\'s in here.<br>> If the real people of America, the silent majority, are going to<br>> survive, they must educate themselves. That is the purpose of this<br>> book.\" In what the author considers a survival guide, there is<br>> explicit information on the uses and effects of drugs, ranging from<br>> pot to heroin to peanuts. There i detailed advice concerning<br>> electronics, sabotage, and surveillance, with data on everything from<br>> bugs to scramblers. There is a comprehensive chapter on natural,<br>> non-lethal, and lethal weapons, running the gamut from cattle prods to<br>> sub-machine guns to bows and arrows. The section on explosives and<br>> booby traps ranges from TNT to whistle traps. One hundred and eleven<br>> drawings supplement the recipes. \"This book is for anarchists,\" says<br>> William Powell, \"Those who feel able to discipline themselves on all<br>> the subjects from drugs, to weapons, to explosives) that are currently<br>> illegal in this country.\" Techniques, disciplines, precautions, and<br>> warnings pervade what may be the most disquieting \"how-to\" book of<br>> contemporary times.<br><br>So why are we discussing this in a question about hacking apps?<br><br>The apps themselves are not illegal. Creating an app which can hack<br>other things is an exercise in programming, nothing more.<br><br>*Using that app could be illegal*.<br><br>It could be legal if you use it against your own systems.<br><br>It could be legal if you use it against a system you were asked to<br>analyze for security holes.<br><br>But it would probably be illegal if you use it to try to access a site<br>that you did not have authorization to access.<br><br>It's not about the *tool*. It's about *how you use the tool.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
