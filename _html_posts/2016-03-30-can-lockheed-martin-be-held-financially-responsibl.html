The FAR is what keeps companies like Boeing, Lockheed,<br>Grumman, and others alive and kicking. There are lots of different<br>contract types; some place more risk on the contractor, some place more<br>risk on the government.<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-46281179d223d3c158556237e9f153f8){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-46281179d223d3c158556237e9f153f8" master_w="485"<br>master_h="273"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>(from [[Government Contracting - The<br>Basics](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=f7250c&url=http://www.acq.osd.mil/osbp/docs/government_contracting_the_basics.pdf){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="osd.mil"}]{.qlink_container})<br><br>Fixed price contracts place more risk on the contractor, as cost<br>overruns are paid for by the contractor. Cost Plus contracts place more<br>risk on the government because deadline overruns are not penalized, and<br>some cost overruns are paid for by the government, depending on contract<br>type. So depending on how the contract is written, risk of cost overruns<br>or risks due to subcontractors not delivering, or risks due to projected<br>solutions not being produced can either be placed on the government, the<br>contractor, or both. All of these things happened in the F-35 program:<br>cost overruns, subcontractors not delivering, solutions required for<br>proper functioning not being developed in the aggreed-upon timeframes,<br>etc. Additionally, hackers and Edward Snowden caused some of the<br>classified components of the project to be released, causing the<br>government to have to trash those components and develop new ones,<br>delaying the project further.<br><br>It\'s easy to look at the total overruns and say \"Well, clearly someone<br>screwed up in writing *that* contract\" or \"Well, that\'s just the<br>government wasting our money again\" but it\'s far more complex than<br>that. It\'s an integrated set of contracts that all work together, and<br>there were failures across the board: the contractors did not properly<br>report when they were going to slip, the government contracting agencies<br>did not provide proper oversight and demand updated reports on subs,<br>etc.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
