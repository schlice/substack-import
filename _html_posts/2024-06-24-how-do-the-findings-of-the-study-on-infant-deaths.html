<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>So to answer your question, [[the<br>study](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=f10313&url=https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2819785?guestAccessKey%3D7d568a16-aea5-41e6-bb65-f9c586b2ecb0%26utm_source%3DFor_The_Media%26utm_medium%3Dreferral%26utm_campaign%3Dftm_links%26utm_content%3Dtfl%26utm_term%3D062424){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="jamanetwork.com"}]{.qlink_container} found that between 2021<br>and 2022, infant deaths in Texas rose from 1,985 to 2,240, a<br>year-over-year increase of 255 deaths. This corresponds to a 12.9<br>percent increase in infant deaths in Texas versus a 1.8 percent increase<br>in infant deaths in the rest of the U.S. during the same period. The<br>study defines infants as under 12 months old.<br><br>So there's the answer to the question.<br><br>Now, what do you do with this information?<br><br>Well, in order to draw a *correct* understanding, you need more<br>information. For example, one might ask how "infant deaths" is related<br>to abortion.<br><br>Ah, there's the rub. The study goes on to try to interpret the data for<br>you (which is where the study turns from science to propaganda) and<br>explains that the reason you see this increase in "infant death" is<br>because babies with terminal abnormalities are being allowed to be born<br>and then are dying before 12 months of age, which is classified as an<br>"infant death."<br><br>*Whoa, wait a second. So the only reason it is classified as an "infant<br>death" is because those babies were not allowed to be* *aborted?*<br><br>Yep, that's right. So let's look at the difference between Texas and,<br>say, California, when it comes to the same baby, so we can see the<br>difference:<br><br>- California: baby with fetal abnormalities is aborted: dead baby.<br>- Texas: baby with fetal abnormalities cannot be aborted, is born, and<br>  dies of these fetal abnormalities: dead baby.<br><br>So the result is exactly the same: a dead baby. But on one hand, it's<br>called an abortion, and on the other hand, it's called an "infant<br>death."<br><br>Therefore, the study means absolutely nothing. Literally, the only<br>thing that the study shows is that when you disallow abortion because of<br>fetal abnormalities, some babies will be born and will die before they<br>turn a year old. That makes the "infant mortality" rate arbitrarily<br>climb, because those babies are not aborted before they are born. *This<br>is expected behavior in Texas, this should not be a surprise.*<br><br>However, it's the analysis of the study that is more telling. *The<br>study's authors find that to be a worse crime than abortion, because of<br>the hardship the family must endure.* The authors posit (without<br>evidence) that it is easier on the families to simply abort the baby<br>rather than to allow it to be born and die, so the more moral position<br>is abortion.<br><br>\<br><br>But this view is incorrect, because the study is looking at the wrong<br>data. In order to have answered the correct question, the study's<br>authors should have investigated the following:<br><br>***How many babies with fetal abnormalities were born and DID NOT<br>DIE?***<br><br>The study failed to even address that point.<br><br>In other words: in Texas, it's possible that some of those babies may<br>have survived, whereas in California, that same baby *would never have<br>been given the chance to try to survive.* Of course, we don't know how<br>many babies with pre-existing fetal abnormalities survived, because the<br>study authors did not address that issue.<br><br>Anecdotal reports of babies diagnosed with fetal abnormalities being<br>born and surviving (even thriving) are abundant on the Internet. I'm not<br>going to speculate why that is, because those are topics for other<br>Spaces, and in any case, it is not materially related to this question.<br><br>But what we *can* say is that, at least in Texas, we give the baby a<br>fighting chance instead of killing it before it even has the chance to<br>fight.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
