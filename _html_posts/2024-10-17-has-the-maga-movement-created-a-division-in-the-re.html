<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The MAGA movement is a symptom, not the cause, of the division. Trump<br>himself is the cause of the division.<br><br>I see the Republican party now splintered into a variety of factions,<br>but it all is happening specifically about Trump. There are three main<br>groups of Republicans when it comes to feelings about Trump:<br><br>MAGA Republicans\<br>MOST bog-standard Republicans\<br>Never Trumpers<br><br>These are ranked from *most* sycophantic/sympathetic to Trump to *least*<br>sycophantic/sympathetic to Trump. Let's look at each of them one at a<br>time:<br><br>- MAGA Republicans. These are the guys wearing the "'Mericuns for<br>  Trump" shirts and the girls wearing the "He can grab this pussy<br>  anytime he wants" shirts. They *love* Trump. They've completely<br>  discounted his character flaws. They've painted their cars with images<br>  of Trump. They have MAGA flags and hats and signs all over their<br>  houses. Some of them believe he represents some sort of savior. These<br>  guys are fringe Republicans.<br>- Most bog-standard Republicans. This is where the vast majority of<br>  Republicans land on the question of Trump. Yeah, he's a flawed<br>  candidate. He's a flawed man. He's definitely not perfect. But most<br>  Republicans aren't voting for him because they think he's totally<br>  awesome. They're putting *principles above personalities* and voting<br>  for the candidate who they believe can do more good for the country<br>  than the other flawed candidate. This is the vast majority of<br>  Republicans.<br>- Never Trumpers. These are people who still hold the same ideas<br>  about the Republican party, but are so off-put by the man himself and<br>  his particular character flaws that they cannot, in good conscience,<br>  cast a vote for him. They're not going to vote for Harris, but they're<br>  also not going to ever vote for any ticket which includes Trump. They<br>  would rather literally throw their vote away on a third party<br>  candidate than vote for Trump. These are also a small fringe of the<br>  Party. This, by the way, is the part of the Republican party who<br>  "actively oppose Trump and MAGA."<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
