<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [We have already answered this question. I understand the<br>point of the question is different, but the idea of replacing bullets<br>with tranqulilzers has already been asked and answered:\<br>\<br>[[What are the biggest obstacles to the use of tranquilizer darts<br>instead of bullets in the United States as a solution to the gun control<br>controversy?](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-biggest-obstacles-to-the-use-of-tranquilizer-darts-instead-of-bullets-in-the-United-States-as-a-solution-to-the-gun-control-controversy)]{.qlink_container}\<br>\<br>Basically, tranqulizers don\'t work on people quickly or equally. Use<br>too much and you kill them. Use too little, and they just get a little<br>groggy.\<br>\<br>Plus, tranquilizers don\'t work the same way you see in the movies. If<br>you don\'t hit a vein, it could take up to 30 minutes before the<br>sedative starts to take effect, which makes the dart effectively useless<br>as a self-defense weapon.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
