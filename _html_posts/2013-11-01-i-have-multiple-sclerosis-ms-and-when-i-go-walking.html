<br/><br/>Answer<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content: [I don\'t let my mind wander. It\'s too little to be out on<br/>its own.\<br/>\<br/>Anyway, when I am walking, I thank God that He has given me one more day<br/>of free mobility. I park in the far away parking spaces and walk \--<br/>because I can. I go on walks with my wife because she still kinda likes<br/>me and puts up with my crap. I try not to think about the day when I<br/>won\'t be able to walk. I try to stay positive. It\'s not always easy.<br/>But you will fail 100% of the time if you don\'t try.]<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content language: English<br/><br/><br/>
