<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [I don\'t let my mind wander. It\'s too little to be out on<br>its own.\<br>\<br>Anyway, when I am walking, I thank God that He has given me one more day<br>of free mobility. I park in the far away parking spaces and walk \--<br>because I can. I go on walks with my wife because she still kinda likes<br>me and puts up with my crap. I try not to think about the day when I<br>won\'t be able to walk. I try to stay positive. It\'s not always easy.<br>But you will fail 100% of the time if you don\'t try.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
