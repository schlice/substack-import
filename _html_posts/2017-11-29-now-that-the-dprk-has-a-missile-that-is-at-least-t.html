<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Now that the DPRK has a missile that is (at least) theoretically<br>capable of carrying a nuclear weapon to any point in the United States<br>of America, what is the likelihood of it \'claiming victory and going<br>home\'?**<br><br>Somewhere between slim and none.<br><br>Their goal was to develop a viable nuclear weapon so they can "sit at<br>the grown up table" with the other nuclear nations and "be taken<br>seriously" in international discussions.<br><br>But as you all know, it takes more than a big stick to be respected, in<br>the words of Teddy Roosevelt. You also have to "speak softly," something<br>which the Kims have never done. There is a place for diplomacy, and the<br>Kims don't understand that the threat of nuclear violence only works if<br>you are backing up a globally accepted standard of conduct. Screaming at<br>the top of your lungs, "YOU MUST NOW RESPECT ME BECAUSE I HAVE A NUKE!"<br>doesn't garner you any more respect than when you didn't have a nuke in<br>the first place.<br><br>We always watched DPRK closely. Now we have to watch them twice as<br>closely, and anything that even smells like a threat against another<br>nation will have to be dealt with swiftly, because the ramifications are<br>now so much greater.<br><br>IF ONLY the DPRK could stop committing atrocities against its own people<br>and come to the bargaining table as an equal ally on the world stage,<br>things might be different. Is that likely to happen now, simply because<br>they now possess the technologies which collectively can create a<br>nuclear device?<br><br>I highly doubt it.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
