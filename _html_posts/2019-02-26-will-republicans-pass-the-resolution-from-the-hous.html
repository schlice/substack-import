<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Will Republicans pass the resolution from the House to stop the<br>Emergency Declaration to build the border wall?**<br><br>No. House Republicans will not vote for the resolution. But House<br>Democrats will, and they have enough for a simple majority.<br><br>However, in order to actually potentially have any effect, the National<br>Emergencies Act says that you need a joint resolution meaning that<br>both the House and the Senate must pass it.<br><br>The Senate will not pass it.<br><br>And even if they somehow did, the President can still veto it. Which<br>means that in order to cancel the national emergency, Congress would<br>need a 2/3 majority in both houses. They don't have a 2/3 majority in<br>either house.<br><br>So it simply doesn't matter. There's no way Congress can stop this.<br>Anything the House does is symbolic.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
