<br/><br/>Answer<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content: [Barbershop singers know the old songs. It\'s what we<br/>learned when we were learning the techniques used to sing barbershop<br/>harmony. Like pianists who learned Chopin, Beethoven, Bach, and the<br/>other classical artists, barbershoppers know the old songs from<br/>practice.\<br/>\<br/>When I hear this question, I can\'t help but be more sentimental and<br/>perhaps a bit more hopeful. Of course, there is more trepidation the<br/>second time around, but love is patient and kind, and love never seeks<br/>to injure. I can\'t help but think of the lyrics to the old song,<br/>\"Takin\' A Chance On Love\" which happens to be all about love the<br/>second time around, and the artist relates this to a game of cards. If<br/>you\'ll allow me, I\'d like to give you those lyrics:\<br/>\<br/>]<br/><br/>&gt; I thought love\'s game was over,\<br/>&gt; Lady Luck had gone away.\<br/>&gt; I laid my cards on the table,\<br/>&gt; Unable to play.\<br/>&gt; Then I heard Good Fortune say,\<br/>&gt; They\'re dealing you a new hand today!\<br/>&gt; \<br/>&gt; So here I go again\<br/>&gt; I hear the trumpets blow again\<br/>&gt; I\'m all aglow again\<br/>&gt; Takin\' a chance on love\<br/>&gt; \<br/>&gt; Here I slide again,\<br/>&gt; About to take that ride again\<br/>&gt; So starry-eyed again,\<br/>&gt; Takin\' a chance on love.\<br/>&gt; \<br/>&gt; I thought the cards were a frame-up\<br/>&gt; I never would try.\<br/>&gt; But now I\'m takin\' the game up,\<br/>&gt; And the Ace of Hearts is high!\<br/>&gt; \<br/>&gt; Things are mending now,\<br/>&gt; I see a rainbow blending now,\<br/>&gt; We\'ll have a happy ending now,\<br/>&gt; Takin\' a chance on love\<br/>&gt; \<br/>&gt; I\'m walkin\' around with a horseshoe,\<br/>&gt; In clover I lie.\<br/>&gt; And brother Rabbit, of course you\<br/>&gt; Better kiss your foot goodbye\<br/>&gt; \<br/>&gt; On the ball again,\<br/>&gt; I\'m headin\' for a fall again,\<br/>&gt; I\'m gonna give my all again,\<br/>&gt; Takin\' a chance on love!\<br/><br/>\<br/>I think many nth-time relationships fail because of our own unease and<br/>fear of \"being hurt\" again. But if you follow the advice of the<br/>author, \"take the chance.\" They\'re dealing you a new hand!<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content language: English<br/><br/><br/>
