<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Barbershop singers know the old songs. It\'s what we<br>learned when we were learning the techniques used to sing barbershop<br>harmony. Like pianists who learned Chopin, Beethoven, Bach, and the<br>other classical artists, barbershoppers know the old songs from<br>practice.\<br>\<br>When I hear this question, I can\'t help but be more sentimental and<br>perhaps a bit more hopeful. Of course, there is more trepidation the<br>second time around, but love is patient and kind, and love never seeks<br>to injure. I can\'t help but think of the lyrics to the old song,<br>\"Takin\' A Chance On Love\" which happens to be all about love the<br>second time around, and the artist relates this to a game of cards. If<br>you\'ll allow me, I\'d like to give you those lyrics:\<br>\<br>]<br><br>> I thought love\'s game was over,\<br>> Lady Luck had gone away.\<br>> I laid my cards on the table,\<br>> Unable to play.\<br>> Then I heard Good Fortune say,\<br>> They\'re dealing you a new hand today!\<br>> \<br>> So here I go again\<br>> I hear the trumpets blow again\<br>> I\'m all aglow again\<br>> Takin\' a chance on love\<br>> \<br>> Here I slide again,\<br>> About to take that ride again\<br>> So starry-eyed again,\<br>> Takin\' a chance on love.\<br>> \<br>> I thought the cards were a frame-up\<br>> I never would try.\<br>> But now I\'m takin\' the game up,\<br>> And the Ace of Hearts is high!\<br>> \<br>> Things are mending now,\<br>> I see a rainbow blending now,\<br>> We\'ll have a happy ending now,\<br>> Takin\' a chance on love\<br>> \<br>> I\'m walkin\' around with a horseshoe,\<br>> In clover I lie.\<br>> And brother Rabbit, of course you\<br>> Better kiss your foot goodbye\<br>> \<br>> On the ball again,\<br>> I\'m headin\' for a fall again,\<br>> I\'m gonna give my all again,\<br>> Takin\' a chance on love!\<br><br>\<br>I think many nth-time relationships fail because of our own unease and<br>fear of \"being hurt\" again. But if you follow the advice of the<br>author, \"take the chance.\" They\'re dealing you a new hand!<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
