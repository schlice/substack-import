<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Ooo, a theory question! And it's about qualified immunity, too. I feel<br>like a kid in a candy store!<br><br>So, let's break it down to the real question you're asking: **why do we<br>need qualified immunity? Why can't we just let the court decide if<br>monetary damages should be due?**<br><br>The TL;DR version of that answer is that some form of qualified immunity<br>is right and necessary when a public servant truly believes he or she is<br>acting in good faith. If they believe they are following a judge's order<br>or existing law, even if they turn out to be wrong, they should not<br>be held fiscally responsible for any damages.<br><br>However, I will agree that in some cases, the current qualified immunity<br>doctrine makes it difficult to allow a case to go forward when the<br>standard includes the fact that the only way the case can go forward is<br>if other appellate courts have found that similar conduct has been ruled<br>illegal. In some cases, this relatively high bar for allowing a case to<br>proceed means that some cases in which there may actually be negligence<br>on the part of the public servant may not be allowed to proceed simply<br>because no cases involving similar conduct have already found that<br>conduct to be illegal. In effect, this means that if you're the first<br>offender, you might get off without having to face civil suit.<br><br>There is room for improvement in the qualified immunity doctrine. I<br>believe that some level of qualified immunity should still exist, but in<br>some cases (like police brutality), it probably should not, and we<br>should allow the courts to proceed with their investigations. We will<br>probably need a combination of thoughtful legislation as well as some<br>court procedure reform to make this better.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Qualified immunity smacks of unqualified impunity letting public<br>servants avoid personally paying for their bad behavior.
