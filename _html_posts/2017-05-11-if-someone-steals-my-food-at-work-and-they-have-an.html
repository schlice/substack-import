<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>In order for you to get into legal trouble in such a circumstance, you<br>would either have to be actively violating rules regarding allergens in<br>a shared location (such as an office refrigerator), or you were actively<br>attempting to deceive the person into eating your (tainted) food over<br>his own.<br><br>There has to be some element of *mens rea* in order for you to get into<br>trouble (i.e. some nefarious intent), or some active disregard of a rule<br>designed to protect persons with allergies, which would constitute<br>reckless endangerment, or something similar.<br><br>If someone with an allergy actively takes your food, knowing that they<br>do not have permission and have no control over the ingredients, and<br>they eat it, they are knowingly taking food over which they have no<br>control. At that point, they take their own health into their hands when<br>they do that.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
