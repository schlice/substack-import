<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Which form of speech receives the greatest level of First Amendment<br>protection?**<br><br>That's not the way the Constitution works.<br><br>All speech is protected. Period.<br><br>But you've also probably heard that "Constitutional rights are not<br>unlimited." In practice, what this means is that at this point (all<br>speech is protected), **we carve out individual "exceptions" to that<br>general rule.**<br><br>Because one guy one time walked into a crowded movie theater and shouted<br>"FIRE!" and a whole bunch of people panicked and got hurt and he said,<br>"but all speech is protected!"<br><br>So lawmakers decided that all speech is protected, unless your<br>speech intentionally causes harm to someone.<br><br>And then another guy said, "That girl over there kills puppies and makes<br>soup out of their eyeballs" and that girl ended up losing her job over<br>the false accusation and the guy said, "but all speech is protected!"<br><br>So lawmakers decided that all speech is protected, unless your speech<br>intentionally causes harm to someone, or unless your speech is a lie<br>which hurts someone.<br><br>And then another girl said, "Cops are pigs! Hey, there's a cop over<br>there, let's go kill him!" And the crowd listened to her and they killed<br>the cop-pig, and she said, "but all speech is protected!"<br><br>So lawmakers decided that all speech is protected, unless your speech<br>intentionally causes harm to someone, or unless your speech is a lie<br>which hurts someone, or "incites violence" (causes others to commit<br>violence).<br><br>And that's how Constitutional protections work.<br><br>TL;DR: The right is universal, with exceptions. It is not that some<br>speech is "more protected" than other speech. It's that all speech is<br>protected, with the exception of certain forms of speech.<br><br>*Note: pronouns are used to distinguish people in this hypothetical<br>example; it's not an implication that women kill puppies. Try to employ<br>some common sense.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
