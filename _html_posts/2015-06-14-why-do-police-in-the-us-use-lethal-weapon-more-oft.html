<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [We have already answered the second part of your question<br>in great depth\<br>\<br>[[Why do American police always shoot to<br>kill?](https://www.quora.com/Why-do-American-police-always-shoot-to-kill)]{.qlink_container}\<br>[[Are police officers taught/trained to \"shoot to kill\" or to \"shoot<br>to<br>incapacitate\"?](https://www.quora.com/Are-police-officers-taught-trained-to-shoot-to-kill-or-to-shoot-to-incapacitate)]{.qlink_container}\<br>\<br>The distilled version:\<br>]<br><br>- A gun is deadly force. If you resort to your gun, it\'s because you<br>  are facing a situation in which lethal force is authorized.<br>- Police don\'t \"shoot to kill.\" Police \"shoot to stop the act.\"<br>  While it\'s true that death sometimes happens when people are shot,<br>  understand that death is not the goal. For example, if police shoot a<br>  person and he lives, did the officer fail to do his job? Not at all.<br>  Police shoot to stop the perpetrator from doing something which can<br>  cause great harm to the officer or the public.\<br>- A shot in the leg is not always non-fatal. You can hit the femoral<br>  artery which will cause death before the ambulance arrives through<br>  *exsanguination*, or \"bleeding out.\"<br><br>\<br>We have more guns per person in the US than in any other country in the<br>world. Having an unarmed police force makes no logical sense.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
