<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>As with all legal questions, the answer is "it depends."<br><br>The juveniles, if anything at all, will be handled by the juvenile<br>justice system. This system does not involve criminal charges and does<br>not involve lawsuits. It seeks to educate juveniles and parents so that<br>juveniles can have positive transitions into adulthood. This may involve<br>individual and group counseling. It could potentially involve some time<br>in a juvenile detention facility, but not always.<br><br>This, however, is all dependent on the state. In a small handful of<br>states, juveniles (especially ones close to becoming legal adults) may<br>be charged as adults if the act is particularly heinous.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>**A teen showed his penis to my cousin (also a teen) without consent.<br>Can he get charged or sued for doing that?**<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
