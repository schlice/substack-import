<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>You are under the mistaken belief that you have more "rights" than you<br>actually do.<br><br>Under the law, you are a *minor*. Your parents have complete control<br>over your life until you reach the "age of majority," the age that<br>society has determined that you are old enough to make decisions for<br>yourself.<br><br>But until that age, legally you don't really have any rights that your<br>parents cannot override. This is because if you are not legally able to<br>make decisions for yourself (and until you turn 18, you are not), then<br>your parents are *completely and totally responsible for everything<br>about your life.*<br><br>It's a big responsibility. Parents generally do their best to make sure<br>you are set up to have a successful life. But understand, parents are<br>human too. Sometimes they make mistakes.<br><br>So let's talk about what you brought up:<br><br>> Why do parents have so much power over their kids?<br><br>Because kids do not have power over themselves until they turn 18.<br><br>> *They can ruin their mental state for 18 years*<br><br>In the vast majority of cases, parents are not "ruining the mental<br>states of children." They are attempting to raise those children in the<br>way in which they see fit.<br><br>> and then expect them to accept their apology.<br><br>You are under no obligation to accept their apology. But if I could<br>offer you some advice: unless your parents are locking you in a cage<br>from the time you come home from school until the time you go back to<br>school, I think they are probably trying their best.<br><br>Here's another point to consider: if you want to be treated like an<br>adult, have you tried acting like an adult? If I had a person in my life<br>with whom I felt like you do towards your parents, I'd tell them that I<br>had some concerns and I wanted to sit down and have a discussion with<br>them about it. And then talk to them rationally. Tell them what you<br>feel, why you feel it, and what you think should be done about it.<br>Discuss it with them.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Why do parents have so much power over their kids? They can ruin their<br>mental state for 18 years and then expect them to accept their apology.<br>My mom doesn\'t give me any power over any decisions. When I fight for<br>my rights its called \'ungreatful\'<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
