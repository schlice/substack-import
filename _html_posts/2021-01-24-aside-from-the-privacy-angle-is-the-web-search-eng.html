<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Aside from the privacy angle, is the web-search engine DuckDuckGo<br>really all that better than Google Chrome?**<br><br>No, I don\'t think so. Part of that is due to the technology, and the<br>other part is due to economies of scale.<br><br>DDG suffers from what everyone taking on the 600 pound gorilla suffers<br>from: they are simply dwarfed in size. Google is just *so big* and *so<br>connected* that their systems simply work better. The integration<br>between Google search and Chrome is exceedingly tight, such that it is<br>noticeably absent when you use DDG.<br><br>So you recognize that and you accept it because you want the privacy.<br>You don\'t want your search results or your metadata sold to the highest<br>bidder, or purloined to be used to piece together information which is<br>truly private.<br><br>It\'s not as good, but overall it is arguably safer. That\'s the trade<br>off.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
