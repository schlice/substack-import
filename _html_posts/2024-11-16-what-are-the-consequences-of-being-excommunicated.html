<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Let's look at an example: the Roman Catholic church practices<br>excommunication. Excommunication is designed to *reform* the person,<br>not *punish* them.<br><br>A person who has been excommunicated from the Catholic Church faces the<br>following penalties:<br><br>- Being barred from the sacraments, including the Eucharist<br>- Being forbidden from participating in public worship<br>- Being deprived of any previously held office or ministry<br>- Being refused a Catholic burial<br><br>Clearly, they can still go about their lives, just not as a Catholic.<br><br>Excommunication is usually only imposed after other attempts at<br>reconciliation have failed. The offender must meet certain conditions,<br>including:<br><br>- Being at least 16 years old<br>- Knowing that their actions violated Church law<br>- Acting freely without threat of force or by fear<br>- Having the use of reason<br>- Not having acted mistakenly<br><br>Some excommunications can be lifted after the person repents and in some<br>cases, offers restitution. Other excommunications are automatic, such<br>as:<br><br>- Mortal sin of abortion<br>- Desecrating the Holy Eucharist<br>- Being ordained a priest without prior orders from the Pope<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
