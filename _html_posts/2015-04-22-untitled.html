<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: [The \"legal gun owner\" you speak of (the straw purchaser)<br>is not a legal gun owner.\<br>\<br>Yes, technically at the time he makes the purchase, it\'s a legal<br>purchase. But he\'s doing so for the express purpose of reselling those<br>guns illegally, so his initial purchase can then be ruled illegal as<br>well. That, however, is an issue for the courts to deal with.\<br>\<br>By the way, there are lots of legal purchases that turn into illegal<br>guns. What if you buy parts and then assemble them and sell that<br>now-assembled gun illegally? You didn\'t buy a gun, you bought parts.<br>You then assembled a gun and illegally sold it.\<br>\<br>So to answer your question, yes, at one point, all illegal guns started<br>their lives as legal purchases by someone who chose to illegally resell<br>that gun. A great majority of those purchases don\'t originate in this<br>country, either. We can\'t control those. It\'s up to CBP to do a better<br>job at finding illegal gun parts as they are shipped into the country.\<br>\<br>But you then made the fallacious logical leap that \"legal gun owners\"<br>are responsible for all illegal guns, which is a logical conclusion that<br>you cannot draw. As I said, a straw purchaser is not a legal gun owner.<br>A legal gun owner buys guns that he will use legally. Straw purchasers,<br>while making legal purchases, intend to use their guns illegally<br>(illegal sales), so they are not \"legal gun owners.\" So your logic is<br>incorrect.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/What-are-common-logical-fallacies-in-gun-control-arguments/answer/Bill-Stein<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
