<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Can a sitting president declare a National Emergency for any reason<br>they want, or are there criteria for deciding what is and isn't an<br>acceptable reason?**<br><br>The National Emergencies Act does not define when a president can or<br>can't declare a national emergency. The President has wide discretion in<br>terms of determining when a national emergency is warranted, and when to<br>declare one. Congress decided not to constrain presidents in that way.<br><br>That doesn't mean that Congress can't look at the President's reasoning<br>for declaring a national emergency and find it suspect. Congress may<br>even believe that the President is abusing his power by declaring a<br>national emergency and impeach him for it.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
