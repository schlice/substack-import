<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>"all those in Quora who swear by freedom"<br><br>If you're referring to the pro-life people on Quora, we all, down to the<br>last person, swear by freedom.<br><br>But that means freedom for *everyone*. Including the fetus.<br><br>You are assuming that bodily autonomy is unlimited, and it is not.<br>Like every right we have, it is limited. Bodily autonomy is a right, up<br>until it impacts another right. That's its limit.<br><br>All of our rights are this way. You have the freedom to speak until your<br>speech starts to hurt others. You have the freedom to own and carry a<br>gun until that right starts to hurt others. And you have bodily autonomy<br>until that right starts to hurt others.<br><br>So if you claim to support rights equally, then you must claim that<br>all rights are equal, and the baby's right to live does not go away<br>just because the mother has bodily autonomy.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
