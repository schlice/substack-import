<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I suppose that *IF* Satan was defeated at the cross, he shouldn't be<br>causing chaos any more.<br><br>But I have news for you. Satan wasn't defeated at the cross.<br><br>The cross accomplished two things:<br><br>1.  Jesus defeated *SIN* at the cross. Remember Jewish custom was to<br>    sacrifice a lamb who had ceremonially taken on the sins of the<br>    people for that year, right? Plus, they had to do it every year just<br>    to cover the sins for that year. Jesus became the "Lamb of God" as<br>    He took on the sin of the world: past, present, and future. Jesus<br>    died "once, for all." Satan's big hook was separating us from God by<br>    tricking us into sin. But now that Jesus has taken away the penalty<br>    for our sin, Satan's tricks (which still exist) have no power over<br>    us. Satan has been "de-fanged." For those of us who have been saved,<br>    Satan may still trick us into sin, but those sins do not change our<br>    salvation.<br>2.  Jesus defeated *DEATH* at His resurrection. When Jesus returned<br>    from the grave, death lost its power over us. Death is no longer the<br>    end. Death is now the beginning.<br><br>Rest assured, Satan *will be* defeated. Satan *will be* cast<br>into hell, along with his demons. But that's not projected to happen<br>until the Tribulation is over, when Jesus returns.<br><br>So no, Satan wasn't defeated at the cross. Sin and death were defeated<br>at the cross. Satan will be defeated at the end of the world.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
