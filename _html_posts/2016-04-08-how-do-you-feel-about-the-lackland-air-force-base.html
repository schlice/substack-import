<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Looks like this was a murder-suicide. An airman shot his commander, then<br>shot himself.<br><br>These are far more common than you apparently know. There are anywhere<br>between 1,000 and 1,500 deaths annually from murder-suicide, and these<br>numbers are probably wrong as some crimes are not reported. In 2011<br>alone, there were 1,382 murder-suicide deaths in the United States.<br><br>*I hope you\'re as upset as I am that these shooting are still<br>happening.*<br><br>Until you can stop hatred, jealousy, and mental instability, these will<br>keep happening.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
