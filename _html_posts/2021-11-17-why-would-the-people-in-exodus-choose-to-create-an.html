Sinai, and he *just took too long*. So they asked<br>Aaron to fashion them an idol while they waited.<br><br>*(NOTE: some people think that the idol was in place of God, and others<br>think the idol was a placeholder for Moses, but the issue is the same)*<br><br>So Aaron took their gold jewelry and made an idol for them to worship.<br><br>We all do this, don't we? We take the good things God gave us in<br>provision and we worship it. Like the big one: money. God provides the<br>money we need to live, and we worship it. This is a danger we all face,<br>not just the Israelites of the day.<br><br>But because the Israelites were not patient enough to allow God to work<br>in his time, they fell into the quick-fix trap of "quick, make an idol<br>for us to worship."<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Why would the people in Exodus choose to create and worship their own<br>idols when they have the true living God with them especially after<br>they\'ve seen how God delivered them from the Egyptians?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
