<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Is there any way I can challenge a driver\'s license suspension for<br>refusal to submit to chemical testing? Not having my license is<br>affecting my ability to get work in my field.**<br><br>Unless the refusal was because of some reasonable excuse, it's unlikely<br>you will be able to challenge the suspension.<br><br>When you agreed to get a driver's license, you also agreed to be subject<br>to the state's rules about driver's licenses, which includes submitting<br>to chemical testing. The rules include the fact that if you fail to<br>submit to testing, your license will be automatically suspended. You<br>agreed to this when you got your license. What changed now? Why is it<br>now okay for you to refuse chemical testing, when it was okay when you<br>got your license in the first place?<br><br>As I said, without some extraordinary circumstance or reasonable excuse,<br>it's unlikely that the court would find the suspension unreasonable.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
