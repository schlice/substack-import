<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Ah yes, the old "God is bad because he created us to go to hell when we<br>don't follow his stupid rules" question. We've answered this a bzillion<br>times on Quora (yes, that's a real number, *Toy Story* said so), and I<br>know the Quora search bar is.......lacking, but you should still try it<br>sometime.<br><br>Anyway, for old time's sake, I'll answer it one more time.<br><br>God didn't create us evil. God created us with the *capacity to<br>choose evil, because he* *intentionally* *gave us free will.* The<br>free will thing was his choice. Take it up with him when you stand<br>before him at the end of days.<br><br>Anyway, sure enough, we chose evil. In order for our free will to be<br>truly free, we must have the capacity to choose evil, and we did.<br><br>But that's okay, because he gave us an escape plan from that, too. It's<br>in the form of another choice: we have to choose to accept him and his<br>gift of salvation.<br><br>See, God isn't *sending* us to hell. We're already on the way there.<br>God offers us the way out, if we choose it.<br><br>Think of it this way: on this earth, we're literally all on the Titanic.<br>We've hit the iceberg, we're all going down. But God's right over there,<br>with a lifeboat. He's standing on the edge of the lifeboat, with an<br>outstretched hand, waiting to take you on board. All you have to do is<br>choose to get on. Some will choose to ignore the lifeboat because the<br>shrimp scampi on this ship is *just too delicious*. Some will ignore the<br>lifeboat because *how could God create us with free will and allow us to<br>choose to die? How sadistic is that?* Or whatever reason they decide to<br>ignore the lifeboat. But many will accept God's outstretched hand and<br>get on the lifeboat.<br><br>God is waiting for you, with his hand outstretched. No matter what you<br>do, no matter how bad you think you are, he will still be there, waiting<br>for you, with his hand outstretched.<br><br>Will you take it?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
