<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>First off, you must define your terms. What precisely do you mean by<br>"born again?"<br><br>Most Christians understand this in relation to Jesus' discussion with<br>Nicodemus in John 3:<br><br>> Now there was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the<br>> Jews; this man came to Jesus by night and said to Him, "Rabbi, we know<br>> that You have come from God *as* a teacher; for no one can do these<br>> signs that You do unless God is with him." Jesus answered and said to<br>> him, "Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born again he cannot<br>> see the kingdom of God."<br>><br>> Nicodemus said to Him, "How can a man be born when he is old? He<br>> cannot enter a second time into his mother's womb and be born, can<br>> he?" Jesus answered, "Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born<br>> of water and the Spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. "That<br>> which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the<br>> Spirit is spirit. "Do not be amazed that I said to you, 'You must be<br>> born again.' "The wind blows where it wishes and you hear the sound of<br>> it, but do not know where it comes from and where it is going; so is<br>> everyone who is born of the Spirit." --- John 3:1--8 NASB<br><br>So what does it mean to be "born again?" To most Christians, this is the<br>process of salvation through repentance and belief in Jesus.<br><br>So that begs the question: *are most churchgoers saved?*<br><br>Well, you might think, why not? I mean, it's so simple to declare that<br>you repent of your sins and you believe that Jesus died for your sins.<br>Shouldn't everyone just, I dunno, *say those words?*<br><br>Well, it's harder to do than just speaking those words. You actually<br>must *repent* of your sins. Repenting means "turning away" from your<br>sins. It means recognizing your past and owning up to it, so that you<br>can conclusively, affirmatively say that you reject such a lifestyle.<br>And introspection is not something that many people do easily. Owning up<br>to one's past mistakes is not an easy thing to do. In some cases, people<br>may not even really be ready to turn away from their past life. Maybe<br>they feel like it's not sinful. Maybe they love the sin more than they<br>love God. And that's a tough conversation to have with yourself.<br><br>And what about believing that Jesus died for your sins? Isn't that easy<br>enough to believe? Not so fast. Because it's more than just believing<br>that Jesus died for you. You have to let Jesus be your personal savior.<br>You have to be ready to give your life to him to use as he wants. And<br>giving up control of your life is a *really hard* thing to do. People<br>really want to be the ones to forge their own destiny. They want to be<br>in charge. No one tells them what to do with their life, right? So this<br>is also very difficult.<br><br>So it should come as little surprise that the majority of people who<br>fill seats in church, every week, are *not saved*.<br><br>> \<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Why are many church goers not born again?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
