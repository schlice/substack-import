<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>For right now, he hasn't banned anything. He made a Twitter post<br>indicating that a policy would be "forthcoming" which banned transgender<br>personnel. We don't know how that policy will handle presently-serving<br>transgender personnel. Unfortunately, we will have to wait and see what<br>the policy says when it comes out.<br><br>Therefore, we cannot comment on how the policy will affect unit<br>readiness, mission accomplishment, operations, or national security. The<br>policy will likely have minimal effect on any of these.<br><br>It will have an impact on unit cohesiveness, morale, and budget, budget<br>being the biggest among all the impacts it will have. By banning<br>transgender personnel from the military, the military will not be forced<br>to pay the estimated \$3.7 billion over 10 years if military members<br>choose to undergo gender reassignment surgery. They will need to get the<br>surgery (i.e. they won't be able to remain transgender and remain in<br>their physical gender) because they cannot have their gender marker (the<br>gender indicated on their ID card and personnel records) changed without<br>it, and they cannot wear the uniform of their gender identity until such<br>time as their gender marker is changed. Therefore, the only way to get<br>their gender marker changed is to get gender reassignment surgery.<br>Without surgery, they will not be able to align their gender expression<br>with their gender identity because they can only wear the uniform of the<br>sex indicated by their gender marker.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
