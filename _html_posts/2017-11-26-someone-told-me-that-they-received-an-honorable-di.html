<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Without knowing exactly what the discharge code was, we will never know<br>why the person was discharged before their period of enlistment was<br>completed.<br><br>But think about it: You sign up for three years, and the military<br>agrees, because they want to keep you around for three years. Then, they<br>let you go after two years.<br><br>WHY IN GOD'S NAME WOULD THEY DO THAT?<br><br>Perhaps because *they realized they didn't want to keep you?* The<br>military has to agree to release you, and it has to be for a valid<br>reason. Whatever that valid reason is, they let you go without requiring<br>you to serve your entire contracted period of enlistment. If they wanted<br>to keep you, you think they would let you go without completing your<br>term so easily?<br><br>Just to show you how many possible reasons for discharge exist, here is<br>a more or less complete list of [[Military Separation<br>Codes](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=52404c&url=https://www.thebalance.com/military-separation-codes-3356946){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="thebalance.com"}]{.qlink_container}.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
