Almost everyone has a "line" past which they<br>will not go, even criminals.<br><br>Think about this: petty crime has petty consequences. Serious crime has<br>serious consequences. If you're in a state with the death penalty,<br>murder could get you the needle, and most criminals won't even go there.<br><br>Criminals aren't deterred by laws. Criminals are deterred by the fact<br>that breaking laws has consequences.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
