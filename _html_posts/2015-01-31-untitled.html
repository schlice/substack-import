<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: [Your statements are correct when you are not in a car.\<br>\<br>When you are in a car, you are *de facto* detained until the officer<br>allows you to leave. Try thinking that you are not being detained when<br>you are pulled over. Because under your theory, you could potentially be<br>pulled over and not be detained. That means you would be free to go<br>at any time. Try that sometime, next time you get pulled over. Believe<br>that you are not detained, and just leave. See what happens.\<br>\<br>OF COURSE YOU ARE BEING DETAINED! That\'s why you had to stop your car!<br>If you have to stop and you can\'t leave until you are told to leave,<br>you are being detained. Asking the officer if you are being detained<br>when you have been pulled over is simply stupid. So if you want to<br>demonstrate your ignorance of the law and traffic procedure, go ahead<br>and ask all of your silly questions like \"am I being detained\" and<br>\"am I free to go\" when you get pulled over. Gee, I dunno, I thought<br>the blinking red and blue lights gave it away.\<br>\<br>And I can *guarantee* you that this sort of attitude will not buy you<br>any lenience. Even if the officer had the option to give you a warning<br>instead of a ticket, he\'d opt for the ticket every time. I know I<br>would.\<br>\<br>Remember, you attract more flies with a teaspoon of honey than with a<br>gallon of vinegar. Try just a little kindness and courtesy next time.<br>You might find that it goes a long way.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/What-should-I-do-when-I-get-pulled-over-by-a-law-enforcement-officer/answer/Bill-Stein<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
