<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Nationalism is not something we experience much in the<br>United States. I would say we experience *patriotism* far more than<br>*nationalism*.\<br>\<br>Patriotism is love of country; it is the engine that drives national<br>independence, and the motivation that keeps people defending it.<br>Patriotism is the force which keeps a country like the United States a<br>free country.\<br>\<br>Nationalism is patriotism to the extreme. It is the force that is<br>initially patriotic, but develops ethnocentric overtones, believing that<br>your country is *better* than other countries, and you should exert your<br>influence over them.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
