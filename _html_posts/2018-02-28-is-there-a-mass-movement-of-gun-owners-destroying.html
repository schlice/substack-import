<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Is there a mass movement of gun owners destroying their guns and<br>denouncing the second amendment on moral principle after this year\'s<br>Florida school shooting, or is the guy in the video just a one-off?**<br><br>I would like to announce a new service. I will accept all of your guns<br>and will gladly "destroy" them for you. Just send them to me, and I'll<br>take care of everything. No messy "destroying." No potential issues with<br>inadvertently creating a "short-barreled shotgun" and running afoul of<br>Federal law. Just find yourself an FFL and send your unwanted guns to<br>me. I'll be happy to take care of them for you!<br><br>Best of all, I'll do it all for *FREE!!!*<br><br>Just e-mail me and I'll take care of the rest.<br><br>Limited time offer! Act now before this great deal passes you by!<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
