<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>*The reason I didn\'t open the door or answer it is because he has no<br>legal right to come into my house without a warrant.*<br><br>That's not a reason to not answer the door. That's a reason to not let<br>him in the door.<br><br>*What is the next stop the cop will take? Will he just ignore this and<br>forget about it, or will he try to get an arrest warrant?*<br><br>We don't know because you didn't answer the door! I would think that at<br>the very least morbid curiosity would have made you answer the door,<br>just to see what he wanted. Oh well, now we'll never know.<br><br>It could have been anything, but if it was indeed something which<br>requires your arrest, he will be back with a warrant. Only you know what<br>you did.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
