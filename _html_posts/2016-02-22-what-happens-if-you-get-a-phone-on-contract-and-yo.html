<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The answer is \"it depends.\"<br><br>Assuming you are on a postpaid (i.e. monthly) contract and you had a<br>phone which was subsidized by the carrier (i.e. it\'s a US\$600 phone<br>but you paid US\$99 for it).<br><br>The terms of your contract are not changed because you lost your<br>handset.<br><br>If you had device insurance, you can invoke that and (for a small fee)<br>receive a replacement handset. There are limitations as to how often you<br>can use your insurance policy; check with the company which provides<br>your handset insurance for more details.<br><br>If you did not have insurance, you can purchase (at full market price) a<br>replacement handset, new or used.<br>[eBay(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=fa205b&url=http://www.ebay.com){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="ebay.com"}]{.qlink_container} and<br>[Gazelle(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=38e2ba&url=http://www.gazelle.com){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="gazelle.com"}]{.qlink_container} are some good options for<br>new or used devices, but not the only options. Shop around for the best<br>price.<br><br>Pro Tip: Most PREPAID mobiles (i.e. the ones you can buy at Walmart)<br>from the same carrier will also work as POSTPAID devices as well. Buy<br>the phone from Walmart and then call Customer Service to have the<br>handset activated and attached to your postpaid account. My kids have<br>done this in the past when they have damaged their postpaid handsets, or<br>simply wanted to upgrade technology out of contract cycle. They have<br>purchased (with their own money) prepaid devices and attached them to<br>our postpaid account without too much headache.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
