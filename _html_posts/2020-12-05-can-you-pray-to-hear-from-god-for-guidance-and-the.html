<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Can you pray to hear from God for guidance, and then open up the Bible<br>to a \"random\" page to receive His voice? Not for the future as would<br>be a form of divination, but just to receive His voice in a more direct<br>way. Or would that be false prophecy?**<br><br>Let me answer you by asking a question: Who are you to tell God how you<br>want to receive his guidance?<br><br>*I want an answer, and I want it on God's letterhead, in Old English<br>font, double-spaced, 12-point.*<br><br>In case you missed the sarcasm, God doesn't work that way.<br><br>You can pray for guidance. You can pray for wisdom. You can pray that<br>God answers your prayers (if it is his will to do so).<br><br>Separately, you can open up the Bible to a random section ***with an<br>open heart and an open mind*** and let God's word speak to you. Before<br>you do that, I would pray to have God do just that: open my heart and<br>open my mind to teach me more about him. Ask God to give you wisdom and<br>understanding, *and then open the Bible and read.*<br><br>A good way to do that is what we call SOAPing. You pick a chapter<br>from the Bible, and you read it. Alternatively, you can use any of the<br>"X-day Bible Reading Plans" that are freely available on the Internet.<br>Personally, I would highly recommend<br>[YouVersion(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=89cdcd&url=https://www.bible.com/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="bible.com"}]{.qlink_container}, available on the Web and on<br>your favorite mobile device. Pray first for God to open your mind and<br>your heart and teach you through your reading, then read the chapter.<br>Next, do a SOAP analysis. As you can probably guess, SOAP is an acronym.<br>It stands for Scripture, Obersvation, Application, and<br>Prayer. Scripture means that you pick out a verse or two which stood<br>out to you while you were reading. You then make an Observation about<br>that verse. You Apply that passage to you, your life, or your<br>circumstances, and then you Pray for God to help you in that endeavor.<br><br>For context, I'll give you an example out of my SOAP diary (I keep it<br>online for easy access on any device). This was a time when I was<br>SOAPing through the Bible and I read John 1. Here's what I got:<br><br>> Scripture<br>><br>> There was a man sent from God whose name was John. He came as a<br>> witness to testify concerning that light, so that through him all<br>> might believe. He himself was not the light; he came only as a witness<br>> to the light. (John‬ 1‬:6-8‬ NIV)<br>><br>> Observation<br>><br>> I love how God sends \"the Light,\" but He also sends messengers to<br>> testify about the light. I can only imagine that those messengers<br>> appeared crazy to the people, especially when John said things like<br>> "Look, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world! This is<br>> the one I meant when I said, 'A man who comes after me has surpassed<br>> me because he was before me.'\" (John‬ 1‬:29-30‬ NIV). What more can He<br>> do to try to tell us the Good News?<br>><br>> Application<br>><br>> God sends me messages all the time. I need to do a better job at<br>> receiving them.<br>><br>> Prayer<br>><br>> God, please help me to \"get it.\" Because I don\'t often get it. You<br>> keep calling and I don\'t hear. Help me to know Your voice so I may<br>> better separate You from the noise.<br><br>SOAPing through the Bible is a great way to both read the Bible, and at<br>the same time, put yourself in a frame of mind to receive the message<br>that God is trying to deliver through it. Have you SOAPed today? Ha, a<br>little Bible humor...<br><br>But back to the question, asking for something and expecting an answer<br>by opening the Bible is just another way of you demanding that God<br>answer you, in the way you expect. We are in no position to demand<br>anything from God. And God doesn't work that way.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
