<br/><br/>Answer<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content: [Sadly, that\'s a political question, and not a military<br/>one. If you want to judge the question in a completely military way, you<br/>have to look at what the military is charged with doing, and make every<br/>budgetary decision based on what their actual job description is.\<br/>\<br/>The question goes deeper than just job description, and it gets down<br/>into details.\<br/>\<br/>]<br/><br/>- Is the military able to conduct wars on multiple fronts<br/>  simultaneously? As military budgets grow and shrink depending on the<br/>  prevailing political climate, this ability changes. In our current<br/>  military configuration, the military cannot successfully conduct wars<br/>  on multiple fronts; there simply is not funding to accomplish it.<br/>- How technologically advanced should are Armed Forces be? We had one of<br/>  the most technologically advanced armies going in to Afghanistan, and<br/>  it was the simple IED that cost us many soldiers\' lives. The<br/>  technology to overcome the IED was developed through necessity during<br/>  Afghanistan, but that was through necessity, and political posturing<br/>  during the process cost several years in development, and cost many<br/>  more lives as a result.<br/>- Eventually there will not be \"people\" on the front lines at all; it<br/>  will all be robots and UAVs. These things cost money, and how quickly<br/>  we start replacing troops with robots depends on the size of the<br/>  budget.<br/>- Our military equipment is aging. We have B-52s in service that former<br/>  Air Force aviators and their grown children have both flown during<br/>  their respective careers. This isn\'t just because the venerable BUFF<br/>  is a great bomber, but because we simply don\'t have the money to<br/>  replace the entire B-52 fleet with B-1s. Our forces will need to<br/>  modernize in order to keep up with the security needs of a growing<br/>  world.<br/><br/>\<br/>So the question of \"how big should the budget be\" is one that is<br/>driven out of necessity, but dictated by politics. This is the nature of<br/>our country, and I suspect that it will always be this way.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content language: English<br/><br/><br/>
