<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>That, really, ultimately depends on the A1C (Airman First Class or E-3)<br>in question.<br><br>The Air Force requires A1Cs to have 28 months Time-in-Grade (TIG), or 36<br>months Time-in-Service (TIS) and 20 months TIG. The average active duty<br>time for A1Cs to advance to SrA (Senior Airman or E-4) is three years.<br><br>That said, Air Force unit commanders are authorized to promote 15<br>percent of their *best* A1C\'s to SrA six months ahead of the normal<br>TIS, often called \"early promotion,\" or colloquially known as "below<br>the zone" (BTZ) promotions. The commander will accomplish this \"early<br>promotion\" process through a promotion board. For large units, they<br>will hold their own board in-house. Smaller units combine all base<br>applicants from all Air Force units on the base into a single pool and<br>will hold a Central Base Board (CBB). They will then select the top 15%<br>from the entire base population for early promotion.<br><br>Remember that Senior Airman is the transition from a Journeyman rank to<br>Non-Commissioned Officer (NCO). The Senior Airman is supposed to be<br>working on his supervisory skills through PME and through real-world<br>supervisory experience. A1Cs are considered completely acclimated to Air<br>Force life and spend their time improving their job skills, as well as<br>taking leadership opportunities when they are offered. Those A1Cs who<br>show exceptional job skills, who mentor their subordinates well, and are<br>always looking for opportunities for leadership and professional, as<br>well as personal, improvement, are going to be the ones who are selected<br>for early promotion.<br><br>So how do you do it? Do your job, to the best of your ability, and then<br>ask what else you can do. Let your supervisor know that you are fully<br>capable of doing your job, and willing to go above and beyond.<br><br>Aim High!<br><br>\<br><br>Some notable quotes about duty from some leaders past (most of these are<br>from memory \-- I had to reference some of the authors; my memory isn\'t<br>what it used to be). These quotes served as inspiration during my<br>career.<br><br>**\"Duty, then, is the sublimest word in the English language. You<br>should do your duty in all things. You can never do more. You should<br>never wish to do less.\"** (General Robert E. Lee)<br><br>\"If I do my full duty, the rest will take care of itself.\"<br>(General George S. Patton, Jr.)<br><br>\"No man is fit to command another that cannot command himself.\"<br>(William Penn)<br><br>\"Never tell your people *how* to do things. Tell them<br>*what* to do, and they will surprise you with their ingenuity.\"<br>(General George S. Patton, Jr. *War As I Knew It*)<br><br>**\"A man has integrity when his interest in the good of the service is<br>at all times greater than his personal pride, and when he holds himself<br>to the same line of duty when unobserved as he would follow if his<br>superiors were present.\"** (General S.L. A. Marshall, *Thoughts On<br>War*, 1941)<br><br>And probably the most famous and well-known duty quotes:<br><br>**\"Ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for<br>your country.\"** (President John F. Kennedy)<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
