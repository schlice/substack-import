<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>No, but it may be justifiable to force someone to not impose their<br>beliefs on others.<br><br>For example, I may truly believe that Italians are demon-spawns, and no<br>one is ever justified in forcing me to change my belief. But if I want<br>to live out my belief that I am a demon-hunter and I am thus going to<br>kill anyone of Italian descent, you can be absolutely justified in<br>forcing me to not impose that belief on anyone. (by the way, I'm picking<br>on Italians in my example because I'm Italian, and it's just an example;<br>I don't believe Italians are demon-spawns).<br><br>It's also perfectly justifiable to try to *convince* someone to change<br>their own beliefs, if you can do so without *compelling* them. This is<br>exactly what God does: he tries to *convince* you that believing in Him<br>is a great way to go, but without *compelling* you to do so. You are<br>still free to love Him or reject Him as you choose.<br><br>Ultimately, there are only two ways to interact with people: reason and<br>force. You can either *convince* me to do something through reason, or<br>you can *compel* me to do something through force. It is never<br>justifiable to compel me to change my beliefs through force.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
