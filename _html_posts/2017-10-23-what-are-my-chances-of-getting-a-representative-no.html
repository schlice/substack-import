<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>It depends on how many people apply in your year and how many available<br>openings your representative has at that institution. Each<br>Representative can have no more than five cadets in any service academy<br>at any one time, so your chances depend on how many slots that<br>Representative has currently open, how many nominations he/she plans on<br>giving, and how many people apply.<br><br>As far as whether or not any one representative will be more or less<br>difficult from which to secure a nomination, no one can really say. They<br>will all use some combination of application, test, essay writing, and<br>board interview in order to grant a nomination, so at least that much<br>will be similar.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
