<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I think your only option is to check with your cell carrier, because<br>there is virtually no way to retrieve messages from blocked numbers on<br>your device.<br><br>Depending on where the blocking was done (at the handset or at the<br>service), the carrier might have a record of the texts. If the message<br>was delivered to your handset and *then* discarded, the carrier would<br>have that. If the message was blocked at the carrier, they won't have<br>the record, either.<br><br>Short answer: check with your cell phone carrier's customer service<br>department.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
