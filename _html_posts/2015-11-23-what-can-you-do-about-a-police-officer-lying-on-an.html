<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Get a lawyer. Explain the situation to the lawyer. The<br>lawyer will let you know whether or not you have a case you can pursue.<br>This will hinge upon several things, but most importantly the evidence<br>you have to show that the officer lied on an arrest report, and the<br>amount of harm the lie cost you.\<br>\<br>If you have no evidence to show that the officer lied, and it\'s \"your<br>word against his,\" it\'s not likely that you\'ll have a very strong<br>case. And without the lie, would the officer have arrested you anyway?<br>Were there other arrestable offenses also committed? Basically, were it<br>not for the lie, would it have not made a difference in the overall<br>outcome?]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
