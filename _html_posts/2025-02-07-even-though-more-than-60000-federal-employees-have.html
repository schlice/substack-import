<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>First of all, don't panic.<br><br>Second, if any of you had actually cared to read the order itself, you'd<br>have seen that the "buyout offer" actually doesn't lay them off.<br><br>*What? But the talking heads on the pretty light box keep telling me<br>that it does!?!?!?!*<br><br>Nope. Read more carefully. The plan actually keeps them on as employees<br>until September 30th, but removes their work responsibilities. It<br>essentially puts them on a paid furlough. After that time, they will be<br>disenrolled from the employee roster. The memo also states that this<br>plan is "subject to the availability of appropriations" dictated by<br>Congress, which must approve a new budget by the time the current one<br>expires on March 14.<br><br>And there's the rub.<br><br>If the government doesn't have funding to continue operating (or, in<br>other words, if Congress doesn't approve a federal budget on time), then<br>*no one gets paid,* including furloughed employees. But some duplicitous<br>attorneys have used a federal judge to successfully interrupt the plan,<br>claiming that because the memo says they'll be paid through September<br>30, that may not happen since the plan is subject to Congress passing a<br>budget, so the "buyout" plan must be paused.<br><br>But there are two problems with their argument:<br><br>1.  The memo already indicates this fact<br>2.  If the employees stay and Congress doesn't pass a budget, *no one*<br>    gets paid.<br><br>And the more glaring problem: all throughout human history, in nearly<br>every endeavor from school assignments to family vacations to work<br>projects, people have a tendency to put the work off until closer to the<br>deadline. Because a federal judge has paused the deadline, fewer people<br>are going to take the deal, because the deadline is indeterminate.<br><br>But if they don't take the deal, and the deadline for doing so<br>*expires*, then they risk losing their jobs due to restructuring and<br>cuts, and if they are fired due to that workforce reduction, they leave<br>with *nothing*.<br><br>It's a gamble. Personally, I'd rather have a "guaranteed" salary through<br>September 30 and have all that time to find a new job rather than<br>getting WFR'd and have nothing.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
