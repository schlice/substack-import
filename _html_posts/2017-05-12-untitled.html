<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>*The person falsely shouting 'fire' in a crowded theater is not engaged<br>in a first amendment right, as he is engaged in a willful assault. He<br>ends up punished for it.*<br><br>This is not what the question asked. The question says "If the Second<br>Amendment means what it says," which implies that it is an absolute<br>right, not subject to any reasonable restrictions. The corollary was<br>designed to show that no rights are absolute. A right can be restricted<br>or curtailed if there is a compelling state interest to do so, and if<br>the restriction is implemented in the least restrictive way possible.<br><br>If the First Amendment means what it says, I can say anything I want, at<br>any time I want, with no restrictions, which includes shouting "Fire" in<br>a crowded theater, even when there is no fire, because I have a First<br>Amendment-protected right to free speech. I don't "intend" to start a<br>mad stampede in which people may get hurt; that's up to them. I'm just<br>exercising my rights to speak in whatever way I choose, wherever I<br>choose. In order to be convicted of criminal assault, there must still<br>be *mens rea*, and if I don't have it, I'm not guilty of criminal<br>assault.<br><br>Of course, this is not true, because while the right to speak is<br>protected, the manner in which speech is conducted is important, as well<br>as to whom the speech is directed, whether or not it is truthful, and<br>whether or not it causes harm. These things can, in fact, be criminal.<br>Therefore, the right to speak is not absolute.<br><br>Accordingly, the Second Amendment says that the "keeping" (owning) and<br>"bearing" (carrying) of arms shall not be infringed. It doesn't say<br>anything about pointing and using, which are normally crimes, and are<br>constitutional as crimes. Therefore, the right to keep and bear arms in<br>whatever way and in whatever location and manner you choose is also not<br>unlimited. Reasonable restrictions are legal, and make sense in order to<br>maintain an ordered society.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/If-the-Second-Amendment-means-what-it-says-then-why-are-there-legal-restrictions-on-gun-ownership-possession-and-carrying-weapons-of-any-kind/answer/Bill-Stein<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
