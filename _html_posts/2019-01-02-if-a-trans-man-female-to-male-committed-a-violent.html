<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If a trans man (female to male) committed a violent felony and<br>insisted on serving his time in a male, maximum security prison, what<br>accommodations are made for him and is he safe, or would he be safer in<br>a woman's prison?**<br><br>The answer is that it depends on the policy at the particular prison.<br>However, we can look at what is happening at Federal prisons as a<br>"model" of sorts to see how the country is trending.<br><br>Federal prisons currently use the default guidance of "biological sex"<br>to determine where to house and how to treat prisoners. Prisons always<br>have the option to make decisions to \"consider the health and safety of<br>the transgender inmate, exploring options available to assist with<br>mitigating risk to the transgender offender\" and to always consider<br>inmate safety.<br><br>Inmate safety is an interesting topic, considering that, according to<br>the Bureau of Jail Statistics, about a third of transgender prisoners in<br>state, federal, and local jails have reported some sort of sexual<br>victimization in various surveys conducted from 2007 to 2012. In<br>contrast, a 2012 prison<br>[survey(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=3c1098&url=https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/svpjri1112.pdf){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="bjs.gov"}]{.qlink_container} found that cis women report<br>sexual victimization rates of between 5 and 10 percent, depending on the<br>type of detention facility. All these numbers include victimization not<br>just by other inmates but by prison staff.\[1\](#SCYol){#cite-SCYol<br>.citation_link}<br><br>No one group should be more or less entitled to safety in prison.<br>However, we cannot ignore the fact that transgender women are assaulted<br>far more frequently when they are incarcerated together with men. You<br>don't have to fully accept everything that trans prison reform advocates<br>say regarding how trans people are, or should be, treated in prison to<br>understand that no one should fear being assaulted in prison. And we<br>should all recognize the fact that the prison system bears the<br>responsibility for keeping *all* prisoners safe and free from abuse.<br><br>Prison policy should first and foremost focus on prisoner safety, and<br>yes, this should be above accommodating prisoners housing requests based<br>on their gender identity.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-SCYol){.citation_index} [[Federal Prisons Scaling Back<br>Accommodations for Transgender<br>Inmates](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=ede308&url=https://reason.com/blog/2018/05/18/federal-prisons-scaling-back-accommodati){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="reason.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
