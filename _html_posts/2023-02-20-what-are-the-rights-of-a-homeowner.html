<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>None.<br><br>Property disputes between neighbors are not within the scope of the<br>HOA's responsibilities. Trees that cross property lines are property<br>disputes between homeowners.<br><br>In most jurisdictions, homeowners may trim trees that overhang into<br>their property, at their own expense. Homeowners may not cross into<br>neighboring property to do so. So in most cases, if a tree is growing<br>over the fence into your yard, you may trim the part that is overgrowing<br>into your yard, at your expense. If you want to hire an arborist to do<br>that work, you may, but it's at your expense, not your neighbor's. Check<br>your local laws before you do this.<br><br>If your neighbor's tree falls and damages your property, fault will<br>depend on the health of the tree at the time it fell.<br><br>- If it was *healthy*, and it fell because of some external reason (i.e.<br>  a hurricane blew it over), you (or more specifically, your homeowner's<br>  insurance) will be responsible to pay for your repairs.<br>- If it was *dead* and it fell, your neighbor (or more specifically,<br>  their insurance) will be responsible to pay for for your repairs.<br><br>If your neighbor's tree is dead or dying, it is imperative that you<br>notify them right away that they must address the known hazard before it<br>causes damage. Your timely notification of the hazard will not only<br>prove that it was dead before it fell (thus allowing you to make a claim<br>if it does fall), but it will give the neighbor the opportunity to<br>address the hazard before it causes damage. If they refuse, you cannot<br>force them to do so, and neither can the HOA. But if it then falls and<br>it damages your property, they are liable for the damages. And if they<br>knew about the hazard and did nothing, their homeowner's insurance won't<br>even cover it; they'll have to pay for the damages out of their own<br>pocket. You can sue them and recover the money for the damage done to<br>your property. To that end, if you do contact them, make sure you keep<br>copies of all correspondence and the fact that they received it (i.e.<br>sending certified mail with a return receipt).<br><br>\<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*This answer is not a substitute for professional legal advice or a<br>solicitation to offer legal advice regarding specific facts.
