<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Does the Department of Justice have the power to remove Trump by<br>invoking the 25th Amendment?**<br><br>No. The Department of Justice works for the President. They do not have<br>any authority under the 25th Amendment.<br><br>The entire purpose of the 25th Amendment is to define how the Vice<br>President takes control from the President. It allows the Vice President<br>to *assume* the authority of the President when he is incapacitated to<br>such a degree that he cannot *cede* control to someone else, and it<br>allows the President to *cede* authority to the Vice President if he<br>cannot fulfill his duty. That's why there is all of that complex<br>language in Section 4 about the President telling Congress that he *is*<br>actually fit to resume duty, and there being Congressional hearings to<br>determine if that is the case.<br><br>The DOJ, which works for the President, is not involved in the process.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
