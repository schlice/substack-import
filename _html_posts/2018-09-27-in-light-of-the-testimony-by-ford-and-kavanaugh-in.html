<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**In light of the testimony by Ford and Kavanaugh in the hearing on<br>9/27, should an FBI investigation have taken place before the hearing?**<br><br>No, no FBI investigation should have taken place. The FBI is not in the<br>business of investigating state crimes. The FBI investigates Federal<br>crimes, and no federal crime has been alleged to have occurred here.<br><br>Or, should one happen now that it is over?<br><br>No, not the FBI. But if Dr. Ford is so confident in her memory, she<br>should approach prosecutors in Maryland and make her accusation. There<br>is no statute of limitations for sexual assault in Maryland, so that it<br>occurred 36 years ago is not an issue. Maryland investigators can<br>investigate the crime and determine whether or not they have enough<br>evidence to move forward and charge Judge Kavanaugh with a sex crime.<br><br>And while [[11 Maryland lawmakers have called on Mongomery County to<br>initiate an<br>investigation](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=d32eb2&url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/md-politics/several-md-lawmakers-call-for-montgomery-county-investigation-into-sexual-assault-allegations-against-kavanaugh/2018/09/26/48e00584-c1b5-11e8-b338-a3289f6cb742_story.html?noredirect%3Don%26utm_term%3D.6090cc46c21b){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="washingtonpost.com"}]{.qlink_container}, the police have<br>stated that they follow a "victim-centered" model for investigations.<br>They released a statement two days ago, part of which read:<br><br>> The department recognizes that victims of sexual assault may not want<br>> to involve law enforcement and/or initiate a criminal investigation,<br>> and we respect that position. The department, however, stands prepared<br>> to assist anyone who reports being the victim of a sexual assault.<br><br>Therefore, the only way that anyone is going to investigate this is if<br>Dr. Ford presents herself to law enforcement officials in Mongomery<br>County, MD, and reports being a victim of sexual assault.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
