That<br>decision will be made by the Senate, as the Constitution permits the<br>Senate to determine how it will conduct the trial. This means that the<br>majority will determine the rules, much like the majority in the House<br>determined the rules for the impeachment investigation.<br><br>So practically, it's up to McConnell and the Republicans whether or not<br>witnesses will be called, how many, and for how long the debate will<br>continue before any votes are cast.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
