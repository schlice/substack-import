<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Because people believe that somehow, having the mere presence of guns in<br>school will harm their children.<br><br>Not that school security guards would ever harm children with those<br>guns, or use them inappropriately. Simply the mere presence of the gun<br>in the school imposes some level of psychological harm on their<br>children.<br><br>They believe the school is sacrosanct. They believe that no violence<br>should ever occur in a school, and the answer (to them) to school<br>violence is not armed guards.<br><br>Not that they've come up with a better answer, mind you. Just that armed<br>guards *can't be* the best way to handle school violence.<br><br>It's true that many people and places are protected by armed guards.<br>Many more people self-protect, more people than you would probably<br>guess. But somehow, the school is different, because, well, it's a<br>*school*. There just shouldn't be guns in a school.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
