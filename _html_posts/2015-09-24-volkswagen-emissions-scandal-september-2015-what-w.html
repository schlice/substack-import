<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [I think you\'re asking what will happen if it is found (as<br>Volkswagen alleges) that they are not the only car manufacturer who<br>specifically modified their cars so they would pass inspection, but only<br>at inspection time.\<br>\<br>If it is found that *all* of the world\'s cars have done this, then<br>there will need to be a serious discussion between lawmakers and auto<br>industry experts about *why*. The answer will be that the laws created<br>by lawmakers are simply not able to be achieved by auto makers. This may<br>just be because the mileage that the law specifies is simply not<br>attainable using traditional gas (petrol) powered engines.\<br>\<br>Lawmakers want to use the laws as a springboard to force auto makers to<br>embrace new technologies like electric and hydrogen fuel cells. However,<br>those technologies, while promising, are not enough to power the<br>world\'s transportation needs today, or even for the next 10 to 20<br>years. The simple fact is that engines powered by fossil fuels will<br>still be required for the foreseeable future, as electric does not<br>provide enough power to drive big loads normally pulled by trucks and<br>diesel-powered big engines, and fuel cells are not ready for prime<br>time.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
