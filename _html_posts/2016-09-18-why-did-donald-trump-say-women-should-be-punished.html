<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Not only did he not say this, but he never had to backtrack.<br><br>There was only ever controversy about it because he was *baited into<br>answering a trick question.* See, Trump's not a politician. He doesn't<br>know how to handle bait questions like a politician would. So the<br>news reporter baited him into answering a trick question and then used<br>it to slam him. Classic liberal media trick, and Trump totally fell for<br>it.<br><br>The questioner started off by saying that abortion is legal. Trump<br>agreed, abortion is legal. The questioner then asked that ***if abortion<br>was illegal***, would you punish women who get abortions? And Trump<br>dutifully followed the questioner right into the trap and answered that<br>yes, we are a nation of laws, and if we decided that abortion was<br>illegal, I would punish someone who got an abortion.<br><br>Boom. Got your sound bite right there. Headlines immediately followed:<br>"Trump would punish women who got abortions." The *context* of the<br>question isn't relevant. No matter what the actual question was, the<br>fact that Trump would actually punish a woman for getting an abortion<br>(even if it was illegal) was all that was needed.<br><br>You can't un-ring a bell. Once that information is out there, no matter<br>how twisted it is, it's out there. And while it was indeed twisted to<br>obfuscate the original meaning of the question, the headline is all that<br>40% of people are going to remember. You'd have to read into the article<br>in-depth to find the truth, that the questioner had posed a hypothetical<br>question to bait Trump into making a remark like he did.<br><br>And I can tell from the mere existence of this question that the<br>misinformation sticks in people's minds. I bet this is why they<br>categorized him as a misogynist with such vigor. They had the quotes in<br>hand!<br><br>But hey, never let the facts get in the way of a good slam against the<br>other party's candidate, right other answerers?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
