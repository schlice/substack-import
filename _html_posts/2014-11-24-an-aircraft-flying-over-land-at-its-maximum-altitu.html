title: '"An aircraft flying over land at its maximum altitude passes over a cliff
  where the land drops away several thousand feet, effectively increasing the altitude.
  Given the aircraft was at its maximum altitude, what would the effect be?"'

<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [[[Katie<br>Shackelford](https://www.quora.com/profile/Katie-Shackelford)]{.qlink_container}<br>beat me to it.\<br>\<br>There are several altimeters in an aircraft, but they measure two<br>different heights:\<br>\<br>AGL: Above Ground Level, the distance above the ground. When an aircraft<br>is on the ground, this is zero.\<br>\<br>ASL: Above Sea Level: This is the standard that all aircraft use when<br>flying, as there must be a consistent baseline for all aircraft to<br>follow. Most aircraft use a \"pressure altimeter\" which uses barometric<br>pressure to calculate altitude. When ascending through 18,000 feet ASL,<br>aircraft set their altimeters to the universal standard 29.92 inHg. When<br>descending through 18,000 feet, aircraft are advised of the local<br>barometric pressure to which to set the altimeter. Aircraft will also<br>use GPS as a source of altitude, but it is not the primary altimeter.<br>The pressure altimeter is more accurate, as long as it is set based on<br>local conditions. When an aircraft is on the ground, this altimeter will<br>read the height of the aircraft above sea level.\<br>\<br>For instance, my favorite airfield (the airstrip at USAFA) is at 6565\'<br>above sea level. When the altimeter is set correctly, it reads 6565 when<br>on the ground. It\'s one of the settings you have to make when prepping<br>your aircraft to fly.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
