<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>This is a great question, thanks for asking!<br><br>First thing you should do right away is check to see that the IRS got<br>your tax return. You can visit [[Refunds \| Internal Revenue<br>Service](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=407dc3&url=http://irs.gov/refunds){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="irs.gov"}]{.qlink_container} and use the "Where's My<br>Refund?" tool to check to see that the IRS received your 2020 tax<br>return. If they did not, you should call the IRS immediately.<br><br>COVID-19 is causing delays in processing paper returns, especially<br>returns that need more information or have errors. The Where's My Refund<br>tool will show you that the IRS has, at least, received your return. If<br>they have, then please be patient, they will either mail your refund or<br>will mail you instructions on any corrections or additional information<br>you may need to provide.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>I mailed my IRS tax returns by mail 3 months ago and still haven\'t<br>gotten my refund. Is there a delay right now for the IRS in 2021? How<br>long will it take?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
