<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Why didn\'t Trump protect reporter Jamal Khashoggi in spite of Obama<br>pleading and advising him to?**<br><br>In what universe is President Trump (who happens to be the president of<br>*the United States*) responsible for the security of a *non-US citizen<br>while outside the United States?*<br><br>*Even if Khashoggi was a US citizen,* the White House does not routinely<br>protect any other US citizen, either. If I flew over to Saudi Arabia and<br>walked into the Saudi Arabian embassy, I wouldn't expect the President<br>to send SEAL Team 6 (or any other SEAL team, for that matter) along with<br>me.<br><br>Khashoggi was an adult. He was also a Saudi citizen. He was free to<br>leave the country (where he was staying as a guest) and return to his<br>country of origin.<br><br>At best, Trump could have passed on Obama's warning. Heck, Obama could<br>have skipped the middle man and warned Khashoggi himself. He probably<br>did.<br><br>But Khashoggi, being an adult, went anyway.<br><br>I'm not sure what you really expected was going to happen here.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
