<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**How has treatment for Multiple sclerosis changed over the past 10<br>years?**<br><br>Treatments for MS have changed more in the last 10 (and even 20) years<br>than they have in the previous 200 years.<br><br>The disease itself was officially identified and given a name in 1868,<br>but its existence was documented long before that. St. Liduina of<br>Schiedam is said to have had MS\[1\](#MMZbT){#cite-MMZbT<br>.citation_link}, and this was in 1396. Her symptoms were documented in<br>her biography, written after her death in 1433, and include relapses and<br>remissions. Her bones were discovered in the 1970s and show signs of<br>limited mobility in her right arm and her legs, but whether or not it<br>was actually MS is debatable.<br><br>From that point through the late 20th century, treatment of MS was<br>limited to management of the symptoms. However, the treatment options<br>literally exploded in the 1990s. The 90s are known as the "drug<br>explosion" decade.\[2\](#fIfGf){#cite-fIfGf .citation_link}<br>Interferon, an injectable drug to treat cancer, was approved for the<br>treatment of MS in the early and mid 90s. For the first time since the<br>1800s, we could actually *alter the course* of the disease by actually<br>addressing the disease itself, and not just its symptoms. We were no<br>longer slaves to symptoms. This was revolutionary in the treatment<br>of the disease.<br><br>Since then, our treatments have become more specific, more targeted, and<br>more effective. Our medicines have continued to improve efficacy, and<br>routes of administration have improved from injection-only therapies to<br>infusion and most recently, oral administration.<br><br>Since the 90s, our treatments have been "evolutionary" instead of<br>"revolutionary." We continue to improve our treatments so that they more<br>effectively slow down the progression of the disease, reduce the<br>severity and duration of relapses, and increase the amount of time<br>between relapses.<br><br>I have often said that there is no better time in history to get MS than<br>right now. I knew of people with MS as a child in the 80s, and it wasn't<br>pretty. It was going to progress, and there was nothing we could do to<br>stop or slow down the juggernaut that was MS, *but there is today*.<br><br>We've also made great strides in understanding the disease and its<br>progression, and our diagnostic tools have improved immensely, but that<br>elusive "cause" is still missing. However, our therapies have improved<br>so much that lifespans for people with MS, who take an approved therapy<br>drug, have nearly matched lifespans of those without MS.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-MMZbT){.citation_index} [[History of<br>MS](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=8de8ed&url=https://www.mstrust.org.uk/a-z/history-ms){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="mstrust.org.uk"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>\[2\](#cite-fIfGf){.citation_index} [[The History of Multiple<br>Sclerosis: How Far Have We<br>Come?](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=5c09eb&url=https://www.healthline.com/health/multiple-sclerosis/history%23drug-treatment){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="healthline.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
