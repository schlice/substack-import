<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The most complete list of side effects of Zoloft I've seen so far:<br><br>- sleepiness<br>- drowsiness<br>- tired feeling<br>- nervousness<br>- sleep problems (insomnia)<br>- dizziness<br>- nausea<br>- skin rash<br>- headache<br>- diarrhea<br>- constipation<br>- upset stomach<br>- stomach pain<br>- dry mouth<br>- changes in appetite<br>- abnormal ejaculation<br>- impotence<br>- decreased sex drive<br>- difficulty having an orgasm<br>- weight loss<br><br>MS can cause bowel/bladder problems, as well as causing sexual<br>dysfunction, so I've highlighted some symptoms in the above list which<br>are also common in MS. Some of the other side effects may be associated<br>with the MS medications, but those are dependent on which MS medication<br>you are taking.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
