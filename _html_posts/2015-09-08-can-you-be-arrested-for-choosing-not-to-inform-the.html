<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [There are a small handful of states that provide some<br>\"duty to report\" in certain situations, and there are some professions<br>which have professional (and in some cases, legal) obligations to report<br>unlawful activity, but for the vast majority of states, for the vast<br>majority of citizens, there is no legal requirement that you report<br>anything to the police.\<br>\<br>If you take positive steps to conceal a crime, or aid or abet a known<br>criminal, or do something to further the crime, these in and of<br>themselves are crimes.\<br>\<br>However, simply having knowledge that something unlawful is occurring<br>and not acting on that knowledge is not a crime.\<br>\<br>We would hope, however, that the moral code of the individual would<br>dictate to them that they take some positive step to mitigate the crime,<br>or its effect (such as contacting the police).]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
