<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Would it makes sense to file amicus briefs to petition various courts<br>to declare Donald Trump a vexatious litigant?**<br><br>A vexatious litigant is one who files frequent frivolous lawsuits. A<br>frivolous lawsuit is one which has little to no evidence to support its<br>filing.<br><br>*There is no evidence to support the claim that Trump contesting<br>selected state elections is vexatious.*<br><br>In fact, there are hundreds of sworn depositions which support their<br>claim. Remember, *evidence* is different than *proof*. While *evidence*<br>exists in sufficient quantity to justify the claim, *proof* may be<br>fleeting, but that follows legal investigation. There is more than<br>enough evidence to prove that these suits are not frivolous.<br><br>You may believe that his lawsuits will ultimately not change the result<br>of the elections. It's true, they may not. ***But that does not negate<br>his right to file them, nor does that lead their filing to be<br>vexatious***. In fact, I would say that if he has evidence that voter<br>fraud has taken place in a state, he has a *duty* to pursue the case,<br>for the sake of the integrity of the election process.<br><br>Compare Trump's lawsuits with some other notable vexatious litigants:<br><br>> - Lawrence Bittaker, who together with his partner Roy Norris was<br>>   convicted of torturing, raping and murdering five young girls<br>>   in 1979. He filed 40 separate frivolous lawsuits against the state<br>>   of California, including one claiming \"cruel and unusual<br>>   punishment\" after being served a broken cookie. In 1993, he was<br>>   declared a vexatious litigant and is forbidden from filing lawsuits<br>>   without the permission of a lawyer or a judge.<br>> - The Church of Scientology. \"Plaintiffs (Scientologists) have<br>>   abused the federal court system by using it, *inter alia*, to<br>>   attempt to destroy their opponents, rather than to resolve an actual<br>>   dispute over trademark law or any other legal matter. This<br>>   constitutes \'extraordinary, malicious, wanton and oppressive<br>>   conduct.\' As such, this case qualifies as an \'exceptional case\'<br>>   and fees should be awarded pursuant to the Lanham Act\... It is<br>>   abundantly clear that plaintiffs sought to harass the individual<br>>   defendants and destroy the church defendants through massive<br>>   over-litigation and other highly questionable litigation tactics.<br>>   The Special Master has never seen a more glaring example of bad<br>>   faith litigation than this.\"<br>> - Francis \"Coyote\" Shivers, actor and singer, declared vexatious<br>>   by the Los Angeles County Superior Court in 2008.<br>> - Dorothy Squires, singer and former wife of actor Roger Moore;<br>>   declared a vexatious litigant in 1987; legal fees led to her<br>>   bankruptcy.<br>> - Leo Stoller, a trademark troll, was declared a vexatious<br>>   litigant by multiple U.S. federal courts, including the Supreme<br>>   Court, in 2007.\[1\](#KfNsj){#cite-KfNsj .citation_link}<br><br>I'm reasonably sure Trump's lawsuits do not rise to the level of<br>vexatious litigation.<br><br>\<br><br>*For the time being, I have re-enabled comments on selected answers.<br>Some people like to comment. Some people like to engage with me in a<br>civil manner, and I did kinda miss that\...a little. But do not<br>misunderstand, I take this step very cautiously, and I have no tolerance<br>for harassing or inane behavior. If you don\'t like what I wrote, tough<br>shit. If my answer is grammatically low-quality or is un-cited opinion<br>masquerading as fact, downvote it. If you think I\'m wrong, write your<br>own answer. But Quora is a question-and-answer site, not a debate site.<br>If you are simply commenting to tell me \"ackshually, you\'re wrong,\"<br>don\'t be surprised if I quietly delete your comment. Put anything<br>vaguely harassing in there, and your deletion will be followed by a<br>block/mute, and a BNBR report. I will do this immediately and with no<br>compunction. You have been warned.
