I'm unaware of any<br>jurisdiction where text message is the only form of notification<br>required to process an eviction.<br><br>The eviction notice will be attached to the door of the unit, such that<br>you cannot enter the unit without seeing the notice. It will be attached<br>in such a way that you will have to remove it to enter the unit.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
