<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Nope.<br><br>You can write whatever you choose to write. It\'s covered by the First<br>Amendment to the US Constitution. You can claim that you are going to<br>fail to abide by the law from now on. You can also claim that you are<br>going to commit crimes.<br><br>But if you do, please specify the times, dates, and locations where you<br>plan on committing said crimes.<br><br>So the police can be there to arrest you.<br><br>At that point, your speech moves from protected 1st Amendment speech to<br>a piece of evidence known as \"forethought,\" meaning you thought about<br>the crimes you were going to commit before you committed them. Depending<br>on the crime, this may make the crime worse.<br><br>For example, if you claimed in your Act of Rebellion that you were going<br>to kill the first police officer you see, and then when the appointed<br>day arrives, you do so, you will be arrested and charged with murder.<br>Your Act of Rebellion will be used as evidence against you in court<br>showing you had forethought; one of the required elements of murder.<br><br>So to summarize, you are allowed to write anything you choose and<br>deliver it to anyone you choose. If you lie about someone and that lie<br>harms that person, that\'s called libel, and you can be sued for that,<br>but if you\'re only sending your Act of Rebellion to the police station,<br>there\'s not much to worry about in that regard.<br><br>Mostly, you\'ll just give the entire police station a really good<br>belly-laugh. And then they\'ll be there to arrest you when you choose to<br>\"rebel.\"<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
