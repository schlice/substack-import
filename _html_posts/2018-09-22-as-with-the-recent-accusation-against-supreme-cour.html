<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**As with the recent accusation against Supreme Court nominee Brett<br>Kavanaugh, should people \"believe\" an accusation of sexual assault<br>simply because the accuser is a woman?**<br><br>No.<br><br>If we are to live in a society governed by laws, then both the accuser<br>and the accused have rights.<br><br>The only time we simply believe an accusation without investigation and<br>without proof is in a [[kangaroo<br>court](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=40d983&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kangaroo_court){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}.<br><br>People should not simply "believe" an accusation simply because the<br>accuser is a woman. The logic most people use is, "Why would she lie?<br>What does she have to gain? Her entire life is being destroyed by this<br>accusation. She's getting death threats. Literally, why would she lie?"<br><br>There are three points I'd like to make.<br><br>1.  Memories can be flawed. In the Kavanaugh-Ford case, Ford's memory<br>    differs from what she even told her therapist just six years ago,<br>    and what she told her therapist was a full thirty years after<br>    the incident. It is well known that memories become less perfect the<br>    more time removed from the incident. If her memories differ from<br>    what she told her therapist just six years ago, it's also just as<br>    likely that her memory of the actual incident thirty six years<br>    ago is also, potentially flawed. Therefore, she's not "lying" *per<br>    se*; she literally believes everything she remembers. But what she<br>    remembers may be wrong.<br>2.  While the majority of women who make accusations are telling the<br>    truth, the history of some high profile cases show that some women<br>    do actually lie about being abused, even if they have "nothing to<br>    gain" from the lie. The Duke lacrosse team actually was innocent<br>    in 2006. Crystal Mangum actually made up the entire ordeal. In 2014<br>    Columbia University student Emma Sulkowitz claimed that a fellow<br>    student raped her. She carried a mattress on her back to shame her<br>    alleged attacker, even though the university and police investigated<br>    the incident and found no wrongdoing. While she may have believed<br>    that she was raped (and she made sure everyone else knew it), the<br>    evidence showed differently.<br>3.  Sexual assault is a big deal, and everyone involved deserves to be<br>    heard and respected. Everyone, regardless of gender, deserves equal<br>    protection under the law. The accused has the right to face his<br>    accuser, and the accused in this country has the right to be<br>    presumed *innocent until proven guilty*, not the other way around.<br>    We do not presume guilt simply because the accuser is a woman and<br>    because she alleges a sexual assault.<br><br>These nomination hearings are already a political circus and a<br>monumental waste of time. Any of these questions could have been asked<br>and answered in writing, and if you want to make a case of "lying"<br>rock-solid, get it in writing. Then, if you catch the nominee in a lie,<br>he's automatically disqualified, and if you so desire, you can start<br>impeachment proceedings to remove him from his current position (if<br>applicable). Ever since Robert Bork, these hearings have been nothing<br>but political theater, a platform for Senatorial grandstanding and<br>auditions for president.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
