<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I think that when you say Section 504, you are talking about the<br>equality in education section of federal law. Basically, that section<br>says that regardless of your disability, you have the right to equal<br>access to education. Your church is not an educational institution under<br>the control of the state, therefore Section 504 does not apply to your<br>church.<br><br>However, if you told the leaders of your youth group that you had a<br>disability and you would benefit from an accommodation in order to<br>equally participate with everyone else, I am absolutely certain that<br>they would go out of their way to accommodate you, so that you could<br>have an equal experience to everyone else.<br><br>If you actually meant something else, please reply and let me know, and<br>I\'ll see if I can help you.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
