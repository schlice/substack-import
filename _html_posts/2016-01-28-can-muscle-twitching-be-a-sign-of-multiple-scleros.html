<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>*Can* it be sign? Yes, it can be a sign<br><br>*Does it mean you have MS?* By itself, it does not mean you have MS.<br><br>There are hundreds of different explanations for muscle twitching. Some<br>are common, some are not so common. Your doctor can help you sort<br>through those.<br><br>A diagnosis of MS is a diagnosis of *exclusion*, which means you have to<br>exclude all other possibilities for the symptoms you see before you can<br>diagnose someone with MS.<br><br>Therefore, you need to start with your exclusions. Make an appointment<br>with your doctor and talk to him/her about all of your symptoms. Go from<br>there. Once they get to the point where they say, \"we have no other<br>explanations,\" then you should see a neurologist to dig further. Don\'t<br>put the cart before the horse here.<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*This answer is not professional medical advice**, nor is it a<br>substitute for professional medical advice.
