<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**How many gun-related mass murders have occurred in the US in the last<br>50 years that have been perpetrated by a person or people who followed<br>gun laws?**<br><br>So let's step back understanding that murder is illegal so no one who<br>has committed a mass murder has actually followed all laws.<br><br>Let's look at *up until the point of the mass murder*, whether or not<br>all laws were followed.<br><br>The news is very clear about these while they're being reported, because<br>soon after you hear about a mass murder, the questions arise. Where did<br>the shooter get the gun? Was it legal for the shooter to possess a gun?<br>How did the shooter get the gun into a place where there shouldn't be<br>guns?<br><br>If we focus on school shootings, we can say that none of the shooters<br>were following gun laws, as schools (currently) are gun-free zones, and<br>private citizens, even fully licensed ones, cannot carry firearms into<br>school zones. Therefore, every school shooter violated the law.<br><br>But the law did exactly what it was supposed to do. Every one of the<br>school shooters (who was alive following the incident) was prosecuted<br>for violating the gun-free zone laws. And for murder too, but we're<br>stepping back from that for the moment.<br><br>*Wait, the law wasn't designed to stop shooters before they kill?*<br><br>NO, it was not.<br><br>In fact, the most shocking thing I think I can say is that **laws do not<br>stop people from doing bad things if they choose.**<br><br>I think people have a tremendous misconception about what laws are<br>supposed to do. Laws are designed to punish those who break them. They<br>are a *disincentive,* *not* *a preventative.* You would think that<br>putting a law in place would prevent 100% of people from doing that<br>particular bad thing, but it does not. It only prevents those who<br>choose to follow that law from receiving that consequence. People<br>can, in fact, choose to *not* follow that law, at which point the<br>consequence kicks in.<br><br>Notice that the law only prevented people who chose to follow it<br>from receiving consequences. People who chose not to follow it<br>received consequences.<br><br>Therefore, the law actually didn't prevent bad behavior. It only<br>prevented *the law-abiding* from receiving consequences from performing<br>said bad behavior. People who chose to not follow the law received the<br>consequences. **But they still performed the bad behavior before they<br>received the consequences. So the law did not keep anyone safe. It only<br>punished the law breaker *after the fact.***<br><br>*So if the law can't keep people safe, how do you stop a shooting before<br>it happens?*<br><br>SECURITY.<br><br>Security prevents bad things from happening in the first place. Laws<br>take the person *who has already performed a bad act* and gives them<br>consequences. Laws have their effect on the back side of the act (after<br>it happens); security has its effect on the front side of the act<br>(before it happens).<br><br>The challenge (should we have the courage to accept it) is making<br>security *ubiquitous* and *unobtrusive* but *effective*. This is our<br>challenge, and it will not be easy, but I am convinced that it is<br>possible.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
