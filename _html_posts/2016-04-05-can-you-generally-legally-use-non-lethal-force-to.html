Since you can respond to a<br>non-lethal threat with a different type of non-lethal response (i.e. you<br>can respond to a violent person with a Taser), the question of fact for<br>the jury to decide is whether or not the response was \"equivalent\" and<br>whether or not the \"reasonable person\" would believe the response to<br>be \"equivalent.\" The reasonable person test is the one which needs to<br>be passed.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
