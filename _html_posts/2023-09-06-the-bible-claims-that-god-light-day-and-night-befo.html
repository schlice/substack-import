<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I like this one. It's the *Scopes trial* conceit: the sun was created on<br>the fourth day, how can there be any light if there was no sun?<br><br>Recall what we are talking about. This is documented in Genesis 1.<br>Genesis 1:3-5 declares, \"And God said, \'Let there be light,\' and<br>there was light. God saw that the light was good, and He separated the<br>light from the darkness. God called the light \'day,\' and the darkness<br>He called \'night.\' And there was evening, and there was morning ---<br>the first day.\" A few verses later we are informed, \"And God said,<br>\'Let there be lights in the expanse of the sky to separate the day from<br>the night, and let them serve as signs to mark seasons and days and<br>years, and let them be lights in the expanse of the sky to give light on<br>the earth.\' And it was so. God made two great lights --- the greater<br>light to govern the day and the lesser light to govern the night. He<br>also made the stars. God set them in the expanse of the sky to give<br>light on the earth, to govern the day and the night, and to separate<br>light from darkness. And God saw that it was good. And there was<br>evening, and there was morning --- the fourth day\" (Genesis 1:14-19).<br><br>How can that be? How can there be light on the first day if the sun<br>wasn't created until the fourth day?<br><br>**This is only problematic if you discount the presence of an omnipotent<br>God. *GOD IS LIGHT!*** God's very presence provided the light for<br>the first three days.<br><br>The Bible reinforces this in several areas.<br><br>> \"This is the message we have heard from him and declare to you: God<br>> is light; in Him there is no darkness at all.\" --- 1 John 1:5 ESV<br>><br>> "There will be no more night. They will not need the light of a lamp<br>> or the light of the sun, for the Lord God will give them light. And<br>> they will reign for ever and ever" --- Revelation 22:5 ESV<br><br>Jesus even echoed this same message:<br><br>> "I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will never walk in<br>> darkness, but will have the light of life" --- John 8:12 ESV.<br><br>Jesus is the Light of the World who provides light to those who believe<br>in Him. Those who do not will be thrown out to the "outer darkness"<br>where there will be great "weeping and gnashing of teeth" (Matthew<br>8:12).<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
