<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Nope. Nothing is un-hackable. No computer system cannot be hacked. And<br>no administrator worth his salt would ever claim that a system is<br>un-hackable. If users are able to use a system, it can be hacked.<br><br>There is a *spectrum* of hackability from the most secure system to the<br>least secure system. The most secure system has no users. The least<br>secure system has no access controls. So there is always a trade-off<br>between usability and security. In every computer system, from NORAD's<br>correlation systems all the way down to your humble PC, there is always<br>a trade-off between how usable the system is, and how secure the system<br>is. The more usable it is, the less secure it is. This is a universal<br>constant in computers.<br><br>While it is true that there is no NORAD system beyond hacking, if you<br>start adding conditions to your hacking situation, the probability of<br>NORAD systems being hacked decreases exponentially:<br><br>- Is there any NORAD system that cannot be hacked ***from the<br>  Internet?***<br>- Is there any NORAD system that cannot be hacked ***without physical<br>  access?***<br>- Is there any *classified* NORAD system that cannot be hacked<br>  *without SIPRNET access?*<br><br>Once you start adding conditions to your scenario, the probability of a<br>NORAD system being hacked decreases exponentially.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Is there anything that cannot be hacked in the North American Aerospace<br>Defense Command (NORAD)?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
