<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>First of all, suicidal people don't "always" say that no one would care<br>if they died. Some people are not being selfless. Some are intentionally<br>trying to hurt those around them.<br><br>**But regardless of how a suicidal person wants to influence others<br>through their death, this is just a symptom of the *flawed<br>thinking* which causes suicidal thoughts.**<br><br>Ultimately, when people think that taking their life will somehow<br>influence others, they have *overestimated their importance in others'<br>lives*. They are thinking more highly of themselves than they ought to.<br>Thinking that your death will either negatively or positively impact<br>others lives is no better than thinking that your presence is a net<br>positive on people\'s lives. *Both* are examples of flawed reasoning.<br><br>Unchecked, this flawed logic and flawed reasoning can grow until a<br>person feels like removing themselves permanently from the situation is<br>the best choice.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Why do suicidal people always say that no one would care if they died<br>when that isn\'t true?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
