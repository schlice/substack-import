<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Can a president self-pardon and then run for office again?<br><br>Whether or not a president can pardon himself is a legal question that<br>has yet to be decided by the courts. There is nothing specifically<br>written in the Constitution which states that a president cannot pardon<br>himself. Legal scholars are split on whether or not a president can<br>actually pardon himself.<br><br>Whether or not a president can run for office again is governed by the<br>presidential term limits in the 22nd Amendment. Whether or not a person<br>can *be* president is governed by Article II of the Constitution: he or<br>she must be 35 years of age, be a natural born citizen, and must have<br>lived in the United States for at least 14 years. Even a convicted felon<br>can hold the office of president. The Constitution does not bar<br>convicted felons from running for, or holding, the office of president.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
