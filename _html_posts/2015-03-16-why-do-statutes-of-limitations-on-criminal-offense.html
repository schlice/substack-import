<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Statutes of limitations exist to protect the defendant.<br>They exist for a number of reasons, but primarily the idea is to make<br>sure that defendants are prosecuted using evidence that has not<br>deteriorated with time. Physical evidence as well as peoples\' memories<br>can deteriorate with time. Some common law philosophy behind them<br>include the fact that plaintiffs who have cause to bring charges should<br>do so within a reasonable amount of time, and the longer the gap between<br>the commission of the crime and its prosecution constitutes an unjust<br>burden on the defendant. Also, as more time passes, you have less<br>possibility of providing a fair outcome for a defendant as evidence and<br>memory may have deteriorated.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
