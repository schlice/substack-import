<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What would be the resulting effects if police officers were required<br>to keep video footage of everything they do on a daily basis in a public<br>database?**<br><br>It would be an absolute nightmare.<br><br>First of all, you'd have to edit out all of the parts of the video which<br>*can't* be made public, for various reasons. For example, if the video<br>is being used in an ongoing legal procedure, the video is evidence and<br>is protected. Only after the trial is concluded could the evidence be<br>released.<br><br>After the editing was done to remove the items which, by law, can't be<br>publicly presented, you'd have a pretty boring compilation of officers<br>driving cars or filling out paperwork. Not sure that's really worth your<br>time, or your desire to watch the police that closely.<br><br>Not to mention, your taxes would triple.<br><br>In order to store 100% of the video of an officer's shift, we're talking<br>about 8 hours of video per officer per shift. Let's just assume we have<br>a small-ish department, and you normally staff 10 officers and a<br>supervisor. This equates to 33 cameras x 8 hours of video = 264 hours of<br>video *per day.* That's 7920 hours of video per month.<br><br>We'll take the Axon Body 2 camera specifications as our baseline, so we<br>can collect some numbers. From Taser's specs, the specs for recording,<br>depending on resolution:<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-bff1e67626a99e9566031135b2d7f3c0){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-bff1e67626a99e9566031135b2d7f3c0" master_w="379"<br>master_h="62"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>Therefore, if you go with Taser's recommendation of running at 720p (low<br>HD resolution; you get decent images but you don't consume the space of<br>1080p), each camera will use 2.7GB per hour. That means, for a typical<br>day of 264 hours of video, you will need 712.8 GB of space per day. In a<br>typical month, you're looking at 21.3 TB per month.<br><br>Then how long do you plan on storing that video? Three months? One year?<br>If you store the video for three months, you'll need over 64 TB of<br>space. If you plan on storing the video for a year, you'll need over 256<br>TB of space. Reducing the quality of the video starts to reduce the<br>effectiveness of the camera recording.<br><br>And this doesn't even factor in *evidentiary* recordings. This is only<br>for *administrative* recordings. Evidentiary recordings may have to be<br>stored for longer.<br><br>While storage prices have definitely gotten cheaper, storage is not<br>free. Not to mention that you will have to hire some new video admins to<br>curate all of the officer's video, remove and catalog the segments of<br>video which must be kept for evidence, and maintain the online catalog<br>of video. Storage admins are not cheap, even on a government salary.<br><br>It would be better to make policies telling officers what they were<br>required to record, and slamming them if recordings ever went "missing".<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
