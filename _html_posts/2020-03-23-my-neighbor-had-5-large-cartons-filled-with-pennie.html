His pickup conked<br>and hauled pennies to a car dealership and bought a truck, but the<br>dealership refused to accept the legal tender. Why?**<br><br>Most businesses don't have large coin counters expecting people to bring<br>in pennies as currency.<br><br>While pennies are indeed legal tender, Federal law does not compel any<br>business to accept them. The business can indeed ask you to change the<br>pennies into larger denomination currency at a nearby bank just as<br>easily as they can ask you to change a \$100 bill into smaller<br>denomination bills.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
