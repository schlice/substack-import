<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>False equivalence. You simply cannot compare humans and animals. Humans<br>have self awareness and agency, which animals do not. As good caretakers<br>of animals, we know when they are in pain, and if we cannot help them,<br>we have a duty and a responsibility to alleviate their suffering.<br><br>When it comes to euthanasia and humans, there are several reasons it is<br>"not considered okay."<br><br>- Religious people will tell you that life is a gift of God, and that<br>  only God should decide when it ends, not us.<br>- Outside of religion, everyone everywhere knows intuitively that it is<br>  wrong to kill humans. They may not be able to explain why they know<br>  (which is a whole discussion unto itself), but they know.<br>- There is a moral difference between passively "letting die" and<br>  actively "killing." Withholding treatment equates to letting die<br>  (passive) and is at least justifiable, whereas physician-assisted<br>  suicide equates to killing (active) and is less easily justifiable.<br>- Some people fear that if euthanasia was legalized, it would be abused,<br>  and some people would be killed who didn't want to die. But public<br>  opinion is changing, and people are increasingly in favor of allowing<br>  terminally ill patients the right to die with a doctor's help.<br>- Doctors are generally not in favor of the practice, saying that<br>  associating euthanasia with medicine could harm the public's image of<br>  the profession. And doctors are not perfect either. Doctors make<br>  mistakes. But forcing multiple doctors to make independent terminality<br>  diagnoses should alleviate some of that concern.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
