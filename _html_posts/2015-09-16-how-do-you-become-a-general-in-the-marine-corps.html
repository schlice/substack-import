<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>(By the way, becoming a general in the Marine Corps is similar to<br>becoming a general in any of the armed forces. The numbers may be<br>different, but the philosophy is the same.)<br><br>Hard work, long hours, hard work, some luck when it comes to<br>assignments, did I mention hard work?<br><br>To become a general, you first must be an officer in the Marine Corps.<br>This means you must first be commissioned into the Marine Corps. There<br>are several ways to get a Marine Corps officer commission:<br><br>- Graduate from any US Service Academy (Naval Academy usually)<br>- Cross-commission from one of the other service academies (I had<br>  several friends who cross-commissioned from my class into the Marine<br>  Corps)<br>- Officer Candidate School (OCS)<br>- Naval Reserve Officer Training Corps (NROTC)<br>- Enlisted Commissioning Program (ECP)<br>- Marine Enlisted Commission Education Program (MECEP)<br><br>Once you\'re a commissioned officer in the Marine Corps, you work your<br>way up through the ranks by doing your job to the best of your ability,<br>and then some. Once you\'ve done everything in your job that you\'re<br>supposed to do, then you look for the things to do in your job that will<br>make it work better, more efficiently.<br><br>There are some other things that we were taught by some generals about<br>how they got to where they were:<br><br>- Trust that the Service will take care of you, and do your given job as<br>  best as you can. Don\'t try to \"game\" the assignment system. The<br>  Service will take care of you and keep you on the best path, but the<br>  needs of the Service come first. In general though, Assignments won\'t<br>  set you up for failure.<br>- Do your PME (Professional Military Education) (yes, you still go to<br>  school even after you graduate from college) as soon as it is offered,<br>  as early as you can get it done. Try to go as a resident as often as<br>  you can rather than doing correspondence. Generally, and regardless of<br>  what you are told, people who go residency to PME are considered the<br>  top officers on the base, and your record reflecting PME in residence<br>  is better than PME by correspondence.<br>- Take the overseas billets when they are offered. Yes, they sometimes<br>  suck, but they always lead to goodness when you return.<br><br>Basically, take the opportunities that are given to you, push yourself,<br>and trust that the system will take care of you.<br><br>BAM, in 25 years, you\'re a general. Congratulations. It\'s that simple.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
