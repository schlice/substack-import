<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Level 2's job is to take escalations from lower level Technical Support<br>Engineers (TSEs). When the lower level TSE has either reached the limit<br>of his or her knowledge, or has encountered an issue which will take<br>considerable time or investigation to solve, they escalate the case to<br>us.<br><br>We may also have to engage our Engineering teams to assist with the<br>troubleshooting. It's important to note that Engineering is not "Level<br>Four Tech Support." They are a completely different organization and<br>they don't have the same tools available to directly support customers.<br><br>We also update Service Requests (SRs) to keep customers up to date with<br>the investigation and our progress. Good notes are important, and our<br>customers can log in to their accounts and view their organization's<br>SRs, as well as get all progress updates by email.<br><br>We handle the longer-running SRs that we don't want our triage team<br>(Tier I Support) to handle. We want our L1s to pick up cases, triage<br>them and either quickly resolve them, or escalate them if the fix will<br>take longer to investigate.<br><br>To the customer, we become the primary contact for the company.<br><br>Level 3 Tech Support, for us, is actually a subset of Level 2 support.<br>It is what we internally refer to as the "Recovery Team." We are<br>sometimes collectively referred to as "L2/RT." As far as our specific<br>function, any time a SR has Data Unavailable or Data Loss (DU/DL), the<br>Recovery Team is engaged. Our charter is to provide the highest level of<br>technical support to our customers in their hour of greatest need. We<br>have a notification process which engages our team and simultaneously<br>notifies our senior leaders of the situation. We are the team focused on<br>recovering systems in the quickest and safest way possible. We don't<br>compromise on either of those. We want to recover data as quickly as<br>possible, but we must keep in mind what actions will risk customer data,<br>and we will never compromise safety for expediency. We will often choose<br>a recovery path that is slightly slower, but is safer to the data.<br><br>Much of this is company-specific, and each company's delineation and<br>definition of each level of support is specific to the product they<br>support, as well as the way in which the organization provides that<br>support. This is specific to us at Dell EMC.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
