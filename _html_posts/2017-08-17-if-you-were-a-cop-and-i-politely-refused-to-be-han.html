<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>These answers are all correct, to a degree.<br><br>The bottom line is that you will be handcuffed whether or not you agree.<br>In general, it works this way:<br><br>1.  I ask you to do something<br>2.  I tell you to do something<br>3.  I make you do something.<br><br>The "do something" can be anything from putting your hands behind your<br>back to moving to a particular location or anything else which I may<br>need you to do. If I am placing you under arrest, you will be<br>handcuffed.<br><br>So I will first *ask* you to place your hands behind your back. If you<br>refuse, I will then *tell* you to place your hands behind your back. If<br>you still refuse, I will *make* you put your hands behind your back,<br>which will usually involve some form of control technique such as a<br>wrist lock (which incidentally also involves some pain), at which point<br>I will apply handcuffs anyway. So not only did your polite refusal get<br>you nowhere in terms of not getting handcuffed, now you're handcuffed<br>and in pain.<br><br>The only time I would not handcuff you behind your back is if you are<br>physically incapable of putting your hands behind your back (perhaps<br>because of an injury or a defect related to your arm), and I would belt<br>you and cuff you wherever I was able. Bottom line: if you're riding in<br>the back of the car, you're handcuffed.<br><br>The short answer: don't refuse the order of a police officer who is<br>performing his duty. You won't get far.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
