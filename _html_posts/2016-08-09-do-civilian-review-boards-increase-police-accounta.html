<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Your question details actually answered your question.<br><br>Civilians don't have their own review boards, but some departments do<br>allow civilian volunteers to audit their internal reviews. The reviews<br>don't change; they're exactly the same review that would be done<br>normally. The civilians on the review board increase *transparency*,<br>or at the very least, the appearance of transparency to the general<br>public. Knowing that civilians sit on the "internal" police review<br>boards helps the public to feel like the police are being held<br>accountable.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
