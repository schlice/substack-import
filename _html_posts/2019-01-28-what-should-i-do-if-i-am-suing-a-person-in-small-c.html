<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What should I do if I am suing a person in small claims and I can not<br>get them served? I have an email address and phone number? Do I take my<br>service attempts to court and show the judge or do text / email the<br>person who has been evading service?**<br><br>Generally (of course, this varies by jurisdiction), you file your<br>complaint with the county. You pay the filing fee, and you pay the<br>service fee. An officer of the court then serves the other party in the<br>case.<br><br>It sounds though as if you're in a county which requires service but<br>does not provide it.<br><br>The first thing you will have to do is get a mailing address. A simple<br>reverse phone number search (free or paid) should be able to reveal a<br>mailing address when you have a phone number. However, there are some<br>paid people searches that will be able to give you a more definite<br>mailing address; the more information, the better. In your case, give<br>the email address and the phone number and you should be able to get a<br>mailing address. The fee you are charged by the search company should be<br>disclosed to the court and can be added to your judgement.<br><br>Once you have a mailing address, there are several methods by which you<br>can get papers served. Always check with the clerk of the court to find<br>out what services are available and authorized in your county:<br><br>- Sheriff's office, Marshall's office, or Constable's office:<br>  sometimes, you will have to approach law enforcement yourself with<br>  papers to be served, and you'll pay that office directly for that<br>  service.<br>- Private process server: check the local phone book for listings of<br>  private process servers in your area. In some jurisdictions, servers<br>  must be authorized by the court<br>- Disinterested adult: Some jurisdictions allow anyone who is 18<br>  years old or older to serve papers. In some jurisdictions, these<br>  adults must also be authorized by the court.<br>- Certified mail: Many jurisdictions allow service through certified<br>  mail. Check with your county to see if they allow this, and what they<br>  accept as proof of service. Generally you'll have to show that the<br>  letter was delivered. In some jurisdictions, the clerk of the court<br>  will do the mailing for you, and you can pay the fee directly to the<br>  court.<br>- Regular mail: A small number of jurisdictions allow service<br>  through regular first-class mail. Again, check with the clerk of the<br>  court to determine what qualifies as service through regular mail.<br>- Substituted service: This is colloquially known as "nail and mail"<br>  since you can "nail" a copy of the summons to their door, and at the<br>  same time mail a copy to the person's address. Typically, in a<br>  jurisdiction which allows it, a copy of the summons is delivered to<br>  the address and is left with anyone who is 18 or older. On the same<br>  day, a copy of the summons is sent via regular mail. Service is<br>  considered complete 10 days after mailing. All of these steps must be<br>  carried out by someone 18 or older who is not named in the suit.<br><br>Once you have completed service to the satisfaction of the court (and<br>have filed a Proof of Service with the clerk), you can attend your court<br>date and receive a default judgement against the respondent. So long as<br>the person was properly served based on what is accepted in that county,<br>the service is appropriately documented, and the respondent fails to<br>show up, you can get a default judgement entered by the court.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
