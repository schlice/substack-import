<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Why is it acceptable to say \"teach men not to rape\", but bigoted to<br>say \"teach Muslims not to commit terrorism\"?**<br><br>It's not acceptable to do either.<br><br>I think it's clear why it is bigoted to say "teach Muslims not to commit<br>terrorism." Terrorism is not unique to Muslims simply because there are<br>some Muslim groups which espouse the use of terrorism. Timothy McVeigh<br>was not a Muslim, and yet he committed the largest act of domestic<br>terrorism the United States had seen until September 11th.<br><br>But it's also not acceptable to say that we "teach men not to rape," for<br>several reasons:<br><br>1.  *Women can be rapists, too.* While original legal wording of rape<br>    crimes made it a crime that only a man could commit against a woman,<br>    more nuanced and modern understandings of the crime understand that<br>    male stimulation is not a sign of consent. Women can, without<br>    consent, stimulate and rape men, and they have.<br>2.  Why is it appropriate to teach men not to rape, but not to teach<br>    them to not commit other crimes? The answer is that *we don't teach<br>    people to not commit crime. We teach people to understand the<br>    difference between right and wrong, and act accordingly*. That's how<br>    people are able to navigate the world, and not go around committing<br>    crimes just because they haven't been taught specifically not to<br>    commit that crime.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
