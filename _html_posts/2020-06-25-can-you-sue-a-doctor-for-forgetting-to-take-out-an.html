<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Can you sue a doctor for forgetting to take out an ovary?<br><br>How do you "forget" to take out an ovary???<br><br>The surgery was either scheduled to include ovary removal, or it was<br>not. If the doctor told you that it was optional, or only if the ovary<br>was damaged or non-functional, then leaving it in may have been the best<br>medical course of action.<br><br>But if, for example, you went in for a complete hysterectomy, to include<br>both ovaries, and the doctor just left one in with no medical<br>explanation as to why, then you may have a claim for malpractice. You'll<br>probably want to contact a medical malpractice attorney to find out if<br>you have a case.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
