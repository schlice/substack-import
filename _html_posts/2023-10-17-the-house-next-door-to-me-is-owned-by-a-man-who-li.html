<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Illinois has a shared fence law.<br><br>> Illinois Fence Law Basics<br>><br>> Most fence-related issues are about the appearance, location, and<br>> height of the fence, and whether a homeowner overstepped the legal<br>> property line of an adjoining property. Illinois\' Fence Act was<br>> drafted to clarify issues common to those with large tracks of<br>> farmland or living in rural, unincorporated regions. A legal fence is<br>> defined as one that will sufficiently contain livestock on the land.<br>><br>> However, there are portions of the state\'s Fence Act that can impact<br>> those in residential neighborhoods. For example, in counties with less<br>> than one million residents and not within the corporate limits of any<br>> city in such county, when one land owner wants to fence their<br>> property, each [[owner of adjoining land must<br>> pay](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=f645d7&url=https://codes.findlaw.com/il/chapter-765-property/il-st-sect-765-130-4.html){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="findlaw.com"}]{.qlink_container} for and maintain the<br>> fence even when they do not want the fence installed.<br>><br>> Neighbors\' Responsibilities for a Common Fence<br>><br>> Illinois state law and local ordinances place the responsibility for<br>> maintenance of a boundary fence separating two properties on the<br>> owners that use the fence. Consequently, when a fence needs repair,<br>> both property owners must share the cost. If one party refuses to<br>> cooperate, the other party can do any of the following:<br>><br>> - Write a letter to the neighbor explaining the problem with the fence<br>> - Request a \"fence viewer\" examine the fence and make a<br>>   recommendation of whether the fence needs repair or whether the<br>>   amount requested for repair is reasonable<br>> - Go to mediation<br>> - Sue the neighbor for reimbursement\[1\](#IAYwH){#cite-IAYwH<br>>   .citation_link}<br><br>If, after you have written a letter, gotten the recommendation from the<br>fence viewer, and attempted mediation, you can file suit in your local<br>small claims court for reimbursement.<br><br>Despite what others have said, the property is located in Illinois and<br>is covered by Illinois law, regardless of whether or not the owner lives<br>on the property full-time. You can seek redress in Illinois small claims<br>court if you cannot get reimbursement in any other way.<br><br>\<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*This answer is not a substitute for professional legal advice or a<br>solicitation to offer legal advice regarding specific facts.
