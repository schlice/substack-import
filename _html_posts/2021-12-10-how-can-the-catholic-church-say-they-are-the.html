<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>You do realize that in order for a believer to truly believe, any<br>adherent to any religion must believe that their religion is right and<br>all the others are wrong.<br><br>If not, then either the tenets of your religion are meaningless, or your<br>faith is weak.<br><br>One of the benefits of living in the United States is that we all get to<br>believe what we choose, or nothing at all. There is no "state religion"<br>which we all must follow.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>How can the catholic church say they are the \'one true religion\"? To<br>me,the Jewish religion would be that! After all, Jesus was a Jew...so<br>where does the catholic church get off claiming that?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
