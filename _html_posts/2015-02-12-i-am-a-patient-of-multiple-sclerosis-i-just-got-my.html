<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [If you are not experiencing any issues, your lesions are<br>called \"silent\" and the majority of lesions you experience will be<br>this way.\<br>\<br>The report doesn\'t suggest a good or bad prognosis. But if your lesions<br>with \"significant resolution\" appear with contrast dye, then the<br>lesions are active. This may be a sign that your medication is not<br>working for you, depending on how long you have been taking it.\<br>\<br>But that determination (whether or not you are making good prognosis)<br>should be made between you and your neurologist.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
