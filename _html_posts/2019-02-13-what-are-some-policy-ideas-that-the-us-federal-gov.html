<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What are some policy ideas that the US federal government could enact<br>in order to help stabilize and control the cost of health care/medical<br>coverage? What can be done to make health care actually affordable or<br>easily to subsidize for all?**<br><br>I really think that in order to make this happen, we're going to have to<br>implement a dual system.<br><br>People don't like to hear "dual system" because it makes them think of<br>the "haves vs the have-nots" and that's simply not the case. Get it out<br>of your head.<br><br>We *can* have basic healthcare covered for all people, and we<br>*can* keep our current insurance companies in business, but each of<br>those will be incomplete.<br><br>We *won't* have Medicare cover 100% of people for 100% of medical<br>issues, and we *can't* continue having private insurance cover 100%<br>of medical issues. Neither system is workable.<br><br>What I see as a future path is to enact a modified version of Medicare<br>Part B for everyone. No enrollment necessary; if you have a Social<br>Security Number and are a US citizen, you are covered. All basic<br>healthcare up to a point (we'll get there later) is covered. All doctors<br>are included (if you billed private health insurance before, you bill<br>Medicare now). Obviously, family practice doctors will end up billing<br>Medicare much more than they do now, but that's the way it is. The vast<br>majority of things that family practice doctors do will be covered by<br>Medicare, not by private insurance. No pre-existing conditions, no<br>limitations, no coverage questions. You're all covered, period.<br><br>There will be a line. And yes, that line can move over time. We can move<br>procedures between basic care and specialized care. It can be done.<br><br>Beyond that line is specialized care. It's where specialist doctors<br>live. It's where hospitals and surgeons and complex and costly<br>procedures and advanced diagnostics live. And it's all funded by private<br>health insurance. Everyone can buy private health insurance. Private<br>health insurance will have to work much more like, oh I don't know,<br>*actual insurance* instead of a complex prepayment plan like we have<br>now. And since private health insurance will be paying for much less<br>than it does today, anyone can afford private health insurance. Much<br>like automobile insurance, you can buy private health insurance<br>yourself. Or your employer can pay for a portion of it. I suspect that<br>most employers will continue to provide private insurance to their<br>employees, much as they do today, but without all the complexities they<br>include now. They will be under no obligation to do so, however, because<br>people can buy their own. The cost structure and repayment structure<br>will necessarily become simpler, since again, they're paying for much<br>less than they are today. Again, much like traditional insurance.<br><br>This can be done. The two systems can co-exist. People can afford<br>private insurance. The government can afford to cover all citizens'<br>basic healthcare. If we stick with this idea that it has to be all or<br>nothing, then we'll end up with nothing.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
