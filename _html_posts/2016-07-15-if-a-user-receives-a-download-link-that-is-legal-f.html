<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Usually, whether or not a "link" is legal depends more on the content at<br>the end of the link rather than the link itself. Remember that a hosting<br>company is not liable if a user posts content which he did not have<br>rights to post, so the link itself isn't really relevant. It's more<br>about the content.<br><br>I'm not sure if this is the exact situation you're facing, but we can't<br>talk about legal specifics on Quora anyway. If you have a case specific<br>to one person, you should talk to a lawyer. So let's assume you have<br>a link to some content. You have a purchased license to use that<br>content. The only way that this would be permissible is that you were<br>either provided a link for your own personal use (not to be distributed)<br>or you were somehow given a direct link to the content but you are<br>personally licensed to use the content separate from the link. You share<br>the link to thousands of users. These users do not have a license to use<br>that content, but through the link, they are able to access and use the<br>content without paying a license fee.<br><br>Sharing the link itself, since it linked directly to licensed content<br>and users could access the content without having to pay, would be a<br>DMCA violation, since you facilitated the distribution of content<br>without the appropriate licensing in place.<br><br>In either case, you as the distributor of the link would not be the<br>target of the content owner's legal action; it would be the hosting<br>facility since they provided unfettered access to licensed content<br>without restriction. The hosting facility, in turn, would provide the<br>original poster of the content, since that would be the person who is<br>ultimately responsible for posting licensed content to a distribution<br>site without authorization to do so. While you do certainly share<br>liability for the unlawful distribution of the licensed content, you<br>aren't likely to be the first target of the content owner; it will be<br>the hosting site which is allowing full access to the content itself.<br>The content owner will issue a DMCA take down notice to the hosting<br>provider, which will take the content offline.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
