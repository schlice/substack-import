<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Why is Donald Trump blocking the full release of the Mueller Report<br>that allegedly exonerates him?**<br><br>Why *should* the President have to resort to Executive Privilege in<br>order to prevent Congress from forcing his Attorney General to violate<br>the law?<br><br>He shouldn't. He shouldn't have to.<br><br>But in this case, Congress doesn't care. They want to use their subpoena<br>power to run roughshod over the law. And they wouldn't wait for more<br>negotiations before holding the AG in contempt.<br><br>So the President did the only thing he could in order to ensure that the<br>law was followed: he asserted Executive Privilege over the full,<br>unredacted report.<br><br>Remember that Barr already released a redacted report, which he was<br>under no legal obligation to do, but because of the intense public<br>interest in the results of the Mueller investigation, he did. Remember<br>too that only 8% of the report was redacted for various reasons.<br><br>But that wasn't good enough for House Democrats.<br><br>Barr offered to show a "less-redacted" version to a closed session of<br>the House Judiciary Committee, only leaving redacted the parts required<br>by law to redact.<br><br>But that wasn't good enough for House Democrats, either. They *insisted*<br>on the full, unredacted report, *along with Mueller's investigation<br>notes, which are confidential for the Department of Justice.*<br><br>Yes, Congress has oversight authority. But **the branches of government<br>are co-equal.** Congress has no authority to *demand* anything of the<br>Attorney General, unless the law allows it.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
