<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Why are "reparations" necessary when the legal process was faithfully<br>and dutifully executed using all available evidence at the time?<br><br>If we convict someone of a crime in 1990, then in 1990 we had enough<br>evidence to prove that the defendant was guilty beyond a reasonable<br>doubt. If we come back years later with new technology (such as DNA)<br>which proves that a convict did not commit the crime for which he was<br>convicted, does that fact alone say that there was malicious intent in<br>the original conviction? The fact that newly discovered evidence<br>provides reasonable doubt that was not present at the time of trial is<br>not a fault of the jury, nor of the state. They did their jobs.<br><br>Perhaps the Governor will write a letter and apologize for the wrong<br>conviction, and will praise the justice system for its "persistence" in<br>"eventually getting it right."<br><br>(EDIT) So I did a little research, and it does appear that some states<br>have compensation laws which allow the wrongly convicted to receive some<br>remuneration for their time spent in prison. The federal compensation<br>law allows for \$50,000 for every year spent, or \$100,000 for every<br>year spent on death row. Some states' compensation laws require that the<br>defendant "did not contribute to his own conviction," so for example, if<br>a defendant pleaded guilty, or falsely confessed, they would not be able<br>to collect. Rebecca Brown, Director on State Policy Reform for the<br>Innocence Project, says that nearly 30% of all DNA exonerations resulted<br>from someone who pleaded guilty or falsely confessed, and that number is<br>on the rise.<br><br>For states without such statutes, the wrongly convicted generally cannot<br>sue the city/county/state for wrongful conviction, since the conviction<br>was not wrongful at the time. They do have a few options, although slim:<br>they can attempt to sue the city/county/state on civil rights charges,<br>but that requires records of official misconduct which led to a<br>constitutional rights violation, or they could potentially work with the<br>state to get a compensation bill added to state law.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
