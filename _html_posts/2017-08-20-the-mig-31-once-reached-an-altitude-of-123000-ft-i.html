<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The problem with the argument is that the questioner assumes we need a<br>replacement for the SR-71.<br><br>While the MiG-31 could do something similar in flight characteristics to<br>the SR-71 (albeit for a very short time and with great risk to the<br>airframe and pilot), not even the SR-71 performs that mission anymore.<br>It has been supplanted by *satellite* data. Over time, flying a<br>satellite is much cheaper than flying a SR-71.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
