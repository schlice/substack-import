Even people that<br>you wouldn't expect can be saved. Just look at the Bible. Even the<br>criminal who was crucified beside Jesus was saved. He saved prostitutes<br>and thieves.<br><br>And the one thing they had in common was a repentant heart and a willing<br>spirit. They had *faith*, and their faith in Christ was what saved them.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Would God ever reject someone who wants to be saved?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
