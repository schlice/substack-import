<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Who told you that you suffer from an autoimmune disease MS?<br><br>So my journey to determine that I had an autoimmune disease went this<br>way:<br><br>I had a bout of optic neuritis. My ophthalmologist (wow, I spelled<br>that right the first time), who did a study on this in the 80s, told me<br>than in 50% of patients, idiopathic optic neuritis has no cause, and in<br>the other 50%, it is caused by MS. He then told me I should return to my<br>primary care physician to request an MRI of the brain to check for<br>signs of MS.<br><br>I did this, and my doctor called me back and told me I should find a<br>good neurologist because my MRI (as read by the radiologist)<br>showed all the signs of someone with MS.<br><br>I made an appointment with the MS center and saw a neurologist who<br>confirmed that my history, my test results, and my physical neurological<br>exam all pointed to the fact that I have MS.<br><br>I know what you're thinking (plus, I read your profile). *In that whole<br>list of doctors, there's no immunologist (or more specifically,<br>rheumatologist, who deals with autoimmune conditions) in that list of<br>doctors. Why would a neurologist handle an autoimmune disorder???*<br><br>While it is true that MS is an autoimmune disease, **there is no<br>biomarker that a rheumatologist can look for in order to diagnose it**.<br>It can only be diagnosed through **physical exams and diagnostic tests,<br>such as an MRI. There is no blood test which can diagnose MS**. Since<br>the physical symptoms are all related specifically to the disease's<br>effects on the Central Nervous System (CNS), and the treatment focuses<br>around those symptoms, the most appropriate medical discipline to manage<br>multiple sclerosis is the neurologist.<br><br>So I had a quorum of medical professionals who each added to the body of<br>evidence needed to reach the diagnosis of MS: an ophthalmologist, a<br>primary care physician, a neurologist, and a radiologist.<br><br>More specifically, rheumatologists primarily deal with autoimmune<br>diseases which affect the musculoskeletal system directly, such as<br>rheumatoid arthritis, Lupus, and Sj”ßgren's syndrome. Immunologists,<br>while specializing in diseases affecting the immune system, don't<br>routinely handle MS, as they are more focused on allergies and immune<br>responses to them, including primary immunodeficiency disorders. MS is<br>an "immune-mediated inflammatory disease," which means that the primary<br>etiology of the disease is unknown, but we know its effects:<br>inflammation of nerve fibers. This primary symptom (which causes the<br>secondary symptoms which characterize the disease) are best treated by a<br>neurologist. MS is not an "immunodeficiency" which would be treated by<br>an immunologist. It is an autoimmune disease primarily affecting the<br>CNS. To that end, it does not squarely fall in the bucket of either the<br>rheumatologist or the immunologist.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
