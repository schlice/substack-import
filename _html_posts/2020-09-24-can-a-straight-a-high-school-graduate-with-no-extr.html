Work experience and<br>> achievements while at college are also relevant to your<br>> application.\[1\](#KbWSp){#cite-KbWSp .citation_link}<br><br>If you want to go the enlisted route, you can participate in what the<br>Air Force calls the ***Leadership Encouraging Airman Development (LEAD)<br>Program.***<br><br>LEAD is "an ongoing effort to give our best and brightest Airmen (Active<br>Duty, Reserve and National Guard Airmen) the opportunity to excel by<br>offering them appointments to the U.S. Air Force Academy and the Academy<br>Prep School. This program delegates authority to unit commanders to<br>identify outstanding and deserving Airmen with officer potential for<br>this commissioning program."\[2\](#EcRFD){#cite-EcRFD .citation_link}<br><br>Once you arrive at your first duty station, inform your commander that<br>your goal is to get into the service academy of your choice. Tell him or<br>her that you'll do whatever it takes to accomplish that goal, then<br>*listen to the advice they give you, and* *follow it.* You will have<br>an ally in your corner, and if you do well and show potential, your<br>commander can recommend you for the LEAD program.<br><br>Regardless of the route you go, don't forget the Academy eligibility<br>requirements:<br><br>- Be a U.S. citizen or be able to obtain citizenship before entry into<br>  the Academy.<br>- Be 17 years of age for direct entry but not have reached your 23rd<br>  birthday by July 1 of year of entry.<br>- Be 17 years of age for prep school but not have reached your 22nd<br>  birthday by July 1 of year of entry.<br>- Be unmarried.<br>- Bear no legal obligation to support a child or other individual.<br>- Not be pregnant.<br>- Be of high moral character.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-KbWSp){.citation_index} [[College Students \| U.S. Air<br>Force<br>Academy](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=14bbdc&url=https://www.academyadmissions.com/prepare/college-students/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="academyadmissions.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>\[2\](#cite-EcRFD){.citation_index} [[Enlisted Airmen \| U.S. Air<br>Force<br>Academy](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=1ed236&url=https://www.academyadmissions.com/prepare/enlisted/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="academyadmissions.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
