<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>In just comparing the two devices, I'd definitely go for the Le Max. The<br>Xperia is a good phone but it is way overpriced for what you get.<br><br>The Le Max is also a little pricey (the 128 GB version is expected to<br>retail in India for Rs. 36,999, or roughly USD \$518), but<br>comparatively, for 128GB of built-in RAM, that's a good price. Plus the<br>long litany of features that are packed into this phone is quite<br>impressive:<br><br>- 6.33-inch QHD (1440x2560 pixels) display, 464ppi and 0.8mm bezel<br>- 64-bit 2GHz octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 SoC and 4GB of LPDDR4<br>  RAM<br>- 21-megapixel rear camera with optical image stabilization featuring a<br>  Sony IMX230 sensor, dual-LED flash, and an f/2.0 aperture lens<br>- 4-megapixel front-facing camera with an f/2.0 aperture<br>- fingerprint sensor<br>- 3400mAh battery<br>- Wi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac with hotspot support and Wi-Fi Display<br>  connectivity<br>- Bluetooth 4.1 with APT-X support<br>- GPS, A-GPS, NFC, and 4G LTE connectivity<br>- infrared (IR) remote control<br>- An array of sensors including an electronic compass, hall sensors,<br>  gyroscope, gravity sensor, proximity sensor and ambient light sensor<br>- USB 2.0 Type-C port and MHL 2.0<br><br>For the price, I think you're getting a good phone in the Le Max.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
