<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Depending on how you interpret your question, you\'re<br>either correct in your assumption, or you\'re way off base.\<br>\<br>Assuming that you think that the military would be a precursor to gang<br>membership, not likely. Break the rules in a gang and you are beaten<br>half to death as your \"don\'t-do-it-again\" warning. Do it again and<br>the gang finishes the job. The discipline in a gang is far more brutal<br>than the discipline in the military. If someone joins the military and<br>then decides, \"yeah, this just isn\'t enough discipline for me, I\'m<br>going over to a gang,\" that\'s not a result of a failure of military<br>discipline.\<br>\<br>If a military member moves to a gang, it\'s more likely that he has a<br>connection with someone already in the gang, and they bring him on board<br>with lures of money or prestige in the community. You don\'t get many<br>blind converts directly out of military service who just got bored with<br>the discipline in the military.\<br>\<br>You may have also meant that the military can be an alternative to<br>joining a gang. While this also sends the wrong message about the<br>military, it is true that the discipline offered by the military is an<br>alternative to the discipline offered by a gang. That said, the military<br>is not the \"national halfway house\" that you make it out to be. If<br>your choices are \"gang or military\" you\'re going to be very<br>disappointed with the military. Gang service is very selfish; gang<br>members are out for themselves or for the betterment of the gang.<br>Military members have a service ethic (a \"heart for service\") that<br>gang members do not. Military members willingly put themselves in harms<br>way to defend the freedoms that you and I enjoy on a daily basis. The<br>world is a much safer place because our military is on watch. The<br>military person gives his life in the defense of others, and in defense<br>of the Constitution. They are out there protecting and defending our way<br>of life. This is a far different motivation than a gang which is out<br>there defending their own \"honor\".\<br>\<br>So while it\'s true that both the military and a street gang are groups<br>that use discipline and promote discipline, they are for starkly<br>different reasons and one has far more altruistic motivations than the<br>other.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
