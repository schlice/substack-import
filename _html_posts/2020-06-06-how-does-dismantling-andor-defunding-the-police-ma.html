<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>How does dismantling and/or defunding the police make any sense?<br><br>It doesn't. The people championing this position are either uninformed,<br>or are willfully anti-authority, of any kind. Maybe even a little bit of<br>both.<br><br>The way we change the behavior of police officers is the same way we<br>change the behavior of criminals. Remove the motive.<br><br>For example, if I'm a purse snatcher, and I work in an area where I have<br>a guaranteed force monopoly (i.e. people are not allowed to carry guns),<br>I can make a good living snatching purses and there's little chance I'm<br>going to face any resistance, armed or otherwise. Even if there's a 1 in<br>100 chance that I run into a woman who is a black belt in multiple forms<br>and she beats the snot out of me, for a 1 in 100 chance, I'm still<br>clearing a large, tax-free salary.<br><br>But what if I allow firearms and now 50% of purse-carrying women are<br>armed? Now there's a 50% chance that I'm going to grab a purse and<br>die. Now, it's no longer profitable to be a purse snatcher, so I<br>stop.<br><br>So what is it that makes it "profitable" for a racist cop to exist?<br>Protection from prosecution.<br><br>We have to revamp the doctrine of *qualified immunity*.<br><br>We have to make it so that we can disallow qualified immunity in<br>specific cases where it is clear that misconduct took place, either<br>willful or ignorant misconduct.<br><br>> An ideologically diverse collection of organizations---including the<br>> ACLU, the Cato Institute, and the Law Enforcement Action<br>> Partnership---have submitted multiple amicus briefs to the Supreme<br>> Court, describing a "cross-ideological consensus that this Court's<br>> qualified immunity doctrine under 42 U.S.C. 1983 misunderstands that<br>> statute and its common-law backdrop, denies justice to victims of<br>> egregious constitutional violations, and fails to provide<br>> accountability for official wrongdoing."\[1\](#ydpRL){#cite-ydpRL<br>> .citation_link}<br><br>This is the time for the court to either severely revamp, or perhaps<br>eliminate, the doctrine of qualified immunity. The net effect of this<br>for police officers is that civil rights violation suits (which seems to<br>be the biggest issue today) would increase, and the focus of those<br>investigations would get back to what it is supposed to be about:<br>determining whether or not police officers exceeded their Constitutional<br>authority. But it wouldn't change Constitutional *protections*, it would<br>only allow courts to review these cases without being barred by<br>qualified immunity.<br><br>In essence, every action a police officer takes will have to be taken<br>knowing that he could face a civil rights case, and his defense had<br>better be spot on. Causing an officer to pause shouldn't have a chilling<br>effect on law enforcement, because it doesn't change Constitutional<br>protections at all. It only allows civil rights cases to move forward<br>instead of simply failing at pre-trial motions. It allows courts to do<br>what they are designed to do, and allows civil rights actions to be<br>properly adjudicated.<br><br>That's a good start.<br><br>\<br><br>*Sorry, no comments on this one.*<br><br>*If you don\'t like what I wrote, tough shit. If my answer is<br>grammatically low-quality or is un-cited opinion masquerading as fact,<br>downvote it. If you think I\'m wrong, write your own answer. But Quora<br>is a question-and-answer site, not a debate site. If you were simply<br>going to comment to tell me \"ackshually, you\'re wrong,\" then you're<br>the reason why I disable comments. Well done, Karen.
