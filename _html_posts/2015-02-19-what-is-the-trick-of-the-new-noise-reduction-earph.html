<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [The headphones that are included with your phone are<br>trying to strike a balance between \"decent earbuds\" and \"the least<br>expensive option we can bundle in with the phone.\"\<br>\<br>These particular headphones use a noise reduction technique called<br>\"noise-isolation,\" as opposed to the more sophisticated<br>\"noise-cancelling\" method.\<br>\<br>Noise-isolating headphones aim to block the entire ear canal and fill it<br>with rubber. Your headphones pictured use silicone rubber earpieces to<br>close out the entire ear canal to isolate the ear canal. That way, there<br>isn\'t any foamy earpad that allows sound to get in, and you get a good<br>fit with the rubber buds fully enclosing the ear canal. These work best<br>when pressed into the outer part of the ear canal.\<br>\<br>Noise-cancelling headphones are different. They use external microphones<br>that listen to waveforms that exist outside the headphones, and they<br>broadcast an equal but opposite waveform into the audio path, which<br>effectively cancels out the external noise. Noise-cancelling earbuds are<br>identified by external battery packs, an on-off switch, and usually an<br>indicator light of some sort, as well as microphones near the buds<br>themselves (to listen to the outside noise). Prices vary depending on<br>additional features. An example of these would be these Audio-Technica<br>ATH-ANC3 noise-cancelling earbuds:\<br>\<br>]<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-7a712c3767dedd5b7da96f439a31e5f3){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-7a712c3767dedd5b7da96f439a31e5f3" master_w="485"<br>master_h="326"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>\<br>\<br>You might want to look for more \"active\" earbuds, like these Philips<br>ActionFit earbuds, which have a built-in earhook:\<br>\<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-a386397065109eccb4332eed0fe3fe2e){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-a386397065109eccb4332eed0fe3fe2e" master_w="300"<br>master_h="300"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>Earbuds like these are extremely comfortable to wear and won\'t fall out<br>during activity. They still use the small rubber earpieces which sit<br>just inside the ear canal, so they still are noise-isolating, but these<br>are far less likely to fall out of your ears. As a matter of fact, once<br>you seat these, really the only way to get them off is to take them off.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
