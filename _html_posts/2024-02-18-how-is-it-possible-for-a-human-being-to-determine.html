<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The answer for God's omniscience is found in the fact that **He exists<br>outside of time.**<br><br>Remember that God created time, so He exists outside of time. What does<br>that mean? Does that mean that He can freely travel through time? No,<br>not at all. It means that God exists *at all times simultaneously.* The<br>concept of time does not apply to God as He exists outside of time.<br><br>Therefore, for God, everything is now. The past is now. The<br>present is now. The future is now. God sees the assassination of<br>JFK at the exact same now that He sees the assassination of Abraham<br>Lincoln and you reading about it in this answer on your screen. It's all<br>now to Him, even though for you, it is the past and the present. And<br>everything which will happen in your future is also *now* to God, even<br>though you cannot see the future, even though you retain the power to<br>change the future.<br><br>Your free will and your ability to make choices are also functions of<br>the fact that you exist subject to time. In other words, you can only<br>choose one course of action over the other (freely, without coercion)<br>because you have arrived at a decision point in your timeline. Which<br>path you choose is 100% up to you, but God sees your decision point, and<br>the time thereafter, because for Him, they are all now.<br><br>For you, this moment in time is now. For God, *every moment in time*<br>is now.<br><br>So God is omniscient because He is not subject to time.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
