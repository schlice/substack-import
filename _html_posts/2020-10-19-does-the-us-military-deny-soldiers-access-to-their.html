<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Does the US military deny soldiers access to their own money?<br><br>No. Not ever.<br><br>Once you are paid, the money is yours. The military can only intercept<br>money with a court order (i.e. you are a criminal and a portion of your<br>wages have been garnished), and it is done *before* the member is paid.<br>Once you have been paid, the money is in the bank and the military has<br>no say in what happens to it after that.<br><br>If someone is telling you that the military is denying them access to<br>their money and they need your help, they are a scammer trying to scam<br>you out of your money. Do not ever send money to anyone claiming to be<br>in the US Armed Forces for any reason.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
