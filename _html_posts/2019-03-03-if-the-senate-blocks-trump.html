<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>This vote would be a perfect opportunity for any enterprising Senator to<br>play to his or her base and virtue signal like there\'s no tomorrow.<br><br>Why? Because even if they do pass a joint resolution to end the national<br>emergency, Trump will veto it, and Congress would need a 2/3 majority in<br>both Houses to override it.<br><br>They may get enough votes to pass a joint resolution, but they do not<br>have a veto-proof majority. So it\'s perfectly safe to pass a resolution<br>and play to your home crowd.<br><br>Nothing is going to change.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
