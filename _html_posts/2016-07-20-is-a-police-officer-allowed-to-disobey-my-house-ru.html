<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>It depends on a few things.<br><br>First, did you call them? If you called them and then you're refusing to<br>let them into your home, they will likely turn around and leave.<br><br>If you didn't call them, what they do will depend on whether or not<br>*exigent circumstances* exist. Exigent circumstances allow police to<br>break open doors and enter spaces which would normally require a warrant<br>if they believe that a person's life is in danger. If exigent<br>circumstances exist, I'm going in. Period. We can discuss your religious<br>requirements later.<br><br>If I am there because I need to question you, I can either go into your<br>house, or we can go down to the police station to get questioned. Your<br>choice.<br><br>For me, for the third circumstance (I'm questioning you at your home, no<br>exigent circumstances exist), I happen to carry a pair of shoe covers in<br>my cargo pocket, the same kinds of shoe covers that most professionals<br>who frequently enter homes will carry and use in lieu of removing their<br>shoes. Some people dislike shoes in their house because of sanitary, not<br>religious, reasons, and sometimes this is acceptable to people. If<br>you're concerned about my shoes in your house, your choice is that I put<br>my shoe covers on and I come in your house, or I take you down to the<br>station to question you. Your choice.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
