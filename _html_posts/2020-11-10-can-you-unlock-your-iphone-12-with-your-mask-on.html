<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Can you unlock your iPhone 12 with your mask on?<br><br>There's a fair chance that Face ID will fail, even with your mask on.<br>However, you can set up an *Alternative appearance* in Face ID while<br>using your mask, in the same way that you can configure Face ID to<br>recognize you with or without glasses, facial hair, makeup, different<br>hairstyles, or with other different looks<br><br>Try this:<br><br>> 1.  Open the Settings app on your iPhone or iPad Pro and tap "Face ID<br>>     & Passcode". Enter your passcode if prompted.<br>> 2.  Tap "Set Up an Alternative Appearance".<br>> 3.  Fold your mask in half and use it to cover one side of your face<br>>     while following the on-screen instructions.<br>> 4.  If your device warns that your face is obstructed, move the mask<br>>     slightly further away from the center of your face.<br>> 5.  Follow the setup process by moving your head in a circle. You'll<br>>     be asked to complete the process once more -- continue to hold the<br>>     mask in the same position and on the same side of your face.<br>> 6.  Once the two Face ID scans are complete, put your mask on, and try<br>>     to unlock your device. If it works, great! If not, go through the<br>>     setup again.\[1\](#ajHnn){#cite-ajHnn .citation_link}<br><br>If that fails, you can try resetting Face ID and setting it up again.<br>This time, do the folded mask trick the first time through, then set up<br>an Alternative appearance **with your folded mask on the other side of<br>your face.** Some have found success doing this.<br><br>If neither of these methods are successful, you're probably not going to<br>be able to unlock your phone using your face while you wear a mask.<br>Don't forget to reset Face ID and re-enable it without a mask, and then<br>just enter your passcode to unlock your phone when your mask is on.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-ajHnn){.citation_index} [[How to Use Face ID with a Face<br>Mask on iPhone &<br>iPad](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=71da8b&url=https://osxdaily.com/2020/08/10/use-face-id-with-mask-iphone-ipad/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="osxdaily.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
