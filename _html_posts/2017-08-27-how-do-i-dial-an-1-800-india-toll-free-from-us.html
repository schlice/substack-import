<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>In general, when calling from an international source, you cannot use an<br>800 service.<br><br>When you make a phone call, normally it is the caller who pays for the<br>call. In an 800 service, the called party pays for the call. That's why<br>the call is known as "toll-free." It's only toll free for the caller.<br>The called party pays a fee to use an 800-service number.<br><br>That fee does not include paying the cost for international calls.<br><br>Therefore, companies expecting calls from international callers will<br>also post a traditional area code and telephone number which can be<br>called by traditional international callers, who will pay for their own<br>call.<br><br>If you're trying to reach a company, check their website to find their<br>international direct dial number.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
