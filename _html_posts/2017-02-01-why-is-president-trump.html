<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>There are so many emotions surrounding this issue, and there is such<br>mis-characterization of the order in the media and in social media, that<br>it's hard to separate the truth from the actual wording of the order<br>itself. So I'll give you the actual reasons behind the order, and<br>separate some of the facts from the hypocritical and hyperbolic<br>rhetoric.<br><br>Also note that the order was in several parts, and many of the parts of<br>the order are being conflated and mis-characterized. The first part of<br>the order is regarding immigrants and non-immigrants from seven Middle<br>Eastern countries. The second part of the order is regarding all<br>refugees, and the third part is regarding refugees from Syria. While<br>many characterizations about the orders have been given, the whole<br>purpose of the order is really only about *vetting*. Vetting is what<br>we do when someone wants to come into this country, either as an<br>immigrant, a non-immigrant (a tourist), or a refugee. We contact the<br>originating country through diplomatic channels to get more information<br>about the person trying to come into this country. The originating<br>country gives us information about the person: are they who they claim<br>to be, what sorts of troubles have they gotten themselves into in their<br>source nation, have they participated in any terror-related activities,<br>etc. You know, trying to figure out whether or not the person is a good<br>guy or a bad guy.<br><br>Here's the details about the order, because you probably don't know:<br><br>1.  It imposes a temporary 90-day suspension on immigrants and<br>    non-immigrants (tourists) from seven Middle-Eastern countries: Iraq,<br>    Syria, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen. The media loves to<br>    mis-characterize this order as "seven majority Muslim countries"<br>    making this order appear to be about religion.\<br>    \<br>    This order has nothing to do with religion.\<br>    \<br>    If it did, then why are there at least 40 other "majority Muslim"<br>    countries which are *not* included on the list?\<br>    \<br>    When we vet people to grant visas, we contact the originating<br>    country to get that vetting information, as I explained above.<br>    *These seven countries give us* *nothing**.* We have no<br>    information to go on in order to determine whether or not these<br>    people are even who they say they are! We can't even prove their<br>    identities. Previously, we just *let them in.* These seven countries<br>    are either in the middle of jihadist wars, being torn apart by<br>    jihadist violence, or are controlled by hostile, jihadist<br>    governments, and are entirely uncooperative with us. That's why they<br>    are on the list and other countries are not.\<br>    \<br>    So we are *temporarily* suspending immigration from these<br>    countries for 90 days. This gives us time to review whether or not<br>    we are getting anything from these countries at all, make sure we<br>    advise these countries what we need from them, and then decide<br>    whether or not we can proceed with continuing to allow immigration<br>    into this country from those nations. Maybe if they want to continue<br>    to allow people to leave their nation and become US citizens, they<br>    will start sharing information with us.\<br>    \<br>    Additionally, this order gives the Secretaries of State and Homeland<br>    Security the power to issue visas or other immigration benefits when<br>    it is in the national interest. So those translators from Iraq who<br>    risked their lives to help us? Already approved. And those<br>    green-card holders caught in transit? Already approved.\<br>    \<br>    We already know that terrorists are trying to infiltrate the ranks<br>    of immigrants and refugees. We know that terrorists from Somalia<br>    have already infiltrated the ranks of immigrants and have launched<br>    jihadist attacks right here in America, and have done so in Europe<br>    as well. Clearly, our current approach is inadequate.\<br>    \<br>    I do think the order went a little far in including green card<br>    holders, but let's be clear, it is not unconstitutional. While a<br>    green card holder may have already gone through many rounds of<br>    vetting, they are not US citizens. Green card or not, they have<br>    no right to enter this country at any time they choose. Only<br>    citizens can do that. Therefore, the ban can legally extend to them,<br>    and it is not unconstitutional. However, it does violate the spirit<br>    of the order, which is why it is being largely rolled back.<br>2.  The order temporarily stops refugee admissions for 120 days so<br>    we can improve the vetting process, and then caps the amount of<br>    refugees at 50,000 per year. ONLY 50,000? That's inhumane!!! Well<br>    hold up there over-reactor: 50,000 is right in between refugee<br>    admissions from Bush's two terms, and Obama's two terms. In 2002, we<br>    only admitted roughly 27,000 refugees. Obama, at his height, had the<br>    cap at 70,000. So Trump's 50,000 is a rough average between Bush and<br>    Obama, and he's improving security screening at the same time. If<br>    you are actually able to separate your emotions from your logic,<br>    this is actually a very middle-of-the-road approach.<br>3.  Finally, there is an indefinite hold on refugees from Syria until we<br>    can be sure that our vetting process is actually working. This is<br>    mostly a return to Obama's refugee policy on Syria from 2011<br>    to 2014. For all of you complaining that this is unprecedented,<br>    until 2016, this was actually the Obama administration's policy on<br>    Syrian refugees. In 2011, we let in exactly 29 refugees from Syria.<br>    2012? 31. In 2013, it was 36. 2014 saw 105, and in 2015, we let in<br>    1682 refugees. All with little to no vetting.<br><br>Finally, there's quite a lot of outrage over the directive to<br>"prioritize refugee claims made by individuals on the basis of<br>religious-based persecution, provided that the religion of the<br>individual is a minority religion in the individual's country of<br>nationality." What this government legal-speak means is that when we do<br>start allowing refugees back in in a few months, people who are of<br>"minority religions" in the country from which they came may go to the<br>head of the line.<br><br>Whether or not there was religious profiling during the Obama<br>administration is certainly a matter for debate, but since this isn't a<br>debate (it's an answer), I'm simply going to focus on the actual order.<br>So does it violate the Constitution to use religion as a test to allow<br>refugees? Does it violate the law?<br><br>No and no.<br><br>In fact, the term "refugee," according to the law, means, "(A). Any<br>person who is outside of any country of such person's nationality ...<br>and who is unable or unwilling to return to ... that country because of<br>persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of ...<br>religion...". There are, of course, other things that could cause a fear<br>of persecution, but clearly, religion is one of them.<br><br>Therefore, it is right for us to determine whether or not religious<br>persecution is taking place in the country of the refugee's nationality,<br>and also determine if the person is fearful of returning because of<br>religious persecution. Determining if the person is part of the<br>religious minority is part of that vetting. If a person is claiming<br>religious persecution, we are well within our rights as a nation to<br>determine if that's true.<br><br>We know that terrorists are seeking to strike through the refugee<br>population. We know that they have already succeeded both here and<br>abroad. And you can read through the entire text of the order, and you<br>won't find a single reference in there to a Muslim ban. None. Zero. The<br>order isn't a betrayal of American values. As long as it is applied<br>correctly, it can be the start of new policies that protect our nation<br>and still allow for the preservation of national friendships and<br>cooperation, and still allow for us to be compassionate national<br>neighbors.<br><br>*(I do apologize, but because this is such a highly-charged emotional<br>issue for some, I am forced to disable comments. If you have a differing<br>opinion, you're welcome to answer the question yourself.)*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
