<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>As of April 8, 2024, there are 15 states which completely ban abortion<br>at all stages, with very limited exceptions.<br><br>As of April 8, 2024, Georgia and Florida are the only states which ban<br>abortion after only six weeks of pregnancy. Other limited abortion<br>states include North Carolina, Utah, Nebraska, and Arizona, but they are<br>all somewhere between six and fifteen weeks.<br><br>[https://states.guttmacher.org/po\...(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=60e836&url=https://states.guttmacher.org/policies/georgia/abortion-policies){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="guttmacher.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>Florida is unique because their state supreme court upheld the<br>constitutionality of a 15-week ban, but the state passed a 6-week ban<br>which would only go into effect if and when the state supreme court<br>found that the 15-week ban was constitutional.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
