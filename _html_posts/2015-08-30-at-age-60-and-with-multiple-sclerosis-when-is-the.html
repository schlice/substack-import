<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [When you decide that living your life medicine-free is<br>worth the relapses.\<br>\<br>On average, without medicine, the disease progresses from RRMS<br>(Relapsing Remitting MS to Secondary Progressive MS) in 10 years.<br>Progressive forms of the disease (except for Progressive Relapsing MS)<br>show continuous worsening of symptoms with little sign of relapse or<br>remission.\<br>\<br>So if you figure that assuming you have 10 years before your disease<br>changes to SPMS (unless you were diagnosed at age 60, you likely have<br>fewer, but we\'ll use 10 as the high baseline), you have to be willing<br>to say that at age 70, you can live with progressive MS. If your legs<br>get weak enough, you may be wheelchair-bound a short time after that.<br>Hopefully, you won\'t be bedridden while you are still cogent enough to<br>care.\<br>\<br>Is that a risk you are willing to take, knowing that, in actuality, you<br>probably have less time than that before you turn progressive? The<br>decision is yours to make, but I would consider the timeframes carefully<br>before making it.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
