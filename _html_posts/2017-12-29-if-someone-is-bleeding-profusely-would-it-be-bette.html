<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>In terms of first aid, apply a pressure bandage. Hopefully you have some<br>form of clean trauma dressing available to you; if not, use whatever is<br>the cleanest and whitest dressing you have available. Sometimes, this<br>could be a piece of clothing. Back in the 80s, my dad (a retired New<br>York police officer) used his white undershirt as a trauma dressing and<br>saved a young man's life. Note that this is not recommended, but if<br>you're saving a life, you do what you have to do, and you use whatever<br>you have on hand.<br><br>If you still cannot control the bleeding with a pressure bandage, and it<br>is on an extremety, you may also want to apply a *restricting band* to<br>the area in the direction of the heart between the heart and the injury.<br>This will reduce (but not stop!) the blood flow to the affected area and<br>will aid you in controlling the bleeding.<br><br>Hopefully, help arrives before you have to make the fateful decision to<br>apply a tourniquet. If you apply a tourniquet, DO NOT REMOVE IT! Only<br>the doctor should remove a tourniquet. You should only apply a<br>tourniquet to save a life, if blood loss is so severe that not applying<br>a tourniquet would result in death. If you are interested in learning<br>how to apply a tourniquet, I will allow you to Google it yourself. There<br>are a number of details in applying a tourniquet, which is why I don't<br>want to do it the injustice of going over them here. If you're this<br>interested, you might think about taking a First Aid course from the Red<br>Cross.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
