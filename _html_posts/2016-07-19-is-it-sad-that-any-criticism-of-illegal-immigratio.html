<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>That statement doesn't make much sense. If you have to open your<br>commentary with "I'm not a racist, but..." that means you're about to<br>say something racist. That seems pretty cut and dried to me.<br><br>You shouldn't have to preface your concerns with any qualifiers at all.<br>If you pose a legitimate concern with illegal immigration and you are<br>called a "racist" and "anti-immigration," then the problem is with the<br>name-caller, not you. Advocating for measures to stop illegal<br>immigration have nothing at all to do with being "racist" or<br>"anti-immigration." Tropes about how this nation was founded by<br>immigrants are tired and woefully overused.<br><br>If we are to succeed as a nation of laws, we must, first and foremost,<br>enforce our immigration laws. There is no other country on Earth with as<br>lax of an immigration policy and such poor enforcement as our own. And<br>Trump's "playing to the crowd" with the whole "wall" thing doesn't help<br>anyone, either. The largest quantity of illegal immigrants comes from<br>persons overstaying their visas and taking up residence in the country.<br>We are decades behind the times on our immigration system, and tracking<br>these people is only getting harder and harder to do. And with no<br>political will (currently) to actually follow up on these visa<br>over-stayers, or to put the money into USCBP and ICE that is needed to<br>update and modernize their operations, little will be done.<br><br>The floodgates are currently wide open, but Trump shouldn't be staring<br>so hard at Mexico; he should be looking at the US government.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
