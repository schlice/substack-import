<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Can multiple sclerosis cause strange sensations in the head?<br><br>[[Erica<br>Friedman](https://www.quora.com/profile/Erica-Friedman)]{.qlink_container}<br>is, as always, spot on.<br><br>The short answer is we don't know. The longer answer is *it could,<br>but you need a neurologist to confirm*.<br><br>No two people who get MS will experience it in exactly the same way.<br>Everyone's MS is different, and even for people who have the same<br>symptoms, they will experience those symptoms differently. For example,<br>let's say Erica and I both experience fatigue (a common MS symptom, also<br>called MS Lassitude). She may experience her fatigue constantly<br>throughout the day as a persistent weight on her body, while I may<br>experience it as getting hit by a freight train at night that I better<br>be near a bed because I'm goin' down and nothing is going to stop me<br>from going to sleep.<br><br>So could your "strange sensations in your head" be MS-related? Yes, it<br>could, but you need a neurologist to help you diagnose what *else* could<br>cause those symptoms before MS is declared the cause. MS is a diagnosis<br>of exclusion, as every symptom caused by MS can also be caused by other<br>diseases or conditions. You must rule out all other causes before you<br>can say that any particular symptom is caused by MS. In general, you<br>need a neurologist's help to do that, either through physical exam, or<br>through blood tests or other diagnostic testing.<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*This answer is not professional medical advice**, nor is it a<br>substitute for professional medical advice.
