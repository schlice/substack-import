<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Philosophy undergirds science, and philosophy undergirds theology. You<br>can't truly understand science or theology without understanding<br>philosophy.<br><br>Why?<br><br>Science and theology *rely* on philosophy. Bad philosophy results in<br>bad science, and good science requires good philosophy. Why? Because:<br><br>1. Science cannot be done without philosophy. Philosophical<br>assumptions are utilized in the search for causes, and, therefore,<br>cannot be the result of them. For example, scientists assume (by faith)<br>that reason and the scientific method allow us to accurately understand<br>the world around us. That cannot be proven by science itself. You can't<br>prove the tools of science---the laws of logic, the Law of Causality,<br>the Principle of Uniformity, or the reliability of observation---by<br>running some kind of experiment. You have to assume those things are<br>true in order to *do* the experiment! So science is built on philosophy.<br>Unfortunately, many so-called scientists are very poor philosophers.<br><br>**2. Philosophical assumptions can dramatically impact scientific<br>conclusions.** If a scientist assumes beforehand that only natural<br>causes are possible, then probably no amount of evidence will convince<br>him that intelligence created the first one-celled amoeba or any other<br>designed entity. When Darwinists *presuppose* that intelligent causes<br>are impossible, then natural laws are the only game in town. Likewise,<br>if a creationist rules out natural causes beforehand (and we don't know<br>of any who do), then he also risks missing the right answer. But a<br>scientist who is *open-minded* to both natural and intelligent causes<br>can follow the evidence wherever it leads. In other words, scientists<br>who are poor philosophers will also be poor scientists.<br><br>3. *Science* doesn't really say anything---*scientists*<br>do. Data are always interpreted by scientists. When those scientists<br>let their personal preferences or unproven philosophical assumptions<br>dictate their interpretation of the evidence, they do exactly what they<br>accuse religious people of doing---they let their ideology dictate their<br>conclusions. When that's the case, their conclusions should be<br>questioned, because they may be nothing more than philosophical<br>presuppositions passed off as scientific facts.<br><br>\<br><br>In the same way, the study of theology implies the study of things which<br>cannot be proven by science. An invisible, immaterial God cannot be<br>scientifically proven, because He exists outside of the physical.<br>Science can never prove the existence of God.<br><br>The only way we can have any understanding of God is through logic and<br>reason, not through testing or observation. Therefore, a good study of<br>theology requires a good foundation in philosophy. Now, does this mean<br>you can't know God or love God without studying philosophy? Not at all.<br>But we're talking about *studying* theology, not knowing or loving God.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
