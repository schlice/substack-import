<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>MS is a disease by which the immune system malfunctions and attacks the<br>myelin sheath surrounding nerve fibers. This is a process called<br>demyelination.<br><br>What is left following this process of demyelination are scars or<br>plaques called scleroses, composed mainly of cholesterol, past which<br>nerve signals do not pass effectively. This degraded transmission of<br>nerve signals is the primary driver of MS symptoms.<br><br>The name "multiple sclerosis" literally means "many scars."<br><br>It would be extremely rare to have a single scar and experience a<br>noticeable symptom. Symptoms occur because of a group of scars in one<br>particular area. Nearly everyone who has MS has more than one scar.<br>Indeed, each lesion is actually a collection of smaller individual scars<br>on nerve fibers.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
