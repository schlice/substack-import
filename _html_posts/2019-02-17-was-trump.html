Political speech is well<br>established in the law as to be non-impactful on the actual law itself.<br><br>He could have even said that he wants to build a wall to keep brown<br>people out, and that still wouldn't change the legality of the action.<br>Regardless of the feelings on which the law is based, you can only<br>determine the legality of the law by looking at the actual law itself,<br>not any emotions or political speech which spurred it.<br><br>How he socializes the law to people is only a matter of public<br>relations, and not a matter of legal argument.<br><br>Now, if you're asking whether or not emotional appeals are a valid<br>method to gin up support for a policy, I can tell you that they are.<br>People are more guided by emotion than logic these days, so an appeal to<br>emotion definitely carries more weight than one to logic and facts. If<br>you want those, look them up.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
