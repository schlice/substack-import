<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Is recording a conversation in California in a scenario where the<br>participants can\'t expect privacy legal?**<br><br>So it appears you're asking specifically about situations which are<br>not telephone recordings, since there is an expectation of privacy<br>on a telephone call. Phone calls are covered by wiretap laws, and so<br>California's "two party requirement" to record phone calls is in full<br>effect on the phone.<br><br>However, recording conversations that are not over the telephone is<br>a whole different ballgame.<br><br>According to Harvard's Digital Media Law Project:<br><br>> If you are recording someone without their knowledge in a public or<br>> semi-public place like a street or restaurant, the person whom you\'re<br>> recording may or may not have \"an objectively reasonable expectation<br>> that no one is listening in or overhearing the conversation,\" and the<br>> reasonableness of the expectation would depend on the particular<br>> factual circumstances. Therefore, you cannot necessarily assume that<br>> you are in the clear simply because you are in a public place.<br>> \[1\](#oUsnm){#cite-oUsnm .citation_link}<br><br>I would say that this means that if you're a party to the conversation<br>and you're recording it, you *might* be legally okay to use that<br>recording as evidence, but if you're simply *eavesdropping* on a<br>conversation, you would probably not be covered. California enacted some<br>pretty tough anti-paparazzi laws, and they apply to video and audio<br>recordings related to people who are not party to the conversation.<br><br>As you can see, California recording privacy laws are really sketchy and<br>generally favor the rights of the individuals involved over the<br>admissibility of recording evidence. So if you are planning on making an<br>evidentiary recording that would be admissible in court, it would<br>probably be best in any setting to get the consent of everyone being<br>recorded before you start.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-oUsnm){.citation_index} [[Digital Media Law<br>Project](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=559799&url=http://www.dmlp.org/legal-guide/california-recording-law){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="dmlp.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
