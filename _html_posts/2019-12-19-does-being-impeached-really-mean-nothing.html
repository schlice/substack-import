<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Does being impeached really mean nothing?<br><br>Thanks to the current House of Representatives, impeachment means much<br>less than it did before.<br><br>Previously, the bar for impeachment was the commission of a crime.<br><br>Today, any presidential conduct we don't like can be considered an<br>"abuse of power" and can be impeachable.<br><br>Comparing all previous presidents to the current standard, ***every<br>previous president we have ever had in the United States, including<br>George Washington, could have been impeached under this standard.***<br><br>So this House has cheapened impeachment and turned it into exactly the<br>partisan political weapon that Hamilton warned us against in Fed 75. He<br>warned us that impeachment should never turn on solely the party in<br>political power; it should have broad, bipartisan consent before moving<br>forward.<br><br>This House ignored Hamilton's warning, and now, any president can be<br>impeached for maladministration that we call abuse of power.<br><br>Democrats forgot to apply the "other foot test" to this impeachment.<br>When the shoe is on the other foot, will they complain? In other words,<br>when we have a Democrat president and a Republican-controlled House, and<br>we impeach the president for abuse of power, purely along party lines,<br>will they complain?<br><br>I bet they will.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
