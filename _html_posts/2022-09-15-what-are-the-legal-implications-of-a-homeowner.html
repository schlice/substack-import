<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Before we find out whether or not the fines are legal, you must be sure<br>that there is no possible justification at all in the Governing<br>Documents which would give the HOA the authority to levy that fine.<br><br>For example, my HOA includes a provision for their Architectural Review<br>Board indicating that they have the exclusive right to deny any<br>exterior change to your house. This means that it doesn't actually have<br>to be listed in the document for them to deny it. Since they have the<br>exclusive right to deny any exterior change to your home, if you<br>make a change which is specifically not called out in the document, the<br>ARB can still deny it.<br><br>It is your responsibility to make sure that your Governing Documents do<br>not have a "catch-all" phrase like this. There's a good chance that they<br>do, however, so look carefully. This is the clause which gives the ARB<br>the authority to control how the exterior of your house looks, and so<br>it's likely they have such a phrase.<br><br>If you have a real estate attorney in your area who specializes in HOA<br>law, and offers free consultations, you might run the Governing<br>Documents by him or her and ask about the HOA's authority, and ask if<br>you have a case. If he says you don't have a case, be prepared to pay<br>the fines or fix the issue on your home.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>What are the legal implications of a homeowner\'s association (HOA)<br>charging fines for violations that aren\'t specifically listed in their<br>rules or regulations?<br><br>\<br><br>*This answer is not a substitute for professional legal advice or a<br>solicitation to offer legal advice regarding specific facts. This answer<br>is for GENERAL INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. Should you ignore this<br>warning and send specific or confidential information in a private<br>message or post it as a comment, there is no duty to keep that<br>information confidential or to discontinue or forego any representation<br>adverse to your interests. Do not delay or forego seeking legal advice<br>or disregard professional legal advice based on this answer. Seek the<br>advice of a licensed attorney in the appropriate jurisdiction before<br>taking any action that may affect your rights. If you believe you have a<br>claim against someone, consult an attorney immediately, otherwise there<br>is a risk that the time allotted to bring your claim may expire.*<br><br>*Quora users who provide responses to legal questions are intended<br>third-party beneficiaries with certain rights under Quoras* [[*Terms of<br>Service*](https://www.quora.com/about/tos)]{.qlink_container}*.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
