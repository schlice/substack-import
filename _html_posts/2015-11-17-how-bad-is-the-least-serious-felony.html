<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Thanks for the A2A.\<br>\<br>You can\'t say anything about what\'s true in most jurisdictions, as it<br>really is different in every jurisdiction. For example, even with all of<br>the answers you already got, in Colorado, theft of \$500 would be a<br>Class 2 Misdemeanor which carries a 3 month to 1 year prison sentence<br>and a fine of \$150 to \$1000. The lowest felony charge in Colorado is<br>theft of \$2000 to less than \$5000. This is a Class 6 Felony which<br>carries a 1 year minimum to 18 month maximum and carries a fine of not<br>less than \$1000 but not more than \$10,000. Also in Colorado, parole is<br>not applied *instead of* prison time, it is used *in addition to* prison<br>time. Therefore, you will also serve an additional one year of parole<br>following your release from prison.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
