<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Why should I buy any cell phone that refuses to let me remove the<br>battery?**<br><br>It's all about compromise.<br><br>Do you want \<that_cool_new_feature\>? You can only get it in the<br>"flagship" or "premium" handsets, and none of them have removable<br>batteries. And waterproofing was the major feature that drove handset<br>manufacturers to move to non-replaceable batteries. IP68 certified<br>devices will not have removable batteries.<br><br>And "refuse" is a strong word. You can remove and replace the battery<br>--- you just can't do it by yourself. You do need an authorized repair<br>shop to do it, but you probably won't need to.<br><br>Consider that the average life span of a mobile device is about two<br>years, and the average life span of a mobile phone battery is perhaps<br>slightly less, but pretty close. You can probably get away with not<br>replacing the battery for the life of the device.<br><br>If having a removable battery is that important to you and every other<br>feature is peanuts, then you have narrowed your choice of phones you can<br>buy accordingly. It's all about what's important to you.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
