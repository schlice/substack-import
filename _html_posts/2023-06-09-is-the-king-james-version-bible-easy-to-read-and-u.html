<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Most certainly no, not by modern English standards.<br><br>The King James Version is written in an *Old English* style, which makes<br>it particularly difficult to read and understand in a modern context.<br><br>If you want an "easy to read" or "easy to understand" translation of the<br>Bible, look towards the right side of this chart. If you want a "word<br>for word" translation that holds to the fidelity of the actual words<br>(but may take more Biblical understanding to tease out the meaning),<br>look to the left of this chart.<br><br>For something easy to read and understand, but which still holds some<br>fidelity to the thoughts, I'd look at the New Living Translation, or the<br>New International Reader's Version.<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-6318b071f7b5cf5baf42863acee2fb10){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-6318b071f7b5cf5baf42863acee2fb10" master_w="730"<br>master_h="417"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>But why the differences? Why so many issues with a translation?<br>Shouldn't it be straightforward? Look at a word and translate it?<br><br>Not necessarily.<br><br>The problem comes with the languages themselves. Look at Hebrew, which<br>has fewer words than English. This means that some Hebrew words have<br>multiple meanings. Therefore, the translator must choose the correct<br>word in the target language to match the meaning of the word in the<br>source language. Therefore, when translating from Hebrew to English,<br>words may be changed. The same word in Hebrew may be represented by<br>different words throughout the Bible, depending on what the author<br>meant. The opposite problem exists for Greek. As an example, there are<br>no fewer than six words in Greek which we represent with the word "love"<br>in English. Therefore, when translating from Greek to English, we may<br>use the word "love" but it may not mean precisely what the author was<br>thinking.<br><br>The different modes of translation are **word for word, thought for<br>thought, and paraphrase.**<br><br>- Word for word translations take each individual word and translate it<br>  in to the target language. However, with either fewer or more words<br>  translating to one word, there may be some misunderstandings in the<br>  sentences.<br>- Thought for thought translations work differently. The translator<br>  reads one sentence and translates it into the target language. Words<br>  may be added or subtracted in order to retain the same thought from<br>  source to target. This is also challenging because cultures<br>  *understand* words differently. A word or phrase may mean one thing to<br>  one culture, and something completely different to another culture.<br>  Capturing the thought of the original writer may require changing some<br>  words during the translation.<br>- Paraphrase translations aim for a complete understanding of the<br>  original text, but they do it without maintaining any fidelity to word<br>  choice. The translator will read an entire paragraph and completely<br>  re-state the paragraph using different words (sometimes many different<br>  words) but retaining the main idea of the paragraph.<br><br>Ultimately, regardless of the method of translation, the translators aim<br>to keep the main idea of the original work in the translation. That is<br>always the goal of any translation: fidelity to the main idea of the<br>original. If the translation changes the main idea behind the original<br>sentence/paragraph, that translation has failed.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
