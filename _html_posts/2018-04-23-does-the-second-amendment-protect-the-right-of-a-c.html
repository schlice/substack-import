<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Does the Second Amendment protect the right of a convicted criminal<br>after they are released, or are they considered to have surrendered that<br>right?**<br><br>The Second Amendment doesn't say anything about convicted criminals.<br>Therefore, the Constitution leaves the details to the law and to the<br>courts.<br><br>Federal law says that convicted felons who lose certain civil rights<br>(such as the right to vote and the right to hold public office) also<br>lose the right to purchase and own a gun.<br><br>State law is where the whole thing gets turned on its head. And all<br>states are different. Some states allow non-violent felons to keep<br>firearms. Some only follow federal law. And some states allow rights to<br>be restored after a felon has served time.<br><br>In the states that allow rights to be restored, if the state restores<br>all rights (i.e. voting rights, serve on juries, gun rights, etc), then<br>the federal ban is no longer applicable. However, if the state only<br>restores gun rights but not other civil rights, then the federal ban<br>remains in effect, and possession of a gun is still a federal offense.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
