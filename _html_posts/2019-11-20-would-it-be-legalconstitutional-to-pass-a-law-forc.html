<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Would it be legal/constitutional to pass a law forcing people to use<br>all bio-fuel in the US?**<br><br>Yes, it would be both legal and constitutional outlawing traditional<br>gasoline and mandating bio fuel instead.<br><br>But it wouldn't go over too well.<br><br>All cars not able to burn 100% biofuel would be rendered immediately<br>useless. The vast majority of auto makers have not approved their<br>vehicles to run on 100% ethanol, the primary biofuel for use in<br>automobiles, let alone the 85% ethanol we currently have in the market<br>(you've probably seen it in the yellow pumps as E85). In fact, most<br>vehicles today are using some blend of ethanol in their gas (E15 is<br>relatively common, but virtually no auto maker has approved E100 for<br>their vehicles). It would take years of redesigns to allow cars to burn<br>100% ethanol.<br><br>Second, we don't have enough ethanol available to create enough biofuel<br>to completely replace gasoline and diesel. In parts of the world,<br>deforestation is taking place so manufacturers have enough arable land<br>to grow the crops needed to turn into biofuel. And we would have to<br>substantially increase the amount of crops we grow specifically for<br>biofuel to meet the new demand, causing increased deforestation as we<br>clear area to grow those crops, making the problem worse instead of<br>better.<br><br>Also, some biofuels made out of waste cooking oil can freeze in cold<br>weather, meaning not all biofuels are viable gas alternatives in all<br>areas.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
