<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Whether or not Officer Wilson was \"wrongfully\" acquitted<br>is a matter of opinion. The full, and only, story is that a grand jury,<br>in an abnormally-extended timeframe, very carefully considered the<br>testimony of over 60 people involved with the case, as well as forensic<br>evidence, and found that there was not enough evidence to indict him on<br>murder charges. This is, technically, not a \"wrongful\" acquittal,<br>since a grand jury, presumably doing its job to the best of its<br>abilities, made a judgment. So to say that it was a \"wrongful\"<br>acquittal is a matter of opinion, not of fact.\<br>\<br>This isn\'t to say that he didn\'t act in accordance with department<br>policy or that he, perhaps, should have done something differently. That<br>determination is up to the department, and they\'re not saying what they<br>found, as they are under no obligation to release the results of any<br>internal review into the incident. At this point, it makes no difference<br>since Officer Wilson resigned from the department. What he did, and/or<br>what he should have done, is now a matter best suited to in-service<br>training for other officers.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
