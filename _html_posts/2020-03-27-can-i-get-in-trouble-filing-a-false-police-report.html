The question is whether or not you have<br>a chance at prevailing.<br><br>You cannot sue someone simply for filing a false police report. You can<br>notify the department that someone filed a false police report. You will<br>have to go down to the police station and file your own police report,<br>and then the police may investigate. They may even charge the individual<br>with filing a false police report, which is a crime. You can't sue<br>someone who committed a crime. The District Attorney will press those<br>charges, not you.<br><br>You *can* sue someone for lying *about you* on a police report. That<br>would be called "libel" but in order to prove it, not only do you have<br>to show that it was a lie, but you'd also have to show that the lie<br>cause you harm (i.e. you lost a job because someone lied about you on a<br>police report). You can then recover monetary damages caused by that<br>lie. Remember though, the truth is always a defense against libel, so it<br>only takes the respondent showing that the statement is (or was) true to<br>invalidate the complaint.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
