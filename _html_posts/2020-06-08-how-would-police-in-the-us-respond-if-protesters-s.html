<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**How would police in the US respond if protesters start aiming laser at<br>the police in attempt to burn one\'s retina like the way Hong Kong<br>protesters did? Would such behavior justify deadly force?**<br><br>The correct answer in the United States is **yes, this justifies deadly<br>force.**<br><br>Permanent loss of a limb or a bodily function actually does qualify as<br>"grave bodily harm."<br><br>Someone shooting a laser at you with the intent of permanently blinding<br>you is using force intending to inflict grave bodily harm, and police<br>can use any force, up to and including deadly force, to stop the act.<br><br>They'll probably try to use a lesser level of force to stop you. I'd opt<br>for the water cannon on the fire truck. But given Minneapolis, this<br>isn't guaranteed.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
