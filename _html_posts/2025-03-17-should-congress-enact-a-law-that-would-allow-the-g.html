<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>There are really no Constitutional restrictions barring Congress from<br>declaring war against anyone, except for the one where Congress cannot<br>declare war against a state within the US. So long as the entity is "a<br>foreign entity," Congress can declare war against them.<br><br>So an NGO? If that NGO is outside the United States, there would be<br>little question whether or not Congress could declare war against them.<br>If that NGO was *inside* the United States, the boundaries get a little<br>fuzzier. Since the only restriction against declaring war would be<br>against a US state, then declaring war against an NGO *might* be<br>Constitutionally permissible.<br><br>Finally, I'm not sure a law would overcome the Constitution. I<br>think you'd need a Constitutional amendment, if it was found to be<br>unconstitutional, to permit Congress to declare war against an NGO<br>within the United States.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
