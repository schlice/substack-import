<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Because there will never be none to steal or purchase.<br><br>My dad was a police officer. Someone broke into our house when I was a<br>child and stole his duty revolver. So in order to eliminate all of the<br>guns which can be stolen, you'd have to remove all the guns from the<br>police and the military, too. I'm betting you weren't planning on doing<br>that.<br><br>And if you keep any of *those* guns around, criminals can offer *lots<br>and lots of money* to buy some of those guns from the cops or the<br>military. Don't think it won't happen. And don't forget that police<br>stations have been raided and guns have been stolen. It happens more<br>often than you think, and probably happened a lot more recently than<br>you're aware.<br><br>The gun market is much like your senses. If you take one away, the rest<br>become heightened. If you take away one avenue to acquire guns, the<br>other ones gain prominence and importance. And criminals are really,<br>really good at smuggling things into the United States. You may not be<br>able to buy a gun at the local gun store (because you made those<br>illegal), but you can always walk into the bad part of town and buy a<br>gun right out of the trunk of Big Joe's car, and the best part is there<br>are no forms to fill out! You just hand Big Joe some cash, and you walk<br>away with a gun in your waistband. No law will ever stop Big Joe (none<br>of them stop him today). And if you arrest Big Joe, then Slim and Fast<br>Eddie will be waiting in the wings to take over sales in his patch.<br><br>Also, don't discount ingenuity. You can make a zip gun with like \$50<br>worth of parts from your local home improvement store. Improvised<br>weapons range from the crude and downright dangerous to both the people<br>involved all the way up to cottage industries which repurpose old parts<br>and turn them into decent-functioning, reasonably reliable firearms.<br>Unless you can simultaneously remove all the guns and the knowledge of<br>how to make a gun, they will always be around, and sales will always<br>happen. And don't forget that 3-D printing is getting better and better<br>all the time, so these cottage industries don't have to fabricate too<br>much, usually just the barrel, and they can 3-D print the rest.<br><br>In short, the only thing your new rule does is to remove the guns and<br>the gun sales to the lawful gun owners. It removes the ability of the<br>law-abiding citizen to continue to use their firearms in lawful<br>ways. And criminals can always get guns. Because they're criminals.<br>They don't care what laws you write.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Why doesn't American gun activists realise that criminals can't get guns<br>if there is none to steal or purchase?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
