<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**How do you stop feeling suicidal? I grew up in a Christian cult and I<br>feel spiritless. Please don't suggest your religious beliefs, medicine,<br>or counseling/therapy. I have tried them for many years. They are not<br>for me so simply please respect that.**<br><br>You don't feel suicidal. It's not a feeling.<br><br>You feel *hopeless*. Your hopelessness is what is leading you to<br>thoughts of suicide. When you believe that there is no further reason to<br>live, and when living is too painful to continue, then suicide looks<br>like the only option.<br><br>The problem, of course, is that suicide is not the only option. You just<br>don't see it. And in order to see it, **you have to be willing to talk<br>to someone about it.**<br><br>You say you've tried counseling and therapy for many years but you still<br>feel hopeless. I can understand that. The key is to attack that<br>hopelessness, and help you find hope. You must be able to find the joy<br>in the small things in life. You must be able to look back and find past<br>successes in your life, and know that the possibility always exists for<br>future success. There are a myriad of ways to find hope in your life.<br><br>But it sounds like you're not willing to put in the effort required to<br>do it. *Quid pro quo,* as they say. Or in English, *you get out what you<br>put in*. In other words, when you put in the effort, you'll see the<br>results. But you must be willing to try.<br><br>At least do this much: before you actually take your life, try calling<br>for help. There is a box on this page with resources in your area of the<br>world. Please call or text or whatever you choose to do before you<br>actually harm yourself.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
