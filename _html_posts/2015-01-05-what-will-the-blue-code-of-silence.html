But I highly doubt it.\<br>\<br>Command staffs have to make it clear to officers that videos are<br>designed to record interactions with the public, not with other<br>officers. Command staffs also have to make policy that enforces and<br>upholds this. When this happens, officers will more readily accept body<br>cameras.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
