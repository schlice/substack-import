<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Do you think gun control laws would stop school shootings?<br><br>No, because laws do not stop bad behavior from happening.<br><br>There is some effect from laws, because sane people fear punishment, so<br>some laws may have some effect at keeping some behaviors from happening.<br>But that's not what laws are designed to do. Laws are designed to punish<br>those who violate them. They're not designed to prevent people from<br>doing the bad things should they choose to do them. They are simply<br>designed to provide a punishment *after* you break the law.<br><br>So laws do exactly what they were designed to do: they send criminals to<br>jail.<br><br>They don't actually *prevent* people from doing bad things.<br><br>The only thing that does that: security.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
