<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Our agency only allows items on your duty belt on which<br>you have been trained and certified to carry. This implies that the<br>training division has a complete training manual on the item, and that<br>you have completed that curriculum.\<br>\<br>Some of those items can be privately purchased, such as your impact<br>weapon (i.e. baton). But most of those items are<br>department-issued.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
