<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Can an HOA spy inside your home if they suspect you are breaking the<br>law?**<br><br>First of all, no one is law enforcement except for law enforcement. The<br>HOA is not a law enforcement agency, and should not be looking inside<br>your house to see if you are breaking the law. If they suspect you are<br>breaking the law, they should call the police and let them handle it.<br><br>HOAs *may* have authority to enforce the Rules & Regulations, but for<br>the most part, those rules don't pertain to the inside of your house.<br><br>One limited exception I am aware of: some HOAs require that your garages<br>not be used as storage units, but as locations for parking cars. In HOAs<br>like this, if you're parking a car in your driveway instead of in your<br>garage, the HOA staff *may* look in your garage windows to see if you<br>are able to store a car in your garage, and fine you if you cannot.<br><br>But looking into the actual house has nothing to do with the Rules &<br>Regulations and is unrelated to HOA business.<br><br>That's not to say that if a Board member happens to be inside your home<br>and they see something illegal that they can't report it to the police.<br>Anyone can do that, not just the HOA.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
