<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Does it harm my Dell laptop or battery to charge it for a while<br>without reaching 100%?**<br><br>The answer is "it depends." What it depends on is the battery technology<br>being used.<br><br>Current battery technology in Dell's current line of laptops is lithium<br>ion. Lithium ion battery tech is a very "clean" charging technology. It<br>only accepts charge until it is full. There is no "trickle" charging or<br>any other type of pulse charging that will either make it work better or<br>worse. Charging to less than 100% also does not harm the battery. All<br>lithium ion batteries will slowly degrade over time, mostly because of<br>mechanical degradation of the cells themselves. Over time, the battery<br>will slowly lose capacity. They don't suddenly die. Runtime gradually<br>gets shorter as the capacity starts to degrade.<br><br>So what can you do to keep your battery alive the longest?<br>Environmental conditions will most directly impact the degradation<br>within the cells. Literally, the worst thing you can do for a Li-ion<br>battery is to keep it fully charged in a hot environment.<br><br>Lower charge voltages can prolong a battery's life. Charging technology<br>within the laptop can charge the battery more slowly in order to<br>preserve its life. Using [[Dell Command \| Power<br>Manager](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=5446d9&url=https://www.dell.com/support/home/us/en/04/drivers/driversdetails?driverid%3D3n7tv){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="dell.com"}]{.qlink_container} can change the voltage in the<br>charging circuit, allowing you to set battery charging to "Standard"<br>(which is the lower charge we are discussing here), and "ExpressChargeâ„¢"<br>which will temporarily increase the voltage to quickly charge your<br>battery. ExpressCharge, if the system is powered off, will charge to 80%<br>in one hour, and 100% within two hours. You can also set "Primarily AC"<br>if you leave the laptop plugged in most of the time. Primarily AC lowers<br>the charging threshold, so that the battery never charges to 100%. The<br>best part? The default setting is "Adaptive," which analyzes the usage<br>patterns of the system and sets one of the above modes automatically.<br><br>Outside of Dell Command \| Power Manager, what you *can* control is the<br>laptop's temperature. Make sure that the air vents around the laptop are<br>not obstructed. Snugging in your big, warm blanket with your laptop may<br>be comforting, but it suffocates your system. A cool laptop prolongs<br>battery life and is safest for all internal components.<br><br>There is no need to disconnect your laptop from AC power when the<br>battery is charged. As I mentioned, a Li-ion battery cannot accept more<br>charge after it reaches 100%, so the charging circuit disconnects once<br>the battery is fully charged. No trickle charging these batteries.<br><br>Also, always use a Dell power supply on your Dell laptop. Using<br>third-party power supplies can charge your battery too quickly, and<br>forcing more voltage into a battery more quickly can decrease its life,<br>and can be dangerous for the cells. Absolutely avoid any so-called<br>"ultra-fast chargers" which claim to fully charge your battery in under<br>an hour.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
