<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>No, this section does not pertain to penalties for crimes.<br><br>A bill of attainder is a legal mechanism which existed in<br>pre-Constitution times, which stated that certain people or certain<br>groups of people were guilty of a crime and were punished in some way,<br>without ever having a proper trial. Because this violates due process,<br>it was specifically added to the Constitution. [[Several<br>laws](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=0d0d26&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_of_attainder%23Cases_before_the_U.S._Supreme_Court){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container} throughout the history of<br>the US were struck down as bills of attainder.<br><br>An ex post facto law is one which makes you liable for conduct which<br>was previously legal. So for example, I purchased a 15-round magazine in<br>the state of Colorado before the law was passed that the maximum number<br>of rounds a magazine can hold is 10 rounds. If the 10 round law says<br>that the purchase of my 15 round magazine when it was still legal is<br>actually illegal, that is an ex post facto law. To be clear, they can<br>come back later on and say that *continued possession* of the banned<br>item is illegal, but the *purchase* of the item, when it was legal,<br>cannot be subsequently made illegal and apply to purchases before the<br>law was passed.<br><br>Neither of these provisions has anything to do with changing penalties<br>for crimes.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
