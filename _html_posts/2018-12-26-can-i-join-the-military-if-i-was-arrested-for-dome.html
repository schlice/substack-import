<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Can I join the military if I was arrested for domestic violence? No<br>charges were pressed. It was just an overnight stay and I have no other<br>criminal history.**<br><br>The answer is a good solid "maybe."<br><br>The military has standards of "moral character" for enlistees. At a<br>minimum, they will perform a criminal background check, and your arrest<br>record will certainly be shown to them. Also the fact that you were not<br>charged and you were released will be shown (which works in your favor).<br>Even if you have a felony on your record, you can get a waiver to join<br>the military, so there's a fair chance that your one arrest (and<br>presumably, no further criminal record) won't immediately disqualify<br>you. You're going to be questioned about it, but like I said, if it was<br>one time and did not continue, you should be fine. Notice that it<br>disqualifies persons with *significant* criminal records. This means<br>that you will be evaluated on a case by case basis.<br><br>Here's what the military says about moral character:<br><br>> Persons entering the Armed Forces should be of good moral character.<br>> The underlying purpose of moral character enlistment standards is to<br>> minimize entrance of persons who are likely to become disciplinary<br>> cases or security risks or who disrupt good order, morale, and<br>> discipline. Moral standards of acceptability for service are designed<br>> to disqualify the following kinds of persons:<br>><br>> - Individuals under any form of judicial restraint (bond, probation,<br>>   imprisonment, or parole).<br>> - Those with significant criminal records.<br>> - Persons convicted of felonies may request a waiver to permit their<br>>   enlistment. The waiver procedure is not automatic, and approval is<br>>   based on each individual case. One of the considerations in<br>>   determining whether a waiver will be granted is the individual\'s<br>>   ability to adjust successfully to civilian life for a period of time<br>>   following his or her release from judicial control.<br>> - In processing waiver requests, the Military Services shall require<br>>   information about the \"who, what, when, where, and why\" of the<br>>   offense in question; and a number of letters of recommendation<br>>   attesting to the applicant\'s character or suitability for<br>>   enlistment. Such letters must be from responsible community leaders<br>>   such as school officials, ministers, and law enforcement<br>>   officials.\[1\](#ZHBkk){#cite-ZHBkk .citation_link}<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-ZHBkk){.citation_index} [[An Arrest Record Could Keep You<br>From<br>Enlisting](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=0fc7ee&url=https://www.military.com/join-armed-forces/disqualifiers-law.html){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="military.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
