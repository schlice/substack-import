<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [There are lots of answers here, but none actually<br>addressed Quora\'s TOS.\<br>\<br>In general, people who answer legal or medical questions are called<br>\"intended third-party benificiaries.\"\<br>\<br>Let me start with what Quora\'s TOS says about answers given to legal<br>and medical questions. I know it\'s a lot, but it\'s important, and I<br>added some *emphasis*:\<br>\<br>]<br><br>> Third Party Beneficiaries \-- Medical and Legal Contributions\<br>> All Quora users who provide answers to legal or medical questions are<br>> intended third-party beneficiaries (\"Legal & Medical Contributors\")<br>> of this section of the Terms of Use. The answers on this site are<br>> provided by Legal & Medical Contributors for informational purposes<br>> only. Quora and Legal & Medical Contributors TO THE FULLEST EXTENT<br>> PERMITTED BY LAW, DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,<br>> STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED<br>> WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, NON-INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTIES\'<br>> RIGHTS, AND FITNESS FOR PARTICULAR PURPOSE.\<br>> ***In no event shall Quora or Legal & Medical Contributors be liable<br>> for any damages (including, without limitation, incidental and<br>> consequential damages, personal injury / wrongful death, lost profits,<br>> or damages resulting from lost data or business interruption)<br>> resulting from the use of or inability to use the Site or the Content,<br>> whether based on warranty, contract, tort, or any other legal theory,<br>> and whether or not Quora or its Legal & Medical Contributors is<br>> advised of the possibility of such damages.*** Neither Quora nor the<br>> Legal & Medical Contributors are liable for any personal injury,<br>> including death, caused by your use or misuse of the Site or Content.\<br>> See Quora\'s [[policy regarding questions and answers to<br>> medicine-related<br>> questions](https://www.quora.com/How-do-medical-disclaimers-work-on-Quora-What-is-Quoras-policy-on-questions-about-medical-issues-and-problems)]{.qlink_container}<br>> and Quora\'s [[policy regarding questions and answers to law-related<br>> questions](https://www.quora.com/unanswered/How-do-legal-disclaimers-work-on-Quora-What-is-Quoras-policy-on-questions-and-answers-about-legal-issues-and-problems)]{.qlink_container}.\<br>> \<br>> ***Quora has provided certain disclaimer template language that Legal<br>> & Medical Contributors may edit and incorporate in their answers.<br>> Ethics rules differ by state, so we are not sure that this language<br>> will work for every attorney in every location \-- especially since<br>> rules can change over time. Legal & Medical Contributors should edit<br>> or add to disclaimer language as necessary to comply with their own<br>> state\'s rules.***\<br>> As always, we do not monitor or control the Content posted via the<br>> Service; the answers and messages created by Legal & Medical<br>> Contributors are their sole creation and responsibility. We do not<br>> endorse or guarantee the completeness, truthfulness, accuracy, or<br>> reliability of any answers or messages posted by Legal & Medical<br>> Contributors, nor do we endorse any opinions they express.\<br>> \<br>> \ \... \\<br>> \<br>> \<br>> Answers to Legal Questions\<br>> Content posted by Legal Contributors in response to legal questions is<br>> not intended to be legal advice or form an attorney-client<br>> relationship. If you believe you have a legal claim, contact an<br>> attorney licensed in your state (or country) immediately to discuss<br>> your options. Most state bar associations have services to aid you in<br>> finding an attorney. For example, California residents should visit<br>> [[How Can I Find and Hire the Right<br>> Lawyer?](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=4d22aa&url=http://www.calbar.ca.gov/Public/Pamphlets/HiringaLawyer.aspx){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="ca.gov"}]{.qlink_container}\<br>> ***Content is provided for informational purposes only, with no<br>> assurance that the Content is true, correct, or accurate. No action<br>> should be taken, delayed, or deferred based on the Content.***\<br>> 1. Content is not a substitute for professional legal advice or a<br>> solicitation to offer legal advice regarding specific facts. Should<br>> you ignore this warning and send specific or confidential information<br>> in a private message or post it as a comment, there is no duty to keep<br>> that information confidential or to discontinue or forego any<br>> representation adverse to your interests.\<br>> 2. You should not delay or forego seeking legal advice or disregard<br>> professional legal advice based on Content. Delay in seeking such<br>> legal advice could result in waiver of any claims you may have,<br>> depending on the applicable statute(s) of limitation.\<br>> 3. Content is not regulated by any state or national bar association.\<br>> 4. Information posted to Quora publicly or sent in an unsolicited<br>> message to a Legal Contributor is not confidential and does not<br>> establish attorney-client relationship without the express consent of<br>> the Legal Contributor.\<br><br>\<br>So in general, people who use Quora are bound by the terms of service on<br>the site, which state very clearly that not only is Quora not to be held<br>liable for any answers, but the answerers of said questions are also not<br>to be held liable. When you create and use an account, you agree to this<br>contract.\<br>\<br>Also, under the legal question section, it says very clearly that<br>content is provided for informational use only, and no action should<br>be taken based on the content. If someone chooses to take action based<br>on this content, they really lack the legal basis to come back and sue<br>based on simply what they read on a website where the TOS says very<br>clearly that you must not take any action based on this information.\<br>\<br>So this covers you in general. However, knowing that laws vary by state,<br>if a lawyer is licensed in a particular state and they require certain<br>disclaimers on any of their academic works, Quora gives them the ability<br>to add a tag on the bottom of each legal post they make that they can<br>modify to meet their state standards. In general, though, most<br>medical/legal question answerers leave their disclaimers to match the<br>boilerplate version Quora provides. Unless your state requires it, the<br>tag on the message is not necessary, since the TOS covers you in<br>general. However, if you have a specific state requirement for specific<br>wording for any of your academic works, the tag system allows you to add<br>that. It\'s always best, however, to drive that point home every time<br>(both in the TOS and the answer itself) that the answer is not specific<br>legal advice, and you should always consult your own lawyer with<br>specific legal questions.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
