<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [The only thing I want to add is that to the pilot, stalls<br>are absolutely positively nothing. Stalls are constantly practiced<br>during flight school. Nose-high stalls, turning stalls (in both<br>directions) and landing attitude stalls are drilled on every training<br>flight. Learning how to recover from these kinds of stalls quickly<br>without violently and rapidly descending is vital.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
