<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Why is the US government reluctant to implement gun restrictions (if<br>gun control has failed)?**<br><br>The government is not *reluctant* to implement gun restrictions. It is<br>*prohibited* from doing so by the Second Amendment which, in part,<br>reads:<br><br>> *...the right of the People to keep and bear Arms shall not be<br>> infringed.*<br><br>So while they may *want* to implement restrictions, they cannot.<br><br>That doesn't mean they don't try, though. And that's only *Federal*<br>restrictions. Many *states* still have repressive gun laws which haven't<br>been challenged or repealed yet, even though the Second Amendment has<br>been incorporated to the states with the *Heller v. DC* and *MacDonald<br>v. Chicago* Supreme Court cases.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
