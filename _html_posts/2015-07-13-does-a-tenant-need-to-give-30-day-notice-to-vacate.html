<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>> *The tenant was given notice to leave, but refuses and welcomes an<br>> eviction simply to delay her stay for a few more months. The tenant is<br>> abusing the legal process in order to buy time.*<br>><br>> *It is not an issue of non-payment and the tenant is month to month,<br>> but rather due to consistent late payments. Does the tenant need to<br>> give notification of departure while we are waiting for the court date<br>> to evict? This will greatly affect the loss of business if the tenant<br>> leaves randomly.*<br><br>As with all legal answers, the law is different in every jurisdiction,<br>so no one here will be able to give you a definitive answer.<br><br>In most jurisdictions, if the rental agreement is silent, and if the<br>tenant has already been advised to leave, they are under no further<br>obligation to provide a date at which they are going to leave; they are<br>expected to vacate immediately. Now, it\'s clear with this tenant that<br>they want to extend their unwelcome stay as long as possible, so the<br>eviction hearing is appropriate.<br><br>\"Consistent late payments\" is interesting. Is this something that is<br>part of your rental agreement? If not, it should be. In other words, you<br>should have something like \"Consistent late payments shall be defined<br>as X or more late payments in a Y-month period, holidays and office<br>closures notwithstanding\" (you define X and Y). Hopefully, it\'s<br>already in your contract.<br><br>Anyway, if your tenant vacates before the eviction hearing can take<br>place, your eviction hearing will usually just be converted to a breach<br>of contract case, and you can use it to collect any back rent due, or<br>any damages to the unit, and any other expenses that the pre-eviction<br>vacation caused. You will have to use the hearing to collect any rent<br>due caused by the tenant living in the unit beyond the rental period, as<br>I\'m certain the tenant will not pay rent when there is no contract.<br><br>You have notified the tenant as required by statute that you will not be<br>continuing the periodic lease. Failure to vacate is proper grounds for<br>eviction.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
