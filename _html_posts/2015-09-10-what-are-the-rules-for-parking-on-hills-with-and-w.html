<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [If you\'re talking about *law*, parking on a hill is no<br>different than parking on level ground. If it is not designated a no<br>parking area, you can park there.\<br>\<br>If you\'re talking about parking *safely*, there are a few things to<br>remember. This assumes you\'re in a right-hand drive country, parking on<br>the right shoulder. The reverse is true for a left-hand drive country.\<br>]<br><br>- If you\'re parking along a curb, how you cut your wheels depends on<br>  whether or not your car is facing uphill or downhill. If your car is<br>  facing *downhill,* cut your wheels to the *right, into the curb.* If<br>  your car is facing *uphill*, cut your wheels to the *left, away from<br>  the curb.* If your car starts to roll, cutting your wheels like this<br>  will cause them to catch on the curb and hopefully prevent the car<br>  from rolling away.<br>- If the shoulder has no curb, *always cut your wheels to the right,<br>  whether you are facing uphill, or downhill.* In this way, if your car<br>  starts to roll your car will either roll forward (facing downhill) or<br>  will roll backwards (facing uphill) and off the road and not into<br>  traffic.<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-05e76138b9e59b1ecd978d474ed9a096){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-05e76138b9e59b1ecd978d474ed9a096" master_w="250"<br>master_h="209"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>- Always set your parking brake and move the gearshift into Park (for an<br>  automatic) or into first gear (for a manual) and turn off the engine.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
