<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Anyone can take legal action against you for any reason. The question is<br>whether or not they have any standing, or whether or not they have a<br>case.<br><br>Generally, the rule in the United States is **if you can see it, you can<br>shoot it**. In general, if you are in a public place, you can record<br>video and post it online.<br><br>There are some places in which video recording is prohibited; usually<br>these places are clearly marked as such. Some government buildings<br>cannot be videoed inside them.<br><br>Also, be aware that there is a difference between a "public place" like<br>a sidewalk and a "private facility which is open to the public" like a<br>restaurant. If you are truly in a public place, like a sidewalk, or a<br>park, or a common area, you're good to go. If you are in a private<br>facility which is open to the public, like a restaurant or a store, you<br>may have to defer to the wishes of the facility management.<br><br>Note that some public places (like public bathrooms) have an established<br>*expectation of privacy*, so you cannot video there. Also, if you are in<br>a public place, and you are videoing things that are occurring in a<br>private place (or where there is a reasonable expectation of privacy),<br>you also cannot post that video. For example, if you are videoing<br>through the slats of a fence, or if you are standing on the sidewalk<br>videoing into the window of a house. Note that state laws differ on<br>whether or not this constitutes an invasion of privacy. Some states say<br>you cannot video anything inside the house, others say that the<br>occupants must take reasonable steps to ensure that there is an<br>expectation of privacy (i.e. closing blinds).<br><br>You also cannot *slander* someone; that is, paint them in a negative<br>light. For example, if I was fake-punching the President and you snapped<br>a picture of it and subtitled the picture, "the moment before Bill<br>punched the first black President of the United States" and this caused<br>me to lose my job because of the negative publicity, I could sue you for<br>slander (well, I'd actually sue for libel as the libelous content was<br>printed).<br><br>You also cannot use the likeness of someone else for profit without<br>their expressed permission. There is an exception for media and<br>education (and the photographer can be compensated as well), but<br>shooting a movie which will be sold constitutes making a profit, and<br>everyone depicted in that movie must sign waivers or be compensated for<br>the use of their image.<br><br>So there are some restrictions, but beyond those, if you're out in<br>public, the general rule of if you can see it, you can shoot it<br>applies.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
