<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**How are police body cameras not full of inane, unremarkable footage of<br>the officer idly driving, sitting around, eating, using the restroom,<br>etc.?**<br><br>Because in most departments, officers have the ability to stop and start<br>recordings.<br><br>On the most common Body-Worn Camera (BWC) system in use today, the unit<br>continually caches 30 seconds of video when the camera is not actively<br>recording. Once the officer presses the record button (or moves the<br>record switch), the 30 second cache is "pre-pended" to the video. The<br>cache has no audio, it's just 30 seconds of video. Then after 30 seconds<br>of silence, the moment the officer pushed the button arrives, and the<br>audio starts.<br><br>If the department is an "always-on" department, then all of the video is<br>recorded. The officer can push the "record" button which actually<br>inserts a marker at that point in the video. Later on, when the video<br>has been loaded into the department servers, the video tech can jump to<br>the mark to see a recorded incident. A great deal of useless video gets<br>discarded after the amount of time the department has designated for<br>non-evidentiary video.<br><br>The reason why it is different between departments is cost. It costs<br>money to store all of that video on servers. The actual act of storing<br>the video does not cost money, but the storage arrays on which the video<br>is loaded do cost money, and the maintenance of that video and the<br>systems on which it is stored is not cheap, and requires full time video<br>techs in the department to manage it (since most departments opt not to<br>store that video off-site). So the limiting factor is the storage system<br>on which the video is to be stored, how much space it has, and how much<br>video is to be kept for how long.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
