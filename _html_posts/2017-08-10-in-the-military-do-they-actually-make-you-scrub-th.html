<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Never cleaned floors with a toothbrush.<br><br>But my training NCO was not happy with the 5 o'clock shadow I had<br>developed one day, was convinced that I didn't know how to shave (or<br>that I was just lazy and didn't do it) and told me to report to his door<br>with a razor.<br><br>Which I did.<br><br>He then told me to shave. In front of his door, at attention. Yes, *dry<br>shave*.<br><br>After he was satisfied that I had shaved enough, I returned to my room.<br>I hadn't looked in the mirror, but my roommate was worried for my safety<br>when he saw all the blood on my neck.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
