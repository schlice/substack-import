<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The First Amendment.<br><br>The line between protecting people from cyber harassment and infringing<br>on free speech rights is very thin and not well defined. Americans are<br>as passionate about reining in cyber harassment as they are about<br>protecting their First Amendment rights.<br><br>This line is a very difficult one to navigate, and the government is not<br>the right organization to do it, thanks to the Bill of Rights. In other<br>words, **the government cannot really do much more to stop cyber<br>harassment than they are already doing without running afoul of the<br>First Amendment.**<br><br>It is really up to industry to fix this issue, not government.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Why does Congress refuse to pass more stringent regulation to protect<br>Americans from cyber-harassment? Current laws are unwieldy and<br>ineffective, and have jurisdictional issues.
