<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Tysabri has always been a great "second-line" MS drug, meaning you<br>should only take it after you have tried other MS therapies and they<br>have not been successful. It's a great drug: its efficacy is unmatched<br>in the realm of MS drugs, which makes it an obvious choice if you can<br>tolerate it. But Tysabri has always had one really negative thing that<br>caused it to get relegated to second string status: the risk of<br>[[progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy<br>(PML)](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=9f0d6d&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_multifocal_leukoencephalopathy){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}.<br><br>However, research by the National Institute of Health may cause<br>neurologists to re-think that choice. NIH recommends that Tysabri be<br>considered for "first-line" use for some patients:<br><br>- Patients who are "JCV negative" (who test negative for [[the JC<br>  Virus](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=4ede7e&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_polyomavirus_2){.external_link<br>  rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>  onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>  qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}, which causes PML)<br>- Patients who are "JCV low-positive" who have not taken any previous<br>  immunosuppressant, and<br>- Patients who are "JCV high-positive" who have an aggressive disease<br>  course, so long as its use is limited to 12--24<br>  months.\[1\](#RfneB){#cite-RfneB .citation_link}<br><br>The risk of PML is greatest in patients who are both JC positive and who<br>have previously been treated by an immunosuppressant. The risk of PML is<br>lowest in patients who are JC negative.<br><br>So depending where you are on the immunosuppressant scale and where you<br>are on the JCV scale, Tysabri may be a good option. It's a good time to<br>ask your neurologist.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>When should people with multiple sclerosis take Tysabri?<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-RfneB){.citation_index} [[First-line natalizumab in<br>multiple sclerosis: rationale, patient selection, benefits and<br>risks](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=dceecf&url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3926344/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="nih.gov"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*This answer is not professional medical advice**, nor is it a<br>substitute for professional medical advice.
