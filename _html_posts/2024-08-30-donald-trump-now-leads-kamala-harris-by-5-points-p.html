<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Tracking the speed of the decline of the convention bump shows just how<br>much staying power she actually has.<br><br>And people are realizing that not only does she *not* have any new<br>policies, but she had **four years already in the White House to fix<br>them!** She's apparently running a campaign against herself, claiming<br>that she was not really part of the administration that got us where we<br>are right now. She's not offering anything unique. She's offering<br>Bidenomics 2.0, or *Bidenomics On Steroids*.<br><br>In other words, if you like how the economy has been doing over the last<br>four years, if you like paying more at the supermarket, if you like<br>paying more at the gas pump, if you like your paycheck not going as far<br>as it did four years ago, if you like the state of the southern border,<br>if you think the state of San Francisco is "pretty good," if you think<br>that the Democrat-led protests have been "mostly peaceful," then vote<br>for Harris, because she's going to *double down* on all of those<br>policies, and go even further.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
