<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I don't have to think. We can calculate the chance.<br><br>The Supreme Court gets, on average, 7000 requests a year for certiorari.<br>They accept, on average, fewer than 100.<br><br>That means, assuming they accept 100 out of the 7000 requests a year<br>they get, the chances of this case being heard are 1.43%.<br><br>But are they really? This case is an isolated case between one homeowner<br>and one HOA, not a referendum on religious freedom. The Court probably<br>won't be able to set a precedent that they are dying to set, so it's<br>unlikely that they will grant cert in this case.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
