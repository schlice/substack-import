<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>A simple Google search would have helped you here.<br><br>> Georgia officials have dissolved a committee responsible for<br>> investigating deaths of pregnant women in the state, after one or more<br>> members leaked confidential information about deaths linked to the<br>> state\'s strict abortion laws.<br>><br>> In a letter sent to members of the Maternal Mortality Review Committee<br>> (MMRC), Georgia health commissioner Kathleen Toomey said an<br>> investigation failed to identify those responsible for the leak, so<br>> all current members would be removed.<br>><br>> The news - first reported by ProPublica - comes two months after the<br>> outlet [[published stories on the deaths of two<br>> women](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=1ac946&url=https://www.propublica.org/article/georgia-abortion-ban-amber-thurman-death){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="propublica.org"}]{.qlink_container} the panel ruled were<br>> preventable and linked to the state\'s strict abortion<br>> ban.\[1\](#hamER){#cite-hamER .citation_link}<br><br>So pretty straightforward: the committee violated the state's rules<br>about confidentiality, and when the investigation couldn't find the<br>leaker, all of the members of the committee were dismissed.<br><br>But the quote that really destroys the narrative you were probably going<br>for in asking this question:<br><br>> \A\ll new member seats would be filled through a new application<br>> process, \with new\ on-boarding processes for \"better ensuring<br>> confidentiality\".<br><br>So the committee still exists. All the seats on the committee will<br>be re-filled, but they're going to do a better job ensuring that the<br>people who fill those seats can maintain their oath of confidentiality<br>better than the previous committee members.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-hamER){.citation_index} [[Georgia axes maternal health<br>panel after abortion deaths<br>leak](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=09149c&url=https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdj3kxvl1j8o){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="bbc.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
