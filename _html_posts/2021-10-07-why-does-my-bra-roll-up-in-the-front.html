<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Most bras are designed to push breasts up to provide support for them.<br>The lower band of the bra is what causes that upward force. Sometimes,<br>that band will roll up in the front if your breasts are too small for<br>the bra you have, or if you have bought a bigger bra than your chest<br>size. It can also happen if your tummy bumps into it after you sit down<br>(the dreaded baby belly can mess with your bra).<br><br>So how do you fix this?<br><br>Make sure you are sizing yourself properly:<br><br>[https://www.realsimple.com/beaut\...(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=174b58&url=https://www.realsimple.com/beauty-fashion/clothing/shopping-guide/how-to-measure-bra-size){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="realsimple.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>And then when shopping, make sure you look closely at the size chart on<br>the bra, find your actual bra size, and select an appropriately sized<br>bra for your actual bra size. In some cases, you may need a smaller bra<br>than you think.<br><br>Enjoy!<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Why does my bra roll up in the front?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
