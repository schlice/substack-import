<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Several reasons.<br><br>1.  It's not necessary. If there is nothing illegal that they have done,<br>    then there is nothing for which Trump needs to pardon them. Sure, he<br>    could simply pardon everyone who was in the campaign against<br>    anything illegal they may have done, and it would be legal as well<br>    as well within his authority for him to do, but it would be<br>    unethical and perhaps a little skeptical. He didn't pardon Flynn<br>    because Flynn lied all on his own. His lies are on him, not on<br>    Trump. And he didn't lie about any "collusion" which may or may not<br>    have taken place, so his cooperation with the special counsel does<br>    not help or hurt Trump at all.<br>2.  He could legally also fire the special counsel because he's not<br>    actually fulfilling his charter, but again, it would not help him,<br>    it would only hurt him. In a discussion of "optics," this would<br>    appear very suspect, even though he has the legal authority to<br>    dismiss the special counsel. Additionally, it would further polarize<br>    and galvanize those who truly believe that Trump must be guilty of<br>    something.<br>3.  Along those lines, it would lead to *real* impeachment grounds:<br>    abuse of power. Firing the special counsel and abusing the pardon<br>    power in this way, which would send the signal that he's clearly<br>    trying to cover his own ass, would actually be what I would consider<br>    an abuse of power, something for which Congress could actually<br>    impeach him.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
