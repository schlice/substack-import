<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>When a lien is placed on a house and then that lien is foreclosed on,<br>the home is sold without the homeowner's agreement. Basically, when a<br>lien is foreclosed, the homeowner no longer has a say in what happens to<br>it.<br><br>When the sale is completed, the homeowner is advised to vacate the home<br>and is given an appropriate amount of time to do so. The Notice to<br>Vacate will specify a date by which the home must be vacated. If the<br>home is still occupied on the date that the home transfers to the<br>possession of the lender, the Sheriff's Office will remove the residents<br>from the home, and any remaining items within the home will be moved<br>into storage at the resident's expense.<br><br>All outstanding liens against the home will be paid, and any remaining<br>balance will be returned to the former owner, or any amount owed will be<br>assessed against the former owner. Usually, the proceeds from the sale<br>are sufficient to satisfy any and all liens against the property.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
