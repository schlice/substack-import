<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [For people with Relapsing/Remitting MS (RRMS), every day<br>brings a new wonder when you open your eyes. \"Will my eyes work this<br>morning?\" \"Will my legs support me when I step onto the floor?\"<br>\"Will I have trouble with my morning constitutional?\" \"Will I have<br>trouble swallowing my breakfast this morning?\" \"Am I going to be too<br>tired to go out with the family tonight?\" \"Am I going to lose focus at<br>my job today?\" Or, more worryingly, \"Are any of my previous symptoms<br>going to come back today?\" MS brings a range of \"unknowns\" to your<br>day, each and every day.\<br>\<br>The trick to living well with MS is knowing how to quiet your demons and<br>live for the day you have rather than worrying about the days you may<br>not have.\<br>\<br>I can tell you that I haven\'t quite mastered living well with MS. It\'s<br>a process. I\'ve gotten much, much better at it, but I know I\'m not<br>\"there\" yet.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
