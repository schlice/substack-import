<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Does the law require you to file a police report for minor<br>accidents?**<br><br>All states are different, and most states do require that you at least<br>file a police report online even if you don't call the police to the<br>scene.<br><br>In Colorado, for example, you *must* call the police to the scene if any<br>of the following occur:<br><br>- if anyone involved is injured or killed<br>- there is damage to public property like a light pole or a guard rail<br>- one of the participants in the accident leaves the scene (a<br>  hit-and-run)<br>- one of the drivers appears to be under the influence of drugs or<br>  alcohol<br><br>While you may not need to call the police to the scene, you still are<br>required to report the accident, which you can do online.<br><br>Even if your state does not require you to file a police report, it's a<br>good idea to do it. Insurance companies use police reports to provide an<br>independent assessment of the accident and its causes, and insurance<br>will use those reports to help them determine liability (i.e. who is<br>responsible).<br><br>Even if you decide to not file a claim with your insurance company, what<br>if the other party does, and their insurance company attempts to make a<br>claim against your policy, claiming you were responsible? If you were<br>not, having a police report could help to prove that.<br><br>Additionally, if you are injured (and some injuries are not immediately<br>apparent), and the accident was not your fault, someone will have to pay<br>for those medical bills, and it shouldn't be you. A police report can<br>help your health insurance to get reimbursed for their payouts to you,<br>and it may prevent you from having to pay anything out of pocket, or at<br>least to get reimbursed for what you do pay. You shouldn't have to pay<br>when someone else is at fault.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
