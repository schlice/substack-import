The Senate would then<br>need to vote to remove him from office, which won't likely happen even<br>if he is impeached. This means that effectively, nothing will happen.<br><br>Example: Bill Clinton.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
