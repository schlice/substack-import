<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What should President Trump do to protect himself from leakers and<br>dissenters on his own staff?**<br><br>He should do what he should have done on Day 1: relieve *everyone* of<br>their jobs and re-hire all employees, and demand that they do their jobs<br>even if they don't like the source of the order. If they don't want to<br>do their jobs, they can quit. They don't work to *actively subvert* the<br>person they are working for. No work force would ever accept that from<br>an employee, and I wouldn't expect the President to accept that<br>behavior, either.<br><br>As a military member, I may have been dissatisfied with my nation's<br>choice of commander-in-chief. I may not want to sit down and have a beer<br>with him. But he's still the commander-in-chief, and when he says jump,<br>I ask for a max altitude while I'm on the way up.<br><br>The problem in the White House, as is the problem with all Government<br>Service employees, is the Government Service itself. You simply can't do<br>what I alluded to. You can't relieve someone of a GS job without cause<br>and without *copious* documentation showing that you warned said<br>individual over the years. (You can still relieve someone of their job<br>*with cause*).<br><br>So while I'd *like* this to happen, it probably won't.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
