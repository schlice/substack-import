<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>"God-fearing" is a phrase which usually means understanding the awesome<br>power of the Creator of the Universe, the being who literally put the<br>breath that you breathe into your lungs and has the power to wipe you<br>from existence such that no one would ever know you were there. It is<br>understanding and respecting the power of the Almighty. It means living<br>in awe, respect, obedience, and submission to God's authority.<br><br>Fear has at its roots both awe and terror. So it's understandable how<br>some people could read "God-fearing" and think that you are to be afraid<br>of God. People are afraid of things all the time, like snakes and<br>spiders, and they are afraid of those things because they can *hurt<br>them.* But this is unjustified with God, as He would never hurt you.<br><br>*But He's all-powerful! He might send me to hell!*<br><br>Actually no, He doesn't send anyone to hell. **You send yourself to<br>hell** by disobeying God. He doesn't condemn you to punishment. You<br>condemn yourself to punishment by refusing to repent of your sin. God<br>simply refuses to abide sinners. And if you haven't taken care of<br>business and repented of your sin, God is going to remove you from His<br>presence and send you away. That's not God punishing you. That's you<br>punishing yourself. It's not just a word game. The punishment is all in<br>your hands. It's not like you could be humming along thinking you're<br>saved and then God smites you. That's only true in Hollywood. In<br>reality, whether or not you are saved is totally up to you.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
