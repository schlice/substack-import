<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>First, you must know that any question which begins with "Can God"<br>*automatically* ends with yes, God can. As the creator of<br>everything, and without being constrained by anything, God can do<br>anything.<br><br>So: can God save an evil person? Yes, God can. However, salvation is a<br>gift from God, and *it's already been given*. The next action is for the<br>person to *accept* the gift.<br><br>And an evil person likely does not want to accept that gift.<br><br>It's not that they *can't* accept the gift, they can. Salvation is<br>offered to anyone who repents of their sins and confesses Jesus as their<br>lord and savior. Sadly, the evil person has been swayed by Satan and his<br>tricks and lies. It's unlikely that the evil person would ever repent of<br>their sins and confess Jesus as lord.<br><br>TL;DR: *Can* it happen? Yes. Is it *likely* to happen? Without a change<br>in the heart of the evil person, no.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Can God save a evil person?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
