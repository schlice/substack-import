<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Only if you want to have to pay through your own insurance<br>in order to be serviced by your local police department. Policing will<br>become \"fee-for-service,\" and only people with insurance will get good<br>police service. I really don\'t think that\'s what you want.\<br>\<br>Perhaps police departments will need to start buying indemnification<br>insurance for their officers to protect them against the myriad of<br>lawsuits they continually face.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
