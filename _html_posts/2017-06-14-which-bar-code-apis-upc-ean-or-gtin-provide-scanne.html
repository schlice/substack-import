<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>To be fair, you shouldn't be providing all of that information in a bar<br>code. They simply can't hold enough information. I would suggest using<br>your bar code to link to a website. Since most "bar codes" (which are<br>really 2D codes today) are easily read on smartphones, you're best<br>served by producing a QR code which sends the user to a mobile website.<br><br>If you do want to include an image, several formats will be able to hold<br>enough information to produce an image, such as PDF417 and QR.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
