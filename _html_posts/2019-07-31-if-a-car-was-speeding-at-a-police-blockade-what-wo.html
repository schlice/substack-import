<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>While I agree with [[Brian<br>Parramore](https://www.quora.com/profile/Brian-Parramore)]{.qlink_container}<br>that any centerfire rifle fired multiple times at the radiator will<br>disable the vehicle, the question was asked about which gun would be the<br>*best* gun to slow it down or stop it.<br><br>And the *best* gun the police have access to would be this:<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-48735fbf68ee465f65df45a888458f4d){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-48735fbf68ee465f65df45a888458f4d"<br>master_w="1000" master_h="1000"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>The Barrett M107. This behemoth fires the similarly behemoth 50BMG<br>round:<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-6ceefcd6b4812f2059f716914f98b9b7){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-6ceefcd6b4812f2059f716914f98b9b7" master_w="450"<br>master_h="430"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>(Photo courtesy<br>[Wikimedia(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=767e93&url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Rifle_cartridge_comparison.jpg){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikimedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}, public domain)<br><br>The bullet on the far right is a .22 Long Rifle (LR). The next bullet to<br>the left is the 5.56 NATO, which is fired by most centerfire rifles such<br>as the M4 or the M-16. And all the way on the far left of the photo is<br>the .50 BMG, fired by the Barrett.<br><br>The 5.56 travels at a maximum of around 3,100 ft/sec and imparts around<br>1,371 ft/lbs of force. The .50 BMG, on the other hand, at its heaviest<br>800 grain Barnes configuration, flies at a relatively slow 2,895 ft/sec,<br>but imparts a *whopping* 14,895 ft/lbs of force on target.<br><br>So will a 5.56 do the job? Yes, probably with more than one shot, but it<br>will stop the car. But will a Barrett do the job better? In all<br>respects, yes.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
