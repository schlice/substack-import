<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Property owners are allowed to record nearly any activity that takes<br>place on their property. Property owners still must allow for privacy,<br>so generally recording people in bathrooms and bedrooms (where there is<br>a reasonable expectation of privacy even from the owner of the property)<br>is not allowed.<br><br>However the property owner has the right to record your actions on his<br>property in any and all shared spaces, with or without your consent.<br><br>You *may* have a claim if you signed a lease agreement and it does<br>not specify that shared spaces will be monitored. You would have to<br>consult with an attorney to see if you have a claim. I doubt you would,<br>as you would still have to show some harm was done before you could make<br>a claim.<br><br>But if you are just \"couch-surfing\" or staying in his house<br>temporarily without a lease agreement, you probably don\'t have much<br>standing for any sort of claim.<br><br>The only way you may have a claim is if he was publishing the video<br>online without your consent, or if he was obtaining private information<br>to use for his own gain (like listening to you speak a credit card<br>number over the phone and then stealing your credit).<br><br>If he was simply protecting his property through the use of a security<br>camera and he took care to safeguard the video, or the camera belonged<br>to a security company like ADT and the video was securely stored in<br>their cloud (as I have in my house), there\'s not much room for any sort<br>of claim.<br><br>\<br><br>*As always, we provide general information here on Quora, not legal<br>advice. Nothing we say here is actionable, nor should it be considered<br>so. If you want a real, actionable answer, you* *must* *consult with<br>a licensed attorney in your area.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
