<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>How do you know that your brain is thinking things all by itself?<br><br>Neither Satan nor his minions can read your thoughts, true. *But they<br>can whisper thoughts into your ear, and convince you that they are your<br>thoughts.*<br><br>Remember, the battle is for our minds. Our minds have been conditioned<br>by the world, influenced by Satan, the puppet-master behind it all.<br>Think about that: *our lives have been shaped by our enemies!* Our very<br>belief system has been shaped by our enemies. We've absorbed a whole lot<br>of lies and half-truths, and those have really affected us.<br><br>If you are a child of God, are you dirty or ugly? Of course not! It<br>isn't true. It just feels true. It's a lie that has been reinforced<br>so many times that it literally has taken a hold of you, and it causes<br>you to think and act in ways that contradict God's Word.<br><br>But can you beat it? ***Of course you can! YOU CONTROL YOU! Satan does<br>not control you!***<br><br>Think of your mind as an airport, and you are the air traffic<br>controller. A lot of thoughts ask for permission to land, but you have<br>the ultimate control over which thoughts can land, and which thoughts<br>get turned away.<br><br>So try this practical exercise to help you break those bad patterns of<br>thought:<br><br>1.  Work out the lie you have been believing. In your case, it may<br>    be the bad thoughts about God concerning the things you are<br>    thinking.<br>2.  Say what effect believing the lie has had on your life. Imagine<br>    how different your life would be if you didn't think this way. What<br>    would you be able to do that you currently can't do?<br>3.  Find as many Bible verses as you can that say what is actually<br>    true and write them down. Google can help you here.<br>4.  Write a declaration. Use this formula: "I renounce the lie<br>    that..." and "I declare the truth that...". You could also say, "I<br>    reject the lie that..." and "I embrace the truth that..." or "I say<br>    no to the lie that..." and "I say yes to the truth that..."<br>5.  Read the verses *out loud* and pray the declaration<br>    *out loud* every day for 40 days. Why out loud? As we've<br>    already discussed, Satan can't read your mind. Declare the truth,<br>    out loud, so the demons hear you renouncing their lies. Also<br>    remember, for a long time, the verses will not feel true. But<br>    remind yourself that God *is* truth, and if He said it, it really is<br>    true.<br><br>(And yes, for anyone who has done the *Freedom In Christ* course, this<br>sounds an awful lot like stronghold busting. News flash: it is.)<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
