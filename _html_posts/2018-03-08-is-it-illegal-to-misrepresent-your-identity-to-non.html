<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Is it illegal to misrepresent your identity to non-authorities?<br><br>It is only illegal to misrepresent your identity to police and federal<br>agents.<br><br>To anyone else, and about anything else, it's not illegal to lie. You<br>can claim whatever you choose to claim in order to get whatever you<br>want.<br><br>I might qualify that you must also not lie on official documentation.<br>For example, if you're filling out a job application or if you're trying<br>to get a loan, you can't lie on those forms.<br><br>I also don't think you were talking about misrepresenting your identity<br>*and actually attempting to perform the role of your misrepresented<br>identity*. You know that misrepresenting yourself as a police officer or<br>a doctor *and then attempting to perform police functions or attempting<br>to practice medicine* will get you thrown in jail.<br><br>But in the situations you discussed (for example, claiming you're a<br>movie producer instead of a journalist in order to get "insider"<br>information), there are no legal requirements to tell the truth.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
