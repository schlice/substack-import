<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**In 2015, in a state supreme court ruling, there are mentions of<br>reimbursement of attorney fees owed to one of the parties. How do you<br>collect this payment?**<br><br>Most financially stable people will pay their court fees because they<br>know that it can become very legally cumbersome if they don't. It can<br>hurt their businesses and their credit in the long term if they don't<br>pay awarded judgments against them.<br><br>In most states, if you have been awarded a judgement that has not been<br>paid, you must hire an attorney (specifically a collections attorney) to<br>assist you with collecting what you are owed. These attorneys either get<br>paid hourly, or will keep a portion of what they collect.<br><br>They will start by sending certified letters reminding the person that<br>they owe a judgement and must pay or that legal processes will commence.<br><br>If they still do not pay, the lawyer will begin a post-judgement<br>discovery process, which is a legal process that examines the person's<br>ability to pay. It discloses all sources of income and all assets. In<br>some states, this happens in court.<br><br>Once you have completed the discovery, you can petition the court to<br><br>- garnish wages<br>- seize cash or assets from a business<br>- garnish bank accounts<br><br>in order to repay the judgement.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
