<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>What precisely is he going to sue you for?<br><br>> Only human beings, and not corporations or other organizations, have<br>> rights of publicity and privacy interests that can be invaded by<br>> misappropriation of name or likeness. Thus, only individuals can sue<br>> for unlawful use of name or likeness, unless a human being has<br>> transferred his or her rights to an organization.<br>> \[1\](#MBNEV){#cite-MBNEV .citation_link}<br><br>The business could try to sue you for defamation, but what you posted<br>must be *untrue*, or the inference you made about what was clearly in<br>the video must be false. But truth is always a defense to defamation<br>claims of any kind.<br><br>I'd say record what you saw and post it on Yelp or in a Google review<br>and let the chips fall where they may. But make sure you have a good<br>defense attorney lined up in case the business does try to sue you.<br><br>Also, be aware that state laws may prohibit recording in businesses if<br>you have been duly notified of the prohibition, so you could be in<br>violation of a state law. Some states may require a posting at the door<br>in order for the prohibition to be binding. Check your state laws before<br>recording.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Is it legal for me to record inside a restaurant? I wanted to expose the<br>manager's awful behavior&his scams. He claims he will sue me for<br>recording&then posting it on the internet because it's a private<br>business.
