<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>A lot of people are talking about turning your basement into a "kitchen"<br>by not putting things like sinks, stoves, and refrigerators down there.<br><br>I would submit to you that you need to check your zoning ordinances much<br>more closely.<br><br>In Colorado (in El Paso County specifically), the only item that turns a<br>"kitchenette" or a "wet bar" into a "full kitchen" is a stove/cooktop. I<br>know; I finished my basement in Colorado and installed a beverage fridge<br>alongside a bar sink, and even that did not create anything more than<br>what is called a "wet bar." What made it a "kitchen" in Colorado's case<br>was the stove.<br><br>But the reason is exactly like everyone here said: if you are living in<br>a "single family housing" zoned area, you can only have one common<br>kitchen in the house. An attempt to make a second "kitchen" is generally<br>viewed as an attempt to make a separate living area which could be used<br>for "multi family housing," which would violate the zoning in that area.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
