<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: [Soldiers aren\'t forced to be exposed to chemicals that<br>will affect them for the rest of their lives. Yes, in war there is risk,<br>and some of it is acceptable risk. Are you saying that all risk in war<br>is acceptable risk?\<br>\<br>\<devils_advocate\> So you\'re saying that we shouldn\'t take care of<br>our military veterans who have been exposed to harmful agents during the<br>course of their military service? Should we take care of anyone who is<br>exposed to any harmful agents during the course of their occupations? I<br>mean, they signed up for the job, the consequences are expected, right?<br>Should we not install guard rails along the sides of high-rise<br>construction projects? I mean, no one forced them up there by gunpoint,<br>if you fall, it\'s just a consequence of working on an unfinished<br>high-rise, right?\<br>\<br>Navy shipbuilders breathed asbestos dust during their tenures and now<br>have mesothelioma (a lung cancer specifically caused by exposure to<br>airborne asbestos). Is your contention that this should just be<br>considered an occupational hazard?\<br>\<br>Military members (like myself) are developing multiple sclerosis at a<br>higher rate than non military members, and so the VA considers<br>developing MS within 7 years of leaving Active Duty a service-connected<br>disability. Is this right, in your opinion?<br>\</devils_advocate\>]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/What-do-you-think-about-VA-alerting-veterans-to-possible-long-term-health-problems-that-may-be-related-to-environmental-exposures-during-their-military-service/answers/5939769<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
