Or only the camera<br>outside to secure our front door?**<br><br>Remember that in all cases, you must check your state and local laws<br>regarding the use of cameras, as they may differ.<br><br>In most cases, if you are the owner of the house, you may install<br>security cameras both outside and inside to protect your home. Inside,<br>you may only install cameras in "common areas" (i.e. the living room,<br>the kitchen, the hallway, etc). You may not install cameras in any area<br>of the house where there is a reasonable expectation of privacy (i.e.<br>the bedroom, the bathroom, etc).<br><br>Also in most cases, you cameras cannot record audio. This is a holdover<br>from federal "wiretapping" laws which dictate how conversations can be<br>recorded, and the types of consent required. In some states, posting<br>signs stating that audio and video recording takes place on the premises<br>and that entry implies consent may be sufficient. Again, check state and<br>local laws carefully before allowing your cameras to record audio.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
