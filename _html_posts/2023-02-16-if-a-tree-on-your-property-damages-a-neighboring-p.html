<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>In most states, the condition of the tree before it fell and whether or<br>not you knew that it was in that condition will determine liability.<br><br>In short, if the tree was alive and healthy, you are not responsible if<br>it falls (i.e. during a hurricane) and damages your neighbor's property.<br><br>But if the tree was dead, you'd be liable for any damages it caused by<br>falling over onto your neighbor's property.<br><br>Additionally, if your tree was a hazard because it was dead or dying or<br>its limbs were broken *and you were notified about the issue* ***and you<br>did nothing***, not only are you liable, but your homeowner's insurance<br>won't even cover you because you were aware of the hazard and did not<br>address it.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
