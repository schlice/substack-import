<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Every servicemember is subject to the Constitution as a citizen. But in<br>addition to the Constitution, they are also subject to the Uniform Code<br>of Military Justice (UCMJ), which is specifically tailored to handle<br>situations which would arise in the course of military service. For<br>example, insubordination is not covered by the Constitution, nor is it<br>covered in any Federal, state, or local laws. The UCMJ addresses<br>disciplinary actions which are specifically related to military service.<br><br>You never sign away any Constitutional rights when enlisting in the<br>military. You sign a contract which binds you to a certain length of<br>service. The military does this because it's not cheap to train someone.<br>Depending on the branch and the job, your training can run upwards of<br>\$250,000. The military would like to see some return on their<br>investment, so you are generally bound to a specific length of service.<br>You also must maintain military standards during your enlistment<br>(grooming, dress and personal appearance, weight, health standards,<br>conduct and character, etc).<br><br>Under Article 31 of the UCMJ, a military member has very similar rights<br>to what *Miranda* holds for civilians. Here is the statement of Article<br>31 rights:<br><br>> I am \_\_\_\_\_\_ (grade/name), a member of (AF Security<br>> Police/AFOSI), I am investigating the alleged offense(s) of<br>> \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, of which you are suspected. I advise you that<br>> under the provisions of Article 31 of the UCMJ, you have the right to<br>> remain silent, that is, say nothing at all. Any statement you make,<br>> oral or written, may be used as evidence against you in a trial by<br>> courts-martial, or in other judicial or administrative proceedings.<br>> You have the right to consult a lawyer and to have a lawyer present<br>> during this interview. You have the right to military legal counsel<br>> free of charge. In addition to military counsel, you are entitled to<br>> civilian counsel of your own choosing, at your own expense. You may<br>> request a lawyer at any time during this interview. If you decide to<br>> answer questions, you may stop the questioning at any time. Do you<br>> understand your rights? Do you want a lawyer? (If the answer is yes,<br>> cease all questions at this point). Are you willing to answer<br>> questions?<br><br>Military members don't lose any Constitutional rights. They are simply<br>covered by a more restrictive set of rules which applies over and above<br>the Constitution.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
