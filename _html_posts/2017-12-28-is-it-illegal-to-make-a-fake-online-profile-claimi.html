The 1st Amendment protects speech, even when<br>you're lying.<br><br>There are, however, laws against getting things to which you are not<br>entitled, so if you're using the fake online profile in order to steal<br>money or donations or to get discounts to which you are not entitled,<br>that is illegal.<br><br>But simply claiming to be a minor who is a victim of ongoing abuse is<br>not illegal.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
