<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>No. At best, the HOA doesn't have the authority to issue the fines it<br>does. But *criminal?* No, not at all.<br><br>First of all, let's discuss what is a "made-up fine."<br><br>In the US, if an HOA is going to cite you for a violation of the Rules,<br>the Rule in question must be specified. And it must be a Rule that the<br>Board of Directors has voted to approve at a Board meeting. The HOA is<br>required to let you know what that rule is that you are being accused of<br>violating.<br><br>It may be something as simple as, "No homeowner may participate in any<br>activity which is a nuisance to other homeowners." Who decides what is a<br>nuisance? Who decides whether or not that nuisance bothers other<br>homeowners? The answer is that the HOA, in its *exclusive* authority,<br>decides what is a nuisance and what is not.<br><br>I don't know your specific situation, but I *do* know that everything<br>the HOA fines you for must be something as recorded in the Governing<br>Documents, or in the Rules and Regulations. So first, find out what<br>provision within your Governing Documents was violated. If they cannot,<br>or will not, cite the actual provision being violated, do not pay the<br>fine.<br><br>If they do cite a provision, was that provision approved at a Board<br>meeting? Were those meeting minutes made public? Were you provided with<br>an updated copy of whatever document is being cited (even posting on the<br>HOA website is considered "providing a document")? These are all very<br>important questions for you to ask. If there is an appropriate<br>provision, and they provided you with the necessary documentation, and<br>they can show they did, pay the fine and fix the violation. It's not<br>worth pissing them off.<br><br>Finally, be cautious if you think you don't want to pay the fine.<br>Failing to pay a fine is a very dangerous proposition. I would never<br>fail to pay a fine without already retaining a lawyer and discussing the<br>situation with him/her. There is a great deal of risk in failing to pay<br>a fine. If you accumulate enough fines, the HOA can turn your account<br>over to their own attorney, who will not only continue to accumulate<br>fines and late fees, but then their own attorney's fees as well. Once<br>the dollar amount gets high enough, the HOA and their attorney can place<br>a lien on your home until those fines are paid, and if they go unpaid<br>for long enough, they can foreclose on that lien, sell your house out<br>from under you, and use the proceeds of the sale to recoup the money<br>they are owed. I STRONGLY suggest you talk to a real estate attorney in<br>your local area who specializes in HOA law. DO NOT FAIL TO DO THIS if<br>you plan on not paying the fines.<br><br>\<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*This answer is not a substitute for professional legal advice or a<br>solicitation to offer legal advice regarding specific facts.
