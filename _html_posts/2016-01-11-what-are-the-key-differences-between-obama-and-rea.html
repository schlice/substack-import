<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>President Obama supports \"non-common-sense\" gun control which he<br>labels as \"gun control.\" Things like:<br><br>- limits on magazine capacity<br>- banning \"scary-looking\" assault weapons<br>- national gun registries<br><br>and the only one that actually makes a little bit of sense (if it\'s<br>done right):<br><br>- background checks on all gun sales<br><br>By the way, \"doing it wrong\" means keeping a record of every gun sale,<br>thus creating a *de facto* national registry of guns. And no, we do not<br>do this for cars; you can buy a car and never register it with the<br>state. Of course, you could never drive it on a public road, but there<br>is no requirement to register a car when you buy it. You only need to<br>register it if you want to drive it on a public road.<br><br>If it\'s done right, we might support something similar, if it equated<br>to a national concealed carry permit, just as your vehicle doesn\'t have<br>to be registered in every state in which you drive. This would only mean<br>registering weapons you intend to carry concealed, not all weapons (for<br>whatever good the gun control crowd thinks this might do).<br><br>Sadly, there are no calls to \"do this right.\"<br><br>President Reagan, when he was president, was steadfastly against any<br>form of gun control whatsoever, even after he was critically wounded in<br>1981 in an assassination attempt. Even with that attempt on his life, he<br>went further, calling for the abolition of the BATF.<br><br>Note that after he left office, he did soften a little, and he did<br>support the Brady Law, passed in 1993, which requires all purchasers of<br>guns from businesses to get Federal background checks through the NICS,<br>disqualifying purchasers who are felons and who are declared mentally<br>ill by a court.<br><br>He also was in favor of the silly limitation on magazine size, but that<br>(thankfully) never came to fruition nationally.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
