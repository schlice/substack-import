<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>We've already answered these questions a number of times. But who knows,<br>maybe once more for good measure.<br><br>> **why should I believe in a god who tortures you for eternity if you<br>> don\'t believe in him**<br><br>If such a god exists, I'd want to weigh the whole "torture for all<br>eternity" thing against believing in him, and I'd probably believe in<br>him so that I don't get tortured for all eternity.<br><br>But since you seem to be asking this question of Christians, I can tell<br>you that God doesn't "torture you for all of eternity for not believing<br>in Him."<br><br>Two things wrong with that:<br><br>1.  First, Hell isn't "eternal torture," but "eternal torment." Knowing<br>    that you are 100% separated from the love of God, and knowing that<br>    it was your own choices that put you in that position, would indeed<br>    be pretty much torment.<br>2.  There is a "lake of fire," but it is saved for Lucifer, the demons,<br>    and anyone else who ***consciously knows about God and rejects<br>    Him***. In other words, you'd have to be a person who says, "I know<br>    God exists. I know what God wants from me. I know God created me.<br>    And I choose, actively, to separate myself from Him and do my own<br>    thing and violate His rules because IDGAF." Those are the people who<br>    are headed for the lake of fire.<br><br>> **For Christians, basically every person I\'ve asked about this has<br>> given a different definition for hell. Any ideas why?**<br><br>The Bible talks about hell, but only in very general terms. Not a lot of<br>specifics, and certainly not something that the believer needs to worry<br>much about. There are a lot of references to the "eternal torment" of<br>hell, but not lots of specifics. The primary reason for this is that<br>*hell was not created for you.* Hell was created for Satan and the<br>demons. It is *our individual sin* which destines us for hell. We go<br>to hell because of what we do, and only what we do. We have all sinned,<br>each and every one of us. In our thoughts and in our words, in what we<br>have done, and what we have failed to do. Each of us has failed to meet<br>the mark, and have fallen short of God's glory. *This* is what makes<br>hell our ultimate destination, nothing more.<br><br>But having an accurate description of hell shouldn't be that big of a<br>deal. The point is that *if the only reason you want to love God is to<br>avoid hell, then you've got it all wrong anyway.*<br><br>You can comment if you didn't understand any of those points, and I'll<br>be happy to try to explain.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
