<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [What most of the answers are missing here is that<br>according to the Posse Comitatus Act, the military cannot enforce<br>civilian law, or act against citizens of the United States.\<br>\<br>The act of stopping any US citizen from firing a gun in a city or county<br>would first fall to the police. If there was an armed revolution, the<br>Governor would call out the National Guard. If the fully constituted<br>National Guard could not quell the insurrection, under the Insurrection<br>Act (the companion to the Posse Comitatus Act), the Governor can request<br>assistance from the US Government. Then, and only then, with the<br>President\'s approval, can the US military act to quash a revolution.\<br>\<br>It would have to be a mighty big revolution before the military<br>wouldn\'t be able to stop it.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
