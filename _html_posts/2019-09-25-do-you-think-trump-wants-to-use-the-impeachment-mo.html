<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Do you think Trump wants to use the impeachment movement to give a<br>stage to information that would cripple the Democratic Party?**<br><br>I think it would be icing on the cake.<br><br>But ultimately, it's not necessary. The Democrats have been on a 3-year<br>temper tantrum after losing an election they thought they had in the<br>bag, and there's no sign of them slowing down. Trump Derangement<br>Syndrome is a real thing, and they are all afflicted with it. And Trump<br>just sits back and watches them destroy themselves.<br><br>This movement to impeach the President (which is the Golden Goose they<br>think will win them the election) is yet another sign of TDS. If Bill<br>Clinton can survive an impeachment for an *actual crime* (lying to<br>Congress), Trump can survive an impeachment where no actual crime<br>occurred.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
