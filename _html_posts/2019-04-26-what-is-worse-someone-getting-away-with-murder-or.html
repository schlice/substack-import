<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>In criminal law, Blackstone's Ratio says:<br><br>> *It is better that ten guilty persons escape than that one innocent<br>> suffer.*<br><br>This was stated by the English jurist Sir William Blackstone in<br>[[*Commentaries on the Laws of<br>England*](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=54d21e&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commentaries_on_the_Laws_of_England){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}, the work which became<br>part of the foundation for what would later become the US Constitution.<br><br>Blackstone's Ratio was also re-stated by Benjamin Franklin, who said<br>\"it is better 100 guilty Persons should escape than that one innocent<br>Person should suffer.\"<br><br>It is a principle with which I wholeheartedly agree. I would rather see<br>ten murderers be exonerated than one innocent person be wrongfully<br>convicted of murder.<br><br>It's also interesting that those with authoritarian leanings tend to<br>think the other way. Apparently, both Bismarck and Pol Pot have said the<br>opposite, that it is better that "ten innocent men suffer than one<br>guilty man escape."<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
