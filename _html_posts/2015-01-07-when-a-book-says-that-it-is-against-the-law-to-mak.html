<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [The principle you are describing is called \"fair use.\"<br>Even the DMCA (the Digital Millennium Copyright Act) has provisions for<br>\"fair use.\" It allows for you to make a \"backup copy\" of the<br>material in question, for your own archival purposes. The stipulation is<br>that you only have one copy in use at any one time. This constitutes<br>\"fair use.\"\<br>\<br>Using a paper-bound book as an example, if you make a copy of the book<br>and then two people are reading the same book at the same time (the<br>actual book and the copy), this is a violation of copyright. You would<br>need to purchase a second copy of the book to be compliant. If you make<br>a copy of a book and you put the original book away and only use the<br>copy, this is considered \"fair use\" because your second copy is only<br>for archival.\<br>\<br>This is the same legal principle that allows you to \"rip\" the audio<br>from a CD and make it into MP3 files for you to use on your personal<br>audio player or phone. The CD still exists with the original music on<br>it, but it is not in use. If you\'re listening to your personal copy of<br>the CD in MP3 format, and someone else is listening to the actual<br>plastic CD in their car, this is a violation of copyright.\<br>\<br>This becomes hotly contested when a \"copy protection\" needs to be<br>broken in order to make a copy of the media. For example, \"fair use\"<br>says you can make a \"backup copy\" for archival. But what about<br>copy-protected DVDs? Can you break the encryption and make a backup copy<br>for yourself? This is an area of the DMCA which lies in contrast to<br>itself. You can make \"backup copies\", but you\'re not supposed to<br>break \"copy-protection\" schemes. So which provision wins? Your desire<br>to make a backup copy, or the industry\'s protection against copying?\<br>\<br>Many arguments for breaking copy protection on DVDs (to continue the<br>example) center around the inability to use the DVD on any system that<br>doesn\'t have a DVD drive (i.e. an iPad). \"Fair use\" means that I<br>should be able to use the content (since I\'m buying a license to the<br>content, not the actual plastic disc) on any device I choose. In order<br>to use the DVD on an iPad, you\'d have to break the encryption and<br>convert the movie to a format that will work on an iPad. The industry<br>has countered this argument by providing \"digital copies\" to online<br>movie streaming and storage companies like Vudu and Flixster using a<br>service like UltraViolet. But in many cases, the \"backup copy\" or<br>\"archival copy\" argument is still not addressed. Are you buying a<br>piece of plastic (which if it gets ruined, is now gone) or are you<br>buying the right to one copy of the content, in which case you have the<br>right to protect it?\<br>\<br>Essentially, this argument has gotten tabled, as the people with the<br>technical chops to break copy protection and make a usable copy of a DVD<br>for their own use or to make a backup copy is a very very small subset<br>of the people who buy a movie. Most of these people are honest, making<br>copies of movies they own (not rent) for their own personal archival. I<br>do this all the time. I will buy a movie and make a digital copy of the<br>movie on my NAS (if a digital copy is not provided). I then store the<br>original movie away in my storage area. I rarely touch the actual movie<br>again. But I can play the movie on any device in my home with ease, or<br>on my mobile devices.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
