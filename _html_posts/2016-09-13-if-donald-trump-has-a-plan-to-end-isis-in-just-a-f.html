<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Trump gave a speech in Philadelphia on September 7th, so presumably this<br>is the most up-to-date position the candidate has. This is what he said:<br><br>> TRUMP: Immediately after taking office, I will ask my generals to<br>> present to me a plan within 30 days to defeat and destroy ISIS.<br>><br>> AUDIENCE: (applause)<br>><br>> TRUMP: This will require military warfare but also cyber warfare,<br>> financial warfare, and ideological warfare as I laid out on my speech<br>> on radical Islamic terrorism several weeks ago. Instead of an apology<br>> tour \-- which you saw President Obama give over and over again \-- I<br>> will proudly promote our system of government and our way of life as<br>> the best in the world, just like we did in our campaign against<br>> communism during the Cold War.<br><br>So, being an uneducated deplorable, this sounds to me as if he will<br>actually get a plan in January, 2017. That doesn't mean he will share it<br>with all of us, all the time. Because "we" are not going to do any<br>stopping of anything, questioner. "We" are going to continue doing what<br>we do, and *the military* will take care of ISIS. That's why we pay<br>them so well.<br><br>That also doesn't mean that the Pentagon doesn't have a plan, or that<br>they don't have any ideas on how they will take on ISIS, right at this<br>very moment. It means that whatever plans they have are still<br>classified. Classified things are released on a "need to know" basis<br>(unless you're Hillary, then you give the terrorists access to<br>classified email whenever they feel like hacking your personal server).<br>Since you don't "need to know," you don't know.<br><br>Kinda makes sense, doesn't it? Your football team doesn't usually<br>publish its playbook on the Internet for everyone to read. We tend to<br>keep that sort of information "close to the vest" so that we can<br>(somewhat) retain the element of surprise. Maintaining "operational<br>security" (OPSEC) is an important tenet of warfighting.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
