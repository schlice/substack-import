<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Is the firing of FBI agent Peter Strzok against normal FBI rules<br>something worthy of an investigation\--possibly a Special Prosecutor?**<br><br>First of all, there are no "rules" to firings.<br><br>Your article in the Washington Compost says that they previously had<br>told Strzok that he would only face a demotion and suspension, not<br>that "rules" *required* such a punishment. Apparently, the FBI changed<br>its mind. There's nothing illegal or rule-breaking about that. It<br>apparently went against some earlier assurances that Strzok would not be<br>fired, but the employer does have the choice to fire an employee.<br><br>The FBI doesn't need to be investigated because they chose to fire an<br>employee. The FBI needs to be investigated for not firing an employee<br>*sooner*.<br><br>We knew since the DOJ filed its IG report on the Hillary investigation<br>that Strzok had some problems, saying that his text messages between<br>himself and his mistress, Lisa Page, "potentially indicated or created<br>the appearance that investigative decisions were impacted by bias or<br>improper considerations," and added that Strzok's behavior was "not only<br>indicative of a biased state of mind but, even more seriously, implies a<br>willingness to take official action to impact the presidential<br>candidate's electoral prospects." The report found that Strzok's<br>decision to put the Russia probe ahead of the Hillary investigation<br>could have been tainted by the same bias. The report said, "Under these<br>circumstances, we did not have confidence that Strzok's decision to<br>prioritize the Russia investigation over following up on the<br>Midyear-related investigative lead discovered on the Weiner laptop was<br>free from bias." Finally, the investigation determined that Strzok's<br>activities were "antithetical to the core values of the FBI and the<br>Department of Justice."<br><br>We knew since then that Strzok needed to go. If anything, the DOJ needs<br>to investigate why the FBI decided to keep him employed for as long as<br>they did following the findings in their IG's report.<br><br>At best, Strzok may be able to file a wrongful termination lawsuit<br>because he was such a longtime agent with a good record that he could<br>argue he had an "implied employment contract" with the FBI. However, the<br>IG report's findings regarding his conduct essentially imply that he<br>freely violated any actual or implied employment contract, and therefore<br>even a wrongful termination suit is unlikely to be successful.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
