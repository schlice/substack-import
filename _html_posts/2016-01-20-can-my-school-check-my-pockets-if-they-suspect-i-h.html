<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Schools are funny places when it comes to the law. You actually don\'t<br>have the same set of rights in a school that you have outside of a<br>school, because the school is required to maintain an orderly and safe<br>environment for all students.<br><br>If the school has a \"No Phones Allowed\" rule and that rule allows them<br>to physically search you for a phone, then they can do it. You\'ll have<br>to check the Student Handbook to see the actual rule.<br><br>You could also ask them to show you the rule.<br><br>If you don\'t think you were treated fairly or justly, have your parents<br>contact the principal and set up a meeting.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
