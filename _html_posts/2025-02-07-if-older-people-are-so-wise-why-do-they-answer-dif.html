<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>A core principle of good Bible understanding is what we call *exegesis*.<br>It flows from the understanding that the Bible never contradicts itself,<br>and therefore no two Bible passages will ever be in direct<br>contradiction. To that end, when someone asks a difficult Bible<br>question, we should allow the Bible to explain the Bible.<br><br>If we try to derive meaning beyond that process, we are in danger of<br>using *our own interpretation* to understand difficult Bible passages.<br>This is a process called *eisegesis*, and it almost always leads to an<br>incorrect interpretation of the Bible.<br><br>When we try to understand the Bible, the best way to do it is to let the<br>Bible explain the Bible.<br><br>As a matter of fact, if you were to chart out all of the Bible verses<br>that refer to other Bible verses, you can see just how *interconnected*<br>the Bible is. And if you were to, say, draw those connections out on a<br>line, with the length of the arc determining its color, you'd get a<br>chart that looks something like this:<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-14f49679969b76cb36043025f7255abd){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-14f49679969b76cb36043025f7255abd"<br>master_w="2000" master_h="1176"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>*(You might even say that the Bible is the first hyperlinked book in<br>history)*<br><br>This interconnection between the books of the Bible is incredible. And<br>not just because it is self-referential. It's incredible because the<br>timespan between the first book written and the last book written is<br>about 1500 years. And if you think that one of them just read the other<br>one and wrote the same thing, the books on the left side of the long<br>line in the middle, at the bottom, the separation between the Old<br>Testament and the New Testament, were written in different languages<br>(Hebrew on the left, Greek and Aramaic on the right), and on *three<br>different continents,* by no fewer than 40 different authors.<br><br>And yet, the Bible maintains a consistent message throughout, and never<br>contradicts itself. You think any book compiled by human authors, using<br>the same criteria, could accomplish such striking cohesiveness? Also,<br>where it references scientific facts or historical locations or people,<br>it is never incorrect about those. That doesn't make it a scientific<br>textbook, it just means that where it does mention scientific facts,<br>they are never wrong.<br><br>Other neat facts about this drawing: the shading along the bottom<br>indicates the different books of the Bible, and the lines below the<br>shaded areas show you the length of each chapter in the book. This is an<br>amazing visual representation showing just how deeply the Bible<br>references itself.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
