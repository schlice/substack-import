<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>We don't really know why the number was set at three *and not longer*.<br>We do know why it wasn't *fewer than* three days, but we don't know why<br>God chose *three* as the number of days to remain dead.<br><br>We know that it could not have been *less than* three days, because it<br>was Jewish belief at the time that the soul stayed with the body for<br>three days before departing. If He had only stayed dead for a day or<br>two, then it would have been easier for the Jews to claim that Jesus<br>never really died. We know that Jesus also intentionally delayed in<br>visiting Lazarus' tomb so that no one would be able to question the<br>miracle. God may have chosen three days for the same reason.<br><br>It is also possible that the death/resurrection timetable was timed<br>around the week: Jesus died on a Friday, Nisan 14, the day when the<br>Passover lamb was sacrificed. His death, the death of a perfect,<br>unblemished sacrifice on our behalf, mirrors the Passover lamb. Jesus is<br>often referred to as "the Lamb of God, who takes away the sins of the<br>world." His resurrection on the third day took place on the first day of<br>the week, illustrating a new beginning and new life. Thus, the choice of<br>day and the choice of the amount of time also appear to be very<br>symbolic.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
