<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>It's actually untrue. Atheists need *much more faith* **than<br>everyone else.**<br><br>What is faith? Faith is the distance we must travel between what we know<br>and what we believe. Faith begins where knowledge ends.<br><br>For example, can anyone be certain that gravity works on all dropped<br>objects? No, because no one has personally observed all dropped objects.<br>Gravity probably works on all dropped objects, and we probably have a<br>high degree of certainty that it does, but are we 100% certain? The<br>answer is no, but the amount of faith we need to believe that gravity<br>works on all dropped objects is pretty small, because all of our<br>observational evidence supports the belief that it does. Similarly, do<br>we know that all humans are mortal? No, it is possible that someone in<br>the past did not die, or that someone in the future will not die. We're<br>pretty sure, to a high degree of certainty, but we can never be 100%<br>sure. We can approach 100%, but we can never be 100% certain.<br><br>Answers like these are based on *induction*. And any answer based on<br>induction can never be 100% proven, only highly likely.<br><br>Christians believe that God exists. All of our observational evidence<br>tells us that He does. So it doesn't take too much faith for us to<br>believe that God exists. We believe that God exists beyond a reasonable<br>doubt, because all of the evidence we have points more towards a creator<br>rather than away from a creator. However, atheists believe that God does<br>not exist. They have zero evidence to support this belief. Therefore,<br>they need much more faith to believe that God does not exist than<br>theists need to believe that God does.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
