<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [There are two reasons that old, unenforced laws remain on<br>the books:\<br>\<br>1. Historical reference. Even the laws in a state show their own<br>historical roots, and can be used for historical reference. Removing old<br>laws removes the historical references which are present by their very<br>existence.\<br>2. Cost. It\'s expensive to change the law in a state. Law reference<br>books need addendums, posters need to be re-printed, etc. If the law is<br>not being enforced, why spend extra money when nothing is to be gained<br>from it?]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
