<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Erik Brunetti, owner of the "FUCT" clothing brand, will appear before<br>the Supreme Court to challenge a federal trademarking law that allows<br>officials to refuse trademarks that they deem "scandalous" or "immoral."<br>Can he win?**<br><br>He should win, and it's the very nature of the way that trademarks are<br>reviewed that should cause him to win.<br><br>First of all, the trademark office has been inconsistent with its<br>application of its own policy, which speaks against the state's<br>interest. Because the restriction on scandalous/immoral marks has been<br>so haphazardly applied, then perhaps the restriction is not as narrowly<br>tailored as previously thought. The government attributes<br>inconsistencies to "changes in contemporary attitudes and organic<br>outcomes inherent in a federal agency in which individual trademark<br>examiners consider more than 400,000 applications each year. " However,<br>it is this very inconsistency which may ultimately torpedo the<br>government's claim that there is indeed a compelling government<br>interest. For example, FCUK, THE F WORD, FVCK STREET WEAR, and F'D were<br>approved, but F U, EFFU, or FVCKED were not. The volume of<br>inconsistencies indicates that the government's argument may not be<br>valid.<br><br>Additionally, denying the trademark only denies the protections afforded<br>to trademarked marks; it doesn't prevent the mark from actually being<br>used. So the denial also does not advance at least one of the compelling<br>government interest as stated by the government (protecting the<br>sensibilities of the general public).<br><br>Brunetti's defense also turns on another trademark case, *Matal v. Tam*,<br>which also dealt with failure to register a trademark, this time for<br>trademarks deemed disparaging. The court stated that because the<br>trademark law denied registration based on what a substantial composite<br>of the reference group deemed disparaging, the government was actually<br>discriminating based on viewpoint. The court stated, "Giving offense is<br>a viewpoint," thus affording 1A protection to that viewpoint. The court<br>also noted the "haphazard record of enforcement" of the disparagement<br>bar, and stated that a significant number of marks had been registered<br>"that many would regard as disparaging to racial and ethnic groups."<br><br>Similarly in this case, the government denied registration because a<br>substantial composite of the reference group deemed the mark to be<br>phonetically similar to a vulgar term. Brunetti argues that again,<br>strict scrutiny is the appropriate standard because, as the *Tam* court<br>stated, giving offense is a viewpoint. Under the strict scrutiny<br>standard, therefore, the haphazard and inconsistent way in which<br>phonetically similar marks have been either approved or denied will<br>likely work against the government's case, undermining their contention<br>that there is a compelling governmental interest in denying a mark.<br><br>\<br><br>References:<br><br>Megan Carpenter, *Argument preview: Justices to consider<br>constitutionality of banning trademark registration for immoral and<br>scandalous marks*, SCOTUSblog (Apr. 8, 2019, 10:12 AM),<br>[https://www.scotusblog.com/2019/\...(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=56e533&url=https://www.scotusblog.com/2019/04/argument-preview-justices-to-consider-constitutionality-of-banning-trademark-registration-for-immoral-and-scandalous-marks/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="scotusblog.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
