<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**How about a 100% firearm background check? One could go to a FFL to do<br>a transfer, or could get a \$10 federal license that allowed them to buy<br>any legal weapon in any state. What do you think?**<br><br>It's the equivalent of what Illinois does with their FOID (Firearms<br>Owner ID) card system. Every gun owner must have a FOID card, and then<br>transactions are very simple: you confirm that the FOID card is still<br>valid, and away you go.<br><br>Expanding the system nationally would work if you had a simple web-based<br>method to check whether or not the card was still valid. Once the check<br>is complete, you get a transaction ID which proves you did the check,<br>and you're off to the races.<br><br>The system must be available, and the system must also default to<br>approve (like our current system) or the government could institute a<br>*de facto* gun ban by simply crashing the system. So if the system is<br>unavailable for X amount of time, you can legally presume the card is<br>still valid.<br><br>No need for a FFL for every transfer.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
