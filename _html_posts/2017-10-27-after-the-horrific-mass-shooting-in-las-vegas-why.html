<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>It's a bad idea because it can't be done. You'll spend billions of<br>dollars and accomplish nothing.<br><br>I read a comment a month or so ago, and it really stuck with me.<br><br>Guns exist. There are over 300 million of them in the United States. No<br>amount of legislation or celebrity endorsements or voodoo magic will<br>ever get rid of them. Ever. Even if you could, [[you can still make a<br>basic<br>one](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=bc2d4f&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Improvised_firearm){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container} out of some cheap parts<br>from your local home improvement store. The notion that we can legislate<br>guns away is simply flawed thinking. Even Australia's "successful" gun<br>buyback program got *at most* 1/3 of the nation's guns off of the<br>streets. In the United States, that would still leave us with over 200<br>million guns still available.<br><br>Guns can be used to help or to harm the innocent. Guns can also be used<br>to help or harm the guilty. The gun is nothing more than a tool. Wasting<br>our time pining over the fate of a small mechanical device is useless.<br>Our time is much better spent working on the actual issue causing<br>someone to desire to take up a gun.<br><br>But that's harder to deal with. It's much easier (and it scores<br>political points in some circles) to simply add/delete/change some<br>legislation around the gun.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
