<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Is it illegal for a 16 year old girl to date an 19 year old guy in<br>Colorado?**<br><br>There are no laws against dating (except the ones I enforce in my own<br>home).<br><br>There are laws against sex with underage people. However, in Colorado,<br>there is a "close-in-age" law. A person who is under 15 can<br>legally consent to have sex with someone who is **no more than 4 years<br>older. Additionally, a person under 17** can legally consent to sex<br>with a person who is no more than 10 years older.<br><br>So in your scenario, in Colorado, a 16 year old can consent to sex with<br>someone as old as 26, and it wouldn't be illegal.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
