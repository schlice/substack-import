<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>If you live in the United States, you do not have a "disability status"<br>recorded anywhere official.<br><br>According to the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), which is the<br>seminal law surrounding protection of rights for disabled persons, a<br>person is defined as having a disability if he or she is "a person who<br>has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or<br>more major life activities, a person who has a history or record of such<br>an impairment, or a person who is perceived by others as having such an<br>impairment."<br><br>Note that there are three facets to the definition:<br><br>- A person who has a physical or mental impairment that substantially<br>  limits one or more major life activities. This one is pretty<br>  self-explanatory. Someone with a physical limitation is considered<br>  disabled. A person with a hidden disability which substantially limits<br>  one or more major life activities is also considered disabled.<br>- A person who has a history or record of such impairment, as listed in<br>  the first bullet, is also considered as a person with disability, even<br>  if they do not currently have a disability.<br>- People who are not disabled but are perceived by others as being<br>  disabled are also protected under ADA.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
