<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>If that were the case, the enemy would put a red cross on every vehicle<br>they own, and you wouldn\'t be able to attack it!<br><br>Under the Law of Armed Combat, of a hospital, for example, is *also*<br>being used for other military uses (i.e. as a munitions depot,<br>communications center, or a command bunker), **it becomes a valid<br>military target.**<br><br>Actionable and reliable intel showing the facility being used for a<br>military purpose, *even if it is still being used as a hospital,* makes<br>it a valid military target. If DWB knew there were military operations<br>taking place in that facility, they should have packed up and left.<br><br>(EDIT) We don\'t know this was the case, and I\'m not simply trying to<br>defend the military by pointing out that any facility can be a military<br>target. But it does help to know the scope of this \"military target\"<br>exemption. For example, Hiroshima was a valid military target \-- there<br>was at least one factory and warehouse there. That made the city a valid<br>target for airstrikes.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
