<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Apparently, having sex in open houses, or "house humping" as it is<br>colloquially known, is a big thing.<br><br>But in terms of "responsibility," the realtor is ultimately responsible<br>for anything that happens during the open house. How you move forward is<br>between you and the agent, after you confront them.<br><br>If the agent knew it was going on (or worse, participated in it), then<br>it's probably time to get a new agent, and to file a complaint with the<br>agency in your area which regulates real estate agents.<br><br>If the agent did not know, then you should probably figure out how this<br>happened, and take steps to ensure that something like this will not<br>happen again. Perhaps the use (and advertisement) of video cameras in<br>use may deter these covert sex junkies from striking again.<br><br>Make sure you set solid ground rules with your agent, and make sure they<br>fully understand that they must monitor the people attending, and their<br>activities. There are some steps you can take: ensure that visitors sign<br>in and that IDs are checked. Ensure that the agent has enough assistance<br>that groups of visitors can be monitored throughout the house.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Is my realtor responsible for sex occurring in my home during an open<br>house? Apparently, a few perverts who like public sex had intercourse in<br>my daughter\'s bed.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
