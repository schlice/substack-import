<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>You\'re not comparing apples to apples here.<br><br>A correct comparison: "All of those plane crashes involve planes which<br>were loaded by jetways. When are we going to fix the problem of jetways<br>in this country?"<br><br>The reason: **aircraft crashes are as unrelated to the tool used to load<br>the plane as violence is unrelated to the tool used to commit the<br>crime.**<br><br>The gun doesn\'t cause violent behavior, just as the jetway doesn\'t<br>cause the plane to crash. Removing the gun won\'t stop crime (criminals<br>will use another tool) any more than removing the jetway will prevent<br>people from loading a plane (passengers will use a roll-up staircase).<br><br>Remember: guns don\'t make crime possible, only easier. Jetways don\'t<br>make loading planes possible, just easier.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
