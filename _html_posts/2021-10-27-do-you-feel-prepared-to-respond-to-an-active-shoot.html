<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Absolutely!<br><br>And you should too. If you don't, remember the following:<br><br>RUN, HIDE, FIGHT<br><br>Let's talk about these, in order. If you find yourself in an active<br>shooter situation:<br><br>1.  RUN. Get out if you can. Don't worry about going into off-limits<br>    areas. If you're in a restaurant, head for the kitchen and go out<br>    the back door. If you're in the mall, look for the maintenance<br>    hallway that leads to a service door. If you're on the ground floor<br>    of a building, look for a window you can open if you can't find a<br>    door. Once you find an exit, get as many people out as you can. Run<br>    a good block away from the scene and call 911.<br>2.  If you cannot get out, HIDE. Take cover. Try to find a room with<br>    only one entrance/exit. Maybe someplace you can barricade yourself<br>    inside. Take inventory of what you have in the room. Look for<br>    anything you can use as a weapon if you must, but then hunker down<br>    and stay put. Don't break cover until the police arrive. If you can,<br>    stay on the phone with 911 throughout.<br>3.  If the bad guys find you, do not hesitate, FIGHT. If you're not<br>    armed with a gun, arm yourself with whatever you have at your<br>    disposal. Coat racks, broken furniture, whatever you have. If you<br>    don't have anything you can use, attack with your fists and feet.<br>    Remember: you are the weapon, not the tool in the hand. Ignore<br>    the gun and fight for your life. Do not stop until one of you is<br>    dead, and oh by the way, make sure it's him.<br><br>Learn this. Memorize this. Don't forget it if you ever find yourself in<br>an active shooter situation.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Do you feel prepared to respond to an active shooter if necessary?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
