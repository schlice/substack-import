<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Thanks for the A2A.\<br>\<br>My #1 change would be to give it to the Army. It is a CAS fighter,<br>period. Let the Army fly it. Army Aviation is currently limited to<br>rotary-wing aircraft; I\'d say let them expand into fixed-wing CAS<br>rather than relying on the Apache for CAS. It suits their role better.\<br>\<br>But if the Air Force is to keep it, then they should double down on<br>their investment and rebuild it with all modern avionics and engines.<br>Keep the Vulcan of course, but rebuild the rest. And keep the manual<br>reversion, it has saved more pilots than I can tell<br>you.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
