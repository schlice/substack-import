<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What is the way to file an online police complaint on a man who cheats<br>a girl by engaging & leaves her before marriage?**<br><br>First of all, in the United States, breaking off an engagement is not a<br>crime. You don't need the police involved; they won't get involved<br>because, as I mentioned, it is not illegal to break off an engagement.<br><br>You can only file online complaints for routine items if your local<br>police department supports online reporting. For example, at my local<br>police department, I can report the following online:<br><br>Theft Of:<br><br>- Personal Belongings (*Where you or another person allowed the suspect<br>  to enter your property/residence.)*<br>- Car Parts<br>- License Plates<br>- Trailers with a VIN or license plate<br><br>Other Crimes:<br><br>- Damage to Your Property<br>- Vandalism to Your Property<br>- Property You Have Lost<br><br>Businesses Only:<br><br>- Gas Skips (No suspect information or license plate information)<br><br>Visit your local police department's website to see if they support<br>online reporting.<br><br>As for the breaking of the engagement, you might be able to file a<br>lawsuit and allege pain and suffering from the act, but I doubt you will<br>be successful. Marriage is a mutual agreement; just be glad that you<br>didn't actually marry the wrong person.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
