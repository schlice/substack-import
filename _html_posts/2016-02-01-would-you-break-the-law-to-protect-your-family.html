<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Thanks for the A2A Layla.<br><br>As with everything, I think the answer is \"it depends.\" The whole<br>reason we have a \"judicial system\" in the first place, and not just a<br>table of laws and appropriate punishments for violating those laws, is<br>that the law doesn\'t always adequately cover every conceivable<br>situation. This is also why there is a \"defense\" to violating the<br>letter of the law. So we know that the law is already designed to<br>address such a situation.<br><br>In any case, I would always try to find a legal method to protect my<br>family. But if the safety of my family was in immediate danger, I would<br>do whatever was necessary to safeguard them. As an example, I\'d run a<br>red light to get out of the way of someone who wasn\'t stopping behind<br>me and was going to hit me, and I\'d deal with the consequences later.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
