They then<br>capitalized on that manufactured controversy to make Biden look good.<br><br>However, in a vacuum, there is *nothing at all appealing* about Biden.<br>He is milquetoast, inept, and is showing borderline dementia and<br>pedophilia. Even today, the best thing you can say about Biden is that<br>"he's not Trump."<br><br>So they have to stick with what works, and really the most likeable<br>thing about Biden is that he's not Trump. So the media and the Democrats<br>must continually remind you that you voted for Biden because he's not<br>Trump. They will continually point out just how much Biden is not Trump<br>every time they talk about him.<br><br>They also have to consider that these moderates who bought into the idea<br>that Biden is better than Trump may be having some buyer's remorse now,<br>along with the fact that Trump is hinting that he may run again in 2024,<br>and polling is showing him *far and away* the top choice of any<br>potential 2024 candidate. So they have to start running against Trump<br>now, and will have to continue to do this as long as Trump continues to<br>hint that he's going to run.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Why do Democrats always answer a question about President Biden's<br>performance, then add a negative comment about former President Trump<br>who has nothing to do with President Biden\'s actions?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
