<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [You stated that you want guardianship to be able \"to sign<br>official papers and make some decisions.\"\<br>\<br>If that\'s the case, a power of attorney should be all you need. You can<br>then perform whatever parental duties are authorized in the power of<br>attorney documentation. You could sign as a guardian at the doctor\'s<br>office, or sign the child into and out of day care or school. The power<br>of attorney document is a powerful tool, and should provide you with<br>everything you need.\<br>\<br>I think becoming a guardian ad litem is a very big step with very big<br>consequences that you probably don\'t need to undertake.\<br>\<br>By the way, talking to a family practice attorney would have likely<br>yielded the same information. Many of them here where I live will do a<br>free initial consultation.\<br>\<br>And if you do want to move forward, I highly recommend you work through<br>your family attorney.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
