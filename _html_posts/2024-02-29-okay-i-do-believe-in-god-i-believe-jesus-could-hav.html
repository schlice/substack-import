<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Gandhi is once quoted as saying to the Pope, "I like your Christ; I<br>don't like your Christians. Your Christians are so unlike your Christ."<br>So you're not alone.<br><br>This isn't a problem endemic to Christianity. Haven't we had the same<br>problem with Islam? Islam is (we are told) a religion of peace, but<br>those radical jihadists who claim to kill in its name do seem to ruin it<br>for everyone, don't they? And as we are constantly told, those people do<br>not speak for all of Islam.<br><br>Similarly, those awful, judgmental people who call themselves Christian<br>do not speak for Christianity. They certainly do a great job giving<br>Christianity a bad name, but do you let a few bad apples spoil the<br>bushel? No, you pick out the bad apples and throw them away.<br><br>Rest on what you know. You know that God is real. You know that Jesus<br>came to earth and died for your sins. You know that faith is what saves<br>you, not anything you can do to earn your way into heaven. Rest on that<br>knowledge. Those people don't change your belief.<br><br>And find a better church. They are indeed out there. I've seen both<br>kinds, so I know they exist.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
