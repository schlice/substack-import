<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: [The problem is not with the depiction, or what is being<br>portrayed in the scene. Porn sites make a killing showing videos of<br>\"underage\" teens but they are not really underage. All of the actors<br>are actually at least 18 or older, but they appear younger.\<br>\<br>Using *actual* underage persons is the rub. Under the law, an underage<br>person cannot consent to sex. Depicting sex with an actual underage<br>person in a recorded medium run into problems related to production of<br>child pornography.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/If-child-pornography-is-illegal-then-why-is-rape-pornography-legal-in-some-places-Both-are-related-to-illegal-and-destructive-behaviours/answer/Bill-Stein<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
