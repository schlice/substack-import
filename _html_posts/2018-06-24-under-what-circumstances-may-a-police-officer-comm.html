<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Is it possible that police officer asks me to take my vehicle for<br>catching someone? Can he force me to do so? And who is responsible for<br>the vehicle in that case?**<br><br>Short answer, yes a police officer can take your vehicle in an<br>emergency. It is called "commandeering" a vehicle. Many states have laws<br>which make it a misdemeanor to fail to render assistance to the police.<br>Case law suggests that this obligation extends to your car, your<br>airplane, or anything else that the police reasonably consider helpful<br>in stopping a criminal or enforcing the law, and failing to do so could<br>subject you to fines.<br><br>Auto insurance is complicated and depending on the state, may require<br>that your insurance pay your benefits first. These are called "no-fault"<br>insurance states. In those states, your auto insurance will pay your<br>auto claims first, and then they will seek remuneration from the police<br>department's insurer, since the department commandeered the car. But<br>this is highly state and situation dependent, and would ultimately all<br>be sorted out by the insurance companies in question.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
