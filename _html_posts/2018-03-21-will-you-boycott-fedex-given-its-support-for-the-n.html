<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I may actually boycott FedEx for their stupid public statements entering<br>the gun debate when it has absolutely nothing to do with their business.<br><br>> FedEx Corporation's positions on the issues of gun policy and safety<br>> differ from those of the National Rifle Association (NRA). FedEx<br>> opposes assault rifles being in the hands of civilians.<br><br>UPS is no better either.<br><br>If only businesses could stick to their core business and not enter the<br>arena of public opinion, we'd all be better off.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
