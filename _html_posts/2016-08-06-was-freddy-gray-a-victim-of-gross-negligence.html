<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Negligence is a failure to exercise reasonable care.<br><br>Gross negligence is a conscious and voluntary disregard for the need<br>to exercise reasonable care, and which usually results in grave harm to<br>people or property.<br><br>Both terms arise from a failure to exercise reasonable care, but simple<br>negligence can be due to unconscious (or accidental) failure to exercise<br>reasonable care, where gross negligence generally implies conscious (or<br>intentional) disregard for the need to exercise reasonable care. Gross<br>negligence is conscious indifference to, or the complete disregard for,<br>reasonably foreseeable consequences which would arise from the failure<br>to exercise reasonable care.<br><br>I think you\'d have a hard time proving gross negligence, especially<br>since the police were already acquitted of criminal charges. Finding<br>that they consciously disregarded the need to exercise reasonable care<br>in prisoner transport is unlikely. They did follow all transport rules<br>which were in place at the time. They actually didn\'t have a mandatory<br>seat belt rule at the time Gray was transported.<br><br>Simple negligence is going to be easier to prove, but to what end? Even<br>gross negligence isn\'t enough to award punitive damages. You need to<br>prove willful or wanton misconduct before you can recover punitive<br>damages. Negligence claims can usually only recover actual damages.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
