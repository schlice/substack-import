<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Do 80% of Americans favor gun control as stated by the White House<br>press secretary?**<br><br>Remember the old phrase: *There's lies, damned lies, and statistics.*<br><br>So sure, 80% of Americans favor "gun control" depending on how you ask<br>them the question.<br><br>Most questions are related to background checks, and yes, most Americans<br>favor requiring background checks on all gun transfers. When asked just<br>this question, they usually respond yes.<br><br>It's easy to say "yes, I want that" but it's less easy to understand<br>*how* you go about implementing that (which is difficult), and *how to<br>pay for it* (as it will be very expensive).<br><br>So while we may "want" that, it certainly doesn't mean we want to do<br>everything possible in order to pay for it. And no universal background<br>check system has ever been implemented in a way in which anyone would<br>refer to as "smart." They simply state that **all gun transfers require<br>a background check, period.** But what does that functionally mean? If I<br>want to gift a gun to my wife, I have to get a background check done on<br>her. If I want to buy my 18 year old son a plinking rifle, I have to get<br>a background check on him. Laws in the four states which have them have<br>been reported to have no better than a 5% compliance rate because of how<br>unworkable they are in practice.<br><br>And are we really catching any criminals here? Are we really preventing<br>gun crime? Or are we really inconveniencing lawful gun owners more than<br>stopping crime?<br><br>And ***absolutely none of that has anything to do with what we really<br>feel about "gun control," whatever that means.***<br><br>So it's easy to distort statistics to make them say whatever you want.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
