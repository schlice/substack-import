<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Why does my dog make a hole and put his food in there then dig is<br>closed? She usually does that with bread or bones.**<br><br>When dogs in the wild kill an animal, they will often bury the leftovers<br>to come back to at a later time. This way, they won't go hungry if they<br>don't have a fresh kill.<br><br>When domesticated dogs display the same behavior, it could be for a<br>number of reasons:<br><br>1.  You may be overfeeding your dog. If it doesn't want to eat the<br>    food it has, it may bury it for later.<br>2.  Sometimes, dogs will mimic this behavior with toys. If it has too<br>    many toys, it may play with them by burying them to save for later.<br>3.  When the items are not necessarily related directly to the dog, and<br>    maybe more to you (like the TV remote or your cell phone), the dog<br>    may be trying to encourage you to play by burying items it perceives<br>    are important to you.<br>4.  Sometimes, dogs bury food because they don't feel comfortable in<br>    their environment, or because they feel stressed. The act of digging<br>    calms the dog down, and burying food gives them a feeling that they<br>    can eat in peace at some time later.<br><br>If a dog does this too much, the stress of managing all of the stashes<br>can actually make the dog *more* stressed than before, which just<br>makes the problem worse.<br><br>If your dog is stress-burying, make sure that the environment that the<br>dog is eating in is less stressful. It should be able to eat without<br>being disturbed. Ideally, your dog should eat even with you being<br>present, without feeling stressed.<br><br>And if your dog is burying its excess food, the answer is simple: don't<br>overfeed your dog! Talk to your vet about appropriate portion sizes, or<br>maybe limiting the number of times per day you feed your dog (i.e. cut<br>it down from three to two).<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
