Probably.<br><br>If they are smart, they monitor *all* traffic in and out of the<br>network. They have automated systems that look for *keywords* that might<br>indicate company sensitive information is leaving the network.<br><br>You using a company network to IM implies your consent to such<br>monitoring.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
