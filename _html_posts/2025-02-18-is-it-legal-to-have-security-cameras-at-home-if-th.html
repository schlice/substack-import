<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>It's even legal to have security cameras at home even if they<br>incidentally capture neighboring properties.<br><br>You have a right as a homeowner to protect your property with security<br>cameras, even if, while in the course of protecting your own property,<br>you incidentally capture your neighbor's property.<br><br>Now, if your neighbor has a problem with your camera, it is hoped that<br>in polite society, they come talk to you. You can show them your camera<br>feed, and if it is still unacceptable to them, perhaps you can both work<br>out a better location for the camera that still protects your property<br>while not unduly capturing their property as well.<br><br>But all that aside, nothing say you have to move it, pissed off neighbor<br>or not. So long as you are not purposefully pointing your camera at your<br>neighbor's property or their doors or windows, it is still legal. If the<br>only positioning to properly protect your property still incidentally<br>captures theirs, *c'est la vie.*<br><br>Incidentally, some cameras have a "privacy mask" feature, allowing you<br>to voluntarily block out portions of your camera feed (for example, if<br>it is capturing your neighbor's property) for just this reason. You can<br>show this feature to your neighbor and show them you are making a good<br>faith effort to not observe their property. Of course, there is a<br>downside for your neighbor. If your camera could have captured something<br>that happened in their yard, they (and the police) lose that opportunity<br>to have captured that incident. Your neighbor could have gotten free<br>security monitoring on your dime, but they gotta take the bad with the<br>good in some cases, I guess.<br><br>And as always, check your state and local laws before you put up<br>cameras.<br><br>\<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*This answer is not a substitute for professional legal advice or a<br>solicitation to offer legal advice regarding specific facts.
