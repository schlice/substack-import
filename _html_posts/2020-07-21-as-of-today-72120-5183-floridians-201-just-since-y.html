<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**As of today, 7/21/20, 5,183 Floridians (201 just since yesterday) have<br>died under Gov. Ron DeSantis\' watch. What do you think of his response<br>to the pandemic?**<br><br>Florida resident here, so I actually have some skin in the game.<br><br>Yes, we have had deaths. But compared to the number of deaths (per<br>100,000) in other areas of the country, *Florida doesn't even move the<br>needle.* Florida is 25th in the country in terms of deaths per 100K<br>residents. New York City is first, with 278.7 (NY as a state has 78.9).<br>Florida has 23.4. The list of states with more deaths per 100K residents<br>is pretty extensive, and includes NJ, CT, MA, RI, DC, NY, LA, MI, IL,<br>MD, PA, DE, MS, IN, AZ, CO, GA, NH, MN, NM, OH, AL, IA, and<br>VA.\[1\](#EpUav){#cite-EpUav .citation_link}<br><br>I bet you're surprised to hear that. That's because you're not being<br>told the whole story. You're being told every day that there are<br>X-thousand number of new cases in Florida, breaking all previous one-day<br>records. Without additional context, however, this only tells you the<br>pervasiveness and the effectiveness of our testing. Are these people<br>symptomatic? Were they hospitalized? Not even close. You're also being<br>told that "doing more testing" is not a valid reason for seeing more<br>cases. Really? As of this week, we're now testing *anyone who walks in<br>the door and says they want to be tested.* Just two weeks ago, you had<br>to be symptomatic and over 65, even at our drive-up testing locations.<br>Today, anyone can drive in and get tested. And we're finding lots of<br>people who are asymptomatic.<br><br>And with the *record* numbers of people reporting that they are<br>infected, our low death rates are a testament to the fact that Florida<br>took steps to protect the most vulnerable among us: the elderly. As you<br>know, Florida has *whole cities* of nothing but retirees (i.e The<br>Villages). We put strict rules in place to protect those communities.<br>For example, unlike New York, we don't return COVID-positive seniors<br>back to their homes. We set up twelve COVID-positive assisted living<br>facilities around the state; that's where seniors go when they test<br>positive, not back to their communities to infect others.<br><br>You're also being told that ICUs are filling up. Again, data without<br>context, just to scare you. Are those all COVID patients? Actually, only<br>around 15% of ICU patients are COVID cases. The rest? Remember when<br>people were deferring hospital visits and surgeries because they were<br>afraid to go to the hospital? Now they're coming in, and their<br>conditions are worse than before. So (surprise, surprise) they have to<br>go to the ICU for care. So ICU capacity is down because we're seeing<br>more ICU patients for lots of reasons, some only tangentially related to<br>the pandemic. Also, hospitals have put plans in place to essentially<br>double their ICU capacity *if they need to*. They don't need to, yet.<br>But you're still being told that there is no ICU space. Data without<br>context.<br><br>You're being told that there are all of these counties in Florida that<br>have no ICU capacity. A grain of truth in a sea of misinformation. Many<br>rural counties in Florida *have no ICU capacity, period.* Their critical<br>cases must be shipped to a larger city nearby for intensive care.<br>They've *never* had ICU capacity.<br><br>It does appear that this information is selectively and creatively being<br>reported, *just to scare you.* Don't let the media win. Don't let them<br>scare you! The number of people who are reporting as positive does not<br>equal the number of people showing symptoms. And the number of people<br>dying is dropping every day.<br><br>\<br><br>*Sorry, I didn't add my standard caveat.*<br><br>*For the time being, I have re-enabled comments on selected answers.<br>Some people like to comment. Some people like to engage with me in a<br>civil manner, and I did kinda miss that\...a little. But do not<br>misunderstand, I take this step very cautiously. My mental well-being<br>isn\'t worth your harassing, inane behavior. If you don\'t like what I<br>wrote, tough shit. If my answer is grammatically low-quality or is<br>un-cited opinion masquerading as fact, downvote it. If you think I\'m<br>wrong, write your own answer. But Quora is a question-and-answer site,<br>not a debate site. If you are simply commenting to tell me \"ackshually,<br>you\'re wrong,\" don\'t be surprised if I quietly delete your comment.<br>Put anything vaguely harassing in there, and your deletion will be<br>followed by a block and a mute. I will do this immediately and with no<br>compunction. You have been warned. Be nice.*<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-EpUav){.citation_index} [[CDC COVID Data<br>Tracker](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=496b84&url=https://www.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/%23cases){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="cdc.gov"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
