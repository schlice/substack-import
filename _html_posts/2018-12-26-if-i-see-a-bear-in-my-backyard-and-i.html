<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If I see a bear in my backyard and I\'m between it and my house, what<br>should I do?**<br><br>Go inside.<br><br>Black bears are not prone to attacking you without being provoked. That<br>doesn't mean they're like puppies, but they certainly are much less<br>aggressive than grizzlies. Just walk backwards, keep your eyes near the<br>bear (I suggest looking at his feet and not locking eyes with him) until<br>you get to your house and go inside. They should leave you alone.<br>Grizzlies are much more dangerous, but follow the same basic rules: make<br>yourself look big (if you're wearing a coat, open it up and hold it open<br>like a cape), walk backwards, don't make eye contact (look at the legs<br>or feet), and slowly but methodically make your way back to your house<br>and go inside.<br><br>Bears with cubs are a whole other ballgame. All momma bears are going to<br>be protective of their cubs, so if there are cubs in the mix, you<br>definitely want to back up slowly, not make any threatening moves, but<br>keep backing up until you get into your house.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
