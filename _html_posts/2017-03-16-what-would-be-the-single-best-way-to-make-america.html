<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>> *What would be the single best way to make America get rid of arms<br>> from civillians \sic\?*<br><br>I added "Hypothetical Scenarios" to your list of topics, because this<br>will never happen. You need a Constitutional amendment to overturn<br>rights enumerated in the Bill of Rights (several depending on how you<br>want to hunt down all these guns), and a clear majority of the American<br>people voting for it. Not to mention the vast majority of states have<br>similar rights in their Constitutions, and they are independent, so<br>states would also have to choose to alter their own Constitutions. Since<br>you will never get all of this to happen, it's most definitely a<br>hypothetical.<br><br>The design of the United States is one that encourages *individual*<br>responsibility for one's own safety. Understanding this, to get rid of<br>civilian ownership of guns, you would have to start by making it so that<br>someone else is responsible for your safety. To wit: you need a police<br>officer for every citizen. So instead of the roughly 800,000 to<br>1,000,000 police officers we have nationwide now, you would need **150<br>times** more police officers (approximately 150 million officers). You<br>would then have to assign an officer to every man, woman, and child in<br>the country (the remaining 150 million people), to be their personal<br>bodyguards. In this way, the citizenry would not be responsible for<br>their own safety, and would not need firearms.<br><br>Maybe someday when our personal robotic assistants (think of the movie<br>*I, Robot* starring Will Smith) can also be our personal bodyguards, we<br>can remove the right of citizens to be armed. Until that day, and until<br>you *fundamentally change the United States,* firearms will always<br>be a part of the very foundation and fabric of this country. If you<br>remove a brick from the foundation, the rest of the structure is<br>immeasurably weakened. Firearms are a fundamental part of the foundation<br>of the United States. They cannot be so easily removed without<br>irreparably damaging the entire nation.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
