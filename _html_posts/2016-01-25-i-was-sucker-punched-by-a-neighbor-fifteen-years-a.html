<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Depends on a lot of things. How do you feel about this person now? Do<br>you want to have a relationship with this person again?<br><br>If you feel okay about this person and you want to have a relationship<br>with him again, welcome him back, tell him \"no hard feelings,\" and<br>move forward.<br><br>If you feel okay about him and you don\'t want to have a relationship<br>with him again, welcome him back and leave it at that.<br><br>If you don\'t feel okay about him, then ignore him. If he starts with<br>you, file for a restraining order and use the previous call as your<br>justification.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
