<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [That\'s an easy one. Just figure out how often you plan on<br>using health services throughout the next few years.\<br>\<br>*But how is that easy? Do you have a crystal ball?*\<br>\<br>It is easy. For example, if you check my bio, you\'ll see pretty plainly<br>that I have MS. Therefore, it\'s a pretty good bet that I\'m going to<br>use a higher-than-average amount of fairly pricey health services<br>throughout the next year (I\'ll assume for brevity that you\'re looking<br>only to the next year). And while my kids are generally healthy, we seem<br>to have a genetic (or familial) predisposition to allergies. We have to<br>keep a very clean home, but that still means only a few sinus infections<br>per quarter, instead of continuous sinus infections. So I know that my<br>kids will not only be consumers of many over-the-counter decongestants,<br>allergy medications, and nasal sprays, we will also have many trips to<br>the doctor for diagnosis and treatment of sinus infections. So I know<br>that my *visits* to the doctor are going to be higher than average.\<br>\<br>Therefore, for me and my family, lower deductibles are better than<br>lower premiums. I understand I\'m going to pay higher premiums, but<br>based on the number and frequency of my expected visits to the doctor,<br>the lighter weight of my deductibles will be a much lighter burden to<br>take on, even considering the extra burden of a higher premium.\<br>\<br>This is why you have the option of a plan with either a higher<br>deductible, or a higher premium. If you and your family are generally<br>healthy, and usually only visit the doctor for acute conditions (i.e.<br>not chronic) or annual physicals (which are usually 100% covered by<br>insurance anyway), you should opt for the plan with the lower premiums<br>(saving you money deducted from your paycheck), but higher deductibles<br>out of pocket if you have to access medical services. If, however, you<br>are like my family, with some chronic conditions that keep us regularly<br>visiting the doctor, you might consider opting for a higher premium in<br>exchange for lower out of pocket expenses.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
