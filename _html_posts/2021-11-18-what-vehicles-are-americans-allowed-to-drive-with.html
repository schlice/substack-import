<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>First of all, every state is different, and the specifics about what is<br>covered under each state's specific driver's licenses varies from state<br>to state.<br><br>However, most non-commercial driver's licenses are valid for passenger<br>vehicles up to 15 passengers (including the driver) with Gross Vehicle<br>Weight Rating (GVWR) of 26,000 pounds (11,793 kg) or less, which would<br>include most cars, trucks, and RVs, as well as two or three-wheeled<br>motor vehicles with smaller than 50cc engines (like mopeds or small<br>scooters).<br><br>If you want to drive anything larger, or anything that holds more than<br>15 passengers, you will need an *endorsement* on your license. This<br>usually involves a separate test (possibly a driving test as well), and<br>a separate fee for each endorsement.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>What vehicles are Americans allowed to drive with their car licence?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
