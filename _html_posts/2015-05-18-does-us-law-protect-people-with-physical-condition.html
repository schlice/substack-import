<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [*If I get a medical diagnosis for this condition, does the<br>law offer me the same protections against discrimination as those set<br>out for people one the autism spectrum?*\<br>\<br>Yes. Employers must provide reasonable accommodations to anyone with a<br>medically-recognized disability.\<br>\<br>*Do I have the right to ask for a low-sensory work environment, barring<br>noise that is inherent to the job itself?*\<br>\<br>You have the right to ask, but that doesn\'t mean that the business will<br>comply 100% of the time. Whether or not you can get accommodations<br>depends on whether or not the accommodations are \"reasonable.\"<br>Reasonableness is determined by whether or not the accommodation will<br>make a material difference in the way that the business is run, or would<br>create an undue hardship on the business.\<br>\<br>Several items are reviewed to see if an accommodation is not<br>reasonable:\<br>\<br>]<br><br>- the nature and cost of the accommodation needed;<br>- the overall financial resources of the facility making the reasonable<br>  accommodation; the number of persons employed at this facility; the<br>  effect on expenses and resources of the facility;<br>- the overall financial resources, size, number of employees, and type<br>  and location of facilities of the employer (if the facility involved<br>  in the reasonable accommodation is part of a larger entity);<br>- the type of operation of the employer, including the structure and<br>  functions of the workforce, the geographic separateness, and the<br>  administrative or fiscal relationship of the facility involved in<br>  making the accommodation to the employer;<br>- the impact of the accommodation on the operation of the facility.<br>  \1\\<br><br>For example, if your workstation can be located in a low-sensory area of<br>the building without a tremendous expense, then that would be an<br>accommodation that would be considered \"reasonable.\" If the business<br>had to build you a special low-sensory room to work in, depending on the<br>cost of such a construction and the gross revenue of the business, that<br>may not be considered \"reasonable.\" If the accommodation substantially<br>impacts the business and/or changes the way they do business, it may not<br>be considered reasonable.\<br>\<br>\1\ [[REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION AND UNDUE HARDSHIP UNDER THE AMERICANS<br>WITH DISABILITIES<br>ACT](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=baa18a&url=http://www.eeoc.gov/policy/docs/accommodation.html){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="eeoc.gov"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
