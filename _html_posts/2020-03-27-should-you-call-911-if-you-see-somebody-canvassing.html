<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Should you call 911 if you see somebody canvassing your neighborhood<br>with hate-speech filled pamphlets?**<br><br>If there is a crime in progress, or a crime is imminent, you should call<br>the police.<br><br>But distributing leaflets is not a crime, unless the person is clearly<br>trespassing. Distributing leaflets, or "flyposting," is not generally<br>considered to be a crime. The contents of the leaflets does not<br>generally modify the legality of the activity. The only exception is<br>religion, which is even more protected than general information<br>leaflets.<br><br>I suggest you check with your local city to see if you have an ordinance<br>against flyposting, or if you live in an HOA-controlled neighborhood,<br>see if your HOA allows flyposting. If it does, you might discuss<br>changing that with your HOA.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
