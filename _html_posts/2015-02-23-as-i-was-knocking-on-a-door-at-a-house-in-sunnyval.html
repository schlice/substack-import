<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Even in states that enforce the \"castle doctrine,\" you<br>would have to be *in his home, uninvited* before he might perceive you<br>as a threat and shoot at you.\<br>\<br>In the rare cases where someone has been shot outside of the house (i.e.<br>just on the property), they were, indeed, a clear threat or a known<br>threat (from the past), either attacking the door attempting to gain<br>entry, or brandishing a weapon.\<br>\<br>Beyond these two cases, you must pose some identifiable threat before<br>you can be shot. The FedEx guy does not pose a threat, nor does the mail<br>carrier. A homeowner can demand you leave their property, and if you<br>fail to do so, the worst that homeowner can do is call the police and<br>have you cited for trespassing. He has no legal grounds to shoot<br>you.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
