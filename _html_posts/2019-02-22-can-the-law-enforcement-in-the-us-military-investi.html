<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Can the law enforcement in the US military investigate off base, even<br>if it\'s miles away, especially if it has to do with an abuse of<br>military equipment?**<br><br>Yes, military investigators will work closely with state and local law<br>enforcement if they have to investigate a case outside of a military<br>base. However, they don't need to get permission from anyone to pursue a<br>case.<br><br>Similarly, military police can follow a suspect off base if that suspect<br>is fleeing, and their authority to effect that arrest will follow the<br>suspect. It is called the "hot pursuit" rule.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
