<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [\"Regularly\" is a pretty big word. I don\'t think banks<br>\"regularly\" pay billions in fines.\<br>\<br>Jail time is only indicated if criminal law is broken. Generally, there<br>is no \"crime\" involved in bank misconduct. Banks are regulated by<br>banking regulation, and can face fines by their constitutient<br>organizations if they violate those regulations, but those regulation<br>violations are not criminal violations of any Federal, state, or local<br>law.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
