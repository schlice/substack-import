<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [People v Sesslin (68 Cal.2d 421)\<br>\<br>This is the only case law in California I can find talking about<br>information and belief, and it is in relation to issuance of warrants.\<br>\<br>The case: Defendant and Frank Harper were charged with seven counts of<br>forgery and two counts of grand theft. Defendant and Harper waived trial<br>by jury and stipulated that the trial judge decide the case on the<br>transcript of the preliminary hearing. The trial court found defendant<br>guilty of one count of forgery and dismissed the other eight counts<br>against defendant. Defendant appealed.\<br>\<br>The CA Supreme Court held, among other things, that an arrest warrant<br>issued solely upon the complainant\'s \"information and belief\" cannot<br>stand if the complaint or an accompanying affidavit does not allege<br>underlying facts upon which the magistrate can independently find<br>probable cause to arrest the accused, and sections 806, 813, and 952 of<br>the Penal Code do not authorize the issuance of warrants of arrest based<br>solely upon complaints couched in the language of the charged offense<br>and therefore do not violate the Fourth Amendment.\<br>\<br>The only other item I might be able to offer (at a Federal level) is the<br>Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 which contains strict<br>requirements for pleading allegations on information and belief. It<br>states that plaintiffs must \"state with particularity all facts on<br>which that belief is formed.\" The most recent example of a case citing<br>this law was *in re Silicon Graphics* (*In re* Silicon Graphics, Inc.<br>Sec. Litig., 183 F.3d 970, 985 (9th Cir. 1999)). In that case, the court<br>explained "that a plaintiff must provide, in great detail, all the<br>relevant facts forming the basis of her belief. It is not sufficient for<br>plaintiff\'s pleadings to set forth a belief that certain unspecified<br>sources will reveal, after appropriate discovery, facts that will<br>validate her claim."\<br>\<br>So under both California and Federal law, claims based on \"information<br>and belief\" don\'t hold much weight.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
