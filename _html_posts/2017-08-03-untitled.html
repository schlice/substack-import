<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>> *They can detain you while waiting for a judges order. Or bring over a<br>> dog.*<br><br>Actually, that's not true. The courts have ruled that an officer may not<br>detain you longer than it would take to conduct a traffic stop. They<br>cannot detain you while you wait for a drug dog. And they definitely<br>cannot detain you while they wait to get a warrant. Anything like this<br>happening would mean that the search, and anything found during the<br>search, would be thrown out of court.<br><br>Remember, this won't stop the action at the side of the road. It would<br>only invalidate anything found during the search. That's why you do what<br>you're told at the scene, and then get a lawyer to help you with the<br>legal parts.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/What-would-a-police-officer-do-if-they-smelled-an-odor-similar-to-marijuana-coming-from-a-car-they-pulled-over-and-are-told-the-driver-does-not-give-consent-to-a-search/answer/Michael-Gordon-57<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
