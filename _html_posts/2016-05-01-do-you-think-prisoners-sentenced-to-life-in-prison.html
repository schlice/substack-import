<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [They do, in far greater numbers than you might realize.<br>It\'s called suicide.\<br>\<br>As for a convict converting his life sentence to a death sentence,<br>never going to happen. Where the death sentence is carried out, the<br>bar that must be hurdled is very high.\<br>\<br>As an example, remember James Holmes? He was the Aurora (Colorado)<br>theater shooter. He was 2/3 of the way through the process to be<br>sentenced to death and phase three found that he would be better served<br>by spending life in a mental institution. While my desire for<br>retribution is pretty high, the ruling was correct. Holmes is most<br>definitely insane. He shouldn\'t die at the state\'s hand because he is<br>mentally diseased. He also shouldn\'t get to opt in to his own death,<br>for the same reason.\<br>\<br>And also, suicide is technically illegal, so the state cannot condone<br>it.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
