<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>So as we know, God is *spirit*. He does not have a body. He does not<br>have an image.<br><br>If we create an image for God (such as the most common image: the old<br>man with the long flowing white hair), we tend to think of God in *human<br>form.*<br><br>And when we think of God as a *human*, we think of God with **human<br>limitations**.<br><br>So the danger with thinking of God based on an image we create is that,<br>even in our minds, we tend to *limit* God. We *constrain* Him to<br>the image we created.<br><br>Thinking of God with any limits at all does a disservice to our<br>understanding of Him. God is limitless. He is omnipotent and<br>omnipresent, two qualities which are uniquely unsuited to thinking of<br>Him in any form we can imagine.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
