<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>*(US answer only, your country's bike laws may be different)*<br><br>The only way a bike lane would be deemed "unsafe" is if there is a<br>hazard in the bike lane (i.e. ice, loose gravel, etc). This occasionally<br>happens after sand/gravel is used during a snowstorm and then the snow<br>melts before street sweepers can get out to pick up the sand/gravel. The<br>passing vehicles will tend to push the sand and gravel into the bike<br>lane.<br><br>If that is true, or if any other hazard exists in the bike lane, the<br>bicyclist can ride in the traffic lane, as close to the bike lane as is<br>safely possible, on the right hand side of the vehicle lane, as if the<br>bike lane wasn't even there. Follow the same traffic laws you would<br>follow if there were no bike lane there in the first place: ride as<br>close to the shoulder as is safe to do so, move into the lane to cross<br>an intersection, move into a turn lane to make a left turn, etc.<br><br>If there is an issue with a bike lane, please report it to your city's<br>street maintenance division as soon as is practical.<br><br>And as always in the US, state laws vary wildly from state to state, and<br>your state may have different laws than the general guidelines I<br>presented here. Never take anything you read on the Internet as a<br>substitute for doing your own research into your own local traffic laws,<br>especially if you are planning on riding a bike in traffic.<br><br>\<br><br>*For the time being, I have re-enabled comments on selected answers.<br>Some people like to comment. Some people like to engage with me in a<br>civil manner, and I did kinda miss that\...a little. But do not<br>misunderstand, I take this step very cautiously, and I have no tolerance<br>for harassing or inane behavior. If you don\'t like what I wrote, tough<br>shit. If my answer is grammatically low-quality or is un-cited opinion<br>masquerading as fact, downvote it. If you think I\'m wrong, write your<br>own answer. But Quora is a question-and-answer site, not a debate site.<br>If you are simply commenting to tell me \"ackshually, you\'re wrong,\"<br>don\'t be surprised if I quietly delete your comment. Put anything<br>vaguely harassing in there, and your deletion will be followed by a<br>block/mute, and a BNBR report. I will do this immediately and with no<br>compunction. You have been warned. Be nice.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
