<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>As everyone has said, you can do it anywhere except for DC, where<br>"political affiliation" is a protected class.<br><br>However, you'll have to find a legal and *reliable* way to determine<br>exactly what political party a person is registered for. And since party<br>affiliation is not public record, I'd think you would have a very hard<br>time doing so.<br><br>And what if they're not registered? Or Independent? Will you refuse<br>service based on how they voted? That is protected information, so it's<br>unlikely you'd be able to find out.<br><br>The problem is that you must refuse service to *every Republican*, not<br>only the ones you can identify visually, or the ones who self-identify.<br>You must refuse service equally, or you are violating the 14th<br>Amendment. You must refuse service equally if you are going to do so at<br>all.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
