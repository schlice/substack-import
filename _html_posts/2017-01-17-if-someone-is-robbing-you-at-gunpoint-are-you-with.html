<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>In order to use lethal force against a person, you must be in fear for<br>your life.<br><br>I would speculate that someone who has a gun pointed at them probably<br>fears for his life at that very moment. This means that the use of<br>deadly force would be justified.<br><br>It's for this reason that they have created this little gem:<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-7b04ff9ec206b479e8f8198fe5cd092b){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-7b04ff9ec206b479e8f8198fe5cd092b" master_w="300"<br>master_h="300"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>The gun wallet.<br><br>This is a Ruger LCP in a gun wallet. Inside your pocket, it "prints"<br>like a wallet, not like a gun. That means the outline of the object in<br>your pocket looks like a wallet. The bad guy has no reason to suspect<br>that you're actually drawing a gun, not a wallet.<br><br>For the person who gets drawn on and when that suspect demands money,<br>drawing this instead might save your life. I'd be firing this and<br>running for cover at the same time.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
