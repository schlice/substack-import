<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Can you just go to a remote island and build a house to live in the<br>rest of your life? What about taxes? What about owning the property? Can<br>a government just take your house you built without buying the land or<br>permits if they ever found you?**<br><br>There are a scant few areas on Earth which are not owned by any country,<br>and each one of those areas is functionally uninhabitable. For the most<br>part, all of the habitable land on Earth is owned by some country.<br><br>When that country owns that land, they have the right to allow you to<br>live there, or not.<br><br>You can definitely go buy a private island and live there, but you are<br>buying that island *from some entity*, usually some country. You will<br>have to pay ownership tax on that property.<br><br>So it sounds like you are asking if you can just go *squat* on an island<br>and claim squatter's rights. In essence, you can. You can't be summarily<br>thrown off the island in a single day, as property right claims are a<br>civil matter, so you won't be arrested unless you're trespassing on<br>someone else's property. But after a certain amount of time, you will be<br>discovered and you will be evicted.<br><br>Your best bet to do this legally is to buy a houseboat and go out to<br>international waters. You can literally live there for the rest of your<br>life, plus you can put in to shore to re-provision and then go right<br>back out to sea.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
