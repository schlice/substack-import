<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content:<br>[[Madeleine(https://www.quora.com/profile/Madeleine-260)]{.qlink_container}<br>commented that \"Guns that are not locked up kill people.\" I replied<br>and told her \"I sat down with my gun that wasn\'t locked up and I gave<br>it a stern talking-to about going out and killing people. It promised me<br>it wouldn\'t. So far, so good.\"\<br>\<br>She replied, \"And of course no troubled people could ever remember your<br>gun is out and take it. Oh wait. That happens everyday.\"\<br>\<br>Then she turned off commenting on her answers and disallowed followers.<br>I guess this is a tactic to make your point and silence the opposing<br>view.\<br>\<br>I don\'t appreciate that, and I believe that it is disingenuous to start<br>a discussion and then shut it down.\<br>\<br>So I\'ll move the discussion to my own answer. And I promise I won\'t<br>disallow commenting.\<br>\<br>There is a fundamental difference between \"Guns that are not locked up<br>kill people\" and \"A troubled person takes a gun and kills someone.\"<br>In the first statement, \"Guns that are not locked up kill people\", the<br>prepositional phrase is \"that are not locked up\". Remove the<br>prepositional phrase and you see the subject, the verb, and the<br>predicate: guns kill people. So in the first sentence, the subject is<br>the gun. In the second sentence, following the logic, the subject is the<br>troubled person. She got it right the second time: the troubled person<br>is the one we need to focus on, not the gun.\<br>\<br>People only focus on guns because guns are purpose-built to kill. That<br>doesn\'t make the gun \"bad\", it just means that its primary purpose is<br>to kill. And it does so more efficiently than any other tool which can<br>be used to kill. And there are many of them. Cars can kill. Baseball<br>bats can kill. Knives can kill (and were actually originally designed to<br>kill). But these other tools have different primary purposes than<br>killing. You wouldn\'t think of banning cars because some people drink<br>and drive. Because some people kill irresponsibly using a car, you would<br>never think to ban cars, because they are just too useful. But because<br>some people use guns irresponsibly, you might think banning guns is<br>okay, because their only purpose is to kill.\<br>\<br>But killing is justified in certain situations. Self-defense and<br>fighting tyranny are two situations which are natural-law rights of<br>people. So if killing is justfied in certain circumstances, why can I<br>not use the most efficient tool to do it?\<br>\<br>The vast majority of US citizens owns and uses guns responsibly. And<br>when limiting a Constitutional right, you must do so in the least<br>restrictive way that still accomplishes your goal. Many schemes to ban<br>guns fail because they are not the least restrictive to legal gun<br>owners, and they don\'t actually accomplish their stated<br>goal.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
