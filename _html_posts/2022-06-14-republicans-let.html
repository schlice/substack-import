<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>If a case came before the Court that posited a valid argument that *DC<br>v. Heller* was incorrectly decided because the basis for its decision<br>was unconstitutional, I would *expect* that it would be overturned.<br>But that's unlikely, as we'll see here shortly.<br><br>The problem, as I see it, is that you expect bad rulings to stand,<br>*because you like the outcome.* You may not have liked the outcome<br>of *Heller,* but it will stand because it is a Constitutional ruling.<br><br>You probably wanted *Roe v. Wade* to stand, because you liked the<br>outcome. But the problem with *Roe* was that it was a bad decision<br>because it was unconstitutional. The foundation upon which *Roe* was<br>built was not Constitutionally based. A right was found which, in<br>actuality, does not exist in the Constitution. You can't "make up" a<br>right that doesn't exist, and then use that as the foundation for a<br>decision. A house built on sand will wash away.<br><br>Not so with *DC v. Heller.* The foundations upon which that case were<br>built are strong Constitutional ones. The reasons why the case was<br>decided in the way that it was are clear, and are all found in the<br>Constitution. The Court in *Heller* did not "make up" any rights and<br>then build their decision on them. They used solid historical analysis<br>to show that the Second Amendment protects an individual right to own<br>firearms, unconnected with service in a militia. This interpretation was<br>not *radical* or unsurprising, as it matches similar arms-bearing rights<br>decided by the states, both before and after the passage of the<br>Amendment. In order to overturn *Heller*, the Court would have to<br>contravene many State Constitutions which also protect the right of an<br>individual to keep and bear arms. Therefore, *Heller* is Constitutional.<br>*Stare decisis* would say that because the decision was, in fact,<br>Constitutional, it should stand. A house built on solid rock will<br>withstand the storm.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
