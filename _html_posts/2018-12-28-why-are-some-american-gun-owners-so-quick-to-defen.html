<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Why are some American gun owners so quick to defend the right to own<br>bump stocks?**<br><br>To summarize what *everyone* here has said, we're not defending the<br>right to own bump stocks. We're decrying a Federal agency re-writing the<br>law, which is not their job.<br><br>The law very clearly says that an automatic weapon is one in which a<br>weapon fires more than one bullet with each trigger pull.<br><br>The ATF ruling *changed the law* and classified a bump stock as a<br>machine gun. A bump stock does not meet the legal definition of machine<br>gun.<br><br>This is a problem for several reasons:<br><br>- If someone is charged under the bump stock law and challenges the ATF<br>  ruling in court, it will certainly be struck down as illegal. It will<br>  then be illegal to ban bump stocks as machine guns because they are<br>  not machine guns. And that will make it *much* more difficult to<br>  control bump stocks. So this could actually backfire and make the bump<br>  stock problem worse.<br>- Allowing the ATF to unilaterally make something into something else in<br>  order to ban it enables a worrisome trend: allowing a Federal<br>  Executive-branch agency the power to *write laws*, which is<br>  unconstitutional.<br><br>The ATF does not have the authority to change laws. That's Congress'<br>job. The fact that Congress can't get shit done is not our problem. And<br>the solution is certainly not to allow the ATF to change the law as they<br>see fit.<br><br>I'm not fan of bump stocks. They're toys. Novelty items. In the 22 years<br>that they've existed, they've been used in only one crime, and it was<br>only somewhat effective because he had thousands of rounds and was<br>essentially "like shooting fish in a barrel."<br><br>But just because you don't like something shouldn't be the permission<br>you need to *violate the Constitution.* Do it right, and change the law.<br>Get Congress to actually do something productive for once. Have Congress<br>make bump stocks illegal. Let states make bump stocks illegal. Whatever.<br>But the ATF changing the classification of bump stocks into machine guns<br>is unlawful.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
