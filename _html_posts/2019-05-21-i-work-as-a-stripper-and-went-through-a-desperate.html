<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**I work as a stripper and went through a desperate time and slept with<br>a customer for money.

Can I report without getting<br>in trouble?**<br><br>It's true that you would be opening yourself up to potential prosecution<br>for your crime, but that you committed a crime doesn't justify<br>harassment and assault and stalking.<br><br>If you tell him to stop threatening you and that you are willing to<br>expose yourself to legal repercussions by going to the police to get him<br>to stop, he'll stop. Most people aren't dumb enough to use the evidence<br>they have to prove they committed a crime (in case you weren't sure, he<br>committed as much of a crime as you did, and him showing his evidence to<br>the police only proves his own guilt).<br><br>But on the off-chance that he doesn't stop, you will have to,<br>colloquially, "shit or get off the pot." You'll have to go down to the<br>police station and file a report. You will have to admit what you did.<br>And you may pay a penalty for it. But the harassment will indeed stop.<br>And if you come clean first, there's a better-than-average chance that<br>you will not be prosecuted for your crime.<br><br>He thinks he's got you over a barrel because you committed a crime, too.<br>But if you're brave enough to admit what you did, you can get him to<br>stop.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
