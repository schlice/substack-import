<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>As with all legal answers, the answer is "it depends." And what it<br>depends on is your Governing Documents; specifically, the language which<br>establishes the committee doing the review of requested changes.<br><br>It's usually called the Architecture Review Board (ARB) or the<br>Architecture Control Committee (ACC) or something like that. It its<br>charter, it will normally have language which indicates that **it is<br>their sole judgement** which determines whether or not a particular<br>change, on a particular house, will be approved.<br><br>What that means, in practice, is that a change can be perfectly legal.<br>The paint color may be part of a standard, approved paint color palette.<br>And this is the crazy part, *it may even be a change that was approved<br>for another house!* The ARB can *still* legally deny the change if, **in<br>their sole opinion**, the change, on your house, doesn't fit the overall<br>look of the neighborhood they are trying to achieve or maintain.<br><br>Now, all of those things I pointed out are reasons that might make you<br>believe the ARB is practicing what we call *selective enforcement*: with<br>two changes exactly the same, they approve one and not the other. It<br>would take some pretty serious explanation on their part to overcome a<br>charge of selective enforcement. Nevertheless, you can still make that<br>charge. To do so, you'll need to hire your own attorney and file suit<br>against the HOA making that claim.<br><br>But can they *legally* deny a change that fits their guidelines? Yes,<br>legally they can, so long as the Governing Documents indicate that the<br>ARB maintains the final decision based on their own judgement.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
