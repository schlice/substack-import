<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [[[Lacey<br>Sheridan](https://www.quora.com/profile/Lacey-Sheridan)]{.qlink_container}\'s<br>answer is spot-on.\<br>\<br>Baltimore looked at Ferguson and said, \"We\'re going to do things<br>differently. We\'re not going to try to go in there like some kind of<br>\"police force\" to try and do, you know, \"policing.\" We\'re just<br>going to let them do their thing and then we\'ll use video to prosecute<br>them later.\" Yeah, we\'ll wait to see how effective *that* is.\<br>\<br>The rioters have calmed down (until the police officers are acquitted<br>and then Baltimore will be burning again), and in their wake, over 200<br>businesses have been *destroyed. Completely gone. \"Total loss\"* as<br> insurance companies call it. Was that the outcome the city was<br>going for?\<br>\<br>And you think that going after the rioters later is going to make up for<br>the fact that all of these businesses are now out of business? Some may<br>be able to recover with help from insurance, but many will have to<br>close. Congratulations, Baltimore, you have now created a slum in the<br>middle of downtown. And with all the insurance payouts, insurance<br>premiums for the remaining businesses are going to go up, which will<br>force other businesses to close as well. Who is going to want to do<br>business in Baltimore, knowing that the city won\'t stop the rioters?<br>Knowing that they have to pay more in insurance to do business there?\<br>\<br>All actions have consequences. And the inaction of Baltimore city<br>government, failing to stop the looters and rioters, or to even try,<br>will also have consequences.\<br>\<br>]<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-030f47953f44f1d59055950923565511){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-030f47953f44f1d59055950923565511" master_w="600"<br>master_h="419"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
