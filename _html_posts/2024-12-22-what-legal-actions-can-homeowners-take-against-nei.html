<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The correct answer, as with all legal questions, is "it depends."<br><br>If you live in a city or a county, there are usually laws which prohibit<br>the discharge of firearms within that city limits. So it doesn't matter<br>what you're shooting at, generally discharging a firearm is a crime,<br>usually a misdemeanor. This is purely a safety thing, because people<br>live in such close proximity that you can't have people randomly<br>shooting firearms, because even if you're not aiming at someone, the<br>population density simply means that you could *potentially* hit<br>someone.<br><br>If you live in unincorporated land, or in rural areas, there are usually<br>no laws against discharging firearms. So long as someone is not shooting<br>*at you*, then there really isn't much you can do about the discharge of<br>firearms. If they are doing it late at night, there are usually still<br>noise ordinances, so perhaps law enforcement could still get involved.<br><br>So check your local laws and see if there are any provisions against<br>discharge of firearms. If there are, contact your local law enforcement<br>and let them know about the neighbors who are unlawfully discharging<br>firearms. But again, be sure it is illegal where you live before you<br>contact the police.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
