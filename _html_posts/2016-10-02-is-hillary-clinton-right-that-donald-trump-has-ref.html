<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>(EDIT) Let's clarify workers first. To be clear, Trump has never<br>been accused of not paying *employees* (there was a case regarding<br>overtime pay for some casino employees, which was settled). He has only<br>been accused of not fully paying *contractors* the originally<br>agreed-upon price for one reason or another.<br><br>You can't simply refuse to pay contractors for the work they do. They<br>sue you and you win. If it was as cut-and-dried as that, then every<br>person who did a job and wasn't paid would sue and win.<br><br>However, what these contractors are upset about is when Trump has:<br><br>- Filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, changing their repayment terms<br>- Refused to pay the full amount or reduced the final payment based on a<br>  satisfaction clause in their contract<br><br>Trump has filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy on four separate occasions in the<br>last 25 years.<br><br>From our friends at *Politifact:*<br><br>> Bankruptcy 1: The Trump Taj Mahal, 1991<br>><br>> The first bankruptcy associated with Trump was perhaps the most<br>> significant in terms of his personal finances, according to [[news<br>> reports](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=527ab2&url=http://www.nytimes.com/1991/12/31/business/year-finance-newsmakers-1991-money-movers-caught-turbulent-times-90-s-donald-j.html){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="nytimes.com"}]{.qlink_container} at the time. He funded<br>> the construction of the \$1 billion Trump Taj Mahal casino in Atlantic<br>> City, which opened in 1990. By 1991, the casino was nearly \$3 billion<br>> in debt, while Trump had racked up nearly \$900 million in personal<br>> liabilities, so the business decided to file for Chapter 11<br>> reorganization, according to the [[*New York<br>> Times*](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=527ab2&url=http://www.nytimes.com/1991/12/31/business/year-finance-newsmakers-1991-money-movers-caught-turbulent-times-90-s-donald-j.html){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="nytimes.com"}]{.qlink_container}. As a result, Trump gave<br>> up half his personal stake in the casino and sold his yacht and<br>> airline, according to the [[*Washington<br>> Post*](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=515374&url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/what-trump-didnt-say-about-his-four-big-business-bankruptcies/2015/08/07/bc054e64-3d12-11e5-9c2d-ed991d848c48_story.html){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="washingtonpost.com"}]{.qlink_container}[.(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=515374&url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/what-trump-didnt-say-about-his-four-big-business-bankruptcies/2015/08/07/bc054e64-3d12-11e5-9c2d-ed991d848c48_story.html){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="washingtonpost.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br>><br>> Bankruptcy 2: Trump Plaza Hotel, 1992<br>><br>> Trump acquired the Plaza Hotel in New York for \$390 million in 1988.<br>> By 1992, the hotel had accumulated \$550 million in debt. As a result<br>> of the bankruptcy, in exchange for easier terms on which to pay off<br>> the debts, Trump relinquished a 49 percent stake in the Plaza to a<br>> total of six lenders, according to [[ABC<br>> News](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=aef910&url=http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/donald-trump-filed-bankruptcy-times/story?id%3D13419250){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="go.com"}]{.qlink_container}. Trump remained the hotel's<br>> CEO, but it was merely a gesture \-- he didn't earn a salary and had<br>> no say in the hotel's day-to-day operations, according to the [[*New<br>> York<br>> Times*](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=f7bf6d&url=http://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/12/business/company-news-trump-s-plaza-hotel-bankruptcy-plan-approved.html){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="nytimes.com"}]{.qlink_container}[.(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=f7bf6d&url=http://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/12/business/company-news-trump-s-plaza-hotel-bankruptcy-plan-approved.html){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="nytimes.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br>><br>> Bankruptcy 3: Trump Hotels and Casinos Resorts, 2004<br>><br>> Trump Hotels and Casinos Resorts filed for bankruptcy again in 2004<br>> when his casinos \-- including the Trump Taj Mahal, Trump Marina and<br>> Trump Plaza casinos in Atlantic City and a riverboat casino in Indiana<br>> \-- had accrued an estimated \$1.8 billion in debt, according to [[the<br>> Associated<br>> Press](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=68a01f&url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/6556470/%23.VfsP5p1Viko){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="nbcnews.com"}]{.qlink_container}. Trump agreed to reduce<br>> his share in the company from 47 to 27 percent in a restructuring<br>> plan, but he was still the company's largest single shareholder and<br>> remained in charge of its operations. Trump [[told the Associated<br>> Press](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=68a01f&url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/6556470/%23.VfsP5p1Viko){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="nbcnews.com"}]{.qlink_container} at the time that the<br>> company represented less than 1 percent of his net worth.<br>><br>> Bankruptcy 4: Trump Entertainment Resorts, 2009<br>><br>> Trump Entertainment Resorts \-- formerly Trump Hotels and Casinos<br>> Resorts \-- was hit hard by the 2008 economic recession and missed a<br>> \$53.1 million bond interest payment in December 2008, according to<br>> [[ABC<br>> News.](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=e04bf4&url=http://ecourses.tvcc.edu/webapps/discussionboard/do/conference?action%3Dlist_forums%26course_id%3D_2116_1%26nav%3Dgroup_forum%26group_id%3D_1711_1){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="tvcc.edu"}]{.qlink_container} After debating with the<br>> company's board of directors, Trump resigned as the company's chairman<br>> and had his corporate stake in the company reduced to 10 percent. The<br>> company continued to use Trump's name in<br>> licensing.\[1\](#RuZAM){#cite-RuZAM .citation_link}<br><br>On four separate occasions, Trump companies filed for Chapter 11<br>reorganization. Chapter 11 allows Trump to renegotiate the terms of<br>debts. It allows him to elongate repayment times, delaying repayment.<br>This affects every contractor who has contracted to do work for Trump.<br><br>In other cases, Trump has attempted to re-negotiate contracts when work<br>was sub-par, or didn't meet his standards. Granted, his standards are a<br>little nebulous, but he is a businessman, and life is not fair.<br>Contractors are not paid fairly because it's a fair thing to do.<br>Contractors get paid what they deserve for the work they do when they<br>deliver the work as promised, and on time. The system is "just," not<br>"fair." There is a big difference between the two.<br><br>If Trump "unjustly" withheld payment, he should be sued. And in over 60<br>cases, he was sued. But if his contracts included a **satisfaction<br>clause**, which many Trump contracts with tradesmen are purported to<br>include, he does have the right to reduce final payment if the work does<br>not meet his standard for satisfaction. Most of those cases were settled<br>out of court, some of those cases are still ongoing. It is time<br>consuming because, strictly speaking, this is an illusory promise, since<br>the promisor has no actual legal burden to pay if he chooses not to.<br>However, courts will generally imply in law that the promisor must act<br>in good faith and reject the deal only if he is genuinely dissatisfied.<br>It takes time to prove genuine dissatisfaction with a trade's work, and<br>these are legitimate contractual issues you have to deal with when you<br>include items like satisfaction clauses in your contracts, and you<br>refuse payment as a standard business practice.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-RuZAM){.citation_index} [[Fact-checking claims about<br>Donald Trump\'s four<br>bankruptcies](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=453b6d&url=http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/sep/21/carly-fiorina/trumps-four-bankruptcies/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="politifact.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
