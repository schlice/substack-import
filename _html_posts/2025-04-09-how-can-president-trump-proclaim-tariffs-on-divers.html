<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>He can "proclaim tariffs" when Congress delegates its tariff authority<br>to the President by passing laws to do so.<br><br>There are six statutory provisions (laws) currently in place that permit<br>the president and the executive branch to levy tariffs, along with<br>governing how those tariffs can be used. Three provisions require<br>federal agency investigations before a tariff can be imposed. The other<br>three provisions do not require an investigation before actions are<br>taken.<br><br>The three which require federal investigations before tariffs can be<br>imposed:<br><br>- Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962. It authorizes the<br>  president to ask the Secretary of Commerce to determine if goods are<br>  being imported in a manner that threatens national security. The<br>  secretary then reports back to the president if he has any affirmative<br>  findings. "Section 232 does not require the President to follow the<br>  Secretary's recommendations but permits him to take alternative<br>  actions or no action," according to the [[Congressional Research<br>  Service](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=c69de8&url=https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/R48435){.external_link<br>  rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>  onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>  qt-tooltip="congress.gov"}]{.qlink_container} (CRS). Under Section<br>  232, there is no maximum time limit on the president's tariff actions.<br>  President Trump has already used this provision during both of his<br>  administrations to impose tariffs on both steel and aluminum imports.<br>- Section 201 of the Trade Act of 1974. The act allows the president to<br>  impose tariffs if the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) finds<br>  that an import surge is threatening a U.S. domestic industry. If the<br>  ITC makes an affirmative determination, the president can take action<br>  accordingly, including placing tariffs. Tariffs imposed under Section<br>  201 are not meant to be permanent, and the actions have a limit of<br>  four to eight years.<br>- Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 allows the United States Trade<br>  Representative (USTR) to authorize tariffs on foreign countries that<br>  restrict U.S. commerce in "unjustifiable," "unreasonable," or<br>  "discriminatory" ways. If the USTR confirms such behavior after an<br>  investigation, the president has the discretion to allow the USTR to<br>  impose tariffs for at least four years.<br><br>Of the three provisions that allow the president to act on his own to<br>impose tariffs without an investigation, only the first has ever been<br>used:<br><br>- The International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977. This act<br>  allows the president to declare an emergency under the National<br>  Emergency Act (NEA) and then use his economic authority to regulate or<br>  prohibit imports. The CRS says that President Trump was the first<br>  chief executive to use this act in February 2025, when he announced<br>  tariffs on Canada, China, and Mexico. The state of emergency declared<br>  by the president can be terminated at his request, or by a joint<br>  resolution of Congress.<br>- Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974 allows the president to enact<br>  temporary tariffs to address "large and serious United States<br>  balance-of-payments deficits" or \"fundamental international payments<br>  problems."<br>- Section 338 of Tariff Act of 1930 authorizes the president to enact<br>  "tariffs on articles produced by, or imported on the vessels of,<br>  foreign countries that discriminate against U.S. commerce in certain<br>  ways."<br><br>Congress could potentially "claw back" some of its authority by passing<br>new or updated legislation which limits presidential tariffs powers, or<br>it could even choose to expand the president's authority in the same<br>way. However, the CRS says that based on precedents dating back to the<br>time of Chief Justice Marshall, case law "has given the President broad<br>latitude to exercise his tariff authorities." Therefore, it is unlikely<br>that any of the President's tariff actions would be found to be<br>unconstitutional.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
