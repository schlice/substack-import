<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>It's actually really simple and easy to understand.<br><br>Abel gave the best from his bounty ***first*; Cain kept all his<br>bounty himself and gave the *overage* to God.**<br><br>Abel gave the best lamb he had first, and had faith that he would have a<br>bounty beyond that first, best lamb. Cain kept his entire harvest, and<br>only gave grain out of his abundance.<br><br>There is a distinct difference between how the two gave: Abel gave to<br>God first, *before* keeping any more for himself. Cain gave to God<br>last, *after* collecting his entire harvest. Abel's gift<br>demonstrated *faith* that God would provide even though he had given his<br>first, best lamb, and Cain's gift did not demonstrate this faith. The<br>Old Testament teaches the principle of *firstfruits* ([[Exodus<br>23:16](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=72715b&url=https://www.bibleref.com/Exodus/23/Exodus-23-16.html){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="bibleref.com"}]{.qlink_container};<br>[34:22(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=dffbad&url=https://www.bibleref.com/Exodus/34/Exodus-34-22.html){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="bibleref.com"}]{.qlink_container}; [[Leviticus<br>2:12-14](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=6da8e4&url=https://www.bibleref.com/Leviticus/2/Leviticus-2-12.html){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="bibleref.com"}]{.qlink_container}; [[2 Chronicles<br>31:5](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=f2122b&url=https://www.bibleref.com/2-Chronicles/31/2-Chronicles-31-5.html){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="bibleref.com"}]{.qlink_container}). Old Testament believers<br>gave from the best of their crops, not the leftovers.<br><br>\<br><br>We can avoid going the way of Cain by *tithing*. Tithing is literally<br>giving 10% of your earnings to God, right off the top, before you take<br>for yourself. Give *first* and let God provide. If God is truly first,<br>we show it through our faithfulness in honoring the tithe to Him. We<br>sacrifice the first that He might bless the rest. And if you're saying,<br>"But I can't afford to tithe!" then understand that you will never be<br>able to afford to tithe until you tithe. We can always afford to give if<br>we give first. In other words, we may not be able to afford to give<br>everything we want, but we can always afford to give. It's all about<br>where you place your faith.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
