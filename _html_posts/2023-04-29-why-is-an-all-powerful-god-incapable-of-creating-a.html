<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**He is not incapable of creating such a world, but He doesn't because<br>He doesn't want to.**<br><br>The first question is the easy one. *Can God create an incorruptible<br>world?* And the answer to any question which starts with "Can God"<br>is yes, God can. As the literal All-Powerful Creator of the<br>Universeâ„¢, there is nothing that God cannot do. Full stop.<br><br>So if He *can,* why doesn't He? The answer must therefore be because He<br>doesn't want to.<br><br>But like a tantrum-filled two-year old, we continue to ask *why*. And<br>the more we do, the more we start to approach questions about<br>understanding the infinite mind of God, which we are incapable of doing.<br><br>In this case, however, we can at least answer why God would not create a<br>world that is incorruptible:<br><br>**An incorruptible world means a world without sin. And a world without<br>sin means a world with people who have no free will.**<br><br>That's right, God wants you to have free will. He wants you to be able<br>to choose between good and evil. And an incorruptible world contains no<br>evil. And God desires creatures with free will *so badly* that He will<br>create a world in which sin (evil) is capable of existing. Free will<br>means you can follow God's rules, or you can sin and disobey God's<br>rules.<br><br>So for the last *why* question, *why would God want to give you the<br>ability to choose to reject Him?*<br><br>And the answer is because God is love. And love, by definition, can<br>only be freely given, it can never be coerced. So God wants to freely<br>give love, and He wants you to *freely* accept love, knowing that there<br>is an alternative, and that there is nothing preventing you from making<br>either choice freely, without coercion.<br><br>God wants communion only with people who freely, gladly, choose Him,<br>knowing the alternative, and choosing Him anyway. *That's* what God<br>desires.<br><br>And that's why God did not create a world incapable of experiencing sin.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
