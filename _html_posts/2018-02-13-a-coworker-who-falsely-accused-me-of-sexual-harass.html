<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Is it legal for the company (for my own safety) to allow her to<br>transfer to a closer proximity to me?**<br><br>To answer your specific question, yes it is perfectly legal to allow her<br>to transfer closer to you. It's even perfectly legal for them to seat<br>her directly adjacent to you as well.<br><br>It's not smart, it's not ideal, but it's not illegal. It just seems like<br>they are setting themselves up for failure here, but it's not my<br>company.<br><br>Anyway, what to do about it (in order, move on to the next one if you<br>get no results):<br><br>- Complain to your manager<br>- Complain to HR<br>- Follow [[Joel<br>  Dyess](https://www.quora.com/profile/Joel-Dyess)]{.qlink_container}'<br>  suggestion and file a complaint with the EEOC for creating a hostile<br>  work environment.<br><br>Just remember, the more noise you make, the more you will be seen as<br>the problem, not her. Make sure you do these in order, and make sure you<br>document the conversations (i.e. date/time, what was the result, etc).<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
