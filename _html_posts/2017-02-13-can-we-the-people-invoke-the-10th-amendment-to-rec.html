<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The 10th Amendment does not give the people the authority to recall the<br>president. Besides, there are no legitimate grounds to recall the<br>president at this time.<br><br>There are two methods by which a sitting president can be removed from<br>office (and none of them involve the people as a whole):<br><br>1.  Congress can invoke impeachment procedures under Article II, Section<br>    4 of the Constitution for "high crimes and misdemeanors."<br>2.  The Vice President can step in as acting President under Amendment<br>    25 if the President becomes unable to carry out the duties of the<br>    office.<br><br>Neither of these situations have occurred, so your best bet is to wait<br>for the next election and vote for someone else.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
