<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I am sorry but no one is going to be able to answer that question for<br>you. There are many reasons why God may not answer your prayers in the<br>way you want. Perhaps you are not ready for what He has planned for you.<br>You may need to grow more before you are ready for what you're asking<br>for. Perhaps He is not ready (in other words, it's not in His timing<br>yet). Or perhaps it's not part of His good plan for you.<br><br>We do know that He has never not kept one of His promises, ever. If He<br>has promised something, He has kept that promise.<br><br>And He has promised that He has good plans for you.<br><br>> For I know the plans I have for you, declares the LORD, plans for<br>> welfare and not for evil, to give you a future and a hope. (Jeremiah<br>> 29:11 ESV)<br><br>As Christians, we were never promised an easy life. But God does promise<br>us a *glorious eternity.*<br><br>So maybe instead of praying for God to open a door when clearly He is<br>not, perhaps we should pray for Him to reveal His plans for us, and to<br>bring us alongside Him in those plans. His will will be done whether<br>we like it or not, so isn't it better that we just learn His plans for<br>us, and we help in accomplishing those plans?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
