Like if it<br>is a noise complaint for people being loud on the street.**<br><br>Short answer is no. There is no legal requirement that police respond to<br>all calls for service.<br><br>That said, they do try to respond to every one, but the response is<br>based on priority. If there is a call for a noise complaint and a call<br>for an armed robbery in progress, which call would you expect the police<br>to attend to first?<br><br>Therefore, they will probably get to it eventually, but maybe not right<br>away.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
