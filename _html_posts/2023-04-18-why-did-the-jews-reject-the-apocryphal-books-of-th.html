<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Let's do a really brief timeline (this is very brief, mind you, but<br>should be enough to answer the question). The short answer is "because<br>they weren't part of the original Holy Scriptures."<br><br>Starting from thousands of years before Christ was born, the Jewish Holy<br>Scriptures were written in Hebrew. But by about the third century B.C.,<br>the language of the common man was Greek. Hebrew was limited to those<br>who worked routinely with the original Holy Scriptures. It was mostly<br>scholars and Rabbis who read Hebrew. So the people wanted a common<br>translation of the Holy Scriptures into their common language. This<br>translation is known as the *Septuagint*.<br><br>When the Catholic Church canonized its Bible, it accepted the<br>Septuagint, since that is what the Jews of the day accepted as their<br>Holy Scripture. The Septuagint, however, had a few additions made to it<br>during the time of its creation, a few books which were never written in<br>the original Hebrew. Nevertheless, the Catholic Church, in creating<br>their Bible, accepted the Septuagint as it was.<br><br>This pretty much stood this way for the first several hundred years of<br>the Catholic Church, until the Protestant Reformation. The reformers<br>rejected everything that was centered on Rome (which is why we call it<br>the Roman Catholic Church), including their Bible, which included the<br>Septuagint as well as the New Testament, all written in Latin, called<br>the Vulgate. The Vulgate was summarily rejected by the Protestant<br>reformers. But now they needed a translation of the Jewish Holy<br>Scriptures that they could use.<br><br>Fortunately, the Jews had gone through sort of a "rediscovery" period of<br>their own during this time. Jewish scholars produced a new version of<br>the original Hebrew texts called the "Masoretic Texts" which was<br>actually written in Hebrew. Not surprisingly, this re-write did not<br>include any of the books that were *only* written in Koine Greek,<br>because those books were not part of the original Holy Scriptures.<br><br>The Protestant reformers, like the Catholic Church before them, simply<br>accepted the Masoretic Texts as they stood, and incorporated them into<br>their own Bible translations, without the additional books which could<br>be found in the Septuagint.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
