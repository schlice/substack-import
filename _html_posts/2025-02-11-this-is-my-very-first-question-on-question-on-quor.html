<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>You're talking about my wife.<br><br>Sure, I have a passion for writing about Christianity on Quora, but<br>she's something different. She, admittedly, doesn't "think on her feet."<br>She can't formulate arguments or deeper understanding on the fly, in a<br>conversation. She'd be in a conversation with other Christians, and<br>then, like a half hour later, would say, "Ah, I know what I should have<br>told them..." **But when she stops, sits in the quiet, and thinks about<br>what she is going to say**, especially when she aims to write it down,<br>*the Spirit floods her with words*, and her writing is literally *so<br>inspirational* that people have literally taken her words and printed<br>them on postcards.<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-cb807a23dd63682b091e2c91b36250e2){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-cb807a23dd63682b091e2c91b36250e2"<br>master_w="1908" master_h="1432"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>*(One of her messages to her girlfriends that one of them printed on<br>postcards)*<br><br>She has the innate ability to hear the words of the Spirit and write<br>them down.<br><br>The forty or so authors of the books of the Bible had exactly the same<br>gift. It's the gift we, today, would call the gift of prophesy. It<br>is a rare and special gift. Treasure the ones in your life who have it.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
