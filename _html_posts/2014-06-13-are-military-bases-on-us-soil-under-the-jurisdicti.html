<br/><br/>Answer<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content: [Since the base is located on soil within a city, county,<br/>and state, those entities have jurisdiction on the base. It\'s called<br/>concurrent jurisdiction, and it means that the local police as well as<br/>the military police, both have jurisdiction. However, the local police<br/>usually defer to the military police on matters which occur on a<br/>military base.\<br/>\<br/>Legally, because of concurrent jurisdiction, since both the state and<br/>the Federal government have jurisdiction, someone committing a crime on<br/>a base can be charged twice, once by the base and once by the locals. He<br/>can be convicted twice, and serve two separate sentences, and this is<br/>not covered by the \"double jeopardy\" rule where you can\'t be<br/>convicted for the same crime twice. In this case, you can. It\'s the<br/>only loophole in the \"double jeopardy\" rule, but it would only be<br/>exercised when something really serious happened.]<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content language: English<br/><br/><br/>
