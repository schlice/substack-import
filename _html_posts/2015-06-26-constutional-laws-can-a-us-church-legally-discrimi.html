<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Churches are allowed to discriminate in their hiring<br>practices and what they preach. That\'s what the First Amendment allows.<br>But let\'s look at the ramifications of today\'s decision. I\'ll break<br>down each one of your points.\<br>\<br>*Allowing marriage equality would lead to people marrying animals*\<br>\<br>That\'s not going to happen. No one can honestly equate an animal to a<br>person. Also, the argument that we\'ll be allowing adults to marry<br>children will equally not stand, as there are physieological differences<br>between men and boys, women and girls. And the decision-making centers<br>in the brain are not reasonably formed until at least age 25 in men,<br>possibly younger in women, but the age of majority has been set at 18 in<br>most states. So that\'s not happening either.\<br>\<br>However, there is a cogent argument to be made that laws banning<br>polyamory (polygamy and polygyny) are no more or less harmful than laws<br>that previously banned same-sex marriage. I see legal challenges to<br>those laws succeeding using today\'s same-sex marriage ruling as their<br>legal precedent. If we have the power to re-interpret what marriage has<br>exclusively been, there is no reason why any law restricting a<br>combination of spouses should also stand. Any argument that the<br>plaintiff in this same-sex marriage case would have made would be<br>equally applicable to any argument a plaintiff in a polyamory case could<br>make.\<br>\<br>That said, I think we can still reasonably draw the line at people.\<br>\<br>***Churches being forced to accept and even perform weddings for<br>gays***\<br>\<br>It could be argued that a church could not keep its tax-exempt status if<br>it failed to follow Federal law. And the new law-of-the-land is that<br>same-sex marriages are Constitutional. You could conceivably see the IRS<br>denying tax-exempt status to any church that fails to follow Federal law<br>and perform same-sex weddings. Doesn\'t matter what the church believes.<br>You can choose to bury your head in the sand, but this is the first time<br>that the law might actually be *applicable to a church*. Federal law<br>says that same-sex weddings are now Constitutional, so there is no<br>reason that a church, which is tax-exempt under Federal law, would be<br>allowed to violate Federal law and refuse to marry a same-sex couple.<br>Any church which thus refuses could lose its tax-exempt status. So I<br>think this may still be a concern, and churches should brace for a new<br>fight. Who does this new law apply to? State governments, or churches?<br>Are churches still protected by the First Amendment, or will the Federal<br>government try to force churches to perform same-sex weddings or lose<br>their tax-exempt status? I would think that the broad precedent<br>surrounding Federal law applying to churches would stand, but this court<br>has now, twice in two days, overlooked the precepts of law and have<br>ruled in favor of public opinion. So anything\'s fair game now.\<br>\<br>*Forced hiring of gay ministers to spread the gay gospel*\<br>\<br>While the Federal government may be able to direct churches to perform<br>same-sex weddings or face loss of tax-exempt status, the decision to<br>influence churchs\' hiring practices has been debated, and lost. The<br>government can only protect classes of people under the civil rights<br>act, and gays are not listed there. This law was not changed today. A<br>business can still only not discriminate based on race, color, creed,<br>sex, or national origin. A church which does not believe in<br>homosexuality can still choose to not hire a gay minister.\<br>\<br>*Marriages between males and females falling apart*\<br>\<br>This has been happening for a very long time, and the government is as<br>much a part of the problem then as it is now. The glamorization of the<br>single-parent household, the weakening of divorce and adultery laws,<br>states advocating no-fault divorce, etc. have all led to a culture that<br>shows marriage\'s *impermanence*. This decision doesn\'t really<br>contribute to that, other than to make marriage more about the *desires<br>of adults* than about the *needs of children*, which was the previous<br>focus of the marriage law. This decision won\'t have any bearing on what<br>happens in the bedroom between a man and a woman. Those marriages are no<br>more precarious today than they were yesterday. The decision does show<br>that the government is suddenly less interested in the needs of<br>children, and more interested in the desires of adults, to the detriment<br>of our nation\'s children.\<br>\<br>***Gays being allowed to teach young children in schools to be<br>homosexual***\<br>\<br>The ruling simply says that same-sex marriage is Constitutional. So if a<br>school is teaching a lesson on marriage, it can teach that male/female,<br>male/male, and female/female marriages are all legal. It doesn\'t<br>influence the curriculums of schools, other than to say what is legal.\<br>\<br>Does it pave the way for further erosion of the institute of marriage?<br>Certainly. It can be used as a springboard to introduce all sorts of<br>curricula into schools. Parents can still choose, as they always have,<br>that their personal limits on left-leaning curriculum have been<br>breached, and they can change their child\'s school to a private school,<br>or homeschool. This will mean changes for the family (I have thought of<br>buying a cheaper, smaller house in a worse part of town just so I\'d<br>have enough money to send my kids to a private school; thankfully I<br>didn\'t have to, but I would). But those choices still exist for<br>families who disapprove of the school curriculum. It doesn\'t really<br>hurt the school much. They lose PPOR (Per-Pupil Operating Revenue), but<br>in the grand scheme of things, they\'re not too concerned that they lost<br>one student. And overall, most families are just going to go along with<br>it anyway.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
