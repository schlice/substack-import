<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Yes, you\'re thinking of [[Huntington\'s disease<br>(HD)](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=3524eb&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huntington's_disease){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}, which is a genetic,<br>degenerative neurological disorder which can develop any time in a<br>person\'s life, but will generally reduce the lifespan of the affected<br>person to about 20 years following the initial diagnosis. The patient<br>will eventually die of pneumonia, heart failure, or other<br>complications.\<br>\<br>This disease is known as the quintessential family disease, because each<br>child of a parent with HD has a 50/50 chance of developing the disease.\<br>\<br>HD is often described as having ALS, Parkinson\'s and Alzheimer\'s \--<br>simultaneously. Early stage HD usually involves mood and cognition.<br>Middle stage HD involves more of the movement disorder: inability to<br>maintain normal movement and involuntary movements, known as \"chorea\".<br>Late stage HD involves an inability to perform most gross motor<br>functions, and the patient depends entirely upon caregivers for support.<br>The patient usually cannot speak, but is still cognizant and recognizes<br>friends and family.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
