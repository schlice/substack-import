<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What are the laws that allow citizens to detain other citizens until<br>the police arrive?**<br><br>The laws you are referring to are known in most jurisdictions as a<br>"citizen's arrest."<br><br>Be very aware: the laws surrounding the ability to make a citizen's<br>arrest vary wildly from state to state. The ability to use force to<br>effect your arrest, the crimes for which a citizen can effect a<br>citizen's arrest, etc. Always check your local laws before doing<br>anything.<br><br>In general, a person can arrest someone they reasonably suspect of<br>committing a felony, even if they didn't see the felony being committed.<br>As long as a felony was actually committed and the arrestor knew of the<br>crime, reasonable suspicion that the person being arrested is the<br>suspect is all that is generally needed. Also, citizen's arrest does not<br>apply to "attempted" crimes; the crime must actually have occurred in<br>order to effect a citizen's arrest. Even if the arrestor reasonably<br>believes a crime occurred, if the crime did not actually occur, the<br>arrest is unlawful and opens the arrestor up to civil and criminal<br>liability. Citizen's arrest cannot be used, in general, for<br>misdemeanors. Also interesting about citizen's arrest: there are fewer<br>Constitutional restrictions than police have. For example, since the<br>citizen is not the government, the Fourth Amendment does not apply<br>(unless a law enforcement officer directed the citizen to make the<br>arrest, in which case the Fourth Amendment does apply). As for use of<br>force, citizens may only use the amount of force necessary to effect the<br>arrest. Exactly how much force that constitutes is a matter of law to be<br>determined by a jury.<br><br>Use of deadly force is really sketchy. Some states allow deadly force<br>only if life is threatened or grave bodily injury is threatened. Others<br>allow deadly force to stop a fleeing suspect, but the laws surrounding<br>use of deadly force are wildly varied among states.<br><br>Just as with law enforcement, if the arrest was found to be unlawful,<br>you're on the hook for that unlawful arrest, illegal detention, and<br>possibly kidnapping. If force was used, you'd be on the hook for assault<br>and battery.<br><br>Effecting a citizen's arrest is fraught with legal peril, and there is<br>no qualified immunity like law enforcement has. Your arrest has to be<br>good or you'll find yourself in legal peril very quickly.<br><br>\<br><br>Relaxed. Researched. Respectful. - [[**War<br>Elephant**](https://warelephant.quora.com/)]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
