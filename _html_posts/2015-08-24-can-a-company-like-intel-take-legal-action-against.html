<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Since you live in India, Intel would have to take you to<br>court in India. I\'m not sure how strong cybersquatting laws are in<br>India, so I can\'t comment on whether or not you have a chance of<br>winning there.\<br>\<br>But there are other avenues for Intel to pursue. The United Nations (in<br>which India is a member nation) has a copyright agency known as the<br>[[World Intellectual Property<br>Organization](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=a7a03e&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Intellectual_Property_Organization){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}, which hears and settles<br>international disputes over cybersquatting. In 2007, the organization<br>said that 84% of the claims brought since 1999 were settled in the<br>complaining party\'s favor.\<br>\<br>Basically, world opinion is that cybersquatting is frowned upon, and the<br>squatter will only be refunded reasonable name acquisition costs.<br>However, if they end up filing lawsuit against you, you may also be<br>saddled with court costs, which would be much more than what you paid<br>for the domain name.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
