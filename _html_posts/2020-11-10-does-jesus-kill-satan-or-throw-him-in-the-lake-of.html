<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>You've got two questions in one, but i'll answer both. Let's split them<br>up:<br><br>**Does Jesus kill Satan or throw him in the lake of fire if he kills him<br>is that considered murder?**<br><br>I like how you're trying to apply human criminal law philosophy to the<br>actions of God. That's cute. Like God is subject to our laws.<br><br>Murder is a crime. But the basis of it is an unjustified killing. If<br>Jesus were to kill Satan, it would most certainly be justified.<br><br>**Will there be people left on earth when Jesus returns, could some of<br>them be nonbelievers will the non believers be able to stand Jesus<br>glory?**<br><br>There are plenty of Bible passages which talk about the difference<br>between those who are saved and those who are not saved. The upshot of<br>all of this is that some people will not be saved. These are the people<br>who reject Jesus' gift. If they are non-believers, then they will not be<br>saved. It has nothing to do with not standing his glory. It has<br>everything to do with whether or not they will accept Jesus as their<br>savior.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
