<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Why does Syracuse have the highest rate of multiple sclerosis<br>nationwide?**<br><br>The short answer is that we can't be sure that it does.<br><br>The study which shows Syracuse has the highest rate of MS in the nation<br>*actually* shows that Syracuse has the highest rate of people making<br>multiple sclerosis related claims against insurance.<br><br>> Because the report's findings are based on medical claims from insured<br>> patients, they may not reflect the actual incidence rate of MS in<br>> Syracuse, said Dr. Corey McGraw, an assistant professor of neurology<br>> at Upstate Medical University.<br>><br>> "When people are well insured, they are going to see their doctors<br>> more often and get diagnosed earlier," McGraw said. "It may not<br>> represent our total community here in Syracuse.\"<br>><br>> Because MS is not a reportable disease it's unknown how many cases<br>> there are in the Syracuse area. "But we do have a high population of<br>> MS patients in the area," McGraw said.\[1\](#FJTRt){#cite-FJTRt<br>> .citation_link}<br><br>We know that because we can see how many people seek medical care funded<br>by insurance.<br><br>But we don't know why this is. Perhaps Syracuse has the type of people<br>living there who overwhelmingly have commercial health insurance.<br>Perhaps medical care in Syracuse is just that much better, and so many<br>people are visiting doctors there.<br><br>But this may or may not directly translate to the number of people in<br>Syracuse who have MS.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-FJTRt){.citation_index} [[Syracuse has highest rate of<br>multiple sclerosis in US, study<br>shows](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=5d7329&url=https://www.syracuse.com/health/2019/10/syracuse-has-highest-rate-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-us-study-shows.html){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="syracuse.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
