<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>*Did Florida violate the 1st Amendment by punishing Disney?*<br><br>No. And the reason why is written in the law which was passed (which<br>everyone seems to be glossing over).<br><br>Reedy Creek (and all of the other special districts which were ratified<br>before the State Constitution) will expire on June 1, 2023.<br><br>Here's the actual text of the amendment to Florida state law:<br><br>> 10 Section 1. Section 189.0311, Florida Statutes, is amended\<br>> 11 to read:\<br>> 12 189.0311 Independent special districts; charter\<br>> 13 requirements.---\<br>> 14 (1) Notwithstanding any general law, special act, or\<br>> 15 ordinance of a local government to the contrary, any independent\<br>> 16 special district charter enacted after September 30, 1989, shall\<br>> 17 contain the information required by s. 189.031(3). Recognizing\<br>> 18 that the exclusive charter for a community development district\<br>> 19 is the statutory charter contained in ss. 190.006-190.041,\<br>> 20 community development districts established after July 1, 1980,\<br>> 21 pursuant to the provisions of chapter 190 shall be deemed in\<br>> 22 compliance with this requirement.\<br>> 23 (2) Notwithstanding s. 189.072(2), any independent special\<br>> 24 district established by a special act prior to the date of\<br>> 25 ratification of the Florida Constitution on November 5, 1968,\<br>> 26 and which was not reestablished, re-ratified, or otherwise\<br>> 27 reconstituted by a special act or general law after November 5,\<br>> 28 1968, is dissolved effective June 1, 2023. An independent\<br>> 29 special district affected by this subsection may be\<br>> 30 reestablished on or after June 1, 2023, pursuant to the\<br>> 31 requirements and limitations of this chapter.\<br>> 32 Section 2. This act shall take effect July 1, 2022.<br><br>Now, you can argue that the text of the law may talk about special<br>districts containing information required by Florida Statute s.<br>189.031(3), and so any which do not are dissolved, and can be<br>reestablished, but REALLY it's about punishing Disney. But in order<br>to make this argument, it would be up to the complainant to prove<br>that this law was written specifically to retaliate against Disney for<br>the exercise of their freedom of speech. This would be extremely<br>difficult to do, given that the law very clearly states that these<br>special districts can immediately be reestablished with the required<br>information included. If Disney was allegedly "being punished" through<br>the removal of the special district, then the special district should<br>not be allowed to be reestablished. However, the law very clearly states<br>that the special district can indeed be re-established.<br><br>In addition, this all smacks of hypocrisy. Corporations can punish<br>states for positions that they don't like, but states can't do the same?<br>Remember before COVID dominated the headlines way back in 2016 when<br>North Carolina passed "HB2" which said that businesses could only allow<br>patrons to use the bathrooms of their birth genders? What did<br>corporations do? PayPal cancelled plans to move to Charlotte, along with<br>other businesses. The NBA pulled the Finals out of NC (which they<br>restored after HB2 was partially repealed), and many small corporations<br>followed suit.<br><br>But yet, when states allegedly do exactly the same thing, it's not okay?<br>The bottom line is that the law was duly enacted by a legitimate state<br>government. A corporation (based in another state) vowed to do<br>everything in its power to get that law repealed. And we're supposed to<br>all look the other way as if this is somehow okay?<br><br>*Will this decision be legally challenged?*<br><br>Without a doubt, yes. But it's unlikely that any of these challenges<br>will succeed. The complainants must prove that the law, ***as it was<br>passed,*** is specifically targeted at retaliation against Disney, and I<br>find it hard to believe that they would be successful at that. Remember,<br>it doesn't matter what the original motivations of the law writers was.<br>What matters is what was actually passed.<br><br>*How will this affect corporate/free speech going forward?*<br><br>If we're lucky, corporations will think twice before wading into a<br>state's politics.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Did Florida violate the 1st Amendment by punishing Disney? Will this<br>decision be legally challenged? How will this affect corporate/free<br>speech going forward?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
