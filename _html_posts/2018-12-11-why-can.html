<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Why can\'t Americans compromise and have a minimal public healthcare<br>system which can be optionally expanded with private insurance?**<br><br>I really feel like that's going to be the compromise system we get to.<br>It will be a hybrid system combining some level of basic care for all,<br>along with private insurance beyond that.<br><br>It will essentially be some form of Medicare Part B for all, as a<br>function of being an American citizen. It will be automatic enrollment<br>in Medicare Part B. It will cover all basic healthcare. Any basic care<br>for which you see the doctor, from annual well visits to colds, flu,<br>broken bones and other injuries, allergies, upper respiratory<br>infections, pink eye, etc, would be covered and paid for by Medicare.<br><br>Any care beyond that (specialist care, more intensive care, etc) would<br>be covered by health insurance, which would be more akin to *actual*<br>insurance. It would indemnify you against charges above a deductible. It<br>would require you to coordinate your care through the insurance<br>provider, in the same way your auto insurance will reimburse you for an<br>auto repair once you've paid your deductible.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
