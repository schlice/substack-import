<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Can an HOA force you to sell your home due to non-owner occupancy<br>requirements?**<br><br>An HOA cannot "force you to sell your home."<br><br>An HOA can fine you for violating the Covenants or the Rules. If you<br>fail to pay your fines, the HOA can place a lien on your home, which<br>means you can't refinance or sell until that lien is cleared. The home<br>becomes the collateral for the fines, as the HOA has an ownership<br>interest in the property. Behind the primary mortgage holder, the HOA is<br>next in line.<br><br>If the lien goes unpaid for too long, the lienholder can foreclose<br>on that lien, and they can sell the collateral used in the lien to pay<br>their outstanding debt. This is a drastic step, and it means that<br>negotiations have failed or have broken down, and this usually takes<br>well over a year and a very large sum of money owed (including<br>attorney's fees and late fees) before the HOA would even consider<br>foreclosing.<br><br>As an alternative, the HOA may consider sending the delinquent account<br>to collections, but they are under no obligation to do so unless it is<br>written into the Covenants or the Bylaws of your HOA.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
