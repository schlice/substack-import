<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>At best, she was simply incorrect about scale. At worst, she was<br>outright lying. She said the following:<br><br>> We have hospitals that are almost at full capacity with people<br>> severely ill on ventilators. We have over 100,000 children, which<br>> we've never had before, in serious condition, many on ventilators.<br><br>First, the numbers are wrong. At best, we've had around 89.000 children<br>hospitalized *with COVID* since August. Not currently. Also, that<br>doesn't mean "hospitalized with COVID-19 disease," it means<br>"hospitalized. And oh by the way, we tested them and they happen to be<br>COVID-19 positive, whether or not they have symptoms."<br><br>The "in serious condition, many on ventilators" is just 100% false.<br>There is no truth to that at all, and it makes it seem like we have a<br>hundred thousand kids in PICU units all on ventilators dying from COVID,<br>and that is absolutely incorrect. We are indeed experiencing a bump in<br>cases with Omicron, but it is demonstrably weaker than previous<br>variants, and in most cases is treatable at home with therapeutics. It's<br>certainly not hospitalizing people in record numbers, and it most<br>definitely is not affecting children at the scale she claims.<br><br>Sotomayor, and Justice Breyer (who claimed that we have "750 million new<br>cases" of coronavirus in the country," even though we only have 330<br>million people in the country) are caught in the classic liberal trap.<br>They want to believe that things are really that bad, and they want to<br>do everything they can to "wake people up" to just how bad things are.<br>So they resort to "exaggeration" or even "willful mischaracterization of<br>the facts" in order to make their point. They either don't know, and<br>don't care to know, the actual numbers, and so they just "make up facts"<br>based on snippets of things they heard, or they actually do know the<br>facts and are willfully distorting them to increase their perceived<br>impact at their target audience --- people who hear what Supreme Court<br>Justices say like the old "E.F. Hutton" commercials, people who hang on<br>every word they say as if they are demigods or something.<br><br>They are of the opinion that whatever they think should be true, is<br>actually true, and if they say it, it is true, or it will become true<br>after they say it. Because it becomes true if enough people believe it<br>is true.<br><br>Who would have thought that such illogical thought was possible in our<br>Supreme Court? The level of know-nothingism which has infected even<br>Supreme Court justices is staggering. You would have thought that<br>someone who should have known that they were going to be ruling on COVID<br>cases would have read up on both sides of the issue. They should have at<br>least read the CDC stuff and then read the Great Barrington Declaration<br>in order to understand both sides of the issue. Alas, it seems like<br>those days are over, and we don't even have objective Supreme Court<br>justices any longer.<br><br>So maybe Trump was right to pack the courts (at all levels) with as many<br>Constitutional textualists as he possibly could. Huh.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Why are members of the Supreme Court saying that 100,000 children are<br>hospitalized for COVID in the USA? Where are they getting their<br>information from?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
