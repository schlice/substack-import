<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The last time I saw such a calculation done, they looked at each<br>prophecy and then looked at the probability of that prophecy coming true<br>in the life of a random person.<br><br>The calculation I'm referring to is by Peter Stoner in a book called<br>*Science Speaks*. The book, published in 1958, had a foreword by Dr.<br>Harold Hartzler, an officer of the American Scientific Affiliation. He<br>wrote that the manuscript had been carefully reviewed by a committee of<br>his organization and that "the mathematical analysis included is based<br>upon principles of probability which are thoroughly sound." He further<br>stated that in the opinion of the Affiliation, Professor Stoner "has<br>applied these principles in a proper and convincing way."<br><br>Stoner calculated the probability of just 8 Messianic prophecies being<br>fulfilled in the life of Jesus. As you read through these prophecies,<br>you will see that all estimates were calculated as conservatively as<br>possible.<br><br>1.  The Messiah will be born in Bethlehem (Micah 5:2).\<br>    \<br>    The average population of Bethlehem from the time of Micah to the<br>    time these calculations were done (1958) divided by the average<br>    population of the earth during the same period = 7,150/2,000,000,000<br>    or 2.8×\[math\10\^5\/math\]{.render_latex}.<br>2.  A messenger will prepare the way for the Messiah (Malachi 3:1).\<br>    \<br>    One man in how many, the world over, has had a forerunner (in this<br>    case, John the Baptist) to prepare his way?\<br>    Estimate: 1 in 1,000 or 1×\[math\10\^3\/math\]{.render_latex}.<br>3.  The Messiah will enter Jerusalem as a king riding on a donkey<br>    (Zechariah 9:9).\<br>    \<br>    One man in how many, who has entered Jerusalem as a ruler, has<br>    entered riding on a donkey?\<br>    Estimate: 1 in 100 or 1×\[math\10\^2\/math\]{.render_latex}.<br>4.  The Messiah will be betrayed by a friend and suffer wounds in His<br>    hands (Zechariah 13:6).\<br>    \<br>    One man in how many, the world over, has been betrayed by a friend,<br>    resulting in wounds in his hands?\<br>    Estimate: 1 in 1,000 or 1×\[math\10\^3\/math\]{.render_latex}.<br>5.  The Messiah will be betrayed for 30 pieces of silver (Zechariah<br>    11:12).\<br>    \<br>    Of the people who have been betrayed, one in how many has been<br>    betrayed for exactly 30 pieces of silver?\<br>    Estimate: 1 in 1,000 or 1×\[math\10\^3\/math\]{.render_latex}.<br>6.  The betrayal money will be used to purchase a potter's field<br>    (Zechariah 11:13).\<br>    \<br>    One man in how many, after receiving a bribe for the betrayal of a<br>    friend, has returned the money, had it refused, and then experienced<br>    it being used to buy a potter's field?\<br>    Estimate: 1 in 100,000 or 1×\[math\10\^5\/math\]{.render_latex}.<br>7.  The Messiah will remain silent while He is afflicted (Isaiah 53:7).\<br>    \<br>    One man in how many, when he is oppressed and afflicted, though<br>    innocent, will make no defense of himself?\<br>    Estimate: 1 in 1,000 or 1×\[math\10\^3\/math\]{.render_latex}.<br>8.  The Messiah will die by having His hands and feet pierced (Psalm<br>    22:16).\<br>    \<br>    One man in how many, since the time of David, has been crucified?\<br>    Estimate: 1 in 10,000 or 1×\[math\10\^4\/math\]{.render_latex}.<br><br>Multiplying all these probabilities together produces a number (rounded<br>off) of 1×\[math\10\^{28}\/math\]{.render_latex} . Dividing this<br>number by an estimate of the number of people who have lived since the<br>time of these prophecies (88 billion) produces a probability of all 8<br>prophecies being fulfilled accidently in the life of one person. That<br>probability is 1 in \[math\10\^{17}\/math\]{.render_latex} or 1 in<br>100,000,000,000,000,000.<br><br>And again, that's just *eight* of the prophecies about the Messiah in<br>the Old Testament coming true in the life of one man.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
