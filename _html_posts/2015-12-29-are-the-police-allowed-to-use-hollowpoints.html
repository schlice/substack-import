<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Yes, as far as I know, most law enforcement agencies still use hollow<br>point ammunition. Here\'s why:<br><br>Hollowpoint ammunition deforms much more than \"jacketed\" bullets (lead<br>with a jacket of usually copper) when striking soft targets. This does<br>several things: it imparts more of the kinetic energy of the bullet into<br>the target, and prevents the bullet from continuing on through the<br>target and hitting anyone behind the target (known as<br>\"overpenetrating\"); the bullet stops in the intended target. The<br>downside is that it does make a larger wound (which is presumably why<br>the Hague Convention of 1899 banned it) but it is a safer bullet for<br>bystanders, and more effective against a single target.<br><br>Most agencies I know of use JHP (jacketed hollow points) which are<br>essentially FMJ (full metal jacket) rounds with a hole drilled in the<br>tip.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
