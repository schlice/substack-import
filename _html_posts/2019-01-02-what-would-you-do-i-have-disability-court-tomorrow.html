<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What would you do? I have disability court tomorrow. My lawyer left a<br>message saying he just now reviewed my case, even though I got him 18<br>months ago. Also, he won't be at court due to lack of documentation. Can<br>I do anything?**<br><br>I'll assume by "disability court" that you're referring to a Social<br>Security Disability hearing in front of an administrative law judge<br>(ALJ).<br><br>Not having representation at court (i.e. being unrepresented), or having<br>ill-prepared representation at court (i.e. being underrepresented) are<br>both valid reasons for postponing your hearing.<br><br>I would immediately contact my Office of Disability Adjudication and<br>Review (ODAR), advise them what your lawyer said, and ask if they can<br>postpone the hearing.<br><br>If they postpone your hearing, call your disability representative and<br>advise him that having representation for over a year and only reviewing<br>the case one day before court is not only unacceptable, it's<br>unprofessional. Tell him that you got him a delay of X days, and he had<br>better be prepared for the next court date, and he'd better be there<br>early and have all his ducks in a row or he's going to find himself<br>answering questions from the bar about why he can't perform his<br>essential job functions.<br><br>If they *don't* postpone your hearing, make sure you make it known at<br>the beginning of the proceeding what your lawyer said, and again ask the<br>court for a postponement because of a lack of representation.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
