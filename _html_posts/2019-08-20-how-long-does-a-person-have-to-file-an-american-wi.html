<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**How long does a person have to file an American with Disabilities Act<br>related complaint with the appropriate federal agency?**<br><br>> You have 180 days from the alleged act of discrimination in which to<br>> file a complaint with the appropriate federal agency, unless the time<br>> for filing is extended by the Federal agency for good cause. As long<br>> as the complaint is filed with any Federal agency, the 180-day<br>> requirement will be considered satisfied.<br>><br>> A complaint may be filed with either \--<br>><br>> 1) Any Federal agency that provides funding to the public entity<br>> that is the subject of the complaint;<br>><br>> 2) A Federal agency designated in the title II regulation to<br>> investigate title II complaints; or<br>><br>> 3) The Department of Justice.<br>><br>> Complainants may file with a Federal funding agency that has section<br>> 504 jurisdiction, if known. If no Federal funding agency is known,<br>> then complainants should file with the appropriate designated agency.<br>> In any event, complaints may always be filed with the Department of<br>> Justice, which will refer the complaint to the appropriate agency. The<br>> Department\'s regulation designates eight Federal agencies to<br>> investigate title II complaints primarily in those cases where there<br>> is no Federal agency with section 504<br>> jurisdiction.\[1\](#JmopX){#cite-JmopX .citation_link}<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-JmopX){.citation_index} [[Filing a Discrimination<br>Complaint Under Title II of the<br>ADA](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=7ed332&url=https://www.gpadacenter.org/individuals-disabilities/filing-discrimination-complaint-under-title-ii-ada){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="gpadacenter.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
