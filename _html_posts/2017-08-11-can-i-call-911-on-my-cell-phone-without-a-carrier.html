<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>If your phone can connect to the cellular network and make calls, but<br>you simply have no SIM card or no subscription to a carrier's service,<br>then yes, your phone will be able to call 911. But if the phone is so<br>old that its radios are no longer compatible with the current cellular<br>network, it simply won't work at all.<br><br>I keep a previous generation cell phone in my "safe room" in my house,<br>plugged in to the wall. It has no SIM card, but it still can receive a<br>cellular signal and is still able to make calls on a carrier network. In<br>an emergency, I can use that phone to call 911.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
