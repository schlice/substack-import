<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>It doesn't sound like you were legally joined, because you said that<br>when your status changed, you "broke up." So therefore, if your partner<br>bought the phone outright for you, and gave it to you, it would be<br>considered a "gift" and you would now own the phone.<br><br>If the phone was a contract phone and you were not paying the contract,<br>you don't actually own the phone, the phone company does. So you'd have<br>to give it back to the phone company if your partner cancels the<br>contract.<br><br>In any other scenario (even through an Equipment Installment Plan), the<br>phone is purchased (even if the partner is still paying it off). If the<br>phone was purchased in any way and then given to you, it is a gift, and<br>you own it.<br><br>But in all fairness, it's an iPhone 6s. You can get a much better phone<br>on your own with your own service plan. I'd recommend you wipe it and<br>give it back. Just be done with your partner. Move on.<br><br>Make sure you turn off "Find My iPhone" before you wipe it.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
