<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I happen to attend a church which did not have Christmas Day services.<br><br>We did this for two reasons.<br><br>1.  We had *absolutely amazing* Christmas Eve day services (two of<br>    them to accommodate everyone). Those services were full of amazing,<br>    moving and heartfelt worship, and great, convicting messages by our<br>    entire pastoral team. That service was enough to fill me for *two<br>    weeks*, let alone the one that it will.<br>2.  In our Saturday services, we were reminded that *in all we do, we<br>    are to worship God*. That means in opening presents, in sharing the<br>    day with our families, in going to work, in vacationing, everything.<br>    Do everything for the glory of God. You don't need to gather in<br>    a room to worship God. Everything you do should be in worship to<br>    God. So simply remembering that and doing it (the next day) should<br>    be sufficient. And spending quality time together with family is<br>    also very important, so we chose to not have Christmas Day services.<br><br>So as long as the message is delivered correctly, I think it's not only<br>possible to have no Christmas Day services, I think it can be<br>theologically and doctrinally acceptable.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
