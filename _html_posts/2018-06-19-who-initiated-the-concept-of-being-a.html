<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Google is very informative sometimes. Wikipedia, even more so. This from<br>our friends at Wikipedia:<br><br>> The concept of a sovereign citizen originated in 1971 in the [[Posse<br>> Comitatus<br>> movement](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=cfee35&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posse_Comitatus_(organization)){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container} as a teaching of<br>> Christian Identity minister William P. Gale. The concept has<br>> influenced the tax protester movement, the Christian Patriot movement,<br>> and the redemption movement (which claims that the U.S. government<br>> uses its citizens as collateral against foreign debt).<br>><br>> Gale identified the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States<br>> Constitution as the act that converted sovereign citizens into federal<br>> citizens by their agreement to a contract to accept benefits from the<br>> federal government. Other commentators have identified other acts,<br>> including the Uniform Commercial Code, the Emergency Banking Act, the<br>> Zone Improvement Plan, and the alleged suppression of the Titles of<br>> Nobility Amendment. Some of those in the movement believe that the<br>> term \"sovereign citizen\" is an oxymoron and prefer to label<br>> themselves as individuals \"seeking the<br>> Truth\".\[1\](#IeGjR){#cite-IeGjR .citation_link}<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-IeGjR){.citation_index} [[Sovereign citizen movement -<br>Wikipedia](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=c31cde&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_citizen_movement){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
