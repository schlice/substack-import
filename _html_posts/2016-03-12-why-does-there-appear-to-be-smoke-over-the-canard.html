<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [This is water vapor condensing when the air pressure over<br>the top of the wing gets lower than the pressure needed to tip the dew<br>point.\<br>\<br>Basically, the dew point is a combination of humidity, temperature and<br>pressure, at which airborne water condenses. The air over the top of an<br>aircraft wing is at a lower pressure than the surrounding air. When this<br>happens at the correct humidity and temperature, the water in the air<br>condenses and becomes visible water vapor. This is also why water<br>condenses on a cold drink, for example.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
