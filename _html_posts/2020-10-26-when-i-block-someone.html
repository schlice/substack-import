<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**When you block someone\'s number, do you have to keep it in your<br>phone?**<br><br>The answer is "it depends."<br><br>Some carriers include a block list in their carrier system which<br>integrates with your phone, so that when you block a number in your<br>phone, they add it to your carrier's block list. Different software (iOS<br>vs Android) handles this in different ways, so it's not useful to go<br>through that here.<br><br>The best advice I can give you if you want to pursue this for your phone<br>and your carrier is to contact your carrier's technical support<br>department and ask them how it works. It's so different per device and<br>carrier combination that you will be best served by working with your<br>carrier.<br><br>Phone handsets do have block lists built in, so if you use that feature,<br>the number will stay "in your phone" but in a protected area for blocked<br>numbers. It's not a full-fledged contact entry, it's just a special list<br>off to the side of numbers that you have chosen to block.<br><br>Regardless of how it is blocked, If you get a call or a text from a<br>number in your blocked list, it won't ring and the text message will not<br>appear in your texts.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
