<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>We didn't have to "assume" that it was al-Qaeda behind the attacks. The<br>evidence was pretty clear and was corroborated by the rest of the world.<br>We determined it was al-Qaeda based on good, old-fashioned police work.<br>And while he initially denied it, Osama bin Laden eventually claimed<br>full responsibility for the attack.<br><br>However, we knew it was them before they admitted it.<br><br>A quick look at Wikipedia gives the complete timeline:<br><br>> For several months after the 9/11 attacks, no one, nor any group,<br>> claimed responsibility for the attacks, so the primary responsibility<br>> fell solely upon the hijackers, all of whom were killed and all of<br>> whom left no message or any claim of responsibility, explaining why<br>> they had carried out the attacks. As the media covered the 9/11<br>> attacks unfolding, many quickly speculated that bin Laden was behind<br>> the attacks. On the day of the attacks, the National Security Agency<br>> intercepted communications that pointed to bin Laden, as did German<br>> intelligence agencies. This helped rule out other immediate suspects,<br>> such as Croatian nationalists, who had bombed Grand Central Terminal<br>> on September 11, 1976.<br>><br>> Authorities in the United States and Britain also obtained electronic<br>> intercepts, including telephone conversations and electronic bank<br>> transfers, which indicate that Mohammed Atef, a bin Laden deputy, was<br>> a key figure in the planning of the 9/11 attacks. Intercepts were also<br>> obtained that revealed conversations that took place days before<br>> September 11 between bin Laden and an associate in Pakistan. In those<br>> conversations, the two referred to \"an incident that would take place<br>> in America on, or around, September 11\" and they discussed potential<br>> repercussions. In another conversation with an associate in<br>> Afghanistan, bin Laden discussed the \"scale and effects of a<br>> forthcoming operation.\" These conversations did not specifically<br>> mention the World Trade Center or Pentagon, or other specifics.<br>><br>> The investigators were quickly able to link the 19 men to the<br>> terrorist organization al-Qaeda, also by accessing material in their<br>> intelligence agency files. The *New York Times* reported on September<br>> 12 that: \"Authorities said they had also identified accomplices in<br>> several cities who had helped plan and execute Tuesday's attacks.<br>> Officials said they knew who these people were and important<br>> biographical details about many of them. They prepared biographies of<br>> each identified member of the hijack teams, and began tracing the<br>> recent movements of the men.\" FBI agents in Florida investigating the<br>> hijackers quickly \"descended on flight schools, neighborhoods and<br>> restaurants in pursuit of leads.\" At one flight school, \"students<br>> said investigators were there within hours of Tuesday's attacks.\" The<br>> *Washington Post* later reported that \"In the hours after Tuesday's<br>> bombings, investigators searched their files on \Satam\ al-Suqami<br>> and \Ahmed\ al-Ghamdi, noted the pair's ties to \Nabil\ al-Marabh<br>> and launched a hunt for him.\"<br>><br>> Based on the evidence, authorities in the United States quickly<br>> asserted that Osama bin Laden and his al-Qaeda organization were<br>> solely responsible for the attacks, and other suspects were ruled out.<br>> The Government of the United Kingdom reached the same conclusion.<br>> Although he denied the attacks at first, Osama bin Laden had since<br>> claimed full responsibility.\[1\](#UhMNM){#cite-UhMNM<br>> .citation_link}<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-UhMNM){.citation_index} [[Responsibility for the September<br>11 attacks -<br>Wikipedia](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=912cbf&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsibility_for_the_September_11_attacks){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
