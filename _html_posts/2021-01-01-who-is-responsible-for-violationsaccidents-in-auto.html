<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Who is responsible for an accident involving an autonomous car?<br><br>For the sake of clarity, we're not addressing *semi-autonomous cars*,<br>which have a driver at the controls and the vehicle is driving on its<br>own (like Tesla's Autopilot). In that instance, the driver is always the<br>person in control and is always responsible for any accidents caused.<br><br>We are only addressing *fully autonomous cars*, which in many cases<br>don't even have steering wheels or pedals.<br><br>When fully autonomous cars are allowed to drive in all 50 states (they<br>are not yet), it will be the vehicle manufacturer and the software which<br>will be responsible for an accident caused by the autonomous car,<br>following current automobile product liability laws. Humans will still<br>be liable for any decisions which they direct (for example, telling the<br>car where to park).<br><br>In fact, Volvo has already announced that they will pay for any<br>accidents (injuries or damages) caused by their autonomous cars.<br><br>How can they be so confident? One of the things that works in the<br>autonomous car's favor is that there will be a *wealth* of data<br>available to accident investigators from the autonomous car. This is a<br>huge boon in determining liability. Being able to compare how an<br>autonomous car responded versus how a human should have responded and<br>ultimately did respond will be big factors in determining<br>fault.\[1\](#fVjeF){#cite-fVjeF .citation_link}<br><br>I can confidently predict that in most cases, it will still be the human<br>driver who will be found at fault.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-fVjeF){.citation_index} [[Self-driving car liability -<br>Wikipedia](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=d34ca4&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-driving_car_liability){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
