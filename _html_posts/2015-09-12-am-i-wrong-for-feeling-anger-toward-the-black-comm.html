<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [I think you\'d have to ask yourself why you\'re angry at<br>an entire group of people when it\'s likely that you\'re just angry at a<br>few people who do not represent the thoughts, feelings, and actions of<br>the whole.\<br>\<br>Why do you look at their actions and *judge* them, as a group, for what<br>a small few have done?\<br>\<br>More specifically, what have they (as individuals or as a group) done to<br>*you specifically* to make you angry?\<br>\<br>While I never like to tell someone that their feelings are wrong, I will<br>tell you that your feelings are likely *misplaced*. You probably<br>shouldn\'t be angry at all black people. You should probably be angry at<br>the few who make the whole look bad.\<br>\<br>I\'m angry at the stupid whites who go shooting up churches and make all<br>whites look bad. I\'m not mad at all whites, or all Southerners for that<br>matter. I\'m not really even mad at the mentally ill person who does<br>horrid things. I\'m more mad that we developed a system in this country<br>which made it so difficult and so stigmatized that mentally ill people<br>who are not dangerous enough to be hospitalized can fester without help<br>until they do snap. *That* is a travesty.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
