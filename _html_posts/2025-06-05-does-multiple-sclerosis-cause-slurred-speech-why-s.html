<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>It can. MS can interfere with the muscles in your mouth and throat, and<br>that interference is most commonly seen in swallowing issues. However,<br>it can also interfere with your mouth and tongue, which could result in<br>slurred speech.<br><br>But as with anything, having slurred speech is not a sign of MS. It's a<br>sign of *a host of conditions, one of which could be MS*. If slurred<br>speech is the only symptom, the root cause of that symptom would have to<br>be found. It could be MS, but it could be a host of other diseases or<br>conditions too.<br><br>\<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*This answer is not professional medical advice, nor is it a substitute<br>for professional medical advice.
