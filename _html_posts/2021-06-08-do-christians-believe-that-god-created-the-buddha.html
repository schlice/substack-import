<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>No.<br><br>There is a pervasive belief in society that one supreme being created<br>all religions, and that people around the world just interpreted that<br>one religion differently. They basically believe that all religion came<br>from the same God, even though they teach different (and contradictory)<br>things. If that were true and all religion came from one god, then it<br>wouldn't be right to criticize any of them.<br><br>However, God does not contradict himself. God is not "a God of<br>confusion" (1 Cor 14:33 ESV). Since some religions teach things which<br>are in contradiction, it is not logical that one God created all<br>religions. And if it is true that there is one supreme being that was<br>just misinterpreted, then not all religions are "right." Only one is<br>"right," and the rest are misinterpretations of the "right" religion.<br><br>The teachings of Buddhism contradict the teachings of the Bible:<br><br>- The Bible tells us that Jesus was raised from the dead; Buddhism<br>  denies this.<br>- The Bible says that belief in Jesus' death and resurrection are the<br>  only way to salvation. Buddhism claims you must follow "the eight fold<br>  path" to Nirvana.<br>- The Bible teaches that each of us has an eternal soul which will be<br>  judged on the last day, and when we die, we await the day of<br>  judgement. Buddhism teaches that we are in a constant cycle of rebirth<br>  until we reach Nirvana.<br><br>Because of these (and other) contradictory teachings, it is not possible<br>that God created Buddhism or that God created Buddha to teach people<br>anything. Because the teachings of Gautama Buddha contradict the<br>teachings of the Bible, it is not logical to believe that God created<br>Buddha to teach people.<br><br>God sent Jesus to teach people. God did not send Buddha to teach people.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Do Christians believe that God created the Buddha to teach people?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
