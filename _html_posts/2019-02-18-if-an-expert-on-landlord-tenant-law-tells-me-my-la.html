<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If an expert on landlord tenant law tells me my landlady disapproves<br>of my middle class friends because they\'re probably giving me rides to<br>get access to the illicit sex and drugs on the property, what should I<br>do? I know they aren\'t. I can\'t move.**<br><br>Thankfully, your landlady's approval of your friends is not a contingent<br>portion of your lease. Unless you have some kind of "friend clause" in<br>your lease, what your landlady thinks of your friends is not really<br>relevant.<br><br>Now, she may refuse to renew your lease when it comes up, and she has<br>every right to refuse to renew your lease when it comes due. However,<br>she can't really kick you out because she doesn't like your friends. I<br>don't think a judge would look too kindly into a landlord breaking a<br>lease agreement because she thinks your friends are sketchy.<br><br>If the police have been called to the unit on more than one occasion<br>because of something illegal you may or may not be doing, that *might*<br>be grounds to evict you, but not liking your friends? Nah.<br><br>But when your lease is up, you might be ready to find another place to<br>live.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
