<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>There is no cure for MS currently.<br><br>There is also no "functional cure," such that any indication of the<br>disease has been eradicated from the body.<br><br>There are treatments which provide some symptom relief to most patients.<br>Most treatments involve good diet choices along with one of the approved<br>disease-modifying drugs. These drugs shorten the length of MS relapses,<br>along with lengthening the amount of time between relapses and reducing<br>their severity. In some cases, the medications slow and repress disease<br>activity to such a degree that the brain can potentially begin to heal,<br>but this has not been studied to any significant degree.<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*This answer is not professional medical advice**, nor is it a<br>substitute for professional medical advice.
