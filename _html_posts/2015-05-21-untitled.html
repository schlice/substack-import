<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: [Not for the officer. The officer has to get it right the<br>first time or he can face charges. Just look at Baltimore. Arrested<br>someone incorrectly and you face prosecution by the very state that<br>employs you.\<br>\<br>I suspect that the grand jury indictments of these officers will cause a<br>chilling effect across all departments, and more departments will simply<br>detain people (which they can do for up to 72 hours without pressing<br>charges) instead of outright arresting people. They will then take the<br>time to investigate thoroughly to ensure that the charges are valid.\<br>\<br>For the citizen, if an officer is arresting you, you must let him.<br>Failing to do that is resisting arrest.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/Can-police-officers-get-into-trouble-for-not-arresting-people-when-theyre-supposed-to/answer/Bill-Stein<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
