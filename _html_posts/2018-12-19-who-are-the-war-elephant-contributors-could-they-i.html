<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Hi readers!<br><br>My DW (for new readers, you'll see that acronym around; it stands for<br>Darling Wife) thinks I talk too much. She thinks I stick my nose into<br>other people's business, and that I inject my opinion at more times than<br>for which it is asked.<br><br>And that's why I write.<br><br>I can exercise my creative talents and write about things that I like,<br>things I know about, and things that interest me. And it helps to save<br>my marriage. Win-win.<br><br>But first, a little about me, as it is my history that most greatly<br>influences my writing. I grew up on Long Island as a staunch Roman<br>Catholic. My dad was a cop, and my mom was a teacher. I did the whole<br>CCD thing as a kid, and basically grew up in the church. If there was a<br>church job for a lay person, I did it: I was an altar boy, I was a<br>sacristan, I was an organist, I was a cantor, I was a Eucharistic<br>Minister. I went to an all-boys Catholic high school. I played the organ<br>during our church services (we had a reclaimed theater organ from a<br>movie theater being torn down), accompanied the Glee Club, and sang with<br>them, too.<br><br>That whole music thing started when my parents caught me playing the<br>Sesame Street theme song on one of these toy pianos:<br><br>[[Amazon.com: Schoenhut 25-Key My First Piano II, Red: Toys &<br>Games](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=ed6508&url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000IGEEC6){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="amazon.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>I don't remember the brand of piano I had as a child, but this is a fair<br>approximation of it. It has little hammers that strike steel rods, and<br>mine was much the same. But yeah, I picked up the theme song by ear. At<br>age 3.<br><br>By age 5, they had me in piano lessons. By age 6, they had discovered<br>that I had perfect pitch. I started supplementing my playing in middle<br>school with singing, in the choir and in solo performances. By the time<br>I graduated high school, I was performing with the Glee Club as well as<br>on stage with the Drama Club, and played in two concert series<br>performances at Carnegie Hall. I sang in All-County, All-State, and<br>All-Eastern Choirs. I was a soloist in our All-State choir.<br><br>I went off to college and graduated from the US Air Force Academy's<br>Class of 1994. I graduated with a BS in General Engineering, and an<br>emphasis in Legal Studies. Constitutional Law was my favorite class; it<br>came effortlessly for me. I served as a Communications officer for 5<br>years on Active Duty. My last duty station on Active Duty was in the<br>Systems Center in NORAD. I served as a Crew Commander on a few crews, as<br>well as serving as Chief of Operations. I also had a "secondary AFSC" of<br>Security Forces Officer. Back in the day, we called it a wartime skill.<br>It was a job that we could do to "augment" critical career fields during<br>times of contingency. I served as an ART/SRT Team Leader, also at NORAD.<br>I'm not a "gun nut," because you're only officially classified as a gun<br>nut if you have more than two gun safes (I only have two) and they're<br>full (mine aren't *completely* full). I am a "gun enthusiast," and<br>combine that with my legal bent, and I spend lots of time defending the<br>2nd Amendment.<br><br>I spent an additional 7 years in the Air Force Reserves, doing the same<br>job, while working for several high-tech companies (I currently work for<br>Dell).<br><br>And then, I got MS, which effectively ended my military career. I could<br>literally go on for weeks about that, so suffice it to say that I'm<br>currently well-controlled, with occasional niggles, on my third<br>medicine,<br>[Gilenya(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=1d8fed&url=https://gilenya.com/index.jsp){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="gilenya.com"}]{.qlink_container}. I currently own the<br>[[Multiple Sclerosis<br>Forum](https://multiplesclerosisforum.quora.com/)]{.qlink_container}<br>here on Quora, discussing all things MS (EDIT: New neurologist, new<br>medicine. I'm now on to<br>[Zeposia(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=826efb&url=https://www.zeposia.com/multiple-sclerosis/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="zeposia.com"}]{.qlink_container}, which is real similar to<br>Gilenya but acts against fewer S1P receptors so is apparently safer. We<br>shall see).<br><br>Understanding *all of that*, you'd probably not be surprised to find<br>that I enjoy writing about the following topics:<br><br>- Military (specifically, the Air Force, and the Air Force Academy, or<br>  service academies in general)<br>- Multiple Sclerosis<br>- Police and Law Enforcement, and Law in Everyday Life<br>- Conservatism<br>- The Constitution<br>- Christianity<br><br>I'm no longer Roman Catholic. I dabbled in United Methodism (which was a<br>nice segue away from the RCC), and I am now simply Christian. I attend a<br>non-denominational Bible-based Christian church. But I have been a<br>Conservative for as long as I could formulate an opinion. As I age (note<br>that I did not say gracefully; I am aging kicking and screaming: I live<br>by the "growing old is mandatory, growing up is optional" mantra), I<br>find that some of my views have been tending towards Libertarian (or at<br>least, less Conservative). This may be because I'm simply disgusted by<br>career politicians and the rise of bureaucratic despotism in this<br>country. Term limits FTW!<br><br>War Elephant is *literally the perfect fit* for me. I really truly hope<br>they feel the same. Smart, thoughtful, passionate writers live here, and<br>somehow they accepted me into their company. I won't be like Groucho<br>Marx; I'm happy to be part of a club that would accept me as a member.<br>Hopefully, I can live up to the high bar they've already set.<br><br>I try to be respectful always, and I try to back my answers with<br>research and reason and logic. I'm not always successful, but I am<br>sincere in my attempt. It's taken me nearly five years to figure out<br>that BNBR isn't about *being incorrect*, it's about *saying a correct<br>thing in an incorrect way*.<br><br>Please feel free to read my body of work here at Quora.
