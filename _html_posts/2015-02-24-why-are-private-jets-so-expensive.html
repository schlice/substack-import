<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Economies of scale.\<br>\<br>Commercial airlines keep prices relatively low because they sell massive<br>amounts of seats. They also use algorithms to determine how many people<br>will buy a ticket and not show up, thus allowing them to \"oversell\" a<br>flight, because a certain amount of people will not mind switching to a<br>less-crowded flight in exchange for a dollar-amount voucher. They<br>operate large numbers of aircraft and operate on a massive scale.\<br>\<br>Smaller private jet co-ops do not have the luxuries of exploiting an<br>economy of scale, so they rely on owners paying fractionally for the<br>aircraft and its costs, and throwing in the flights. With many co-op<br>programs, you can also buy time in the system and not take an ownership.<br>As you can imagine, buying in to a private jet co-op is an expensive<br>proposition, more expensive than buying commercial airline<br>tickets.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
