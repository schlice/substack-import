<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If you get caught with numerous drugs and don't take you to jail or<br>even give you a ticket, can you be charged for it later?**<br><br>The short answer is yes, they can, but it's likely that they won't.<br><br>Legally, they have up to the statute of limitations in order to charge<br>you with a crime. For example, if you are caught for possession but<br>never charged, the district attorney has up to the statute of<br>limitations in order to charge you with that crime.<br><br>However, if they had you, but they let you go, it's usually because they<br>chose to not prosecute that crime. If they made that choice now, it's<br>not likely they'll change their mind in the future.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
