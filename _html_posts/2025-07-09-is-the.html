<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Ooo, an excellent question!<br><br>If God is eternal, how can He be the Alpha and the Omega? If He has no<br>beginning and no end (as He is eternal), how can He have a beginning and<br>an end? How can He be the Alpha and the Omega?<br><br>The title \"Alpha and Omega\" is used to describe God\'s eternal nature,<br>not to indicate a temporal beginning or end in the way humans experience<br>time. God\'s eternality means He has always existed and always will<br>exist, encompassing all of time within His being. Therefore, He is the<br>Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end, not in a linear sense,<br>but as the totality of existence. He was there at the Alpha, and He will<br>be there at the Omega. We say "alpha" and "omega" because alpha is the<br>first letter of the Greek alphabet, and omega is the last. This turn of<br>phrase was used to indicate the whole of anything, from beginning to<br>end.<br><br>Therefore, "I am the Alpha and the Omega" doesn't indicate that Jesus<br>has a beginning and an end. It can only be identifiable with an eternal<br>God who is *present* at the beginning and the end. He is unchanging, and<br>He is there for it all.<br><br>Jesus as the beginning and end of all things is a reference to no one<br>but the true eternal God.<br><br>In fact, it makes logical sense. How can Jesus have a beginning? If<br>Jesus created all things (John 1:3), He would have to exist before "all<br>things" existed. Therefore, Jesus can't have a beginning, because He<br>would have to exist before He existed, or He would not have been able to<br>create all things.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
