<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: [Then this is a failing of the justice system that allowed<br>them to occur. Judges are supposed to be the voice of reason in the<br>process (assuming that the police are simply non-thinking brutes, much<br>like pit bulls straining against their chains, just itching to be let<br>off the leash). Judges are supposed to analyze the evidence and only<br>employ them when the circumstances absolutely call for them.\<br>\<br>So that means that either judges are becoming more lenientin allowing<br>them, or the times that they have actually been needed has actually<br>increased. Don\'t discount the fact that crime and criminals may have<br>become more violent since the 80\'s.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/What-would-it-cost-to-fortify-ones-home-well-enough-that-the-police-cannot-break-into-it/answer/Bill-Stein<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
