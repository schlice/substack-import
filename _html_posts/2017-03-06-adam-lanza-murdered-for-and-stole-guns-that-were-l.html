What<br>law would have prevented this?<br><br>Let me answer for you: **there is no law that can stop someone from<br>breaking the law.**<br><br>If a law is going to be broken, you cannot stop the criminal by *passing<br>a new law.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
