<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Great question!<br><br>First, please discuss with your doctor, if you haven't done so yet.<br>Sometimes, fatigue isn't just MS lassitude. There are medical issues<br>which can cause fatigue, either related to, or unrelated to MS, such as<br>depression, thyroid disease, and anemia. Your doctor should check for<br>these conditions.<br><br>Fatigue can also be a side effect of some medications; your neurologist<br>should review everything you're taking.<br><br>Finally, the [[MS<br>Society](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=4c2dce&url=http://www.nationalmssociety.org/Symptoms-Diagnosis/MS-Symptoms/Fatigue){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="nationalmssociety.org"}]{.qlink_container} recommends the<br>following interventions for fatigue:<br><br>> - Occupational therapy to simplify tasks at work and home.<br>> - Physical therapy to learn energy-saving ways of walking (with or<br>>   without assistive devices) and performing other daily tasks, and to<br>>   develop a regular exercise program (which you already have done, so<br>>   focus more on PT to learn more energy-saving ways to do everyday<br>>   tasks)<br>> - Sleep regulation, which might involve treating other MS symptoms<br>>   that interfere with sleep (e.g., spasticity, urinary problems) and<br>>   using sleep medications on a short-term basis.<br>> - Psychological interventions, such as stress management, relaxation<br>>   training, membership in a support group, or psychotherapy.<br>> - Heat management --- strategies to avoid overheating and to cool<br>>   down.<br>> - Medications --- [[amantadine hydrochloride<br>>   (Symmetrel®)](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=e69066&url=http://www.nationalmssociety.org/Treating-MS/Medications/Amantadine){.external_link<br>>   rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>>   onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>>   qt-tooltip="nationalmssociety.org"}]{.qlink_container} and<br>>   [[modafinil<br>>   (Provigil®)](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=e437cd&url=http://www.nationalmssociety.org/Treating-MS/Medications/Provigil){.external_link<br>>   rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>>   onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>>   qt-tooltip="nationalmssociety.org"}]{.qlink_container} --- are the<br>>   most commonly prescribed. While neither is approved specifically by<br>>   the U.S Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of<br>>   MS-related fatigue, each has demonstrated some benefit in clinical<br>>   trials. The most recent trial of modafinil, however, reported no<br>>   difference between modafinil and placebo in relieving<br>>   fatigue.\[1\](#jqQpN){#cite-jqQpN .citation_link}<br><br>I have to agree with [[Michele<br>Camera](https://www.quora.com/profile/Michele-Camera)]{.qlink_container}<br>and the Monster suggestion. I have been able to power through fatigue<br>when I need it with that stuff.<br><br>I also swear by heat management. I've noticed that if I've ever<br>overheated myself due to over-exertion, I'm totally spent. It's vicious<br>when it happens. I've literally fallen asleep in my clothes when I've<br>done it.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-jqQpN){.citation_index}<br>[Fatigue(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=4c2dce&url=http://www.nationalmssociety.org/Symptoms-Diagnosis/MS-Symptoms/Fatigue){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="nationalmssociety.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*This answer is not professional medical advice**, nor is it a<br>substitute for professional medical advice.
