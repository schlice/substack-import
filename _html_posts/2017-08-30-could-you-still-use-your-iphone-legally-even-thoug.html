<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>In 2010, Federal regulators added jailbreaking to a list of exemptions<br>from the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. This means that it is not a<br>violation of copyright law to jailbreak your phone.<br><br>They did not rule that jailbreaking does not violate the EULA. Apple<br>can, under its own power, deny users access to the iTunes Store, or deny<br>them access to any other Apple-owned service, if they violate the EULA<br>and jailbreak the device. Note that they have not done this, nor is it<br>in their best interest to alienate over 9 million iPhone users who have<br>jailbroken their phones. Additionally, they still want to have a<br>mechanism to update these phones to supported (and non-jailbroken)<br>firmware, so they will not block those phones from the Apple network.<br>Violating the EULA is not a violation of "law." You can still legally<br>use your jailbroken iPhone.<br><br>Remember, jailbreaking simply means that you "unrestrict" the phone so<br>it can run any application you choose, even applications which were not<br>specifically authorized or tested by Apple. Apple does not like this<br>because it degrades the user experience and introduces security<br>vulnerabilities from software which they have not tested.<br><br>But jailbreaking your phone is not "illegal."<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
