<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If the police stops you for running a red light, but you are 100%<br>certain the light\'s still yellow when you cross the intersection, but<br>there\'s no dashcam to prove, what should you do?**<br><br>What you do is entirely up to you.<br><br>Remember that the officer is not going to argue that you ran a red<br>light. He's going to argue that you failed to stop. This is very<br>different from running a red light.<br><br>The law says that a motorist must make a reasonable attempt to stop when<br>the light changes. If you did not slow down, attempt to slow down, or if<br>you *sped up* (which some people do when they see a yellow light), the<br>officer can cite you for that.<br><br>And at that point, and with no other evidence or witnesses, it's your<br>word against his. And the court will likely side with him.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
