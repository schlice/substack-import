<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [There is always a point to publicizing mass shootings.\<br>\<br>The problem is, most people *miss the point.* The President is a big<br>reason most people miss the point.\<br>\<br>Even before they finished searching the campus for bombs, before they<br>could ascertain exactly what had happened, the President was calling for<br>increased gun control.\<br>\<br>Missed the point.\<br>\<br>I think most people intuitively know that *the shooting wasn\'t caused<br>by guns.* So how can you hope to *fix* the issue when you\'re not<br>addressing the *cause*?\<br>\<br>But so many people tend to focus on the gun. It\'s easy to do that,<br>isn\'t it? It\'s easy to focus on the gun, because it\'s *tangible*.<br>It\'s a real thing you can hold and presumably regulate.\<br>\<br>People, on the other hand, are *messy.* It\'s decidedly harder to fix<br>*people* than it is to fix *guns.* And no one wants to admit that drugs<br>can\'t help every mentally ill person, nor that deinstitutionalization<br>wasn\'t a rousing success for everyone. As is often the case, a<br>one-size-fits-all solution is never the answer, as there are always some<br>for whom the answer doesn\'t fit.\<br>\<br>If we actually use incidents like these to highlight the failings of the<br>mental health system in the country, we could start making positive<br>changes to that system.\<br>\<br>Until then, incidents like these will only be ratings fodder for the<br>drive-by media.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
