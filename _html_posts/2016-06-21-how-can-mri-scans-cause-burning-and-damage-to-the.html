<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>From mrisafety.com:<br><br>> Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is a relatively safe diagnostic<br>> modality. However, damaged radiofrequency coils, physiologic monitors,<br>> electronically-activated devices, and external accessories or objects<br>> made from conductive materials have caused excessive heating,<br>> resulting in burn injuries to patients undergoing MR procedures.<br>> Heating of implants and similar devices may also occur, but this tends<br>> to be problematic primarily for objects made from conductive materials<br>> that have elongated shapes or that form loops of a certain diameter.<br>> For example, excessive MRI-related heating has been reported for<br>> leads, guidewires, certain types of catheters (e.g., catheters with<br>> thermistors or other conducting components), and certain external<br>> fixation or cervical fixation devices.\[1\](#DAEbh){#cite-DAEbh<br>> .citation_link}<br><br>It seems that most burn injuries caused by MRIs can be isolated to the<br>following causes:<br><br>- Faulty MRI equipment<br>- Conductive external or internal implants<br>- Old tattoos which contained metallic ions in the dye<br>- Body parts in direct contact with the transmitting coils<br>- Conducting objects in the RF field causing a concentration of the RF<br>  energy<br>- Microfiber clothing which contains metallic ions (such as silver<br>  thread in a microfiber shirt)<br><br>Here are the guidelines to perform an appropriate and safe MRI. If these<br>do not happen when you go to get your MRI, tell the MR tech immediately.<br>If they refuse to fix it, stop the scan and inform your doctor.<br><br>1.  The patient should change into a gown or other appropriate attire<br>    that does not contain metallic material.<br>2.  Prepare the patient for the MR procedure by ensuring that there are<br>    no unnecessary metallic objects contacting the patient's skin (e.g.,<br>    drug delivery patches with metallic components, jewelry, necklaces,<br>    bracelets, key chains, etc.).<br>3.  Prepare the patient for the MR procedure by using insulation<br>    material (i.e. appropriate padding) to prevent skin-to-skin contact<br>    points and the formation of "closed-loops" from touching body parts.<br>4.  Insulating material (minimum recommended thickness, 1-cm) should be<br>    placed between the patient's skin and transmit RF coil that is used<br>    for the MR procedure (alternatively, the transmit RF coil itself<br>    should be padded). There should be no direct contact between the<br>    patient's skin and the transmit RF body coil of the MR system. This<br>    may be accomplished by having the patient place his/her arms over<br>    his/her head or by using elbow pads or foam padding between the<br>    patient's tissue and the transmit RF body coil of the MR system.<br>    This is especially important for MR examinations that use the<br>    transmit RF body coil or other large RF coils for transmission of RF<br>    energy.<br>5.  Use only electrically conductive devices, equipment, accessories<br>    (e.g., ECG leads, electrodes, etc.), and materials that have been<br>    thoroughly tested and determined to be safe or otherwise acceptable<br>    for MR procedures.<br>6.  Carefully follow specific MR safety or MR conditional criteria and<br>    recommendations for implants and devices made from<br>    electrically-conductive materials (e.g., bone fusion stimulators,<br>    neurostimulation systems, cardiac pacemakers, cochlear implants,<br>    intracranial pressure monitoring catheters, etc.).<br>7.  Before using electrical equipment, check the integrity of the<br>    insulation and/or housing of all components including surface RF<br>    coils, monitoring leads, cables, and wires. Preventive maintenance<br>    should be practiced routinely for such equipment.<br>8.  Remove all non-essential electrically conductive materials from the<br>    MR system prior to the MR procedure (i.e. unused surface RF coils,<br>    ECG leads, EEG leads, cables, wires, etc.).<br>9.  Keep electrically conductive materials that must remain in the MR<br>    system from directly contacting the patient by placing thermal<br>    and/or electrical insulation between the conductive material and the<br>    patient.<br>10. Keep electrically conductive materials that must remain within the<br>    transmit body RF coil or other transmit RF coil of the MR system<br>    from forming conductive loops. Note: The patient's tissue is<br>    conductive and, therefore, may be involved in the formation of a<br>    conductive loop, which can be circular, U-shaped, or S-shaped.<br>11. Position electrically conductive materials to prevent "cross<br>    points". A cross point is the point where a cable crosses another<br>    cable, where a cable loops across itself, or where a cable touches<br>    either the patient or sides of the transmit RF coil more than once.<br>    Even the close proximity of conductive materials with each other<br>    should be avoided because cables and RF coils can<br>    capacitively-couple (without any contact or crossover) when placed<br>    close together.<br>12. Position electrically conductive materials (e.g., cables, wires,<br>    etc.) to exit down the *center of the MR system*, *not* along the<br>    side of the MR system or close to the transmit RF body coil or other<br>    transmit RF coil.<br>13. Do not position electrically conductive materials across an external<br>    metallic prosthesis (e.g., external fixation device, cervical<br>    fixation device, etc.) or similar device that is in direct contact<br>    with the patient.<br>14. Allow only properly trained individuals to operate devices (e.g.,<br>    monitoring equipment) in the MR environment.<br>15. Follow all manufacturer instructions for the proper operation and<br>    maintenance of physiologic monitoring or other similar electronic<br>    equipment intended for use during MR procedures.<br>16. Electrical devices that do not appear to be operating properly<br>    during the MR procedure should be removed from the patient<br>    immediately.<br>17. Closely monitor the patient during the MR procedure. If the patient<br>    reports sensations of heating or other unusual sensation,<br>    discontinue the MR procedure immediately and perform a thorough<br>    assessment of the situation.\[2\](#gOGjl){#cite-gOGjl<br>    .citation_link}<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-DAEbh){.citation_index} [[MRISafety.com -<br>Info](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=e6472d&url=http://www.mrisafety.com/SafetyInfov.asp?SafetyInfoID%3D166){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="mrisafety.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>\[2\](#cite-gOGjl){.citation_index} [[MRISafety.com -<br>Info](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=e6472d&url=http://www.mrisafety.com/SafetyInfov.asp?SafetyInfoID%3D166){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="mrisafety.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
