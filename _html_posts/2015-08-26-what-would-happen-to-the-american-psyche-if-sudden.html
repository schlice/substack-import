<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [I know that your question involves modifying the Second<br>Amendment, and as you have already heard from others, you can\'t just<br>\"modify\" an Amendment without another Amendment that either modifies<br>or repeals it.\<br>\<br>But what if you could pass a law that made it harder to buy guns? Your<br>argument is that you still have the right to bear arms, but you just<br>can\'t buy them. If you can get them, however, you can \"bear\" them.<br>This, however, violates the spirit and the letter of the Second<br>Amendment, because any law that prevents you from buying, owning, or<br>using guns is illegal. Clearly, we have placed some sensible<br>restrictions on purchasing and owning guns (convicted felons and the<br>mentally ill cannot own them, along with the myriad of other laws at a<br>state level), but laws that prevent you from owning (which includes the<br>purchase of) guns are unconstitutional.\<br>\<br>(EDIT) I\'d like to address the additional comment of the OP, who added<br>*\"The OP would like to think we still value a human life over the right<br>to own and play with your guns.\"*\<br>\<br>The OP clearly believes that his right to be free from gun violence<br>trumps my right to defend myself *against* gun violence. There is<br>nothing at all that prevents a criminal from acquiring a gun illegally,<br>and using it against me illegally. So if I have to follow the law and<br>the criminal, by very definition, does not, the only people affected if<br>you \"remove guns\" are the likes of me \-- honest, law-abiding citizens<br>who, if you met me on the street, you\'d never know that I was carrying<br>a gun. Heck, you\'ve probably met me before, a thousand times, and you<br>had no idea that I had a gun secreted on my person. That\'s the point.<br>Unless there is some need for you to see my gun, you\'ll probably never,<br>ever see it. *My* guns are used only for defense, never for offense. And<br>under the Constitution, I retain the right to defend myself against all<br>forms of tyranny and evil with my guns.\<br>\<br>Really, it\'s not about you. Don\'t make my rights about you. My rights<br>are about me.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
