<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The source of the information in legislation does not invalidate the<br>bill. The information from the book may have been used as \"reference<br>material\" and should be cited appropriately, but there are really no<br>copyright issues here since the US Government does not publish works for<br>sale, it writes laws.<br><br>I would hope that a simple letter to the Office of the Law Revision<br>Counsel would correct any oversight in failing to properly attribute the<br>quote, especially during positive law codification if the bill ever<br>becomes law and is added to US Code.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
