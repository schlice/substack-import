Other minorities have been screwed over too. Only focusing on<br>one minority takes away the spotlight from other minorities.**<br><br>1.  Black Lives Matter is an organization that was created from a lie.<br>2.  Its usefulness as a movement has absolutely nothing to do with black<br>    lives.<br><br>Black Lives Matter has as its impetus the lie that Michael Brown was<br>killed by white police officer Darren Wilson in cold blood, while he was<br>surrendering, with his hands up. This lie has been completely and<br>utterly disproven, and even the "witness" who reported seeing this not<br>only did not see anything, but wasn't even anywhere near the incident.<br>Forensics actually match Wilson's account of the situation, that Brown<br>was actually struggling with him to get control of his firearm, and<br>Wilson shot him to stop the attack.<br><br>Nevertheless, drawing on Winston Churchill's legacy, when he said,<br>"Never let a good crisis go to waste," Black Lives Matter was born.<br><br>The movement was co-founded by Patrisse Cullors, who freely admits that<br>she is a trained Marxist.<br><br>> Co-founder Patrisse Cullors has been surprisingly open about the<br>> group\'s real agenda for years. \"We are trained Marxists,\" she<br>> warned. \"We are super-versed on ideological theories.\" During a<br>> candid interview in 2015, [[Cullors<br>> explained](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=d314eb&url=https://nypost.com/2020/06/25/blm-co-founder-describes-herself-as-trained-marxist/){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="nypost.com"}]{.qlink_container} that BLM has \"really<br>> clear direction as to where we want to take this movement. I don\'t<br>> believe it\'s going to fizzle out,\" she said, somewhat prophetically.<br>> \"It just gets stronger\...\" \[1\](#tIltG){#cite-tIltG<br>> .citation_link}<br><br>They are entirely disinterested in protecting or enhancing black lives.<br>The are far more interested in destroying the current system and<br>replacing it with a Marxist and socialist paradise. And violence is just<br>one way they intend to be heard.<br><br>> \"If this country doesn\'t give us what we want,\" Greater New York<br>> Black Lives Matter President Hawk Newsome<br>> [warned(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=8baf69&url=https://www.foxnews.com/media/black-lives-matter-leader-burn-down-system){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="foxnews.com"}]{.qlink_container}, \"then we will burn down<br>> this system and replace it.\"<br><br>But it might surprise you to learn that \"what they want\" isn\'t an end<br>to police brutality or racism.

Because while<br>those statements are all true, they don't play off of the "fear" that<br>these people have instilled in the minority community that white police<br>officers are roaming the streets just looking for little n\*\*\*\*rs to<br>kill.<br><br>Never let a good crisis go to waste. And BLM has hijacked the "race<br>crisis" to instill their vision of a new America on the backs of people<br>that they deliberately lied to in order to convince them that there is<br>far more of an issue than there actually is. Don't get me wrong, racism<br>exists, and it drives the interactions of some people. But does racism<br>exist *to the extent that BLM would like you to believe?* Not even<br>close.<br><br>\<br><br>*Sorry, no comments on this one. It's just too hot-button of an issue to<br>allow comments.*<br><br>*If you don\'t like what I wrote, tough shit.
