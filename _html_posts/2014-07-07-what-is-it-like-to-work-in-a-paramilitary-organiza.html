<br/><br/>Answer<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content: [Our local police departments in the United States are akin<br/>to paramilitary organizations. Paramilitary organizations tend to have<br/>similar (if less detailed) rank structures (usually officers, troopers<br/>or deputies, sergeants, lieutenants, captains or bureau chiefs, deputy<br/>chief or undersheriff, and chief of police or sheriff, but those can<br/>differ by department). They hold many of the same ideals but are much<br/>closer to home.\<br/>\<br/>The Sheriff\'s Department feels like much more of a family than the<br/>military ever did. Granted, military families were close because of<br/>their shared experiences and ideals, but the actual working organization<br/>of our Sheriff\'s Department is much closer than our actual working<br/>organization in the military. The strict anti-fraternization rules make<br/>that \"family\" feeling something that is vilified in the active-duty<br/>military. The police are always in the front lines of the local<br/>community and always being scrutinized for every decision they make.<br/>This shared experience brings them closer together than the military,<br/>which is highly insulated by many layers of bureaucracy.\<br/>\<br/>(EDIT: seems I didn\'t finish answering the question). Regardless of my<br/>past military experience, I was re-trained in the Sheriff\'s Department.<br/>All peace officers are required to receive the same training, as is<br/>required by state law. Testing and training are a big part of what we<br/>do, ensuring our skills are honed and meet minimum standards. The basic<br/>military foundation was great to have in the department, and I think it<br/>made the training regimen that much easier for me. Military etiquette is<br/>always appreciated in the department, but is far less formalized than in<br/>the military. This also contributes to the greater \"family\" feel. I<br/>still highly respect my superior officers in the department, even though<br/>I am not required to salute like I was in the<br/>military.]<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content language: English<br/><br/><br/>
