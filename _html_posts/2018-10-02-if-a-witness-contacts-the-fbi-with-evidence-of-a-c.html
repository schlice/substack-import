<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If a witness contacts the FBI with evidence of a crime (like perjury<br>before the Congress), isn\'t the agency obligated to investigate,<br>regardless of the instructions they are given by the White House?**<br><br>No. The FBI can decide whether or not they choose to investigate any<br>alleged crime. In any case, if a crime is brought to the attention of<br>the FBI, either by a witness or a victim, the FBI will perform an<br>initial investigation to determine if a crime has been committed (i.e.<br>has the alleged incident actually met the essential elements of a<br>Federal crime), and who committed this crime. In the case of lying to<br>Congress, it must be Congress that refers the charge to the FBI, as they<br>are considered the "victim."<br><br>In the specific crime you are discussing (lying to Congress), there are<br>two separate crimes we can discuss: "knowingly and willfully giving<br>materially false statements to Congress" which does not need to be done<br>under oath, and a general "perjury (lying under oath)" charge.<br><br>The crime of lying to Congress is really difficult to prove. First, you<br>have to prove that the lie was "knowingly and willfully" given. This<br>means that the alleged liar knew the right answer, and intentionally<br>gave a false answer with intent to derail an investigation or to mislead<br>the Congress. Then, the "materiality" portion of the law kicks in. The<br>statement has to be materially important to Congress' work; it can't<br>just be an omission of fact which was "accidentally" given, or was a<br>"mistake" in fact, in any ancillary statement. It actually has to be<br>part of what Congress was primarily investigating through the testimony.<br><br>If the FBI reviews the claim and finds that it can't easily establish<br>any of the essential elements of the crime, they are not going to bother<br>to investigate.<br><br>Just because it is difficult to prove doesn't mean that it hasn't been<br>done before. John Poindexter was sentenced to prison for lying to<br>Congress when he testified about key details of the Iran-Contra affair.<br>He was later pardoned.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
