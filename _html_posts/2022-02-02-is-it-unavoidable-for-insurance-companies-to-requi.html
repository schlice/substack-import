<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>My company already does this. However, it\'s not with COVID vaccines.<br><br>If you are a non-smoker, for example, you get a discount on your monthly<br>health insurance premiums. The more healthy habits in which you partake,<br>the more discounts you can earn.<br><br>So it\'s not necessarily that the unvaccinated will pay more, it\'s that<br>the vaccinated will pay less. In this way, it is not a punishment for<br>being unvaccinated, but an incentive to be vaccinated.<br><br>The difference is a carrot versus stick difference.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
