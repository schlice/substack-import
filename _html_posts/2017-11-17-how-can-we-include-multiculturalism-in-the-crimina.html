<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>You must be more specific. You can't just make a statement like this and<br>expect that it will be taken seriously unless you identify a specific<br>lacking. It's like saying, "How can we include ice cream in the public<br>transportation system?"<br><br>You must first show that the criminal justice system is failing because<br>of a lack of multiculturalism. Is it a failing of the law, or a failing<br>of the court system and the judge/jury system?<br><br>In my opinion, *the US justice system does not need multiculturalism.*<br>It addresses the only group of people it is required to address:<br>American citizens. National heritage is not a factor in the justice<br>system, nor should it be. It treats all American citizens equal,<br>regardless of heritage.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
