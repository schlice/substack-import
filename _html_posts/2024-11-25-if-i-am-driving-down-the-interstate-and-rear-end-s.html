<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>As with all legal answers, the answer is "it depends." However, in all<br>at-fault states in the US, the car in the back is always at fault in a<br>rear-end accident.<br><br>Your auto insurance usually covers the costs if you are found at fault<br>in an accident. Auto insurance has multiple parts. **Liability<br>insurance** pays the other party\'s injuries and property damage if you<br>are found liable or "at fault." Collision insurance pays for *your*<br>vehicle *regardless* of who caused the accident.<br><br>But there is one more wrinkle in auto insurance: no-fault states. In<br>a \"no-fault\" state, your own insurance will typically cover your<br>medical bills *regardless* of who caused the accident, while in an<br>\"at-fault\" state, the at-fault driver\'s insurance is primarily<br>responsible for the other party\'s damages.<br><br>In "at-fault" states (most US states are), if you are the car in back,<br>your liability may be limited by the fact that the car in front had<br>faulty tail lights. This would limit the amount your insurance company<br>would have to pay.<br><br>But the default position is that the car in back is responsible for the<br>accident.<br><br>You can help yourself by installing a dash cam. The dash cam video can<br>show the missing tail lights (or any other mitigating factor in an<br>accident) and may help you to avoid having your rates increase due to an<br>accident which you would normally be at fault for. It can also help your<br>insurance company negotiate a lower liability payment to the other<br>company.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
