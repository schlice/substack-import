<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [First, most modern recorders are no longer separate. It\'s<br>called the Combined Voice and Data Recorder (CVDR).\<br>\<br>The reason that there won\'t be redundant recorders on the airplane is<br>that the need is not there. In most cases, the recorder is located after<br>a crash. The notable exceptions are recorders that are not jettisonable<br>and go down in the ocean. It\'s too much of an expense for such a small<br>gain in functionality.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
