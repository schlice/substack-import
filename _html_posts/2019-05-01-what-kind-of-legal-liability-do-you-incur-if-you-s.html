<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What kind of legal liability do you incur if you shoot an active<br>shooter stopping a massacre?**<br><br>There is a saying in the pro-gun world. "Every bullet you fire has a<br>lawyer attached to it." So to broadly answer your question, every bullet<br>you fire puts you at risk of facing legal action.<br><br>Interestingly, you face *less* scrutiny as a civilian than you would as<br>a police officer. Police officers who fire in the line of duty are<br>subject to more investigations than civilians.<br><br>You could potentially face both criminal charges, as well as civil<br>charges.<br><br>Criminally, you could be charged with murder or any of its lesser<br>included offenses, such as manslaughter, or criminally negligent<br>homicide. You would argue (if you were even charged with a criminal<br>offense) that you acted in self-defense (defense of others is also<br>self-defense).<br><br>Civilly, the family of the shooter can sue for wrongful death. While<br>they can prove that your actions were the proximate cause of the death,<br>your affirmative defense would be the same (that you acted in<br>self-defense to save your own life and the lives of others).<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
