<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Why can an FFL proceed with a sale if they haven\'t received an answer<br>on an NICS background check in three business days?**<br><br>Primarily because it prevents government from violating the Second<br>Amendment.<br><br>The "default allow" policy prevents the government from shutting down<br>the NICS system and imposing a *de facto ban* on gun sales simply by<br>failing to process any NICS requests. If that policy was not in place,<br>the government could bypass the 2nd Amendment and create a *de facto*<br>gun ban simply by shutting down the NICS system.<br><br>In this way, it is incumbent on the government to not only provide an<br>answer, but to provide a *timely* answer.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
