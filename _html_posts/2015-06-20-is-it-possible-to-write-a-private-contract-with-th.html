<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [It\'s likely that such terms in a rental agreement would<br>be considered excessive and unenforceable.\<br>\<br>Your terms have to be reasonable in that they have to collect what you<br>are owed. That can include any money you spend on getting your money<br>back as well. You can\'t impose exorbitant fees just to create a<br>disincentive to failing to pay. I wish it worked that way. Alas, it does<br>not.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
