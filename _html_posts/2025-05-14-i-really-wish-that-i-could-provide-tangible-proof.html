<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Why do you feel the need to provide tangible proof of God's existence?<br>Why can't you believe in God without tangible evidence?<br><br>I posit that there are plenty of things that *even atheists* believe in<br>without tangible evidence that they exist. In fact, there are plenty of<br>things that we are very rational to believe in despite the fact that<br>there is no scientific evidence to prove them:<br><br>1.  Math and logic. Science can't prove them because science<br>    *presupposes them.*<br>2.  Metaphysical truths, such as there are minds which exist outside of<br>    my own.<br>3.  Ethical judgements. There is no scientific test you can do to prove<br>    that the Nazis were evil.<br>4.  Aesthetic judgements. The beautiful, like the good, cannot be proven<br>    through science.<br>5.  and ironically...Science itself. The belief that the scientific<br>    method accurately produces truth cannot be proven using the<br>    scientific method itself. You can't prove the tools of science (the<br>    laws of logic, the Law of Causality, the Principle of Uniformity, or<br>    the reliability of observation) by running some kind of experiment.<br>    You have to assume those things are true in order to do the<br>    experiment!<br><br>So the need for "tangible proof" of God's existence is a bit ironic,<br>since there are plenty of things we are very rational to believe in even<br>without "tangible proof." We are very rational to believe that sunsets<br>are beautiful and that the Nazis were evil, despite the fact that we<br>can't provide tangible proof that "beautiful" and "evil" exist.<br><br>\<br><br>Secondly, "tangible proof" is a bit silly, wouldn't you say? If God does<br>exist, He is necessarily intangible. He's not made of stuff we can<br>detect, because He *created* the stuff so can't be *made* of the stuff<br>He *created*, because then He would have to exist before He existed. So<br>you're never going to find one of God's hairs, or see one of God's<br>footprints. Those things do not exist.<br><br>But just because we don't have "tangible" proof that God exists doesn't<br>mean that we can't prove that God exists, at least prove beyond a<br>reasonable doubt. It just means that we can't use science to produce<br>that proof.<br><br>The correct tools to use are not scientific, but philosophical. Let's<br>not forget, philosophy is not divorced from science, as if you can rely<br>on science alone, and philosophy is just pseudo-babble for PhDs to<br>discuss while smoking pipes in dimly-lit rooms. Philosophy is the<br>*foundation* of science. Science is dependent on philosophy. In fact,<br>*science is a slave to philosophy.* Bad philosophy results in bad<br>science, and good science requires good philosophy. Why? Because:<br><br>1.  Science cannot be done without philosophy. Philosophical<br>    assumptions are employed in the quest for causes and thus cannot be<br>    their consequence. For instance, scientists presuppose that reason<br>    and the scientific method enable us to comprehend the world<br>    accurately---a belief which is not provable by science. The<br>    foundational tools of science, such as the laws of logic, the Law of<br>    Causality, the Principle of Uniformity, and the reliability of<br>    observation, cannot be validated through scientific experimentation;<br>    they must be presumed to be true to conduct any experiment. Hence,<br>    science is fundamentally rooted in philosophy. Regrettably, numerous<br>    self-proclaimed scientists are really poor philosophers.<br>2.  **Philosophical assumptions can dramatically impact scientific<br>    conclusions.** If a scientist presupposes that only natural causes<br>    exist, then likely no evidence will persuade them that an<br>    intelligent source created the first single-celled amoeba or any<br>    other entity with apparent design. When proponents of Darwinism<br>    assume that intelligent causes are not feasible, they default to<br>    natural laws as the sole explanation. Conversely, if a creationist<br>    dismisses natural causes *a priori* (though I'm not aware of any who<br>    do), they too risk overlooking the correct explanation. However, a<br>    scientist open to both natural and intelligent causes is able to<br>    pursue the evidence to its logical conclusion.<br>3.  Science doesn't really say anything---scientists do. Data<br>    interpretation is always a task for scientists. However, when<br>    scientists allow their personal biases or unproven philosophical<br>    beliefs to influence their interpretation of data, they fall into<br>    the same trap they often criticize in religious<br>    individuals---allowing ideology to shape conclusions. Such instances<br>    warrant skepticism, as the resulting conclusions might merely be<br>    philosophical assumptions masquerading as scientific truths.<br><br>In philosophy, evidence is often presented in the form of *arguments*.<br>Over the years, thinkers have identified at least twenty arguments for<br>the existence of God, which vary in complexity. Some of these arguments<br>are based on the universe or history, while others are based on the<br>existence of reason and beauty. So just like we know that reason and<br>beauty exist, we can use the same tools to prove reason and beauty to<br>prove the existence of God.<br><br>So perhaps you can discuss the Cosmological Argument or the Kalam<br>Argument, which discuss the beginning of the universe, which demands<br>proof of a cause. We can discuss the Moral Law, and the fact that the<br>existence of the Moral Law implies the existence of a Moral Law Giver.<br><br>Those are just a few avenues we can use to discuss proof that God<br>exists.<br><br>\<br><br>Not knowing how to have a discussion with atheists doesn't make you a<br>bad person. It simply makes you uninformed. To be honest, Christians get<br>a mandate to spread the Gospel but never get any instruction on how to<br>do so. They never get to hear common arguments against Christianity and<br>how best to respond. This is evangelism in the form of *apologetics*.<br>Christians are rarely taught how to have a conversation with an atheist.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
