<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The question should not be what an off duty police officer does when he<br>realizes he's been speeding. The question is what happens if an off duty<br>police officer is *caught* speeding.<br><br>The answer to the first question (and the one posed by the OP) is the<br>same thing that happens if a civilian realizes he is speeding. He either<br>stops speeding, or he doesn't. Same as anyone else. Maybe you were<br>thinking that there was some kind of self-reporting requirement that<br>officers have. Some departments may require this, but I am under the<br>impression that most do not.<br><br>The answer to the second question is more unique. In our department,<br>even if you don't get a ticket, you are *required* to notify your chain<br>of command any time you encounter local law enforcement in any official<br>capacity. So even if I don't get a ticket, I still must collect a<br>business card from the complaining officer so that I can compose an<br>email to my sergeant and lieutenant and copy the complaining officer so<br>that they are all aware that at X time on Y date, I was stopped at Z<br>location by CC'd complaining officer to discuss my excessive speed. I<br>may hear about it from my chain, I may not. But they need to have the<br>record of the incident so that their files remain complete and they can<br>answer questions about how often their officers are contacted by other<br>agencies, and what the results of those interactions are. This would be<br>in addition to the ticket, if I got one.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
