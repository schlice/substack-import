<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Unlikely.<br><br>Those who argue for removing the "life of the mother" exceptions say<br>that doctors can still intervene to save the life of a woman without<br>being prosecuted. They make a distinction between the death of a fetus<br>*as a result of lifesaving treatment*, and the intentional killing of a<br>fetus by abortion. Additionally, they argue, some "life of the mother"<br>exceptions are ambiguous. Exceptions span the range from "life of the<br>mother" to "health of the mother," and there is no standard as to what<br>procedures are medically necessary, and what procedures cross the line.<br><br>In states with minimal explanation of what constitutes an exception,<br>doctors fear crossing the line and being subject to penalties, including<br>jail time and loss of their licenses.<br><br>There is nothing in the Constitution which guarantees that a medical<br>decision will not cost someone their life. There are laws against<br>medical malpractice in place already. The only guarantee in the<br>Constitution is that life cannot be taken without due process of law.<br>There is no requirement to save any particular life in the Constitution.<br>As far as the Constitution is concerned, all life has equal value. So<br>it's unlikely that such an argument could be made successfully.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Could it be successfully argued that an anti-abortion law which doesn't<br>take into account the life of a mother is unconstitutional?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
