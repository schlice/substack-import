<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [The *ex post facto* clause of the Constitution says that<br>Congress can\'t write an ex post facto law (a law which has retroactive<br>effects, or a law which criminalizes, or increases penalties on, a crime<br>which has already been committed). Interestingly, this was also applied<br>directly to the states in the Contstitution as well, one of the only<br>times that the Constitution actually put a restriction on the states<br>before the 14th Amendment was passed. We define criminal acts as those<br>that violated the law at the time in which the crime was committed.<br>Therefore, we can\'t write an ex post facto criminal law and criminalize<br>an activity that was legal at the time it was committed, or add<br>qualifiers or modifiers that would change the criminality of an act that<br>was already committed.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
