<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Can a business deny you use of their private restroom if you really<br>have an emergency?**<br><br>In general in the US, yes. Businesses are under no obligation to provide<br>restrooms which are open to the general public, regardless of the<br>emergency. Restaurants provide restrooms to customers, but they are not<br>required to provide access to their private restroom to anyone but<br>employees. OSHA requires restrooms for employees, but if the<br>establishment is not a restaurant, there isn't a requirement for<br>restrooms open to customers. Requirements for restrooms for restaurants<br>are governed by state law, and those laws can vary by state.<br><br>There is a movement as part of the Crohn's and Ulcerative Colitis<br>foundation to provide "can't wait" cards to its members. If you [[sign<br>up on their<br>site](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=349a0f&url=https://www.crohnsandcolitis.com/sign-up){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="crohnsandcolitis.com"}]{.qlink_container}, they'll send you<br>a "restroom request" card, which helps to explain to businesses that you<br>have an urgent medical condition which needs immediate attention, and<br>that the business should open its private restroom to you. But that is<br>nothing more than a *request*. There is no legal obligation which<br>requires the business to grant you access, regardless of the emergency<br>status.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
