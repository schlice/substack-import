<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>*How come* it is a sin?<br><br>First off, that's like saying, *how come* it's illegal to not drive<br>through a red light? I mean, there's no cars around, I'm not hurting<br>anyone, so how come it's illegal?<br><br>The answer is because it is. You didn't make the law, but you are<br>bound by the law.<br><br>The Bible is the same way. *It is a sin because God said it is a sin*.<br>God made humans male and female. He made males in male bodies and<br>females in female bodies. God made males to be attracted to females, to<br>bond in marriage, and produce children in those marriages. Period. God<br>did not make males to be sexually attracted to males, and females to be<br>sexually attracted to females. Doing so violates the natural order that<br>He created, so it doesn't make sense that He would create people to have<br>same-sex attractions. It was the introduction of sin into the world<br>which altered the human condition and introduced these thoughts, not<br>God. So if you want to blame someone, don't blame God, blame Adam and<br>Eve. They brought sin into the world, which introduced the possibility<br>for people to have same-sex attractions.<br><br>The Bible is replete with admonitions against homosexual behavior (all<br>quotes from NIV):<br><br>> Do not have sexual relations with a man as one does with a woman; that<br>> is detestable. --- Leviticus 18:22<br>><br>> If a man has sexual relations with a man as one does with a woman,<br>> both of them have done what is detestable. They are to be put to<br>> death; their blood will be on their own heads. --- Leviticus 20:13 ยน<br>><br>> Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their<br>> women exchanged natural sexual relations for unnatural ones. In the<br>> same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were<br>> inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed shameful acts with<br>> other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their error.<br>> --- Romans 1:26--27<br>><br>> Or do you not know that wrongdoers will not inherit the kingdom of<br>> God? Do not be deceived: Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters<br>> nor adulterers nor men who have sex with men nor thieves nor the<br>> greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the<br>> kingdom of God. --- 1 Corinthians 6:9-10<br>><br>> We also know that the law is made not for the righteous but for<br>> lawbreakers and rebels, the ungodly and sinful, the unholy and<br>> irreligious, for those who kill their fathers or mothers, for<br>> murderers, for the sexually immoral, for those practicing<br>> homosexuality, for slave traders and liars and perjurers---and for<br>> whatever else is contrary to the sound doctrine --- 1 Timothy 1:9-10<br><br>These passages are so clear that they defy reinterpretation. It's<br>intellectually dishonest to claim that Christians are misinterpreting<br>the Bible because of some prejudice against homosexuals.<br><br>But let's also be clear: while homosexual *temptation* is not a sin,<br>*continuing* the temptation into lustful thoughts or actions ***is<br>sinful***. Temptations are exactly that. Allowing your mind to continue<br>the thought is where the sin takes place.<br><br>\<br><br>I must now address the statement about "we're all human and God loves<br>all of us." This is absolutely true, but think about it. If you're a car<br>thief, does your mother still love you? Of course she does. But she also<br>doesn't want you boosting cars. She can love you *while still rejecting<br>your illegal behaviors.* So the fact that God loves us as a parent loves<br>a child in no way means that God will excuse sin. This is the source of<br>the oft-repeated, more-oft-misunderstood phrase, "love the sinner, hate<br>the sin." Christians do, in fact, love homosexuals, just as they love<br>adulterers, people who watch porn, and people who stole trading cards<br>from the neighborhood candy store as a kid (oops, got a little too<br>personal there). This in no way means that we excuse homosexuality,<br>adultery, pornography, or petit theft. We confront those sins, just as<br>we do for any sin, and we plead with the sinner to repent of their sin<br>and to get right with God. We don't *reject* them because of their sin.<br>We *love them through their sin.*<br><br>We are *all* sinners. We have *all* fallen short of the glory of God.<br>"As it is written: "There is no one righteous, not even one" (Romans<br>3:10 NIV). It doesn't matter what our sin is, we are all guilty of sin:<br>in our thoughts and in our words, in what we have done and what we have<br>failed to do. We are all sinners. We all deserve hell.<br><br>But we are *saved* through the sanctifying blood of Jesus Christ, who<br>sacrificed himself as a ransom for many. His shed blood washes us clean.<br><br>All we need to do is repent and believe. Repentance is a<br>*turning away* from sin. Think of doing a 180 and spinning on your heel<br>and going the other way. That's repentance. It's acknowledging our<br>sinfulness and a commitment to *sin no more*. Jesus said it every time<br>He forgave sin: "Go and sin no more." Belief means giving your life to<br>Jesus, acknowledging that it is only through His sacrifice that we are<br>saved, and accepting Christ as your personal Lord and Savior.<br><br>\<br><br>*ยน Remember the context: the book of Leviticus details God's commands<br>for the Jews, who had literally been slaves for generations and had no<br>idea how to live in community with each other without some form of<br>overlord controlling their lives.* ***We do not believe today that<br>homosexuals should be killed.*** *While homosexuality is a sin, we do<br>not kill people for committing sins. The rules were different back then.<br>Jesus literally fulfilled the law so the old law no longer applies.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
