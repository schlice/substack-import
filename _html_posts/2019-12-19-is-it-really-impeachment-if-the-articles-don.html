<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Is it really impeachment if the articles don\'t go to the Senate?<br><br>Indeed it is. The President has most certainly been impeached.<br><br>There's zero chance that he will be removed from office if the articles<br>never make it to the Senate.<br><br>There's only a statistical chance that he would be removed from office<br>even if they do make it to the Senate, but it's a statistically<br>insignificant chance.<br><br>If the articles *don't* go to the Senate, Trump and his team will use<br>the heck out of this incident in their campaigning, and continued delays<br>will only hurt House Democrats.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
