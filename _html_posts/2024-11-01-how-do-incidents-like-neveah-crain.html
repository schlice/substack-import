<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>They make it abundantly clear that *how states word their laws makes<br>a huge difference.* Texas is a shining example of how not to write<br>law. It's also a shining example of something that both parties are<br>guilty of: great idea, poor execution.<br><br>Texas' anti-abortion laws make it so difficult to decide that a<br>person is eligible for an abortion, and they impose **such high<br>penalties** for performing a procedure to remove a baby that *might even<br>be considered to possibly be an abortion* that they don't want to do it.<br>Hospitals will pass patients off to other hospitals because they don't<br>want to take the legal risk of being wrong.<br><br>In other words, in Texas' zeal to criminalize the medical professionals<br>who might perform an abortion has caused these situations to happen.<br>When your laws interfere with medical practice, then your laws are<br>incorrectly written.<br><br>\<br><br>Now, the next thing we must discuss is *how do we deal with this*.<br>Because there are two ways to deal with this:<br><br>- Don't ban any abortions<br>- Be smarter about banning abortions.<br><br>Sure, if we don't ban any abortions, then this type of scenario would<br>never happen. Also, if we don't have any speed limits, then no one will<br>ever get a speeding ticket. But there will be a lot more car accidents,<br>and they will be more deadly. Either we set limits, or we do not set<br>limits, and there are consequences to both decisions.<br><br>**But crucially, this type of scenario is the exception rather than the<br>rule.** This scenario is the "perfect storm," the perfect combination of<br>an incomplete miscarriage leaving fetal tissue in the womb and doctors<br>and hospitals who are more worried about lawsuits than they are about<br>treating patients.<br><br>TL;DR: This is solely a problem with how Texas wrote their law;<br>it is not a problem that Texas wrote their law.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
