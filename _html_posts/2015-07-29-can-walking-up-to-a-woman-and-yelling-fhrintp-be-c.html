<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [I think you\'re trying to ask if making such a statement<br>would be considered inflammatory and could contribute to a rape.\<br>\<br>Is it considered inflammatory? Absolutely. This sort of inflammatory<br>speech is definitely not covered under First Amendment free speech<br>protections in the United States.\<br>\<br>I think you\'d be hard pressed to find a rapist who claims, \"I heard<br>someone shout FHRITP and I thought, \'Hey, that sounds like a great<br>idea\' so I raped her.\" However, even if you did, the statement didn\'t<br>drive the rapist to do what he did. He made the decision to rape all on<br>his own, regardless of where he gets his influences from. No one<br>convinced him to rape.\<br>\<br>Here\'s an example. If I walked past a Lamborghini and I said, \"Hey,<br>great car, someone should steal that,\" and then the car gets stolen, am<br>I liable for theft? The answer is no, as I did not do anything to<br>further the theft, aid or abet the thieves, or plan the theft, so I<br>can\'t be considered an accessory to the theft.\<br>\<br>Clearly, shouting FHRITP is different than saying \"Someone should steal<br>that car\" as it is inflammatory speech, but the legal concept is<br>similar. Simply stating that someone should do something illegal is not<br>tantamount to inciting a crime. Additionally, simply stating (or<br>shouting) FHRITP isn\'t tantamount to telling anyone to rape, because if<br>you FHRITP with consent, it\'s certainly not illegal as long as both<br>parties consent. You could be promoting consentual sex, not rape.\<br>\<br>Therefore, the actual words aren\'t anything other than inflammatory<br>speech. Any conduct that follows from the speech is not caused by the<br>speech itself.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
