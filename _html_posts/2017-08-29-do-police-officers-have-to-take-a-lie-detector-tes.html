<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Each agency will use whichever technique they believe is more reliable<br>and effective at determining whether or not someone is being deceptive.<br>Most agencies do use some form of deception analysis, along with<br>traditional questioning.<br><br>Our agency locally uses a system called CVSA or "Computer Voice<br>Stress Analysis." It's not as detailed or complex as a polygraph<br>machine. It uses a sensitive microphone which records the respondent's<br>voice while answering questions, and is supposed to detect micro-tremors<br>in the respondent's voice when they are being deceptive.<br><br>These tools are investigative aids only. They contribute to the body of<br>evidence which is used to determine whether or not a person is<br>employable by the particular agency for which they are applying. Neither<br>the CVSA nor the polygraph can actually determine whether or not someone<br>is being truthful. They simply provide additional evidence which can be<br>used in making an employment determination.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
