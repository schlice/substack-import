<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>False comparison.<br><br>First, "love the sinner, hate the sin" is not a quote from the Bible,<br>but the idea is correct. I answered that separately.<br><br>[[Bill Stein\'s answer to Is \"hate the sin but still love the sinner\"<br>truly biblical? in Christians &<br>Christianity](https://christianschristianity.quora.com/Is-hate-the-sin-but-still-love-the-sinner-truly-biblical-1)]{.qlink_container}<br><br>The upshot of that is God can perfectly love and hate a person at the<br>same time. This means He can love him as someone He created and can<br>redeem, as well as hate him for his unbelief and sinful lifestyle.<br><br>We, as imperfect human beings, cannot do this; thus, we must remind<br>ourselves to "love the sinner; hate the sin." But how do we do that? We<br>demonstrate our love for sinners by treating them with respect (1 Peter<br>2:17), praying for them (1 Timothy 2:1), and sharing the gospel with<br>them. We demonstrate our hatred for sin by identifying sin for what it<br>is, abstaining from it, and decrying it as incompatible with God\'s<br>character. Sin should not be tolerated or dismissed; it should be hated.<br><br>\<br><br>As for your second question, "sin" is not a "thing." It can't be sent<br>anywhere. Sin is a state of disobedience to God's word. Sin is,<br>literally, "missing the mark."<br><br>A sinner is someone who sins. But the person going to hell is the person<br>who knows God's commands and *actively ignores them* in their sin.<br><br>\<br><br>Finally, you asked about believers marrying unbelievers. I answered that<br>separately.<br><br>[[Bill Stein\'s answer to Christian, is marrying an unbeliever NOT<br>necessarily a sin in and of itself and NOT a moral transgression that<br>would necessarily separate a believer from God? in Christian Bible<br>Studies](https://christianbiblestudies.quora.com/Christian-is-marrying-an-unbeliever-NOT-necessarily-a-sin-in-and-of-itself-and-NOT-a-moral-transgression-that-would-nec-1)]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
