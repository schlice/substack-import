<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [While I agree that it\'s horribly insensitive and<br>personally offensive to me, I wore the (real) uniform to protect the<br>rights of those who want to wear (fake) uniforms.\<br>\<br>It reminds me of Voltaire\'s quote: \"I disapprove of what you say, but<br>I will defend to the death your right to say it\".\<br>\<br>You\'ve crossed the line from free speech to fraud when you attempt to<br>gain some form of benefit by wearing the uniform. If you wear a uniform<br>to get 10% off of your latte and you were never in the military, you<br>deserve to be arrested for fraud.\<br>\<br>Starting in 2014, Colorado driver\'s licenses now include a \"Veteran\"<br>designation if you choose. You have to bring the standard military<br>discharge form (DD-214) which every service member receives upon being<br>discharged from the armed forces to DMV to have the tag applied to your<br>license. Since I am a disabled veteran and left the service before<br>serving long enough to retire, I no longer have a military ID card. The<br>veteran tag on my license helps, as I am definitely a military veteran,<br>albeit not retired.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
