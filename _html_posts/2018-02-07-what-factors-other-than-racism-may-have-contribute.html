<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What factors, other than racism, may have contributed to the violence<br>inflicted on young black men by police officers in the U.S.?**<br><br>Other than racism, here are some of the factors which may have<br>contributed to violence\* inflicted on young black men by police<br>officers in the US:<br><br>1.  They physically attacked police officers.<br>2.  They acted in an overtly aggressive way.<br>3.  They actively resisted arrest.<br>4.  They pointed weapons at police officers.<br>5.  They fit the description of a person who recently committed a<br>    violent crime in the area, and they failed to stop when told to<br>    stop.<br>6.  They did or said any number of other things which indicated to the<br>    arresting officer that the person had the intent to harm them.<br><br>\* Police takedown procedures always *look* violent. However, how many<br>times have you seen a person *violently* taken down by a police officer<br>*not* walking away under his own power? If *actual violence* were<br>occurring, wouldn't these people be going away on stretchers in<br>ambulances, or worse, in body bags? And if this so-called "violence"<br>were endemic, wouldn't the stretcher or body bag transport happen far<br>more often than it does today?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
