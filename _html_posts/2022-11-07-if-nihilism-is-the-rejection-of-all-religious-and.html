A true nihilist would believe in nothing, have<br>no loyalties, and no purpose.<br><br>Atheists have morals and values, and they are indeed purposeful. They<br>simply believe that their morals and values did not come from a god,<br>because atheists believe that gods do not exist.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
