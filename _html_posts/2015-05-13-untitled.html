<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: [That\'s the point: the Constitution neither supports nor<br>precludes states establishing same-sex marriage laws. [[Cliff<br>G.](https://www.quora.com/profile/Cliff-G-13)]{.qlink_container} said<br>that denying the right to marry based on sexual orientation is no<br>different than denying it based on race. About that point, he is wrong<br>(and, I might add, he\'s not often wrong, but on this point, he most<br>certainly is).\<br>\<br>Race is, indeed, a protected class in this country (race, color,<br>religion, sex, or national origin). These things (with the exception of<br>religion, but that is protected separately) are immutable. Sexual<br>orientation is a preference. It has yet to be conclusively proven to be<br>immutable. Indeed, most scientists believe that there are genetic<br>factors involved, but sexual preference develops over the course of the<br>human maturation process, from adolescence, through puberty, and into<br>early adulthood. It develops sooner in some than in others, but most<br>scientists agree that it not immutable; you are not \"born gay.\" You<br>may be born with a proclivity to become gay, but most scientists do<br>agree that sexual preference is a developed preference. Until it is<br>proven that sexual orientation is an immutable characteristic of a human<br>being, I don\'t suspect that it will be added to the list of protected<br>classes.\<br>\<br>The arguments about what equal rights for citizens are when it comes to<br>marriage turns on what marriage laws are, and why we have them. We do<br>not have them to recognize an emotional union between consenting adults,<br>with only an incidental relationship to child rearing. They certainly do<br>that, but the State has no compelling interest in recognizing emotional<br>unions, or we\'d be recognizing all sorts of emotional unions that<br>people believe are important. We do have them to deal with children that<br>may arise following sex between men and women. Since sex between<br>same-sex couples does not similarly produce children, marriage laws do<br>not discriminate against them because marriage laws do not apply to<br>them.\<br>\<br>Said in another way, because the real reason we have marriage laws in<br>this country is to deal with the children that sex between men and women<br>may produce, sexual complementarity is a legitimate condition of<br>marriage. Laws against interracial marriage were unconstitutional<br>because race was not a valid precondition to marriage, as sex between<br>colors still produces children. Interracial marriage prohibitions<br>existed not because marriage didn\'t make sense for them, but they<br>existed to discourage them from happening, in the interest of white<br>supremacy. Therefore, they were rightly found to be unconstitutional.\<br>\<br>So in order to accommodate same-sex couples in an institution which<br>makes no sense for them to join, we have to redefine marriage.\<br>\<br>That\'s the question before the courts: is it Constitutionally<br>appropriate to redefine marriage? Is it necessary? Is it right?\<br>\<br>Since nearly all of the \"benefits\" of marriage can be extended to<br>unmarried couples \-- including same-sex couples \-- without redefining<br>marriage law, I fail to see, from a purely legal view, how redefining<br>the institution of marriage to include people for whom it makes no sense<br>serves the greatest good.\<br>\<br>Once you redefine marriage to include same-sex couples, you then create<br>a new, less-justifiable distinction in the law. You exclude groups of<br>people who qualify for marriage in every way except for their lack of a<br>sexual relationship. Prime example: two same-sex friends who share a<br>house and a mortgage and bills. They may even raise a child together<br>after one of their wives dies. They are closer to each other than<br>brothers; they love each other like brothers. Why shouldn\'t the state<br>recognize their relationship as well? Because they aren\'t gay? There\'s<br>no \"inclusion\" there. How can gays possibly explain that<br>discrimination simply because that couple doesn\'t have sex?\<br>\<br>Because it doesn\'t make sense for them, and because it will create<br>more, less-justifiable distinctions in the law, I don\'t see the court<br>ruling that all states must redefine marriage to include same-sex<br>couples.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/What-is-your-prediction-for-the-U-S-Supreme-Court-ruling-on-the-legality-of-gay-marriage-bans/answer/Cliff-G-13<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
