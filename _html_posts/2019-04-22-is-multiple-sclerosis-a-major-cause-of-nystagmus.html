<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>[[Michele Camera\'s<br>answer](https://www.quora.com/Is-multiple-sclerosis-a-major-cause-of-nystagmus/answer/Michele-Camera)]{.qlink_container}<br>is spot on. Nystagmus can be caused by a problem present at birth, or<br>developed in early childhood.<br><br>However, *acquired nystagmus* occurs later in life, and is caused as a<br>symptom of another condition, such as stroke, MS, or physical trauma.<br><br>MS is one of the causes of acquired nystagmus, but as Michele stated, I<br>think that "major" is likely an unsubstantiated adjective.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
