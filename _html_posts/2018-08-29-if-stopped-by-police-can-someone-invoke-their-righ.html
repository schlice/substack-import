<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If stopped by police, can someone invoke their right to remain silent<br>if asked to perform a sobriety test? After being taken to the station,<br>if you demand a lawyer when they insist on the breathalyzer, will that<br>be used against you?**<br><br>Two questions in one.<br><br>First question (paraphrased): can you refuse to perform a sobriety test?<br>The answer is yes you can.<br><br>However, what does that mean? The answer varies by state, but in most<br>states, the decision to not perform a FST (field sobriety test) will<br>have consequences. The officer will use the information he already has<br>to make a determination on whether or not you are impaired.<br><br>You can also refuse the portable breathalyzer. The outcome will be the<br>same: the officer will use his or her best judgement to determine<br>whether or not you are too impaired to drive.<br><br>However, while you can refuse the stationary breathalyzer at the police<br>station, the consequences are much different. You have essentially<br>already consented to the breathalyzer at the police station when you<br>signed for your license in what's called "implied consent." Therefore,<br>refusing the breath test means you are willingly giving up your driving<br>privilege, since you already agreed to the breath test as a condition of<br>getting your license. Refusing the breath test means your license can be<br>suspended. Most states will automatically suspend your license for 12<br>months for refusing to take a breath test (if you're a frequent flyer,<br>you may be suspended for longer).<br><br>Second question (also paraphrased): can you demand a lawyer when you are<br>required to give a blood/urine/breath sample at the police station?<br>Well, you can demand a lawyer, but you may not get one. Some states do<br>not allow you to request a lawyer at the time of your breath test, but<br>that may be changing. In 2014, the New York Court of Appeals ruled in<br>*People v. Gursey* that the refusal to allow access to a lawyer during<br>the breath test was a violation of the defendant's access to counsel.<br>The phone call to a lawyer could have taken place in minutes, and<br>shouldn't have been a tremendous burden on the state. People abuse that<br>privilege by asking for an attorney so that they have more time to<br>"sober up" before the breath test. In states that allow it, you are<br>generally allowed a phone consult with an attorney; you are not allowed<br>to wait for an attorney to arrive. Will it be used against you? Probably<br>not; you will either be allowed or not allowed to request to speak to an<br>attorney before your breath test, and if you are allowed, it will be a<br>quick phone consult. In most states, you may not have an attorney<br>present for the breath test.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
