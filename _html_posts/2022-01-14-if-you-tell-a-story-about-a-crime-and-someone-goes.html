<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>As with most legal questions, the answer is "it depends."<br><br>If, by "you telling a story," you're hanging out in a bar telling a<br>story about a crime to a buddy, and a cop overhears you and decides to<br>investigate on their own, you have zero responsibility for what that cop<br>does or does not do.<br><br>If, by "you telling a story," you're sitting in an interview room in the<br>police station, giving a sworn deposition, and then the authorities go<br>after the perpetrator, then yes, your testimony is responsible for that<br>investigation.<br><br>And "responsible" how? Other than being the catalyst for an<br>investigation, you have no other "responsibility" here. You're not<br>"responsible" for the perpetrator committing the crime. You may be the<br>"responsible" party who informs law enforcement, but you bear no other<br>responsibility.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>If you tell a story about a crime and someone goes after the<br>perpetrator, are you responsible?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
