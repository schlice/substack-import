<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>HOA Board members are only bound by state law and the Governing<br>Documents. If it's in there, then they must do it. They are only<br>required to respond when state law or the Governing Documents tell them<br>they are required to respond.<br><br>If you are demanding they respond to your phone calls or emails or text<br>messages or smoke signals, they are usually not legally required to do<br>so.<br><br>For example, if they contact you and tell you that you are in violation<br>of a rule, you can respond to that message and explain why you are not,<br>or you can pay your fine and fix the condition which is violative. If<br>you explain why you think they are wrong, they may not listen to you,<br>and if it is something over which they have exclusive control, they are<br>not obligated to change their findings based on your comments.<br><br>Bottom line, check your CC&Rs to see when they are required to respond<br>to you and when they are not. And if you think they should be more<br>responsive, don't vote for them next election. Vote someone in who<br>promises to be more responsive.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
