<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>No one will rule on Florida's abortion law.<br><br>That's because *Dobbs v. Jackson Women\'s Health Organization* is<br>pending decision at the Supreme Court right now. *Dobbs* is a case<br>dealing with the constitutionality of a 2018 Mississippi state law that<br>banned abortion after the first 15 weeks of pregnancy (much like<br>Florida's).<br><br>Tangentially, Georgia passed a law which banned abortions after six<br>weeks. That law was ruled unconstitutional under *Roe*, was appealed,<br>and is awaiting ruling by the 11th Circuit, **which has stayed its<br>ruling until *Dobbs* is decided.**<br><br>Since Florida is in the 11th Circuit, even if its law is challenged, any<br>ruling will be stayed until after *Dobbs* is decided.<br><br>*Dobbs* is the most important abortion case to be brought before the<br>Supreme Court since *Planned Parenthood v. Casey.*<br><br>\<br><br>*Feel free to comment, but if you think you're going to come into my<br>comments on my answers, pop off, and then block me, don't expect me to<br>keep your conversation around very long.*<br><br>*If you don\'t like what I wrote, tough shit. If my answer is<br>grammatically low-quality or is un-cited opinion masquerading as fact,<br>downvote it. If you think I\'m wrong, write your own answer. But Quora<br>is a question-and-answer site, not a debate site. If you are simply<br>commenting to tell me \"ackshually, you\'re wrong,\" don\'t be surprised<br>if I quietly delete your comment. Put anything vaguely harassing in<br>there, and your deletion will be followed by a block/mute, and a BNBR<br>report. I will do this immediately and with no compunction.*<br><br>*You have been warned. Be nice.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
