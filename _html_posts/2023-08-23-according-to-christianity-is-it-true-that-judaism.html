<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Yes.<br><br>But this isn't unique to Christianity. Every religion which makes truth<br>claims (all of them) believe that their claims are true.<br><br>And if absolute truth exists, then the opposite of truth is false.<br><br>Therefore, if my religion is true, then every other religion which is<br>not my religion is false.<br><br>There's nothing surprising or earth-shattering about this. This is just<br>common sense.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
