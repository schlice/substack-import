<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The problem with "scientific" proofs is what you mean by "scientific<br>evidence."<br><br>In the realm of science, evidence normally refers to data you can<br>see, hear, taste, touch, or smell---things that directly confirm or<br>undermine a hypothesis. And in the context of science, such evidence has<br>led to remarkable results. Just look at today's advancements in<br>technology and medicine.<br><br>However, scientific evidence isn't the *only* type of evidence. Many<br>truths that exist cannot be proven through physical evidence. For<br>instance, we don't have physical evidence that a sunset is beautiful or<br>that the Nazis were evil. Of course, we understand these statements to<br>be true, but not because we have found physical evidence to support<br>them.<br><br>The same holds true for the existence of God. Whether you believe God<br>exists or not, He is, by definition, immaterial and transcendent. He is<br>immaterial because He is not composed of physical matter, not made of<br>material stuff like you and me. And God is transcendent because He<br>exists beyond space and time. Thus, when we're searching for God, we do<br>not expect to find direct, physical, scientific evidence for His<br>existence within space and time. This fact is important: it is not just<br>that we have not yet found such evidence, though it may exist, it is<br>that such evidence is *impossible*, even in principle. We are not going<br>to find one of God's hairs, or discover His footprint, or run a<br>scientific experiment to see if He exists.<br><br>Does that mean it is impossible to demonstrate that God exists? No. It<br>simply means that science is not the right means, just as a metal<br>detector is not the right tool to find a wooden cup.<br><br>As you hinted, the right proofs are "logical" proofs, which are<br>contained in the discipline called *philosophy.* Philosophy is concerned<br>with life's most important issues, from morality to meaning to God.<br>Philosophy allows us to probe realities that can't be detected through<br>our senses; thus, philosophy provides an excellent method to explore<br>evidence for the existence of God.<br><br>Philosophy typically offers evidence in the form of *arguments*. In<br>fact, thinkers over the years have identified no fewer than twenty<br>arguments for God, arguments that range from the clear and simple to the<br>extremely complex. Some of these arguments appeal to the universe or<br>history, others to the existence of reason and beauty.<br><br>We can approach the God question from many angles, and there is no one<br>best way. But I think there is one argument that is not only clear and<br>convincing, but easy enough to understand.<br><br>First, if terms like arguments or evidence bother you, you might instead<br>consider these arguments as "clues" that converge and point to a common<br>conclusion, much the way road signs guide you to a specific destination.<br>A sign doesn't prove that the destination exists, but it does point the<br>way. These arguments are signposts to God. So, let us look at one<br>signpost that in my opinion, presents perhaps the simplest yet most<br>powerful argument for God's existence.<br><br>The Kalam argument dates back to the Middle Ages but has been made<br>popular today by William Lane Craig, an evangelical Christian<br>philosopher. The argument is very simple; in fact, it is probably the<br>easiest of all the arguments to understand, having two premises and one<br>conclusion:<br><br>- P1: Everything which has a beginning has a cause.<br>- P2: The universe had a beginning.<br>- C1: The universe has a cause.<br><br>So let's dig in to these two premises and one conclusion:<br><br>Premise 1: This statement says everything that has a beginning has a<br>cause. It's very important that we get this right. Some atheists try to<br>refute this premise by responding, "But if everything that exists has a<br>cause, and God exists, then what caused God?" But the premise does not<br>claim, "Everything that *exists* has a cause." It says, "Everything that<br>*begins to exist* has a cause." Since God, by definition, and whether<br>you believe in Him or not, is eternal and never began to exist, this<br>first premise does not apply to Him. Therefore, the rhetorical question<br>"What caused God?" is like asking, "To whom is the bachelor married?" or<br>"What caused the uncaused being?" Regardless of whether bachelors or<br>uncaused beings exist, these questions do not make sense. They are<br>literally nonsense because they confuse the meaning of terms.<br><br>Now that we have cleared away that misunderstanding, let us turn back to<br>the first premise. Is it true? Does everything that begins to exist have<br>a cause? For most people, the answer is yes; it is common sense. Almost<br>nobody denies it. The statement simply means that nothing just springs<br>into existence, randomly and without a cause. For if things did come<br>into being this way, then our world would be a wild spree of things<br>apparently popping into existence like sleight of hand magic. Only it<br>would be worse, since with sleight of hand you at least have a magician<br>who pulls rabbits out of a hat. However, in a world that violates this<br>first premise, rabbits would pop in and out of being even without<br>magicians or hats. Few sane people believe the world works this way.<br>Even the great atheist David Hume said, "I never asserted so absurd a<br>proposition as that something should arise without a cause." So, through<br>experience and reflection most people, even most honest atheists, agree<br>that everything that begins to exist has a cause.<br><br>Premise 2: This claim is slightly more controversial than the first<br>one. In fact, no less a thinker than St. Thomas Aquinas says that the<br>truth that the world had a beginning of its duration is only<br>conclusively known by faith and not by reason. Nonetheless, a host of<br>the greatest minds from antiquity to the present, including St.<br>Bonaventure in the Middle Ages and William Lane Craig today, offer<br>arguments that purport to defend this truth. An example of one of these<br>arguments, one which St. Bonaventure includes in his paradoxes of the<br>infinite, goes as follows: If the world has always existed, then there<br>would be an infinite number of past days. However, if there were an<br>infinite number of past days, we never would have been able to arrive at<br>the present day because an infinite series, by definition, cannot be<br>traversed. Since we have arrived at today (and today is the end date of<br>history), it follows that there must have been a beginning of time (a<br>beginning date).<br><br>Modern physics also seems to give weight to this position. Despite<br>cyclic cosmological models advanced by some physicists in recent years,<br>since the advent of the big bang theory in the twentieth century, the<br>scientific consensus is that the universe did have a beginning roughly<br>fourteen billion years ago. Alexander Vilenkin, a leading non-Christian<br>cosmologist, was invited to speak at a colloquium for Stephen Hawking's<br>seventieth birthday. There, in front of the greatest scientists in the<br>world, Vilenkin said, "All the evidence we have says that the universe<br>had a beginning." It is rare for scientists to speak with this measure<br>of conclusiveness, but Vilenkin stated his opinion that it is not just<br>that *some* of the evidence points to a beginning of the universe, or<br>even the *majority* of evidence, but that *all* of the evidence points<br>that way today.<br><br>Conclusion: The two premises are widely accepted today: everything<br>that begins to exist has a cause, and the universe began to exist. If<br>that is the case, then the third statement, the conclusion of the<br>argument, logically follows. We cannot avoid the fact that if everything<br>that begins to exist has a cause, and the universe began to exist, then<br>the universe must have had a cause.<br><br>This logical conclusion leads us to wonder: if the universe had a cause,<br>*what* is that cause? The cause certainly could not have been anything<br>*within* the universe or even *the universe itself*, since things can't<br>cause themselves to come into existence. This idea defies logic. It<br>would be like saying your arm caused you to come into existence, or that<br>you yourself are the cause of your own existence. Neither statement<br>could be true, for since before you existed, there was no arm and there<br>was no you!<br><br>Thus, the cause of the universe must be something *beyond* the universe,<br>something beyond all matter, energy, space, and time. In other words, it<br>must be transcendent (beyond the universe), it must be immaterial<br>(beyond matter and space), it must be eternal (beyond time), and if it<br>has created something so massively complex as the universe, it must be<br>tremendously powerful and intelligent. Well, a transcendent, immaterial,<br>eternal, supremely powerful, and intelligent cause of the<br>universe---what does that sound like to you? As Thomas Aquinas pithily<br>puts it, "This is what most people mean by 'God.'"<br><br>\<br><br>Now of course, this doesn't tell us anything about *which* God exists,<br>or anything about that God. It simply is a logical proof which shows<br>that logically-speaking, a creator God must exist.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
