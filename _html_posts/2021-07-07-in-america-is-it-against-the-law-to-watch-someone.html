<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>*(US answer only)*<br><br>There is no "duty to intervene" law in the United States when it comes<br>to suicide. The only laws that might apply are for certain categories of<br>people who are "mandatory reporters" who learn of someone's desire to<br>commit a crime, or to harm themselves, and are required by law to report<br>that. Some mandatory reporters might be doctors, teachers, mental health<br>professionals, etc.<br><br>And again, this only applies if you "watch" and do nothing. If you did<br>*anything at all* to "encourage" or "assist" the person in their<br>suicide, then you can be held criminally and civilly liable for the<br>death.<br><br>But to answer your specific question, it is not against the law to watch<br>someone commit suicide and not intervene to stop them.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>In America is it against the law to watch someone commit suicide and not<br>stop it?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
