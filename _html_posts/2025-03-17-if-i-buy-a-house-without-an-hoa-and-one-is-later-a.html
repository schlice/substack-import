<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The answer, as with all legal answers, is "it depends." And what it<br>depends on is state law.<br><br>Most states do permit mandatory HOAs to be formed in neighborhoods<br>where there was none before. However, the amount of consent that<br>existing homeowners must provide varies.<br><br>- In most states, unanimous consent is required to form a new,<br>  mandatory HOA (for example, here in NC, to form a mandatory HOA where<br>  there was none requires unanimous consent of the affected homeowners).<br>- In some states, however, only a supermajority of homeowners is<br>  required (for example, TX law allows POAs to be formed with a<br>  supermajority of homeowners). However, there are usually exceptions<br>  which permit you (the current homeowner) to opt-out. For example,<br>  in TX, there is a one year right to opt-out of the newly formed HOA<br>  (of course, if you sell your house, the new owner would be<br>  automatically subject to the HOA).<br><br>If you happen to be in a state which can form a mandatory HOA in your<br>area without your permission, and you are being forced to participate<br>against your will, we recommend not ignoring it, but fighting it. We<br>strongly recommend retaining a real estate attorney in your area who<br>specializes in HOA law. If you do ignore it without fighting it, the HOA<br>can make legal trouble for you, and then it will become much harder to<br>resist the changes.<br><br>\<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*This answer is not a substitute for professional legal advice or a<br>solicitation to offer legal advice regarding specific facts.
