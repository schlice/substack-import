<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I know a lot of people believe that Satan lives in hell, and that he is<br>actually ruler of hell, lording over the tormented souls burning forever<br>in the lake of fire.<br><br>But while that may be the picture painted by Dante's *Inferno*, it is<br>not the reality relayed by the Bible.<br><br>In fact, when Satan was cast out of heaven, he was cast down to the<br>earth, not into hell. Jesus talked about Satan being the "ruler of this<br>world" (John 14:30). He spends part of his time actively roaming the<br>earth, seeking to tempt and destroy people.<br><br>Satan was cast out of heaven long before the incident in the Garden. But<br>interestingly, he still retains access to heaven. In fact, there are<br>several passages in the Bible which talk about Satan's activity<br>post-casting-out in heaven. Job 1 and 2 show Satan agitating against<br>God. And in Revelation, just before he is to be cast down to hell, he<br>will be found in heaven, where he "accuses them \the brethren\ before<br>God day and night." Imagine that Satan is there presenting your sin to<br>God, and probably embellishing the story just a little bit to try to<br>make it seem worse than it is, in just the same way that he twisted<br>God's words in the Garden.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
