You aren't under any obligation to go anywhere with anyone<br>unless you're being arrested.<br><br>However, unlike your question, he doesn't \*need\* an arrest warrant. He<br>just needs to have a reasonable belief that you committed a crime, and<br>he needs to be able to articulate the reason for his belief.<br><br>In other words, you can either willingly accompany the police to the<br>station, or the police can arrest you. Other than arrest, you go<br>willingly, even if they "convince" you that going with them is in your<br>best interest.<br><br>And if you are arrested, I strongly suggest not saying anything at all<br>until you've had the chance to consult with a lawyer.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
