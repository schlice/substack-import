<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>So when comparing the three states, Florida and Texas generally compare<br>pretty favorably economically, because neither of them have a state<br>income tax (which includes retirement money), and the states generally<br>compare very well when it comes to cost of living.<br><br>Florida has a few legs up in that it has a very large portion of the<br>state who is of retirement age (heck, Florida has an entire *city* which<br>is comprised of literally nothing but retirees, and it is very large),<br>it has more favorable weather for more of the year, and being ranked<br>number 5 out of 50 states for people on Medicare, it's really a<br>tailor-made location for retirees.<br><br>Arizona is a close second, but the income tax thing tends to hurt them,<br>as well as the smaller population of retirees, but some people like the<br>dry heat better than the moist heat. My wife and her Sj√∂gren's Disease<br>needs moisture, so we live in Florida.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Why don\'t more people retire to Texas rather than Arizona and Florida?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
