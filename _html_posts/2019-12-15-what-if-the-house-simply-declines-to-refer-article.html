<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What if the House declines to refer the Impeachment to the Senate<br>because most of the Republican \"jurors\" have already publicly declared<br>that the verdict, namely acquittal, has already been divided?**<br><br>So let me get this straight.<br><br>There is no consensus in the Congress that impeachable offenses have<br>even taken place, let alone what they are, so the House is questioning<br>whether or not they should pass Articles of Impeachment in the first<br>place, because there is zero chance of conviction in the Senate.<br><br>Is that your basic question?<br><br>If it is, then the Impeachment process, *finally,* **would be<br>working correctly.**<br><br>Impeachment requires *broad, bipartisan agreement* that impeachable<br>offenses have actually occurred. Then you can get down to the business<br>of deciding what they are, and all the little details, when you draw up<br>Articles of Impeachment.<br><br>This House put the cart before the horse. They drafted Articles without<br>even getting consensus that impeachable offenses have even taken place.<br>Now you have partisan Articles, and zero chance of conviction.<br><br>Logic would tell you to not bother with filling the Articles in the<br>first place. The supermajority in the Senate was designed to be that<br>necessary high bar for impeachment, grounding the "hot passions of the<br>day" in the House.<br><br>**TL;DR: The House should recognize that if they have no chance of<br>conviction, maybe there isn\'t as strong of a case for filing Articles<br>in the first place.**<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
