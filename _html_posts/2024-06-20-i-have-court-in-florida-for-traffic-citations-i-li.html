<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>First of all, the answer, as with all legal answers, is "it depends,"<br>and one of the things it depends on is whether or not the "traffic<br>citations" we're talking about *crimes.* If you are actually going to<br>court for something like a *misdemeanor or felony traffic violation*<br>\[i.e. reckless driving (with property damage), hit and run (with<br>property damage), expired or no valid driver\'s license or registration,<br>or DUI\], then you will be required to appear, which means you'll have<br>to make your way back to Florida.<br><br>But if it's literally just a traffic citation, you definitely have a few<br>options instead of physically going to court:<br><br>1.  Pay the ticket. You can essentially admit guilt and pay the ticket<br>    and you won't need to go to court. Keep in mind that this can have<br>    consequences on your insurance, and if you have a number of tickets<br>    within a short amount of time, you could risk having your license<br>    suspended.<br>2.  You can hire an attorney to go to court on your behalf.<br><br>Hiring an attorney might, at first, seem like a bad deal, because the<br>cost of hiring an attorney may be just as much (maybe even more) than<br>the cost of just paying the ticket. But there are some distinct<br>advantages, besides just having the attorney appear on your behalf:<br><br>- In most states, and in most cases, if the ticket is related to an<br>  accident you caused (where there is no bodily damage, like, let's say,<br>  you rear-ended a car), when your attorney shows that your insurance<br>  company fully accepted responsibility to pay for the other driver's<br>  car, they can get the ticket dismissed.<br>- In some cases, the attorney can negotiate on your behalf. While there<br>  isn't much room for negotiations in traffic court, there is *some*.<br>  For example, your attorney could help you avoid points on your license<br>  by negotiating a moving violation down to a non-moving violation.<br>- If you have an advanced driver's license (like a CDL), certain moving<br>  violations can cause you to lose your CDL. In that case, hiring an<br>  attorney (even if it is just as expensive, if not more, than just<br>  paying the ticket) could be extremely beneficial.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
