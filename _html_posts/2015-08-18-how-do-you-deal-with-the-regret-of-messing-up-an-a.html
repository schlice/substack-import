<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>> *Yesterday is history.*\<br>> *Tomorrow is a mystery.*\<br>> *Today is a gift. That\'s why we call it the present.*<br><br>\<br>Live for today. Don\'t live in your past with regret. There is nothing<br>you can do about your past. What\'s done is done. Take stock of what you<br>have today.\<br>\<br>I would trade your condition for mine in a hot second. TRUST ME when I<br>tell you that there are others who are far worse off than you are<br>(regardless of the cause of their conditions), and they still make the<br>best of their lives. I might just be one of them.\<br>\<br>My decision to serve my country left me with multiple sclerosis. Wanna<br>trade? Yeah, didn\'t think so.\<br>\<br>However, there are people who rely on me, people who look to me for<br>their guidance, people who I brought into this world and now I have the<br>responsibility to care for and to lead and to teach. Because my legs<br>don\'t want to work some days doesn\'t mean that I\'m less of a person<br>because of it. If you lose an arm, or a leg, are you less of a person?<br>Are your body parts what makes you a person, or is it something else?\<br>\<br>You are still you, even with your condition. Be the best you that you<br>can be.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
