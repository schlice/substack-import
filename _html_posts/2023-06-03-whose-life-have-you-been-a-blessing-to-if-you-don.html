<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Why do you have to know whose life you have blessed? Can't you bless a<br>life without even knowing it? Do you have to know whose life you blessed<br>in order to have done so? Does it change the blessing at all? Can't you<br>still be a good person to everyone you meet, even if you never find out<br>that you blessed their lives in some way?<br><br>General George S. Patton, Jr. said, "There is no limit to the good you<br>can do if you don't care who gets the credit."<br><br>Think about *that.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
