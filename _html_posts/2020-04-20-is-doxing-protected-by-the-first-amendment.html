<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Is doxing protected by the First Amendment?<br><br>Doxing, or "doxxing," is the practice of researching and then<br>broadcasting private information about an individual, usually on the<br>Internet, and usually done with malicious intent.<br><br>Doxing is illegal, and is not protected by the First Amendment. In just<br>the same way that you can't shout "Fire!" in a crowded theater because<br>it induces panic and can cause people to be hurt, doxing someone (even<br>if the information was previously publicly available) with malicious<br>intent is still harassment, and you can be sued if you do cause someone<br>harm.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
