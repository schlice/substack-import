<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>To be clear, MS does not attack motor neurons. MS attacks the myelin<br>sheath which surrounds nerve fibers in the central nervous system in<br>your brain and your spinal cord. When the myelin is damaged, signals<br>which normally traverse these nerves are degraded. Think of it as the<br>insulation around an electrical wire. When the insulation is damaged,<br>signals do not flow down the wire nearly as efficiently as they used to.<br>Many different types of nerve cells are affected, including the ones<br>that help you see, and the ones that help you pee and poo, along with<br>the ones that help you walk and think.<br><br>You may be thinking of ALS, or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. ALS, also<br>known as "Lou Gehrig's Disease," actually does attack motor neurons,<br>destroying the actual nerve fiber in your brain and spinal cord. These<br>are actual motor neurons that get destroyed, neurons that control<br>voluntary motion in your arms and legs. As the neurons are destroyed,<br>myelin sheaths harden.<br><br>Symptoms (at least initially) can be similar, but ALS progresses much<br>more quickly. On average, people with ALS live about five years after<br>their diagnosis, where MS is not fatal.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
