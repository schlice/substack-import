<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>It's not easy, but the process is similar for a recruited athlete as<br>well as a non-recruited athlete. Even recruited athletes have to go<br>through this process (although the Academy's acceptance rate may be<br>somewhat different for recruited athletes than it is for others).<br>Approximately 40% of cadets are recruited athletes for one of the<br>Academy\'s 27 NCAA Division I teams. On average, 34% of student-athletes<br>receive athletic preference during acceptance.<br><br>As far as USAFA's general acceptance rate (11%), it's roughly on par<br>with a school like Georgetown (12%). So you need to be very academically<br>qualified to go. The average high school GPA of students who are<br>accepted is 3.78, and as of the last class who entered, they averaged in<br>the top three percent of their high school classes. Strong performance<br>in your high school core classes (i.e. strong understanding of algebra)<br>is more important than exposure to college-level curriculum (i.e.<br>calculus).<br><br>But what makes it *really* challenging is that in addition to USAFA<br>acceptance, you need a *nomination*. Even recruited athletes need<br>nominations. In order to attend a Service Academy, you have to be<br>nominated by a member of the House of Representatives, a Senator, the<br>Vice President, or (in special cases) the President. The method with the<br>least amount of competition is your Representative for your<br>Congressional District. When I was nominated, there were roughly 100<br>students from my district who also applied. You had to go in front of a<br>Nomination Board assembled by the Representative, and you had to put a<br>package together for that Board, which was fairly similar to the<br>application to USAFA: academic transcripts, letters of recommendation,<br>essays discussing extracurriculars, etc.<br><br>The Academy (and the Nominating Board) uses the "whole person" standard.<br>Being talented in just one area is not enough. You need to show some<br>talent in all areas: academic, athletic, community service, etc. Your<br>letters of recommendation should span all of those areas. So just having<br>a high GPA but never participating in sports or doing any work in the<br>community is not going to cut it.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
