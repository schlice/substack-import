<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If you are going to have a person with a felony living with you after<br>they are released from prison, what things can you do to support their<br>transition into a law-abiding life?**<br><br>If they are prohibited from accessing certain items (i.e. firearms,<br>alcohol, some prescription drugs, etc), remove those from the home while<br>the felon lives with you. Not that any one particular felon will use<br>those things, but if you want to support their transition, give them the<br>best opportunity to succeed by getting those things out of the home.<br><br>Encourage the felon to be on time, hold down a job, keep a neat room,<br>keep a neat appearance. These things may be small, but they may have<br>been de-emphasized while in prison. Normal everyday life requires these<br>things. They were emphasized when we were children; we have to<br>re-emphasize them now while the felon transitions back to normal life.<br><br>The felon must keep their appointments with their parole officer (PO) if<br>they have one (most do). And even if the felon was told that the<br>appointments are stupid, a waste of time, you don't have to do them,<br>etc, encourage them to do it anyway.<br><br>Most importantly, while the felon is a felon, that person is not defined<br>by his/her felony. They are still a person, who happens to be a felon.<br>But they're a person first. Always remember that first and foremost.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
