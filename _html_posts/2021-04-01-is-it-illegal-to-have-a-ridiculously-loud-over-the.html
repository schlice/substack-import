<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Is it illegal to have a ridiculously loud over the top car horn?<br><br>Depends on your definition of "ridiculously loud."<br><br>If you're talking the same air horns they put on trucks, that's not<br>ridiculously loud. Trucks use them, why can't you?<br><br>But I'd strongly recommend you consider the following: ***don't replace<br>your standard car horn with a truck horn.***<br><br>Install it as a secondary horn. Or if you're Mark Rober, build a<br>custom electronic horn, and then add the truck horn as a last resort.<br><br>[https://youtu.be/lv8wqnk_TsA(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=6c03df&url=https://youtu.be/lv8wqnk_TsA){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>After you check your local ordinances, this build is a really easy way<br>to do this. It's not an overly complicated build, and you can assemble<br>the whole kit relatively inexpensively.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
