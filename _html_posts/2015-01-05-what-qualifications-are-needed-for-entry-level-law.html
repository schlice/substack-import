<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [In addition to [[Rick<br>Bruno](https://www.quora.com/profile/Rick-Bruno-1)]{.qlink_container}\'s<br>answer, our department requires an excellent driving record, a full<br>medical exam, and in place of the polygraph, we use a [[Computer Voice<br>Stress<br>Analysis](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=5a56b9&url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_stress_analysis){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container} (CVSA) as part of the<br>background check. But it\'s essentially the same for most departments:\<br>]<br><br>- Colorado has a state-authored peace officer entrance exam, which all<br>  peace officer candidates must pass. It includes math and verbal<br>  skills, along with some logic and reasoning. It requires no prior<br>  police training to pass.<br>- Candidates then move on to Oral Boards. These boards are conducted by<br>  the individual departments. The board members are looking for<br>  leadership ability, ability to speak in stressful situations, and<br>  problem-solving skills (part of Oral Boards is individual, and part is<br>  group. In the group evaluation, they are looking for someone to take<br>  charge of the group, direct the discussion, and deliver the verdict<br>  intelligently).<br>- If the candidate passes both written and oral exams, the application<br>  process starts, which includes all the items Rick already mentioned,<br>  along with the medical, physical, psych, and CVSA testing.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
