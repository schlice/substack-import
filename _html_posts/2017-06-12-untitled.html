<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I can personally attest to the .30--06 example.<br><br>Fire one in an indoor range, for example, and EVERYONE knows it. While<br>the other guns on the range go "pop, pop, POP POP, pop pop" the .30--06<br>goes "BOOOOOOOOOM." It's a very intimidating (and loud) sound in a room<br>full of loud sounds.<br><br>Even outdoors, it's louder than anything else you routinely shoot, from<br>.45 to 12-gauge to 5.56 NATO. That .30--06 announces its presence. You'd<br>better hope you hit that deer/elk/whatever you're shooting at with the<br>first round, because the whole area knows you fired a shot.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/Why-would-a-citizen-need-a-gun-silencer-and-why-is-that-a-priority-for-Congress-Does-Congress-not-have-anything-else-to-work-on-than-passing-a-law-making-it-easier-for-someone-to-buy-a-gun-silencer/answer/David-H-call-me-WarpedFactor<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
