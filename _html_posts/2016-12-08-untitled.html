<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>We don't have a national ID because it's not useful for anything. You're<br>a *citizen* of the United States, but you are a *resident* of a state.<br>States generally use driver's licenses as ID cards. You can also get a<br>state ID card if you don't drive. Even in a national election, you vote<br>as part of your state. Especially for president, where the states decide<br>the outcome, not the people.<br><br>So why don't they just use your driver's license as voter ID? Some<br>states do, but not all. I mean, it seems simple enough. Why can't you<br>just get a driver's license or a state ID? What about this scenario:<br>what if you're elderly and you haven't seen your birth certificate for<br>the last 40 years? You don't have a car, you live on a fixed income,<br>etc. So you can't get your state ID card to vote because you don't have<br>enough documentation to do it and it's cumbersome to get around. You'd<br>have to take the bus to city hall to get a copy of your birth<br>certificate so that you can take another bus to go to DMV to get a state<br>ID card so you can *vote*? *That's* disenfranchisement. The arguments<br>about racism and illegals voting are red herrings.<br><br>Don't get me wrong, I'm all for voter registration. I don't see a<br>problem with showing some acceptable form of ID. You show ID to get your<br>Social Security benefits. You show ID when you go to the doctor's office<br>to get a checkup. You seriously can't show ID to vote? But there are<br>some scenarios where I could see obtaining a state ID card is cumbersome<br>or prohibitive for some.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/What-is-so-bad-about-a-Muslim-registry-I'm-surprised-there's-not-already-a-registry-of-all-citizens-that-includes-info-such-as-race-gender-religion-and-languages/answer/Shern-Ren-Tee<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
