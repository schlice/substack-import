<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I want to expand on [[Thomas<br>Goodnow](https://www.quora.com/profile/Thomas-Goodnow)]{.qlink_container}'s<br>excellent<br>[answer(https://www.quora.com/Why-cant-Christians-and-Muslims-provide-evidence-of-their-all-knowing-Gods-existence/answer/Thomas-Goodnow)]{.qlink_container}<br>and say that he's right, but "evidence" is going to be tough to come by.<br>It all depends on the specific type of evidence you're looking for.<br><br>Most people are looking for "evidence" in terms of what they can use<br>their five senses to determine. So they want something they can see,<br>hear, feel, smell, touch. And if we can't "produce such evidence," they<br>won't believe.<br><br>This type of doubt is not new. Thomas wouldn't believe that Jesus had<br>actually risen from the dead until he touched the nail holes in his<br>hands, and put his hand into Jesus' side (where the centurion pierced<br>him on the cross). Jesus did appear to Thomas, and he was able to get<br>his doubts alleviated. And Jesus said, "Because you have seen me, you<br>have believed; blessed are those who have not seen and yet have<br>believed." (John 20:29 NIV). Clearly, Jesus knew that this would be an<br>ongoing problem (people not believing if they don't see for themselves).<br>But God is pleased with us when we believe *despite* our doubts; when we<br>have not seen, but have yet believed.<br><br>Anyway, back to evidence. It's difficult to provide the type of evidence<br>that will satisfy the OP, since it's likely he or she is looking for<br>something which can be interpreted by the senses. But God exists outside<br>of the physical. He exists in the *supernatural*, not in the physical.<br>Thus, he cannot be sensed with your physical senses. He can't be proven<br>with science (which operates against the physical). So the type of<br>"evidence" the OP is presumably looking for won't be something we can<br>produce.<br><br>*But if he's so all-powerful, why doesn't he make himself visible to<br>us?*<br><br>Good question. But here's the trick: he already did.<br><br>God deigned to take human form and live on the earth for 33 years. The<br>"all-powerful," "all-knowing" God *willingly chose* to take on human<br>form.<br><br>*And then he allowed himself to be killed.*<br><br>Some all-powerful God, huh? He just starts getting the ball rolling on<br>his ministry on earth, and he goes and gets himself arrested and<br>crucified. But Christians know that *this was the point of his life*: to<br>be killed as the sacrificial lamb for our sins, paying for them all<br>(past, present, and future) with his blood, and then, as an added bonus,<br>**so that he could be resurrected and restore the path for man to return<br>to Heaven.**<br><br>Never has the life of one person been so consequential to everything in<br>existence as the life of Jesus.<br><br>People who ask for "evidence" like this are intentionally posing a<br>question which cannot be answered so that they can continue to deny the<br>existence of God with a clear (?) conscience. But if you look at the<br>logical and philosophical "evidence," rather than searching for physical<br>evidence which cannot be produced, you will find that it takes a larger<br>leap of faith to be an atheist than it does to be a theist. Former<br>atheist Lee Strobel, who arrived at this end result many years ago, has<br>commented: \"Essentially, I realized that to stay an atheist, I would<br>have to believe that nothing produces everything; non-life produces<br>life; randomness produces fine-tuning; chaos produces information;<br>unconsciousness produces consciousness; and non-reason produces reason.<br>Those leaps of faith were simply too big for me to take, especially in<br>light of the affirmative case for God\'s existence. In other words, in<br>my assessment the Christian worldview accounted for the totality of the<br>evidence much better than the atheistic worldview.\"<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Why can\'t Christians and Muslims provide evidence of their all-knowing<br>God\'s existence?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
