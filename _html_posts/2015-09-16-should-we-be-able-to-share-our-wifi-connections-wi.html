<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [To piggyback on [[Cliff<br>G.](https://www.quora.com/profile/Cliff-G-13)]{.qlink_container}\'s<br>answer. some WiFi routers give you the option of creating a \"Guest\"<br>network which is isolated from your home network (for the techies, it<br>does this using VLANs). This will protect your home systems from<br>intrusion by anyone on the guest network, but it won\'t protect you from<br>legal liability should someone on your guest network do something<br>illegal. The IP address will still be the one for your ISP\'s access<br>point. You\'re opening yourself up to some legal issues that you\'re<br>best served by avoiding.\<br>\<br>Use the guest network for anyone who comes to your house and wants to<br>connect. That way, you still have positive control over who is using<br>your network and why, and their dirty, infected machines won\'t infect<br>the rest of your network (I\'m not saying everyone\'s systems that<br>connect to your network are infected, but from a security standpoint,<br>you can only control your own systems, so you should treat all outside<br>systems that way). As for your neighbors, let them buy their own<br>Internet service.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
