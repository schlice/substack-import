<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I suppose it comes down to why you want to join the military.<br><br>Are you looking for work experience? That may be important in other<br>career fields, but less so in the police department. You will get all<br>the work experience you need within the department. The training (both<br>classroom, called academy training, and then OJT, or on-the-job<br>training) are all very well-formed training programs, so the work<br>experience is not necessary.<br><br>Are you joining the military because you want to serve your country, and<br>you're trying to find out why, after all the anti-cop rhetoric and<br>downright hate, these people are *still worth fighting for and<br>protecting?* Then yeah, maybe some time in the Armed Forces would give<br>you that perspective, at a much larger scale than your local police<br>department ever can. No disrespect to my badged sworn brethren, but you<br>don't get that same perspective when you're in the soup every day.<br>Directly supporting and defending the Constitution under the authority<br>of a *Posse Comitatus Act* provides that perspective much better than<br>hauling puking D&D's all night.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
