<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Interesting question.<br><br>What is the source of this morality which would seek to claim that an<br>"instruction from God" is "immoral?" This source must be one that God is<br>subject to.<br><br>So: what is the source of morality which God did not create which God<br>must follow?<br><br>\<br><br>The answer, of course, is that there is none.<br><br>The questioner is substituting human ideas of morality for God's truth.<br>The questioner could only interpret "instructions from God" based on<br>man's interpretation of morality, and God is certainly not subject to<br>man's interpretation of morality.<br><br>God is the author of morality; therefore, God is not subject to that<br>morality in the same way that we, His creation, are.<br><br>Since God's very nature does not allow Him to violate His own being, He<br>can never be immoral, as He is the author of morality.<br><br>The only way you could "consider" something directed by God to be<br>immoral is if your interpretation of morality conflicts with God's given<br>morality.<br><br>So it is nothing more than a matter of interpretation. Man interprets<br>God's morality and finds it lacking, but there is no rational basis upon<br>which God would ever be subject to that version of morality.<br><br>\<br><br>No, it is impossible for God to act immorally, because if God does it,<br>it is *de facto* moral.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
