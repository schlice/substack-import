<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Short answer: you can\'t. You can ask. They don\'t have to tell you.<br>They do have to tell you whether or not the cancellation was because of<br>a reason within the airline\'s control (so that you know if you qualify<br>for Rule 240), but that\'s all they are required to tell you.<br><br>Longer answer: the airline ticket you bought is a ***contract for<br>carriage***. It doesn\'t specify which flight you must take. It doesn\'t<br>even specify when you need to arrive. The airline will make every<br>effort to get you there when they originally agreed to, but they are<br>under no obligation to take you on any specific plane, on any specific<br>seat, or at any specific time. That said, they are under no obligation<br>to tell you why the flight was cancelled. They can cancel it for any<br>reason.<br><br>However, if they do cancel it because of a foreseeable preventable<br>reason within the control of the airline (i.e. crew scheduling mixup,<br>mechanical failure, etc), not because of acts of God, weather delays,<br>etc., under Rule 240, they can transfer your ticket to another<br>airline if the original airline cannot get you where they said they were<br>going to get you in a reasonable amount of time.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
