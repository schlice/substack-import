<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If somebody works as a federal contractor does having a security<br>clearance mean that they cannot talk about what they are working with<br>and if they do they will end up in prison?**<br><br>The answer is "it depends."<br><br>Not all parts of every federal contract are classified. In fact, it is<br>very infrequently that an *entire* federal contract is fully, 100%<br>classified. It is true that *parts* of some federal contracts involve<br>classified material and classified projects. But very rarely is an<br>entire federal contract 100% classified.<br><br>It is true that some federal contractors who work on some federal<br>contracts won't be able to discuss certain portions of their work.<br><br>However, simply possessing a security clearance does not mean they can't<br>talk about the entirety of what they do.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
