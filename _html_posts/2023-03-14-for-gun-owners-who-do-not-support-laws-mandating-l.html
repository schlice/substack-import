<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I can see both sides of the issue. If your guns are secured, they are<br>inaccessible to you in the event of an emergency. In order to be<br>prepared for an emergency, you must unsecure your firearms to make them<br>ready.<br><br>On one hand, I think that technology has advanced to the point where we<br>can have safe firearms storage but still have rapid access to it.<br>Personally, I wear bracelets all the time. I have a few bracelets which<br>are so important and personal to me that I never take them off unless<br>I'm in the shower. So I'd have no problem wearing a bracelet with an<br>RFID chip to open a gun safe with the wave of my hand. Biometrics are<br>becoming more reliable and more accurate as we progress, although I'm<br>not quite sold on that yet. Nevertheless, I think we can say that we can<br>safely secure our personal home defense firearms but still have rapid<br>access to them.<br><br>The problem comes when we mandate such storage. And there are indeed<br>several problems with this, but the biggest is *liability*. What happens<br>if someone gets into my safe, steals a gun, and kills someone with it?<br>Because my safe storage failed or didn't work properly, somehow now I<br>become liable for their actions. And in the minds of most gun owners,<br>the only reason to mandate safe storage is so that we have someone to<br>blame, other than the shooter, for the shooter's bad actions. This<br>leaves a very, very bad taste in the mouths of gun owners. No gun owner<br>with a conscience wants unauthorized people to get their hands on their<br>guns and use them to commit crimes. It's *doubly bad* when you now<br>become *criminally liable* for someone else's bad choices. Only the<br>criminal is criminally responsible for the criminal's criminal conduct.<br>Transferring criminal liability to others is a bad thing.<br><br>The other issue is one of Constitutionality.<br><br>- If a firearm is secured, it cannot be used for one of its lawful<br>  purposes (self-defense), which makes the law, *de facto*,<br>  unconstitutional. And I can guarantee you that a safe storage law will<br>  not have any provision for lawful use, because that defeats the<br>  purpose of a safe storage law. For example, how close to my firearm do<br>  I have to be in order to leave it unsecured? Must I simply be in the<br>  same house? Does it have to be within arm's reach? Each one of these<br>  exceptions to the safe storage law opens up a hole for an unauthorized<br>  person to get hold of a firearm, which limits the law's usefulness.<br>- If you mandate purchasing a gun safe along with purchasing a gun (and<br>  some gun safes rival the cost of the gun in price), you are pricing<br>  the poor out of the gun market, arguably the people who need guns the<br>  most for self-defense. Excluding an entire class of citizens through<br>  mandatory price increases is also unconstitutional.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
