<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The only way that the world would become more peaceful if we could<br>(somehow) remove all the guns from it instantly would be if the guns<br>were the cause of the violence. Remove the gun, remove the violence.<br><br>However (and gun control advocates often seem to miss this point),<br>guns do not cause violence. Guns are a tool, one of many which could<br>be used to commit violence. Guns, by themselves, do not cause violence<br>any more than pencils cause spelling errors or forks cause obesity. You<br>need a consciousness behind the gun to cause violence.<br><br>Therefore, using that understanding, removing the gun will not cause<br>peace, because the gun does not cause violence. Removing the gun will<br>remove a tool that can be used for good or for ill. The gun will be<br>replaced with something else, most likely a sword, a knife, a baton,<br>pepper spray, Tasers, bow and arrows, and spears.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
