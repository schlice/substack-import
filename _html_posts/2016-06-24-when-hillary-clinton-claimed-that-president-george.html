<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>She's *Hillary*. She always knows.<br><br>You're just supposed to believe her. You're not supposed to ask<br>questions.<br><br>And if you asked her, she'd probably say something along the lines of<br>*Bush knew there was a threat to the country, although he didn't know<br>specifics, he didn't do enough to protect us!*<br><br>The fact of the matter is that no one, not even Bush, knew or even<br>foresaw our own aircraft being turned into weapons. The Pentagon had it<br>in a war games scenario, but it was something that sat on a shelf. No<br>one ever took it seriously.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
