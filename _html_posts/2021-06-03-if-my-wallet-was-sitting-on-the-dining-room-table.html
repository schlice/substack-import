<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>*(US answer only. Be advised that parole rules vary from state to state,<br>so everything in this answer may not necessarily apply to you)*<br><br>Maybe your husband's parole officer didn't make this clear to you, so<br>let me see if I can help.<br><br>Parole is not "release from prison." It is "conditional release."<br><br>> Parole is designed as an opportunity for a prisoner to transition back<br>> into society. The restrictions on parolees are supposed to encourage<br>> good behavior after incarceration. In fact, even before prisoners get<br>> out of custody, the possibility of parole gives them an incentive to<br>> avoid trouble.<br>><br>> Parole also reduces prison overcrowding, granting offenders who are<br>> considered unlikely to harm others the benefit of supervised life in<br>> society. Parole helps the government try to cut down on the high costs<br>> of maintaining large prison populations while keeping the population<br>> at large safe.\[1\](#VluDV){#cite-VluDV .citation_link}<br><br>In order to ensure that parolees stay out of trouble, they must meet<br>with their parole officer (PO). You probably already knew that. You<br>probably also knew that POs do random site visits to ensure the parolee<br>is reintegrating into society appropriately, and that there are no<br>violations that could send him back to prison.<br><br>As I initially mentioned, parole is a "conditional release." Some of the<br>conditions that may apply to your husband as a condition of his release:<br><br>- He may have to get a job and keep it for a certain period of time<br>- He may have to refrain from drug and alcohol use. If part of his<br>  sentence was for either, he may have to attend AA or NA meetings<br>  regularly.<br>- He may have to stay within a certain geographic area unless his PO<br>  gives him permission<br>- He may not contact his victims or former associates, and he may not<br>  participate in any criminal activity<br><br>The PO usually can conduct random, unannounced searches of the parolee's<br>residence, and usually has the authority to search the areas which the<br>parolee has reasonable access to. This includes looking in a wallet on<br>the dining room table for evidence of drug or alcohol use, or for<br>evidence of criminal activity. POs usually have pretty broad discretion<br>in this regard, as your home is essentially considered an extension of<br>the jail, and that PO is responsible for that parolee.<br><br>If you really believe your rights were violated or that the PO did<br>something he was not allowed to do, you should not ask questions on<br>Quora. You should instead call a criminal defense attorney in your area.<br>You might want to contact your husband's original defense attorney, or<br>you may wish to find another. Your call, but one way or another, if you<br>really think there is a violation here, you can only be advised properly<br>by a lawyer.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>**If my wallet was sitting on the dining room table and it was clearly<br>my wallet and the parole officer without asking grabs it and goes<br>through it is that acceptable and I\'m not on parole my husband is?**<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-VluDV){.citation_index} [[What Is Parole?
