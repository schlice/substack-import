<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Can you be guilty of influencing a witness under OCGA16-10-3 by<br>telling someone to lie if, at the time, you weren\'t charged with any<br>crime? Don\'t you have to be charged and know that someone was a witness<br>to be charged with influencing a witness?**<br><br>First of all, OCGA 16--10--3 is not "Influencing a witness."<br><br>> **16-10-3 - Using Private Funds For Law Enforcement Off-Duty<br>> Employment Of Law Enforcement Officers**<br><br>The statute you're looking for is 16--10--93: Influencing Witnesses.<br><br>> A person who, with intent to deter a witness from testifying freely,<br>> fully, and truthfully to any matter pending in any court, in any<br>> administrative proceeding, or before a grand jury, communicates,<br>> directly or indirectly, to such witness any threat of injury or damage<br>> to the person, property, or employment of the witness or to the<br>> person, property, or employment of any relative or associate of the<br>> witness or who offers or delivers any benefit, reward, or<br>> consideration to such witness or to a relative or associate of the<br>> witness shall, upon conviction thereof, be punished by imprisonment<br>> for not less than one nor more than five years.<br><br>Do you see anything in there about a requirement that you are charged<br>with a crime before the statute applies to you?<br><br>The elements of the crime under Georgia law:<br><br>- A person,<br>- with intent to deter a witness from freely, fully, and truthfully<br>  testifying:<br>  - communicates a threat of injury or damage to person or property<br>  - threatens their employment,<br>  - threatens relatives or associates similarly,<br>  - or offers benefits or rewards or consideration to anyone<br>- in order that they testify in a certain way<br><br>There's nothing in there which states you must be charged with a crime<br>first. If you tell someone to lie in court, you're guilty of Influencing<br>a Witness, and you can be arrested right there in the courthouse and go<br>directly to jail.<br><br>You do have to know the person is a witness, otherwise you're not<br>deterring a witness from testifying, but I bet you'd have a hard time<br>convincing the judge that you were unaware that the person you were<br>telling to lie in court was not actually in a court in which they could<br>tell the truth.<br><br>I know of former court officers who would carry this statute (for their<br>own states) on cards in their pockets and pull aside people who he<br>witnessed doing this and warn them (they got one warning) that witness<br>intimidation was not tolerated and if he saw it again, he'd arrest them<br>in the courtroom at the end of their trial, regardless of how it turned<br>out, and he'd drive them to the jail personally, to book them in on that<br>charge. In the same sentence, he'd remind them that he can enlist the<br>aid of as many officers as he though he'd need in order to effect that<br>arrest.<br><br>Think about that before you tell someone to lie in court.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
