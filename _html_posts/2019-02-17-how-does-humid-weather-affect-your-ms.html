<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Humidity is usually accompanied by heat, and it is the heat that affects<br>me more than the humidity.<br><br>When I get hot, I start to get tired faster. if I allow myself to<br>overheat, it usually means that by the end of the day, I am too tired to<br>continue doing what everybody else is doing. I have gotten so overheated<br>in the past that I have literally passed out, fallen asleep in my<br>clothes, and woke up the next day wondering what happened.<br><br>and this is a different kind of tired, it\'s not the same kind of tired<br>where you just want to go to bed. This is a deep, neurological tired,<br>where your brain just turns to mush and you can\'t really function<br>effectively. The last time this happened to me, I had to have somebody<br>else drive the car because I was in no condition to drive.<br><br>This is a symptom of MS called "MS lassitude" and I can tell you from<br>experience that it is a real thing.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
