<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Is it legal for a shop in the USA to kick a homeless person out of the<br>bathroom (let's say the person is a regular customer of the business)?**<br><br>Businesses are not "public property." Businesses are owned by private<br>entities (either people or companies) and they are "open to the public."<br>This means that people are allowed inside by the owner of the business<br>as long as they abide by the rules of the business.<br><br>The business can set whatever rules they choose for their bathrooms.<br>They may be "employee-only" bathrooms since OSHA requires a bathroom<br>on-premises for employees. If they are a food service establishment,<br>there are state regulations which require accessible bathrooms for<br>customers who are eating. They may set no rules at all. Perhaps anyone<br>can use them at any time, paying customer or not (like Starbuck's).<br>Perhaps anyone of any gender can use any bathroom they choose (like<br>Target).<br><br>Regardless of any rules which may or may not be in place, since the<br>location is actually a private building (which is open to the public),<br>the open invitation to enter the premises is **fully revocable for any<br>reason** by the owner (or the owner's representative, usually the store<br>manager).<br><br>If the store manager says that you are no longer welcome in the store,<br>in any part of the store, then you must vacate the store immediately, or<br>you can be arrested for trespassing. There doesn't have to be a reason.<br>It's certainly not good business practice to eject your customers from<br>your store, but it's not illegal to do so.<br><br>The only caveat: they cannot deny service because of a protected reason<br>(race, color, religion, sex, or national origin, and in some cities,<br>sexual orientation).<br><br>Beyond that, if the store has a valid reason for ejecting a person, they<br>can.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
