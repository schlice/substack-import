<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>How can I be diagnosed with both Lupus and Multiple sclerosis?<br><br>Great question. While they are both autoimmune diseases, they both cause<br>distinct symptoms which are generally not seen in the other disease.<br>Signs and symptoms from both diseases may lead to a finding of both<br>lupus and MS.<br><br>CAUSE OF SYMPTOMS: In both diseases, the immune system attacks healthy,<br>normal body tissue. In Lupus, actual body tissues like skin, lungs,<br>heart and kidneys, are attacked. In MS, the myelin sheath surrounding<br>nerve fibers in the CNS is attacked.<br><br>SYMPTOMS: Lupus produces symptoms such as:<br><br>- Fatigue<br>- Fever<br>- Joint pain, stiffness and swelling<br>- Butterfly-shaped rash on the face that covers the cheeks and bridge of<br>  the nose or rashes elsewhere on the body<br>- Skin lesions that appear or worsen with sun exposure<br>  (photosensitivity)<br>- Fingers and toes that turn white or blue when exposed to cold or<br>  during stressful periods (Raynaud\'s phenomenon)<br>- Shortness of breath<br>- Chest pain<br>- Dry eyes<br>- Headaches, confusion and memory loss<br><br>MS produces symptoms such as:<br><br>- Bladder Dysfunction<br>- Bowel Dysfunction<br>- Changes in Cognitive Function, including problems with memory,<br>  attention, and problem-solving<br>- Dizziness and Vertigo<br>- Depression and other Emotional Changes<br>- Fatigue (also called MS lassitude)<br>- Difficulty in Walking and/or Balance or Coordination Problems<br>- Abnormal sensations such as Numbness or "pins and needles"<br>- Sexual Dysfunction<br>- Spasticity<br>- Vision Problems (Optic Neuritis)<br><br>Less common symptoms include:<br><br>- Headache<br>- Hearing Loss<br>- Itching<br>- Seizures<br>- Speech Disorders<br>- Dysphagia (Swallowing Problems)<br>- Tremor<br><br>DIAGNOSIS: MS diagnosis is usually made by using an MRI to scan the<br>brain and spinal cord, along with a neurological exam. The lesions<br>caused by the disease process are visible on an MRI. Lupus is diagnosed<br>with a combination of blood and urine tests, as well as the physical<br>examination findings, including the signs and symptoms.<br><br>TREATMENT: There is no medication available which specifically targets<br>the disease activity of lupus. A combination of NSAIDs, corticosteroids,<br>immunosuppressants and biologics may be used to ease lupus symptoms.<br>Approved MS therapy drugs slow down the progress of the disease, while<br>reducing the severity and duration of relapses. Secondary medications<br>may be used during relapses to help control the symptoms.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
