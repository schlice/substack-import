<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**You can bet there are people in high places taking a hard look at<br>Trump\'s latest string of pardons. if evidence of a quid pro quo is<br>found involving either pardons for silence or for cash, is there any<br>recourse the Justice Department can take?**<br><br>Clearly, you know nothing about how pardons work, and you know less<br>about which president has issued questionable pardons in their 11th<br>hour.<br><br>First of all, before a pardon request ever makes it to the President, it<br>goes through the [[Office of the Pardon<br>Attorney](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=174aac&url=https://www.justice.gov/pardon){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="justice.gov"}]{.qlink_container}. Before that happens, a<br>person convicted must actually serve at least five years (less only in<br>the highest profile cases) before they can submit a request for pardon.<br>The Pardon Attorney will request counsel from the Attorney General, and<br>then and only then will the request be sent to the president. There are<br>a lot of factors considered before a request for pardon is even<br>considered.<br><br>Second, Trump has pardoned 28 and commuted 16 people's sentences. Obama<br>pardoned 212 (two-thirds of those during his last year in office, after<br>the elections were over) and commuted 1,715 sentences (mostly after the<br>election).<br><br>But if, as you claim, Trump accepted a bribe to pardon someone, it is at<br>least conceivable that he can be charged under 18 USC ยง201, after he<br>leaves office. But it is highly unlikely for a number of practical<br>reasons.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
