<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Android (or any phone with a removable battery): Take out the battery.<br>The phone can\'t be traced when it is off.\<br>iPhone (or any phone without a removable battery): Turn it off and put<br>it in a transmission-proof pouch. With the battery still connected,<br>there is no guarantee that the phone can\'t be traced.<br><br>But of course, if you are really a fugitive, the first thing you would<br>do would be to destroy your contract phone. Not remove the battery or<br>put it in a transmission-proof pouch, \*destroy\* it with a hammer.<br><br>Then go buy (with cash) a few burner phones. Use them a few times each<br>and throw away.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
