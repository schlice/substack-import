<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Doing bad things as a kid means you\'re human. Doing bad<br>things and then *stopping* doing bad things means you\'re normal.\<br>\<br>Believe it or not, police departments don\'t look negatively at this.<br>They would look negatively if you tried to *cover up* your past bad<br>actions: lying is a deal-breaker when trying to become a cop. As long as<br>you are open and honest about your past, the police will understand<br>this.\<br>\<br>Everyone makes mistakes as a youth. Growing up and growing out of that<br>phase is also mandatory if you want to become a cop.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
