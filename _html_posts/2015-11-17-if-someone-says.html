<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [No, the first is a statement of fact, the second is a<br>statement of intent. The first, \"I can kick your ass,\" is a<br>(subjectively-sourced) statement of fact. It states something that can<br>be accomplished.\<br>\<br>Once I say, \"I\'m gonna kick your ass,\" that amounts to a threat. You<br>can call the police if someone told you they were going to kick your<br>ass, especially if they told you exactly when and where they were going<br>to attempt this assault.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
