<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The biggest sign is that you\'re still alive.<br><br>God is well within his rights to strike any of us down at any time. We<br>are all sinners. We have all fallen short of God\'s grace.<br><br>But He has not done this.<br><br>The only reason can be that He\'s not done with you yet. He has more for<br>you to do.<br><br>He calls you, you repent, He saves you, and then He equips you to do the<br>works He has prepared for you. The Bible is very clear on this.<br><br>If you have been saved, then be ready, because He will be calling you to<br>serve. We don\'t know when or how, but we know He will. And it will be<br>amazing and it will enrich the Kingdom.<br><br>Praise God for that!<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>What are the signs that you might be called by God to do something?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
