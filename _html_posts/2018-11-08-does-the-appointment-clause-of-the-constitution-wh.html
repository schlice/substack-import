<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Does the Appointment Clause of the Constitution, which provides that a<br>"principal officer" in the federal government may not be appointed<br>without Senate confirmation, make Matt Whitaker's appointment as acting<br>Attorney General invalid?**<br><br>No.<br><br>The Appointments Clause says that the actual appointment must have<br>"advice and consent" by the Senate. In the interim, the President is<br>able to appoint "acting" Agency heads while the actual<br>Constitutionally-approved method for appointing an Agency head is<br>underway.<br><br>That process is controlled by the Federal Vacancies Reform Act, passed<br>in 1998. The Act states who can be appointed to become an interim head<br>of an agency while the process to find, nominate, and confirm a new head<br>of the agency is in progress. It provides for three classes of people<br>who can serve as acting officials:<br><br>- By default, \"the first assistant to the office\" becomes the acting<br>  officer.<br>- The President may direct a person currently serving in a different<br>  Senate-confirmed position to serve as acting officer.<br>- The President can select a senior \"officer or employee\" of the same<br>  executive agency, if that employee served in that agency for at least<br>  90 days during the year preceding the vacancy, and is paid at a rate<br>  equivalent to at least a GS-15 on the federal pay scale.<br><br>By these rules, Matt Whitaker's appointment as acting AG is legal. He<br>was formerly Chief of Staff to AG Sessions at the Justice Department,<br>which meets the criteria for a "senior officer or employee" of the same<br>agency.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
