<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>In most jurisdictions, the \"side of the road\" is not technically the<br>road. It is called the \"shoulder.\" Legally, bicycles and other<br>unlicensed vehicles (i.e. ATV\'s) cannot use the sidewalk, as it is<br>exclusively reserved for pedestrians. Those vehicles must use the<br>shoulder, as far off the road as is practical. Sometimes the shoulder is<br>marked with a solid white line,<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-890092af2acadca8258406e0d4e5c717){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-890092af2acadca8258406e0d4e5c717"<br>master_w="3648" master_h="2736"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>sometimes it is not.<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-6c798466b351c3d139bd84029528cc70){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-6c798466b351c3d139bd84029528cc70" master_w="520"<br>master_h="315"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>Sometimes the shoulder is wide enough to fit a whole vehicle (in the<br>case of a disabled vehicle), sometimes it is barely wide enough to fit a<br>bicycle and rider.<br><br>When the sidewalk is impassable, but the shoulder is available (or if<br>there is no sidewalk), pedestrians can use the shoulder along with<br>bicyclists, assuming it is safe to do so.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
