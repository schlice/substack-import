<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>"Illegal" implies that the practice somehow violates copyright law, or<br>that you could be arrested or fined by doing so. Whether or not you are<br>allowed to view the video is determined by copyright. YouTube has<br>granted you, the YouTube user, the right to view the movie on their<br>platform. They have not granted you the right to download the video to<br>watch offline.<br><br>Therefore, it is a violation of YouTube's terms of service to do so. You<br>deprive YouTube of its ad revenue. But "illegal?" No, it is not illegal<br>to download a YouTube video.<br><br>In some cases (like VEVO videos produced by artists), YouTube pays the<br>distribution company a fee based on the number of views a video gets. If<br>you download the video for offline viewing, YouTube has no idea of that<br>view count, and the artist gets shorted. So you are, in effect, stealing<br>from the artist. While no one will ever come after you for doing so,<br>theft is theft, regardless of how small it is.<br><br>So it's more "immoral" than "illegal."<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Is it still illegal to download YouTube videos for myself?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
