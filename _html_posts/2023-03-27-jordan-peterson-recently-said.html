<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Time to take his entire quote into context. Because text without<br>context is just pretext.<br><br>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\...(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=6d5327&url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DHRl0bdl3wXk){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="youtube.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>What was his next statement after that one?<br><br>"You might say, 'Well, no, the planet has too many people on it,' it's<br>like 'yeah, whatever, good luck with that.' Every single one of your<br>ancestors reproduced in an unending procession lasting three and a half<br>billion years. And they're all wrong and you're right? I don't think<br>so."<br><br>The problem is that he's using the wrong words. And you're not taking a<br>strong enough interest in biology.<br><br>When you "want to have sex with someone" you actually, biologically,<br>want to create children. You may not want children, but you're doing the<br>one thing, the only thing, that creates children. So if you are having<br>sex because your body is telling you to have sex, it's not to have fun<br>or to grow love or any of those excuses. It's to make children. Your<br>biological drive which causes you to desire sex is to procreate, to<br>further the species. You may do it because it's enjoyable, but it's<br>enjoyable because you're supposed to do it to further the species. In<br>other words, your desire for sex is, at a root biological level, to make<br>children.<br><br>So somehow, all of your ancestors over the last three and a half billion<br>years were wrong, and you are right? You want to do the thing which<br>makes children but you don't want children? Yeah, I'll agree with<br>Peterson: I don't think so. You're either deluded (you don't realize<br>the consequences of having sex) or immature (you don't care that you<br>could get pregnant).<br><br>But if you break it down, he's right.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
