He<br>created the laws of physics and so He is not constrained by them. God<br>exists outside of time, space, matter, and energy, as He created all of<br>those things so He is not limited by them as we are.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
