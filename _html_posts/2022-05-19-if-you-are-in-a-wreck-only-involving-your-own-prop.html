<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>> In Indiana, you are required by law to report any car accidents that<br>> involve injury, death or entrapment of another person. You must also<br>> report accidents that involve damage to property, excluding the<br>> vehicles involved.\[1\](#jbWAt){#cite-jbWAt .citation_link}<br><br>So if your accident caused no damage to property other than your car (so<br>like, for example, let's say you drove into a drainage ditch at the side<br>of the road and damaged your own car but that's it) and no one else was<br>injured, you would not have to report that.<br><br>If there was damage to property and you *didn't* report it and you just<br>left, you could be charged with leaving the scene of an accident, so<br>don't do that.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>If you are in a wreck only involving your own property, do you have to<br>report it to the police in Indiana?<br><br>\<br><br>*This answer is not professional legal advice, nor is it a substitute<br>for professional legal advice, or a solicitation to offer professional<br>legal advice.
