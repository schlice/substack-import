<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Animal cruelty charges can result if you knowingly kill an animal<br>without cause. Since you had a pretty easily substantiated reason<br>(defense of a child), you likely won't be charged with animal cruelty.<br>At worst, you could be charged with criminal mischief, or criminal<br>destruction of property. Destruction of property ranges from a<br>misdemeanor to a felony depending on the dollar amount of the property<br>destroyed. However, again, you have a defense: you were defending the<br>life of a child.<br><br>You *may* be charged with other violations, depending on your<br>jurisdiction. You may be in an area where discharge of firearms is<br>prohibited (such as within most city limits), and if you are a person<br>prohibited from owning a firearm, you would also be charged for those<br>infractions.<br><br>Your defense may be lessened if you knew the dog was aggressive and you<br>allowed your child to remain in its presence. So first and foremost,<br>don't allow your child to be near the dog. Don't allow your child to be<br>in the same house as the dog. If this upsets your mother-in-law, perhaps<br>she should get rid of the dog, or kennel it while your child is present.<br><br>Can you be arrested? Yes. Would you have a fairly solid defense that a<br>defense attorney should be able to work with? Also yes.<br><br>But don't take my word for it. You should talk to an attorney licensed<br>in your jurisdiction before you take action on any advice.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
