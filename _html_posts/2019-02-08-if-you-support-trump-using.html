<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If you support Trump using \"national emergency\' power to build his<br>wall, would you continue even if it created legal precedent for a future<br>president to have unrestrained power to restrict assault and other<br>military weapons?**<br><br>It's clear you don't understand how this whole "national emergency"<br>thing works.<br><br>Many of our Federal laws have these little inbuilt "short-circuits" that<br>allow the president to do certain things (which would otherwise have to<br>go through Congressional approval or other processes) during a time of<br>declared war or declared national emergency. Clearly, declared war is<br>out, as declarations of war can only be made by Congress. But the<br>president can declare a national emergency, and it's solely his job to<br>do so. [[It's been done many<br>times](https://www.quora.com/How-can-a-U-S-president-simply-declare-there-will-be-an-emergency-some-number-of-days-in-the-future-specifically-pending-the-outcome-of-a-funding-measure/answer/Bill-Stein)]{.qlink_container},<br>probably more often than you know. It's governed by the National<br>Emergencies Act. The law outlines what the president needs to do in<br>order to declare a national emergency.<br><br>Once the national emergency is declared, all of these Federal laws with<br>their little inbuilt short-circuits become available to be used. For<br>instance, 10 USC ยง 2808 has the following in it (*emphasis* added):<br><br>> \I<br> the event of a declaration of war *or the declaration by the<br>> President of a national emergency* in accordance with the National<br>> Emergencies Act (50 USC ยง 1601 et seq.) *that requires use of the<br>> armed forces*, the Secretary of Defense, without regard to any other<br>> provision of law, may undertake military construction projects, and<br>> may authorize the Secretaries of the military departments to undertake<br>> military construction projects, not otherwise authorized by law *that<br>> are necessary to support such use of the armed forces.* Such projects<br>> may be undertaken *only within the total amount of funds that have<br>> been appropriated for military construction*, including funds<br>> appropriated for family housing, that have not been obligated.<br><br>So in order for a national emergency to make guns illegal, there would<br>have to be a law that gave some agency the authority to do so in the<br>event of a national emergency.<br><br>But not even a national emergency can override the Constitution. So such<br>a law would be unconstitutional.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
