<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>From the [[Tecfiedra<br>website](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=6bd50e&url=https://www.tecfidera.com/en_us/home/about/side-effects.html){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="tecfidera.com"}]{.qlink_container}:<br><br>> You should always talk to your healthcare provider before taking<br>> TECFIDERA if you're pregnant, interested in becoming pregnant,<br>> breastfeeding or planning to breastfeed. That's because it isn't known<br>> how taking TECFIDERA would affect an unborn baby or if it passes into<br>> your breast milk. If you're pregnant while taking TECFIDERA, talk to<br>> your healthcare provider about enrolling in the [[TECFIDERA Pregnancy<br>> Registry](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=5b3824&url=https://www.tecfiderapregnancyregistry.com/){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="tecfiderapregnancyregistry.com"}]{.qlink_container} to<br>> monitor your health and the health of your baby.<br>><br>> [[TECFIDERA Pregnancy<br>> Registry](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=5b3824&url=https://www.tecfiderapregnancyregistry.com/){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="tecfiderapregnancyregistry.com"}]{.qlink_container}\<br>> [1-866-810-1462(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=e3b1c5&url=%23){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);" qt-tooltip="#"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>So the short answer is talk to your neurologist if you are planning on<br>becoming pregnant. They may want you to stop your Tecfidera during your<br>pregnancy, as pregnancy hormones suppress MS symptoms. But beware:<br>you'll probably relapse after you give birth; it's a very common thing<br>for women with MS who get pregnant.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>I was recently diagnosed with multiple sclerosis and taking Dimethyl<br>Fumarate 240 mg.
