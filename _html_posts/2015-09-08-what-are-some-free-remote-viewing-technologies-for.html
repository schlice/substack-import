<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [There are plenty of free ones available, but two things<br>stand in your way:\<br>\<br>]<br><br>1.  You can handle 90% of your customers\' issues by using something<br>    like Windows Remote Assistance, as long as your customer is using<br>    Windows 7 or higher. You\'d have to talk them through sending you an<br>    assistance request, and there are still factors which might hamper<br>    the support experience (internet connection speeds, firewalls, etc)\<br>2.  If you want to produce a reliable, secure remote support experience,<br>    I would seriously consider a contract for a pay service.<br>    Additionally, most of the free solutions I know of are only free for<br>    personal use. Using one of these solutions in a business setting<br>    still requires a license. So if you are looking to provide a<br>    service, you can use any old software. If you\'re looking to provide<br>    a reliable service that your customers would brag about, I would<br>    most definitely go with some contracted pay service. Some of the<br>    ones I would seriously consider:<br><br>- TeamViewer<br>- GoToAssist<br>- LogMeIn Rescue<br>- join.me<br>- Webex<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
