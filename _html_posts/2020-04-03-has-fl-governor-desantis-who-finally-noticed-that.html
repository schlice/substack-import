Governor Desantis, who finally noticed that people without<br>symptoms can spread the coronavirus, also discover that people at<br>religious services are immune and do not need to stay at home?**<br><br>I would posit only that it might be difficult for a church to even bring<br>their pastor and their worship team together (maintaining social<br>distancing, of course) to lead streaming worhsip services if they didn't<br>have an explicit exemption.<br><br>Yes, I know. When you make an explicit religious exemption, the<br>chronically stupid among us will congregate at church, believing the<br>exemption means that religious people are immune.<br><br>Let it be. Natural selection will do the rest.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
