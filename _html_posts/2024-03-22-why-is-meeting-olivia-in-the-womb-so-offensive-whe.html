<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>For the uninitiated, what we're actually discussing here is a<br>three-minute video called *Meet Baby Olivia.* It is an *animated* video<br>depicting the fertilization of an egg and the development of a baby.<br><br>The video is not *offensive*, it is controversial.<br><br>First, it is controversial because it was produced by *Live Action*, the<br>company founded by Lila Rose. Rose became famous when she went<br>undercover to Planned Parenthood facilities exposing some activity which<br>they claim they did not participate in. She and her organization have<br>become very polarizing since then.<br><br>Secondly, some of the things the video talks about are disputed. For<br>example, the video references fetal "heartbeat" and this is disputed. At<br>six weeks, the embryo isn't yet a fetus and doesn't have a heart, so<br>some embryologists object to the term "fetal heartbeat."<br><br>The video also describes the animated figure\'s motion and actions with<br>words like "playing," "exploring,\" "sighing" and making "speaking<br>movements." Some doctors say that those words assign human traits and<br>properties to a fetus that are more sophisticated than medicine can<br>prove. There are signals that the brain is developing and functioning,<br>but the opposing doctors claim that the video\'s language implies a<br>"level of intention" in the fetus' actions that cannot currently be<br>proven.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
