The police do get<br>held accountable for murder, rape assault, or any other crime they<br>commit.<br><br>I would argue that officers you feel "got away with" some crime actually<br>didn't "get away" with a crime. They were either not charged with a<br>crime because the evidence didn't support such a charge, or a jury found<br>that they were not guilty.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
