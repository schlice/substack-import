<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: [You want a deal that allows Iran to enrich uranium for<br>legal purposes, like generating power? OK, the deal is: enrich uranium.<br>We get 100% unfettered access to any site in Iran (military or civilian)<br>with no advanced notice. The trade embargo stays for five years, if<br>there are no violations of the use of the uranium in five years, some<br>limited trade may be allowed. Any refusal to allow inspectors into a<br>site is a violation and the sanctions remain in place.\<br>\<br>I don\'t like the deal because, like I said, the distance between<br>enriched uranium and a nuclear weapon is very short and easy to reach.<br>However, if you insist on allowing Iran to enrich uranium, this is a<br>start.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/For-Republicans-in-the-United-States-why-was-it-OK-when-Ronald-Reagan-gave-arms-to-Iran-but-not-OK-when-Barack-Obama-negotiated-a-nuclear-agreement-with-Iran/answer/Bill-Stein<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
