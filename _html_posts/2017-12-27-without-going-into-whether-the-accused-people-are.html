<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Without going into whether the accused people are guilty, is<br>\"Murder\" the appropriate charge when someone is killed because of a<br>\"prank\"?**<br><br>The short answer is yes, the charges are appropriate.<br><br>Originally, the boys were charged with an Ohio charge called "felonious<br>assault" which is basically felony-level (criminal) assault, but when<br>the passenger died, the charge was upped to murder.<br><br>Essentially, you're asking about the "intent" portion, or the *mens rea*<br>(i.e. the guilty mind) in a murder charge. There are two portions: the<br>"act," also called the *actus reus* (i.e. the guilty act), and the<br>"intent."<br><br>The boys performed a criminal act, knowingly dropping a sandbag off of<br>an overpass into freeway traffic. This alone is felony assault. When the<br>passenger died, it became second degree murder: during the performance<br>of a criminal act, the direct outcome of that act was a death, even<br>though the death was not intentional. The other boys get charged with<br>murder as well under the "felony murder rule:" when the group is<br>committing a felony, if one member of the group commits a murder, the<br>entire group can be charged with murder.<br><br>If the boys had intended on killing someone by dropping the bag instead<br>of it being a "prank," the charge in most jurisdictions would be<br>first-degree murder.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
