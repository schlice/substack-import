<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Trump recently signed an executive order requiring children and<br>parents to be detained together; is this progress or a band-aid<br>distracting from a larger problem?**<br><br>Of course it's a band aid!<br><br>Congress needs to do its job and change the law if they don't like<br>it. But they're too busy being embroiled in partisan politics. Democrats<br>are too eager to keep using this issue to hold Trump's feet to the fire<br>(so they think) to score political points. Republicans are too willing<br>to try to get everything and the kitchen sink into a bill which they<br>know Democrats won't sign so that they can use the Democrat's refusal to<br>sign to beat them about the head and shoulders for refusing to sign.<br><br>Congress is a complete mess.<br><br>The only thing the President can do, rightly, is to sign an Executive<br>Order which is patently illegal on its face, as it violates Federal law,<br>detaining children for longer than 20 days. You can expect an injunction<br>from the 9th Circuit within a day or so. It will prevent the Executive<br>Order from going into effect because it is patently illegal.<br><br>If Trump can do something else, like make deportations go faster (within<br>the 20 days), that would be something that would be both legal and<br>acceptable because it keeps families together.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
