<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>A2A<br><br>I must say I love [[Loretta B.<br>DeLoggio](https://www.quora.com/profile/Loretta-B-DeLoggio)]{.qlink_container}'s<br>answer, but I fall squarely into the camp that has an opinion on this<br>issue.<br><br>Let's first look at what is required to be charged with an attempt.<br>There must be clear evidence that you were planning, plotting, scheming,<br>or preparing to commit a crime (in other words, the legal definition of<br>intent to actually commit a crime is met), and in addition, you took<br>direct action towards the completion of that crime.<br><br>In the moral sense, the attempt and the actual crime are exactly the<br>same. Morality refers to the state of morals which would lead someone to<br>commit crimes. It is equally as morally reprehensible to attempt to<br>commit a crime as if to actually commit the crime itself.<br><br>However, we do not legislate morality, nor can we.<br><br>Legally, therefore, there is a difference between the attempt and the<br>commission of a crime. Because the attempt falls short of actually<br>committing a crime, you cannot be charged with committing a crime when<br>you did not. This is why, in a society where we live by a standard of<br>laws and not a standard of morals, we have a separate offense for<br>attempting to commit a crime. You were *most of the way* there to<br>committing a crime, but you did not.<br><br>Therefore, because the commission of the crime did not take place, the<br>criminal is not "actually" a criminal. The criminal was an "almost"<br>criminal. The difference between "almost" and "actually" under the law<br>is significant enough to charge the attempted felon less severely than<br>the actual felon.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
