<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Ultimately, there is no difference. Ataxia is an MS symptom, and it is<br>the lack of voluntary coordination of muscle movements. In MS, this<br>can present as clumsiness, unsteady gait, impaired eye and limb<br>movements, and speech problems. In some cases, the lack of coordination<br>appears as muscle tremors. So MS-associated ataxia is simply a symptom<br>of MS.<br><br>There is a different, yet related ataxia syndrome, and it is called<br>fragile X-associated tremor ataxia syndrome (FXTAS). In FXTAS, there<br>is also brain damage visible on an MRI, but it is specifically located<br>in the area of the brain related to muscle movement (the cerebellum).<br>FXTAS is a late-onset disease, usually presenting after age 50.<br><br>The most common symptom of FXTAS is intention tremor, wherein a<br>muscle you are trying to control trembles. Also common are gait and<br>coordination problems (ataxia).<br><br>\<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*This answer is not professional medical advice, nor is it a substitute<br>for professional medical advice.
