<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I'm going to take a guess and say that you haven't told her, in no<br>uncertain terms, that you no longer want to communicate with her. That's<br>okay, you are not obligated to.<br><br>But if you haven't made your communication preferences known, how do you<br>expect anyone to abide by them? In other words, *it's difficult to<br>expect someone to do something you haven't told them you want.*<br><br>So tell her that you appreciate her outreach but you really aren't<br>interested in communicating with her any longer, as you've both already<br>moved on.<br><br>If she doesn't stop, block her number.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>**What would you do if an ex workmate (we both women ?) wont let go of<br>the contact. Eg keeps texting. She never wants to meet either and keeps<br>asking what I\'m doing and even went to where my daughter works and<br>asked was she my daughter. hardly know her**<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
