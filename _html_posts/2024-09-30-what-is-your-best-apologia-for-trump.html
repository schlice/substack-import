<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The Supreme Court says that there is no Constitutional right to an<br>abortion. Therefore, whether or not to allow abortions in any given<br>state is up to that state and the people that live in that state.<br><br>So the fact that Florida allows abortions up to six weeks and Texas does<br>not allow abortions at all means that state laws are working as<br>designed.<br><br>Could someone from Texas travel to a state which allowed abortions? Yes.<br>In addition, there are some states which are setting themselves up as<br>abortion *destinations*, with charitable organizations setting up room<br>and board throughout the process. This, too, is working as designed.<br><br>Whether or not remember this from our civics classes, states are<br>*independent*. They can set whatever laws they want within their state,<br>so long as those laws don't violate the state or federal Constitutions.<br><br>It may be confusing, but abortion laws create an ever-changing<br>landscape. But that's by design.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
