<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Is it true that the president \"cannot obstruct justice because he is<br>the chief law enforcement officer\"?**<br><br>No.<br><br>While it is true that the president is the head of the executive branch<br>under Article II of the Constitution, this does not make the president<br>immune from obstruction of justice.<br><br>For example, President Nixon obstructed justice when he destroyed<br>evidence, paid hush money, and instructed people to lie. President<br>Clinton attempted to obstruct justice when he advised potential<br>witnesses to lie.<br><br>I will assume that this question is related to President Trump, and the<br>accusation by [[certain Democrats that he obstructed<br>justice](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=a6ee32&url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2017/12/03/dianne_feinstein_sees_possible_obstruction_of_justice_case_against_trump.html){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="slate.com"}]{.qlink_container} when he fired the director of<br>the FBI.<br><br>In this context, **the President cannot be guilty of obstruction of<br>justice.**<br><br>The President has the Constitutional authority as the head of the<br>executive branch to run that branch as he sees fit, including making<br>personnel decisions (i.e. hiring and firing people), under Article II of<br>the Constitution. Therefore, making a personnel decision consistent with<br>the Constitution *cannot* be a crime.<br><br>If a law contradicts the Constitution, the *law* is unconstitutional,<br>not the Constitution.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
