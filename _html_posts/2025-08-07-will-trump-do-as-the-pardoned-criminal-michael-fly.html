<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Will Trump do, as the pardoned criminal Michael Flynn has demanded,<br>and impose martial law to re-run the election at gun point?**<br><br>First, he's not "demanding" anything, nor is he even suggesting that the<br>President "should" act this way.<br><br>He simply stated that *if he wanted to*, he could impose martial law and<br>send in the military to seize voting machines and essentially "re-run"<br>the election in certain states.<br><br>It's most likely that the President will simply ignore this statement.<br>As the President has surely been informed, not only would such a move be<br>incredibly unwise, it might also be illegal. Invocation of the<br>Insurrection Act only occurs when the fully-constituted military forces<br>of the states cannot quell an insurrection, and the state appeals to the<br>federal government to step in. It does not permit the federal government<br>to send in troops on its own.<br><br>**<br>
