<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>It's funny that most of the answers miss the point.<br><br>As you know, morals are learned. Children start learning morals<br>early, with some research suggesting seeds of morality emerge as early<br>as age 5. However, the ability to fully articulate and understand<br>complex moral themes develops more slowly, possibly around ages 9-12.<br><br>Moral development is a continuous process that evolves throughout<br>childhood and into adulthood.<br><br>But here's the kicker: with *billions* of people all over the earth<br>developing morals *completely independently* and sometimes in remote<br>corners of the world, somehow **stealing is still wrong and is still<br>immoral.** Additionally, rape is wrong everywhere, as is murder. Those<br>are all, universally, wrong.<br><br>*How is that possible?*<br><br>How is it possible that billions of people, all over the world, in<br>vastly different cultures and regions and social norms, have all somehow<br>magically developed this moral code which says that stealing, rape, and<br>murder is wrong? Sure, we know that it is, but why?<br><br>In order for this miraculous feat to be true, ***there must be a<br>standard of morality that applies to all people, and it must be<br>programmed into us at birth.***<br><br>It can't be something learned, because we all grew up differently, in<br>different cultures, in different parts of the world.<br><br>It can't be dictated by society, because same reason: we all grew up in<br>different societies.<br><br>It has to be greater than humanity, and it has to be inbuilt into<br>humanity. This isn't something that can be random. This isn't something<br>that random chemical interactions can produce. It is far too intricate<br>and complex for random mutations to accidentally throw together.<br>Darwin's theory of evolution does not adequately address how this can<br>happen. This is clearly a function of intelligence.<br><br>Therefore, our shared moral code points strongly to the fact that **we<br>have been designed by an intelligent designer.**<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
