<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>> Does Satan have any chance of entering Heaven?<br><br>No. Being angels, they have angelic minds, and thus when they chose to<br>rebel, they did so with the full knowledge of the glory of God. In other<br>words, it was a 100% free choice.<br><br>> **Then why should those who serve Satan or claim to be of satanic<br>> descent have any chance?**<br><br>Because humans have *human minds*, not *angelic minds*. They do not have<br>a full understanding or appreciation of the glory of God, and they have<br>been corrupted by sin. It is for these reasons that humans have the<br>*opportunity* to reject sin and accept God whereas the angels did not.<br><br>> **What would be the consequence of cooperating with someone who<br>> opposes God?**<br><br>Hopefully you convince them to repent and believe. But everyone opposes<br>God in some form or another, because we are all sinful and we have all<br>missed the mark when it comes to God's sovereignty.<br><br>What we have that the angels and demons do not: hope.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
