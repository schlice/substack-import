<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Why is differentiating guns by muzzle velocity not being used in the<br>public gun control debate?**<br><br>Because despite what the media is telling you, there isn't a gun out<br>there that is "less deadly" or "more deadly" because the bullet moves<br>slightly faster or slower.<br><br>All guns are designed to kill. Guns which fire small, subsonic bullets<br>like the .22 or guns which fire faster bullets like a 5.56 will still<br>make the person on the business end of that gun dead. Small bullets make<br>you equally as dead as bigger bullets.<br><br>A .22 can cause death just like a 5.56 can. If your goal is to kill<br>(which is why you use a gun in the first place), why would you not use<br>the most efficient tool available?<br><br>- If your goal is to put a house together, why wouldn't you use a nail<br>  gun instead of a hammer and nails? The nail gun is more efficient.<br>- If your goal is to paint a house, why wouldn't you use a power painter<br>  instead of a brush? The power painter is more efficient.<br>- If your goal is to kill, why wouldn't you use a gun instead of a<br>  spoon? The gun is more efficient.<br><br>The problem in this debate is that people don't find using a nail gun or<br>a power painter distasteful but they find using guns to be distasteful.<br>But that's because they don't realize that in some limited<br>circumstances, using a gun is legally permissible. There are two<br>scenarios in which killing is permissible: self-defense, and resistance<br>to tyranny. The founders of the United States thought that these<br>principles were *so important* that they explicitly prevented the<br>government from ever passing laws to restrict the right to self-defense<br>or resistance to tyranny or any other lawful use with firearms.<br><br>You don't have to personally touch a gun ever, in your lifetime. But<br>that belief cannot infringe on the rights of those who do. And there are<br>tens of millions of gun owners who own hundreds of millions of guns.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
