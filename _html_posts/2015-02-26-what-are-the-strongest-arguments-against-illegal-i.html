<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [*NOTE: This answer specifically addresses people who have<br>entered and/or remained in the United States illegally; in other words,<br>\"illegal aliens.\" There are lots of categories of aliens, but only<br>those who have entered and/or remained in the country illegally are the<br>ones I am discussing in this answer.*\<br>\<br>[[Charlie<br>Fortin](https://www.quora.com/profile/Charlie-Fortin)]{.qlink_container}<br>put a succinct answer together which talks about the pay gap between<br>legal and illegal workers. But I think it\'s best to stick with [[Lucas<br>Karl<br>Hahn](https://www.quora.com/profile/Lucas-Karl-Hahn)]{.qlink_container}\'s<br>point: they are illegal{.underline}.\<br>\<br>Is there any other country in the world that you can go to, squat for a<br>few years, and get all the privileges that any citizen in that country<br>gets? Free healthcare? Free education? Housing assistance? These things<br>really are free for the illegal alien, because they don\'t pay for any<br>of them. They pay sales tax, but that\'s not what pays for education,<br>housing, and healthcare. Your Federal taxes pay for those things.\<br>\<br>By the way, switching from an income-based tax system to a<br>consumption-based tax system would completely close the illegal<br>\"loophole\". Check out<br>[FAIRtax.org(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=58cd5b&url=http://www.fairtax.org){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="fairtax.org"}]{.qlink_container} to get more information.\<br>\<br>If the first thing you do as a new citizen of a new country is to<br>*violate the laws of that new country*, you and I have a problem.\<br>\<br>I think that it\'s a cop-out to say \"but the waits are too long,\" or<br>\"but I\'ll never get in,\" or \"I don\'t want to learn English.\" Those<br>are excuses. Hundreds of thousands of people become naturalized US<br>citizens each and every year, and they do it legally. How must they feel<br>that they\'ve put in the effort, waited the appropriate time, and done<br>what they needed to do to become US citizens and others simply cut a<br>hole in a fence and waltz in to the country without so much as a wave<br>hello, and by the stroke of an executive pen, they magically become<br>citizens. Not cool, bro, not cool.\<br>\<br>{EDIT} [[Josh<br>Smith](https://www.quora.com/profile/Josh-Smith-142)]{.qlink_container}<br>advised me that \"illegal alien\" is redundant, since DHS uses the term<br>\"alien\" to identify someone who is not a US national, not \"illegal<br>alien\":\<br>\<br>]<br><br>> Alien - Any person not a citizen or national of the United States<br><br>\<br>I have edited my post and have changed \"illegal alien\" to simply<br>\"alien.\" Thanks for keeping me honest, Josh.\<br>\<br>{EDIT 2} As [[Victor<br>Eijkhout](https://www.quora.com/profile/Victor-Eijkhout)]{.qlink_container}<br>points out, \"alien\" applies to many different categories of people in<br>the United States who are not citizens, including foreign nationals who<br>are legally present in the country on a work visa. Therefore, \"illegal<br>alien\" is a correct term to indicate someone who is not a citizen or<br>national of the United States, and is in this country illegally (i.e.<br>not in a documented legal status). I edited my answer again. Sheesh<br>people, make up your mind.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
