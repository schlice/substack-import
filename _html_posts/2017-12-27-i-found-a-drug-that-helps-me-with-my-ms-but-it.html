<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Hi Anne, it would be easier to answer your question if we knew what the<br>drug was. In most cases, it's marijuana, and it does help MS patients<br>with neurological pain. On a side note, it is a great reliever of nausea<br>(for patients who take chemo) and it reduces intraocular pressure for<br>patients with cataracts.<br><br>First of all, you can always talk to your neurologist. Even if the drug<br>is illegal, your doctor cannot turn you in to police. The only time a<br>doctor can notify the police about something you told him in confidence<br>is if you indicated that you're going to do something to hurt yourself<br>or others, and drugs doesn't count. Yes, I'm talking about suicide or<br>murder, but beyond that, doctor-patient privilege works both ways. Your<br>doctor might be able to help you find an alternative medication for you<br>(may not work as well, but might still work).<br><br>Again assuming the drug is marijuana, if you're open to the possibility,<br>another option is to move to a state which allows medical marijuana.<br>Since Colorado allows you to have marijuana for any reason (personal use<br>is completely legal here), I would suggest there, but there are many<br>states which now allow medical use, if not recreational use.<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*This answer is not professional medical advice**, nor is it a<br>substitute for professional medical advice. This answer is for GENERAL<br>INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. If you think you are experiencing a medical<br>emergency, call your local emergency number (in the United States, 911)<br>immediately.* *ALWAYS SEEK THE ADVICE OF YOUR DOCTOR* *before<br>starting or changing treatment.*<br><br>*Quora users who provide responses to health-related questions are<br>intended third-party beneficiaries with certain rights under Quora\'s*<br>[[Terms of<br>Service](https://www.quora.com/about/tos)]{.qlink_container}*.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
