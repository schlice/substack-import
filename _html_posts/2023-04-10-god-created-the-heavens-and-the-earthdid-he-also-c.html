<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>> God created the heavens and the earth...did he also create outer space<br>> and aliens if they really exist?<br><br>Yes, and I'll prove it by science, not religion.<br><br>The Big Bang (which nearly everyone agrees created the entire universe)<br>not only created the objects in the universe, *but it created the<br>universe itself.*<br><br>Einstein's Theory of General Relativity relies on a number of<br>calculations, but the premise of those calculations is that **all time,<br>space, and matter began at a single point.**<br><br>This means that not only are the objects in space moving away from the<br>center where the Big Bang happened, *but space is, too.*<br><br>This implies something else: what's out there beyond the edge of the<br>universe? *Nothing*. The universe is expanding at the same time as<br>the objects in the universe are, and there is nothing beyond the edge of<br>the universe.<br><br>Anyway, yes, God created all of it. And if there are other intelligent<br>creatures out there in the universe, then yes He also created them.<br><br>> Do aliens believe in God?<br><br>Hopefully they are advanced enough to understand and believe.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
