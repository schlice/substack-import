<br><br><p>which is supposedly a much greater sin than eating an Apple?"<br>date: "Jul 07, 2025 06:57 AM PDT"<br>tags: "theology"</p><br><hr /><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-355d045771dbb364f93d924d036b5b7a){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-355d045771dbb364f93d924d036b5b7a" master_w="221"<br>master_h="136"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>I thought you commit suicide when you unalive yourself. Last time I<br>checked, Jesus was killed by the religious leaders in Jerusalem. He<br>didn't kill Himself.<br><br>So by definition, it's not suicide.<br><br>He *sacrificed* Himself. And again, last time I checked, that was a<br>*noble* thing to do, not a sin. At worst, He'd be a martyr.<br><br>AND, He came back to life three days later. So did He *really* sacrifice<br>Himself if He came back from the dead? Does it count when you didn't<br>stay dead?<br><br>And eating an apple isn't a sin. By the way, the Bible never says it's<br>an apple, so it's clear you've never read the book. Probably too hard<br>for you, I get it. It's some heady stuff. I'd suggest you try reading<br>*The Message*, which is a Bible translation designed to read like a<br>novel instead of...you know...the Bible.<br><br>off topic...<br><br>Eating an apple isn't a sin. *Disobeying God is a sin.* And yeah,<br>it's a pretty big one. God literally tells you to not do something and<br>you do it anyway. Like God doesn't directly tell you or I things to do<br>or not do, but in this case, God told Adam to not eat the fruit, and he<br>did it anyway. I think that's a pretty big sin, wouldn't you say?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
