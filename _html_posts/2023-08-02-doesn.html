<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Well, yes to the victimhood part, but no to the shirking responsibility<br>part.<br><br>Followers of Christ recognize that they are indeed victims. They are<br>victims of sin. They are born with a sin nature and are sinners by<br>that nature. They cannot escape their sin.<br><br>But they can escape the *consequences*. Jesus took the punishment for<br>our sin on Himself, so that we could be justified and made blameless. So<br>we're taking responsibility for our sin nature by believing in Christ<br>and accepting His gift of salvation.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
