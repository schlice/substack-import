<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>You're talking about two separate things here. Impeachments are<br>political and are handled by the Legislative branch. Indictment for a<br>crime is a legal process and is handled jointly by the Executive and the<br>Judicial branches.<br><br>You're probably thinking that the President could step out of his limo<br>on 5th Avenue in New York city, pull out a gun, shoot a man dead in the<br>street, climb back into his limo\*, and no one can touch him, right?<br>Well, not so fast. If there was such a clearly illegal act committed,<br>the President could be *indicted* for the crime, even though he probably<br>couldn't be arrested. And if that were the case, and Congress refused to<br>impeach him, the statute of limitations would be *tolled* (paused) until<br>such time as the President became eligible for prosecution, which would<br>be the natural end of his term. But if such crime occurred, there would<br>be little doubt that the President would be impeached and removed from<br>office.<br><br>I think the reason that you're not seeing impeachments happen is because<br>"very obvious illegal and corrupt conduct" is not happening. That may be<br>the way *you* see it, but to everyone else, it's not quite so obviously<br>illegal and/or corrupt.<br><br>Finally, impeachments, as noted above, are political. And if the party<br>in power in the House is the same party as the President, they're going<br>to *excuse* quite a bit of errant behavior. In other words, the House<br>will turn a blind eye to a lot of bad behavior simply because the<br>President and the House are part of the same party. Only you can fix<br>that, and you do so at the ballot box.<br><br>\* When Trump said that, he was making the point that he was so<br>well-liked that there wasn't anything he could do to lose support. He<br>said, "I could stand in the middle of 5th Avenue and shoot somebody and<br>I wouldn't lose voters." He wasn't making the claim that he could get<br>away with such a crime, or that the President was immune to prosecution.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Should we repeal the impeachment clause if no one is willing to use it<br>for some very obvious illegal and corrupt conduct? Sould we just now<br>admit the president is above the law and can do anything he wants?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
