<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Let's start by assuming you're talking about your country *wiretapping*<br>your phone and listening to your calls and intercepting your text<br>messages. Since the listening would be taking place *outside* of your<br>physical device, there is nothing you can do to prevent your service<br>provider from listening in on your phone calls.<br><br>The only way you can prevent someone from listening in on your calls<br>while they are in flight is to use a secure phone.<br><br>There are many types of secure phones available. Militaries and<br>government agencies use them to communicate classified material over<br>regular telephone lines. The phones encrypt the voice on the source<br>side, send the encrypted voice to the target side, and decrypt the voice<br>on the target side. They exchange keys at the beginning of the call, and<br>once the two devices have sync'd, they begin encrypting the voice<br>traffic.<br><br>What you can do instead is use<br>[Signal(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=f74393&url=https://signal.org/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="signal.org"}]{.qlink_container}. Signal is an app for your<br>phone<br>([Android(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=c90720&url=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id%3Dorg.thoughtcrime.securesms){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);" qt-tooltip="google.com"}<br>]{.qlink_container}or<br>[iOS(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=df24a1&url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/signal-private-messenger/id874139669){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="apple.com"}]{.qlink_container}). So long as you and the<br>party you've called both are using Signal, calls and texts will be<br>end-to-end encrypted (from your handset to the called party's handset).<br>Best part: Signal is free and open-source. Signal doesn't integrate<br>tightly into iOS because of Apple restrictions, you have to use it as a<br>standalone app. But in Android, Signal integrates with Android, and if<br>the party you are calling also has Signal installed, it automatically<br>asks if you want the call to be secure. Text messages using the Messages<br>app works the same way.<br><br>If instead you were talking about your country hacking your phone and<br>enabling the microphone and camera to listen to you when you're not on<br>the phone, try this little piece of awesome:<br><br>[[**Anti-radiation Bag - Anti-tracking Pouch, EMF Protection for<br>Phone**](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=e14a2d&url=https://www.amazon.com/Anti-radiation-Anti-tracking-Protection-Anti-spying-Function/dp/B074ZCHWGY/ref%3Dsr_1_2_sspa?ie%3DUTF8%26qid%3D1506463495%26sr%3D8-2-spons%26keywords%3Dcell%2Bphone%2Bpouch%2Banti%2Bsignal%26psc%3D1){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="amazon.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>The cool thing about this phone pouch is that once you slip it into that<br>pouch, no signals will get in or out. No one can hack your phone and<br>even if they did, they can't connect to your microphone or your camera,<br>and they won't be able to spy on you.<br><br>Of course, putting the phone in this pouch means that you won't get any<br>calls or texts, either. You would have to consciously take the phone<br>out, let it connect and update, and then when you're done, put it back.<br>Just know while the phone is in the pouch, you're out of touch too.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
