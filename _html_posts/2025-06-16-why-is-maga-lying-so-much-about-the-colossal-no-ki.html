<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>> **Why is MAGA lying so much about the colossal No Kings protests being<br>> a flop**<br><br>You're right. They're totally lying. The protests paid off! They didn't<br>want Trump to become a king. And when I woke up this morning, I found<br>that Trump is still not a king.<br><br>So...job well done, protesters! You succeeded! Trump is still not a<br>king!<br><br>> **when Orange Hitler\'s military jerk-off parade was a humiliating<br>> sparcely populated disaster full of old creaky tanks and disillusioned<br>> soldiers?**<br><br>So you can probably see by my credential that I'm going to take personal<br>offense at that.<br><br>I'm not going to address your remarks other than to say the entire<br>purpose of the military is to create and maintain a country where you<br>don't get arrested by Gestapo troops and beheaded in a quiet corner of<br>the middle of nowhere for actually posting what you did.<br><br>So count yourself lucky that the military exists, because if they<br>didn't, your freedom wouldn't either.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
