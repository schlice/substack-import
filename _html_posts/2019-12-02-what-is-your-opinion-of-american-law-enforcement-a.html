It's not the state's job to be<br>the arbiter of US citizenship. That's a Federal government function; the<br>Courts have said as much.<br><br>American law enforcement agencies *meaning Federal law enforcement<br>agents like the FBI or DHS* can and should ask for proof of<br>citizenship, if it is reasonably in question, especially if citizenship<br>is at issue in whatever they are doing.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
