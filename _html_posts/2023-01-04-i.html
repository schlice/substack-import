<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>*Be sure to check the Disclaimer at the bottom of this answer.*<br><br>The answer, as with all legal answers, is "it depends." And primarily it<br>depends on the evidence the petitioner has against you.<br><br>You will get this evidence by submitting a "request for production of<br>evidence," which is part of pre-trial discovery. The petitioner will<br>have to turn over copies of the evidence they have which proves that it<br>was your dog entering their property and attacking their dog.<br><br>Once you see their evidence, you can mount a defense against it. If they<br>claim that, for example, there is a hole under the fence that allows<br>your dog access, you could measure the hole and show that your dog<br>cannot possibly fit through that hole.<br><br>You could also submit your own affirmative defenses, such as showing the<br>area your dog is confined to while he or she is outside, showing that<br>the boundaries of that area are not permeable enough to allow your dog<br>to escape, using testimony to explain that your dog is never off-leash<br>outside, etc.<br><br>Good luck.<br><br>\<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*This answer is not a substitute for professional legal advice or a<br>solicitation to offer legal advice regarding specific facts.
