<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Is there any recourse for a homeowners association (HOA) that requires<br>80% \"yes\" votes to change anything in the covenants, but can\'t even<br>get 80% of the homeowners to cast a vote?**<br><br>It's not the HOA that requires signatures of 80% of homeowners in order<br>to change the covenants, it's part of city ordinances. It is your city<br>which requires 80% of the homeowners to concur to a change to the<br>covenants on file, because it's part of city charter. Covenants get<br>incorporated into city charter, and so it requires a majority of<br>homeowners to change them. Each city and state is different, and not all<br>of them require 80% concurrence. Some require 75% concurrence, and<br>others require 100% concurrence.<br><br>It's up to the HOA to get out and solicit signatures. We had to go door<br>to door in our neighborhood to get required signatures. Granted, we only<br>have 130 homes, so it wasn't too difficult to get the remaining<br>signatures which didn't come in by mail. But it's the job of the HOA<br>Board to get out and get those votes, or assemble a committee to do it.<br><br>That raises a good point: check your city charter and see if you can<br>solicit votes by mail. This may be an easy way to collect votes from<br>your homeowners if you're allowed to do it.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
