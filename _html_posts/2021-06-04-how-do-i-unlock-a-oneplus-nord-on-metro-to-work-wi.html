<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>This should work for either the Nord N100 or the Nord N10 5G on Metro by<br>T-Mobile.<br><br>First of all, Metro's requirements for unlocking phones for free:<br><br>- The device must be purchased from Metro by T-Mobile.<br>- The device must not be reported as lost, stolen or blocked.<br>- One hundred eighty (180) days must have passed since the device's<br>  activation date.<br><br>If the above are true, Metro will automatically unlock your device for<br>you within two business days of all of the above requirements being met,<br>assuming the device supports remote unlock. Once they do, If the device<br>does not support remote unlock, Metro will send you a text notifying you<br>that the device is eligible to be unlocked and provide you with<br>instructions to complete the unlock.<br><br>If you want to unlock your device before the 180 days are up, or if the<br>device was not originally purchased from Metro, or some other condition<br>prevents you from remotely unlocking your device with Metro's<br>permission, you won't be able to unlock the device for free. In that<br>case, the steps to follow are:<br><br>1.  Open the Phone app on your Nord.<br>2.  Dial \*#060# in order to get your device's IMEI number.<br>3.  Write the number down on a piece of paper or somewhere else so it<br>    can be referenced later.<br>4.  Visit the [[MetroPCS Device<br>    Unlock](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=b8e703&url=http://www.androidsimunlock.com/phone-unlocking-service/metropcs-device-unlock-app-official-unlock/){.external_link<br>    rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>    onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>    qt-tooltip="androidsimunlock.com"}]{.qlink_container} service and<br>    select your phone.<br>5.  Enter your phone's IMEI number and complete the checkout process<br>6.  You might have to wait a bit, but you will receive an email upon<br>    confirmation that your phone has been successfully unlocked<br>7.  Insert a non-Metro SIM card<br>8.  Use the Device Unlock app or Unlock app pre-installed on your device<br>    and follow instructions on-screen. Select "Permanent Unlock"<br>9.  If successful, you should see a message saying "Unlock Approved:<br>    Mobile device is permanently unlocked"<br><br>If you have any trouble with this, contact Metro at 888-863-8768. You<br>may need to contact them if:<br><br>- You do not see the apps or settings listed for your device. You may<br>  need a PIN code for unlock, which Metro's Care team can provide.<br>- You meet the eligibility requirements but cannot unlock your device.<br>- You have a device not listed above.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>How do I unlock a OnePlus Nord on Metro to work with any carrier step by<br>step?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
