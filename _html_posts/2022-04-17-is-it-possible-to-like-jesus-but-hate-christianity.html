<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>It depends on what about "Christianity" you "hate." Personally, I don't<br>like "Christian sects."<br><br>I get that the Christian sects are not all that attractive. It just<br>smacks of division within the house of God. Seventh-Day Adventists don't<br>believe like Methodists. Catholics don't believe like Episcopalians. But<br>somehow, we all believe in Jesus and the central message of the Bible?<br>Makes no sense to me.<br><br>There's a lot to dislike about modern-day Christian churches.<br><br>I would suggest you search for a **non-denominational Bible-based church<br>in your area** and take a Sunday to go visit. I bet you'll find that all<br>the unpleasantness you found in "Christianity" is gone.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Is it possible to like Jesus but hate Christianity?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
