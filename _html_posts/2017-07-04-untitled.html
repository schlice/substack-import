<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>And after all that work:<br><br>- The rate of homicides continued to decline at exactly the same rate as<br>  before. There was absolutely no effect to the overall rate of gun<br>  homicides.<br>- There were no *gun* massacres, but there were plenty of *arsons*<br>  though, the new favorite tool of the criminal element. A few lengths<br>  of chain, a few padlocks, and a whole bunch of gasoline and, as the<br>  arsonists found out, you could easily put Port Arthur to shame.<br>  Additionally, the whole "there were no gun massacres" thing is pretty<br>  disingenuous. From<br>  [Wikipedia(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=44de96&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_laws_in_Australia){.external_link<br>  rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>  onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>  qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}, "a 2016 study using<br>  data from the Australian National Injury Surveillance Unit reported<br>  that there were no mass firearm killings following the 1996 gun law<br>  reforms through May 2016. They also reported a more rapid decline in<br>  firearm deaths between 1997 and 2013 compared with between 1979 and<br>  1997, but there was also a decline in total non-firearm suicide and<br>  homicide deaths of a greater magnitude. Because of this, the<br>  investigators concluded it was not possible to conclude with any<br>  certainty that the change in firearm deaths could be attributed to the<br>  gun law reforms"<br>- The government expended *billions* of dollars and, as you rightly<br>  stated, there are still black market guns, and you're back to about<br>  the same number of guns you had before. Regulations or not, they are<br>  just as lethal. And criminals still have a thriving black market to<br>  choose from.<br>- Plus, you neglected to mention, there now exists a comfortable **gray<br>  market** of guns which were never turned in during the confiscation<br>  period. Indeed, many of the guns which were turned in were rusty old<br>  hunks of metal or old collector's pieces. There are still several<br>  hundred thousand gray market guns.<br><br>Maybe the gun laws reduced mass shootings, but did they at least reduce<br>gun-related *homicides*? That is hotly disputed. University of<br>Melbourne researchers Wang-Sheng Lee and Sandy Suardi wrote a report in<br>[[2008 on this<br>issue.](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=6a1476&url=http://www.nationalreview.com/article/425021/australias-1996-gun-confiscation-didnt-work-and-it-wouldnt-work-america-mark-antonio){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);" qt-tooltip="nationalreview.com"}<br>]{.qlink_container}The closing statement in that report: "There is<br>little evidence to suggest that \[the Australian mandatory gun-buyback<br>program\] had any significant effects on firearm homicides...Although<br>gun buybacks appear to be a logical and sensible policy that helps to<br>placate the public's fears, the evidence so far suggests that in the<br>Australian context, the high expenditure incurred to fund the 1996 gun<br>buyback has not translated into any tangible reductions in terms of<br>firearm deaths."<br><br>So I submit that of everything you said, your last statement is the most<br>accurate: *There are still black market guns to be had by the<br>professional criminal. But the gun culture has changed.*<br><br>I submit to you: is changing a nation's culture worth the cost? I<br>believe you need to see some more tangible results before spending<br>billions of dollars to literally accomplish nothing more than to change<br>a nation's culture.<br><br>Thank you, but unless you're able to show *real benefit*, I think<br>we'll pass.<br><br>And sorry for spoiling the whole Australia secret you had going there.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/If-the-US-passed-gun-control-laws-confiscating-150-million-guns-how-would-these-guns-be-found-and-removed-and-what-compensation-would-be-offered-to-owners-for-the-loss-of-what-had-once-been-legally-owned-property/answer/Richard-Farnsworth<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
