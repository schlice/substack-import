<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: [Have you not read the Constitution?\<br>\<br>\"\...the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be<br>infringed.\"\<br>\<br>There is no \"off-limits\" for civilians using firearms. Your arguments<br>are not relevant, since all of the things you quoted are privileges, not<br>rights. Car ownership is not regulated; *driving* a car on public roads<br>is a heavily-regulated privilege granted by the state. Even with all<br>that regulation, cars still kill more people than guns. Interesting\...\<br>\<br>Since gun ownership is a protected right, it cannot be similarly<br>restricted.\<br>\<br>Also, in order to *conceal* a firearm, you have to get training. Note<br>that open carry does not require any licensing at all.\<br>\<br>You\'ll be comforted to know that your over-confident friend, if he<br>lives in an open-carry area, decides to open-carry without any training,<br>he probably won\'t have time to use his weapon, as he\'ll be one of the<br>first targets.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/How-realistic-is-the-average-gun-rights-enthusiast-about-their-ability-to-use-their-firearm-for-self-defense-home-protection-without-being-a-danger-to-themselves-or-bystanders/answer/Bill-Stein<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
