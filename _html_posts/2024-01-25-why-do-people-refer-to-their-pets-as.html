<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>> Why do people refer to their pets as \"service animals\" now?<br><br>People refer to their pets as service animals because they think it will<br>allow them to take their pets into public places where pets are normally<br>not allowed. They are not disallowed from those places because the<br>owners hate pets. Sometimes, they are disallowed for health code<br>reasons, and other times it's because they are disruptive and a<br>distraction.<br><br>A service animal is specially trained to perform a task related to a<br>qualifying disability. Business owners are allowed to ask if they animal<br>is trained to perform a task related to a qualifying disability, and<br>what that task they are trained to perform is. Beyond those two<br>questions, business owners cannot ask about the disability, or cannot<br>require the owner to show paperwork, the animal doesn't need special<br>clothing (i.e. a vest), etc. If the person refuses to say whether or not<br>the animal is trained and what they are trained to do, the owner can ask<br>the person and the animal to leave.<br><br>> **Is it legal for any animal to be certified as a service animal by<br>> the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)?**<br><br>No. What they are trying to do is pass of Emotional Support Animals<br>(ESAs) as service animals. Service animals are specially trained to<br>perform specific tasks to assist a person with a disability. Service<br>animals have full public access rights, which means they can go places<br>other animals can\'t. For example, they can go into restaurants, stores,<br>libraries, and other public places. They can also go on airplanes and<br>other public transportation.<br><br>ESAs provide companionship and emotional support, but they aren\'t<br>required to perform specific tasks. They are covered under the Fair<br>Housing Act, but hotels aren\'t subject to this act. But as I mentioned<br>above, unless your state has special protections for ESAs, they don\'t<br>have the same protections as service animals. They can be excluded by<br>businesses.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
