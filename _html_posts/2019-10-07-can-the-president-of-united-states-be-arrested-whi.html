<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Can the President of United States be arrested while in charge?<br><br>Practically, no the President cannot be arrested while in office. He is<br>surrounded by Secret Service and is under surveillance 24x7. It would be<br>a tremendous challenge to arrest the President.<br><br>Constitutionally, it's much more clear that the President cannot be<br>arrested. Article II, Section 1 of the Constitution is very clear: "The<br>executive power shall be vested in a President of the United States of<br>America." This means that the President *is* the Executive.<br>Not the President and the Vice President. Not the President and the<br>Attorney General. Not the President and the Director of the FBI. The<br>President only.<br><br>This was a deliberate decision on the part of the Framers, and it was<br>done in part to balance the Executive and check the power of the<br>Judiciary and the Legislature.<br><br>To that end, all Executive authority flows from the President. The<br>authority of any prosecutor to issue an indictment, the power of any<br>sheriff to attempt an arrest, all flows directly from the power of the<br>executive, which is exclusively vested in the President. It's the same<br>reason that a deputy cannot arrest the sheriff: it's the sheriff who<br>deputized the deputy. He could instantly revoke that deputization, and<br>the deputy would have no authority.<br><br>Therefore, the President cannot be indicted or arrested while in office<br>for several reasons:<br><br>1.  The President *is* the source for all executive authority. Since he<br>    granted the authority, it is plainly obvious that he will not allow<br>    himself to be indicted while in office.<br>2.  Arresting the President would have serious functional ramifications<br>    on the government. In order to maintain smooth functioning of the<br>    government, you cannot remove a key officer of the government and<br>    expect it to continue to run smoothly.<br><br>So does this mean the President is above the law? Of course not. The<br>Constitution included a provision to deal with Presidential lawlessness:<br>*impeachment*. You can impeach a president and remove him from office,<br>and then you can feel free to indict and/or arrest him.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
