You can't sell your home *if you use a Realtor* without paying<br>commission. But if you use a Realtor, that person is going to want to be<br>paid. So assuming that you're paying 6% commission, you are selling a<br>\$1.5 million house. In order to effectively market your home and get<br>the highest possible offer, you're going to want to *list it for sale on<br>the Multiple Listing Service (MLS)*. This is a database of all homes for<br>sale in the United States. The MLS is a product of the National<br>Association of Realtors. Listing your house, marketing your house<br>properly, getting the word out about your house, making sure the<br>showings are taken care of, are *services* which get paid for out of the<br>sale of your house, when you use a Realtor.<br><br>> Can\'t I just trade my home with someone from the area I want to live<br>> at bypassing the middleman?<br><br>Of course! Instead of using a Realtor and listing your house on the MLS,<br>you can just stick a sign on the lawn that says "For Sale By Owner" and<br>then sign a contract with someone who can pay for your house.<br><br>> Someone should start a business called hometrading .com<br><br>Sure! Except the people who run that website will need to pay their<br>programmers and pay for the website and all of that stuff and they're<br>going to want to get paid somehow.<br><br>Or you can use the growing list of non-MLS listing services which<br>already exist. Some examples (there are more than this, try Google):<br><br>- [[Rocket<br>  Homes](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=cb3b2a&url=https://www.rockethomes.com/){.external_link<br>  rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>  onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>  qt-tooltip="rockethomes.com"}]{.qlink_container}, from the same people<br>  who brought you Rocket Mortgage<br>- [Offerpad(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=d2f0b4&url=https://www.offerpad.com/){.external_link<br>  rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>  onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>  qt-tooltip="offerpad.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>Or sell your home to the growing list of "all-cash" buyers. Some<br>examples (there are more than this, Google is your friend):<br><br>- [HomeLight(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=005525&url=https://www.homelight.com/simple-sale/quiz%23/qaas%3D0/){.external_link<br>  rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>  onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>  qt-tooltip="homelight.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br>- [Opendoor(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=fba828&url=https://www.opendoor.com/){.external_link<br>  rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>  onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>  qt-tooltip="opendoor.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>I cannot sell my home without paying \$90,000 commission. Can\'t I just<br>trade my home with someone from the area I want to live at bypassing the<br>middleman?
