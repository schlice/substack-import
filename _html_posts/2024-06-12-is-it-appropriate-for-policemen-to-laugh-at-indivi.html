<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Appropriateness is a personal judgement call, and is also situational.<br>Some people may think it is appropriate while others do not, and there's<br>no right or wrong answer there. All we can really discuss is whether or<br>not it is prohibited by either department policy or by law. And in<br>general, it is not prohibited by either law or department policy in most<br>cases.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
