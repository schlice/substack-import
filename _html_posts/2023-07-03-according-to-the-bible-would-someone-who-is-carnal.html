<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The short and surprising answer is **yes, Beavis and Butt-Head would be<br>able to make it into Heaven**.<br><br>But just like everyone else, they would need to do the needful:<br>repent and believe.<br><br>They would have to repent from their carnally-minded ways. This<br>means they'd have to *turn away* from sin, and stop doing<br>self-destructive things. They'd have to stop doing *literally whatever<br>pops into their heads at that very moment*. That's the perfect<br>illustration of someone who fulfills the desires of the flesh. If they<br>think of it, they do it, no matter how idiotic it may seem. They'd have<br>to repent of that, and be sorry for what they have done.<br><br>Then, they'd have to believe that Christ died for their sins. Knowing<br>what they did which was in controversion to God's will, they'd have to<br>believe that there was One who came and died to be the penal<br>substitution for them. They'd have to know that He died for them. They<br>would have to accept Him as their Lord and Savior.<br><br>Clearly, that would be bad for MTV, because they wouldn't really be<br>Beavis and Butt-Head any more, and the show would get kinda boring.<br><br>But it would be good for them and their eternal destiny, would it not?<br><br>This thought question often comes up which illustrates this point:<br><br>**Would Hitler be in Heaven if he truly repented on his deathbed and<br>believed in the salvific power of Christ?**<br><br>Would you be surprised if you heard that the answer was yes? There<br>is no one whose deeds are *so bad* that they cannot be forgiven, if they<br>repent and believe.<br><br>Remember though, this doesn't mean that we live our lives in sin,<br>*knowing* that we can repent on our deathbeds. That's not how this<br>works. If you know about God and His plan for us, and you *knowingly<br>live otherwise, claiming that you'll just apologize later*, that is not<br>living as a saved person would live. Saved people do not make bargains<br>with God so that they can continue to live in sin.<br><br>\<br><br>TL;DR: While it would ruin the show, Beavis and Butt-Head could indeed<br>go to Heaven if they repent and believe, just like anyone else.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
