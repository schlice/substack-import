<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Short answer: no.<br><br>Longer answer: There is no legal \"duty to assist\" in the United<br>States. I believe one or two states may have a law requiring<br>notification of authorities if you witness a crime (and even those are<br>rarely, if ever, enforced), but beyond that, there is no affirmative<br>legal duty to render aid.<br><br>Most states do have some form of \"Good Samaritan\" clause which<br>releases the untrained bystander from any civil or criminal liability if<br>they do choose to render assistance and something goes horribly wrong.<br>The statutes are supposed to encourage more people to assist in a<br>crisis. I\'m not sure of their effectiveness.<br><br>Your decision to render aid is a personal one, and there is no<br>requirement under the law to do so.<br><br>The only way you can be held responsible in any case is if you are a<br>medical professional. In many states, medical professionals are under<br>some form of legal obligation to assist in an emergency involving their<br>medical profession, and failure to act can potentially be a cause for<br>civil action, if not criminal liability.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
