<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>> **My Samsung Galaxy J5 has been screen-locked by my younger brother.<br>> He downloaded a lock screen app on CH-Play, set a password and<br>> doesn\'t remember it. How can I delete the app and get my phone back<br>> to normal?**<br><br>You will need to boot into recovery mode and wipe your phone. Please<br>follow [[this<br>guide](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=62d288&url=https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/use-recovery-mode-android/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="digitaltrends.com"}]{.qlink_container} to boot your device<br>into recovery mode. You will then select the Wipe Data/Factory Reset<br>option from the recovery menu. Use the volume up/volume down buttons to<br>move to the option, and press the power button to select.<br><br>***PLEASE NOTE: Doing this will wipe all of your programs and data, and<br>will return the device to factory new settings. You will have to restore<br>your settings from your last Google backup and your apps will need to be<br>re-installed (this will happen when you log back in to your Google<br>account). The third-party app will NOT be re-installed.***<br><br>***AGAIN: THIS IS A DATA DESTRUCTIVE OPERATION! YOUR DEVICE WILL BE<br>WIPED WHEN YOU DO THIS!***<br><br>Okay, now that the big warnings are done, understand that this will wipe<br>and re-install your device from the recovery partition. You will need to<br>log back in to your Google account when you re-start the initialization<br>process because of FRP (Factory Reset Protection), so be aware of that.<br>When you re-initialize the phone, it will ask you to restore from a<br>recent Google backup, so your apps and settings will be restored. Any<br>personal data you had on the device *may not* have been backed up in<br>either your Google or Samsung accounts, so be prepared for that.<br><br>Good luck!<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
