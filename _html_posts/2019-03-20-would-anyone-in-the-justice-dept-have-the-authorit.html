The only<br>reason they would do this is to see if charges are warranted. However,<br>it's fairly Constitutionally certain that you can't indict a sitting<br>president, so the purpose of such a grand jury is dubious at best. Yes,<br>I know, no one has ever tried to indict a sitting president, but if you<br>look at it from a Constitutional standpoint, then it's highly likely<br>that you cannot indict a sitting president.<br><br>So let's assume for a moment that the Special Counsel's office *does*<br>convene a grand jury, and they file an indictment. Trump's attorneys<br>would most definitely object to the indictment, stating that a sitting<br>president cannot be indicted, and must have a Constitutional remedy<br>applied (impeachment, removal from office, etc). The Justice Department<br>is not really in the loop if the Special Counsel's office convenes a<br>grand jury, and they indict.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
