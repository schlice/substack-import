<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Of course guns are a common denominator! Gun crimes necessarily<br>involve guns. It's in the name.<br><br>Just the same:<br><br>> 13,384 people died in alcohol-related impaired driving accidents last<br>> year. Do you see that cars are the common denominator in all of these<br>> deaths?<br><br>and<br><br>> Approximately 1500 people were murdered with knives last year. Do you<br>> see that knives are the common denominator in all these deaths?<br><br>\<br><br>But you are making the logical leap that because there is a<br>*correlation* between the killings, the object which is related is<br>the *cause.* This is a logical fallacy, also known as the [["false<br>cause"<br>fallacy](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=22885e&url=https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/false-cause){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="yourlogicalfallacyis.com"}]{.qlink_container}. Just because<br>there is a correlation between events does not mean that the events are<br>caused by the matching criteria. Just as the car did not cause the drunk<br>driving deaths and the knives did not cause the murders, the gun did not<br>cause the killings. It was the *instrument* of the killing, but it was<br>not the *cause* of the killing. It was common among all the killings,<br>but it did was not the *cause* of the deaths. A person with the will to<br>take a life is what caused the death.<br><br>Focusing on the instrument will not change the course of the killer.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
