<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Is it illegal to take away my mentally ill brother's gun?<br><br>Yes. This is called *theft*.<br><br>You may have a *justification* for your actions (namely that your<br>brother is "mentally ill"). But if your brother is mentally ill to the<br>point where firearms possession is unlawful, then you can engage the<br>police to take his guns. You would rather have his guns seized than have<br>him hurt himself or others, right?<br><br>Now, if he has never been determined by a court to be a "mental<br>defective," then he is not so mentally ill as to be unable to possess a<br>firearm. He may be dangerous, but not an unlawful gun owner. Taking his<br>guns at this point would have no justification whatsoever, and you could<br>be rightly arrested for theft.<br><br>You may think you're doing the right thing, but you didn't ask if it was<br>the right thing. You asked if it was illegal.<br><br>If you want it to be legal, he would have to be declared "mentally<br>defective" by a court.<br><br>(EDIT) Some states have enacted so-called "Red Flag Laws" which allow<br>you to make a report to the government that your brother is a danger to<br>himself and others, and *with that report alone*, the police can seize<br>his guns. He would then have to argue that he is *capable of having his<br>property returned to him*, which often takes a long period of time. We<br>can argue the Constitutionality (or lack thereof) of these laws, but<br>until the courts rule them to be unconstitutional, some states have<br>them, and you can use them to protect your mentally ill brother until<br>they are overturned in court. If your state has "Red Flag Laws," you<br>should investigate how to petition to have someone's guns removed.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
