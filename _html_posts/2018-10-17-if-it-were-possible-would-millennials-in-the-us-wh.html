<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If it were possible, would millennials in the US who can\'t find<br>employment volunteer to serve on juries for compensation?**<br><br>It's not possible.<br><br>Jury duty is not employment. Serving on a jury is one of those civic<br>duties you have as part of being a citizen of a state.<br><br>Creating a class of "professional jurors" removes that civic<br>responsibility from jury duty, and makes it "just a job."<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
