<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I'm pretty sure that anyone with average intelligence understands the<br>fact that if you have no gun, you can't shoot someone.<br><br>You forgot to add the sentence you're implying. **So therefore, you<br>should own no gun either, then no one can shoot anyone**.<br><br>A pleasant thought, but criminals don't give a damn what you think.<br>Therefore, the only person who will actually own a gun is a criminal.<br>And he'll kill you and walk away scot-free.<br><br>See the problem? You've voluntarily disarmed yourself (perfectly<br>allowed), *but then you've insisted that I do the same* (perfectly<br>disallowed). And none of your "understanding" has any bearing whatsoever<br>on criminals, who by definition don't follow the law. So even if you<br>made owning guns illegal, they still will own guns. And then they'll be<br>the only ones with guns.<br><br>I got an idea! Why don't you make killing people illegal? Then no one<br>can kill anyone, either.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
