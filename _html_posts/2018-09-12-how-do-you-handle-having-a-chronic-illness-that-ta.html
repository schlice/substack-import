While I use traditional MS therapy drugs, I also utilize<br>    complementary and alternative medicines. I see a naturalist and use<br>    supplements to aid in some of the side effects of my medication.<br>    Don't be afraid to use alternative medicines, but I would caution<br>    you in doing so *exclusively*. Pursuing alternative medicines *while<br>    ignoring traditional MS therapy drugs* is dangerous, and I highly<br>    doubt that your doctor would agree to you doing so. Diet, exercise,<br>    complementary and alternative treatments, as well as an approved MS<br>    therapy drug, offers you the *best* chance for managing symptoms and<br>    slowing the progression of the disease.<br>2.  A diagnosis of any chronic disease is depressing. MS is probably<br>    even more so, knowing that the future is so *uncertain*. At least<br>    with some diseases or conditions, the future is well known. MS<br>    removes a great deal of certainty about your future health. MS just<br>    assures us that our future *will* be uncertain, and that's really<br>    unsettling. However, if we're honest with ourselves, *we never<br>    really had any true certainty about our future health, even without<br>    MS, did we?* Something could have changed in an instant, and the<br>    course of our lives could have been irrevocably altered. We never<br>    really had any certainty about our future. What we *did* have was<br>    *control*. At least to some degree, we had control over our future<br>    health. We could eat right. We could exercise. We could avoid doing<br>    things which put our health at risk. However, even with MS, all hope<br>    is *not* lost. We know that we can slow the progression of the<br>    disease and minimize its impact, so we know that we have, at least,<br>    a modicum of control over this disease, and like the rest of our<br>    health, that's comforting. I don't know which form of the disease<br>    you have, but assuming you have a relapsing form of the disease,<br>    take comfort in the fact that you *can* do something to help slow<br>    the disease progression and lessen its impacts. You are not doomed<br>    to your fate; you can be proactive in your approach to disease<br>    management, and there can indeed be some comfort in that.<br>3.  If you don't have a care team who will work *with* you instead of<br>    *directing* you, get one. Your neurologist should work with you to<br>    tailor a treatment program that both slows down the disease course<br>    while working with your needs and provides you with whatever<br>    ancillary treatments you may need. My care team includes a primary<br>    care provider who works very closely with my neurologist, a<br>    naturalist who handles both chiropractic and nutrition/supplements,<br>    and a massage therapist. I bring in other specialists as needed<br>    (i.e. a gastroenterologist). But my care team works very well<br>    together and they lean on each other, utilizing their strengths. And<br>    they don't just *prescribe*. They *listen*. I was on a drug that was<br>    negatively interacting with another drug I was taking at the time<br>    for, you guessed it, depression. Now, the MS drug was not indicated<br>    to react in the way that it did, but there you are. I couldn't come<br>    off of the depression medication at the time, and my neurologist<br>    didn't want me to come off of the MS drug just because of that, but<br>    when I told him how much my quality of life was suffering, he agreed<br>    that we should change my MS drug. While the efficacy of the new drug<br>    is lower, it completely reversed the side effect I was experiencing<br>    because of the undocumented drug-drug reaction. That's what a care<br>    team *listening* to you looks like.<br><br>I've always said that if there is any time in history to get MS, this is<br>it. We've made greater strides in the last 20 years in MS research than<br>we've made in more than 100 years (yes, MS has been around that long:<br>drawings from autopsies done as early as 1838 show what we now know as<br>MS). I take comfort in that, and you can too.<br><br>Remember: MS is *life-altering*; it is not *life-ending*. You still have<br>a purpose. Don't abandon it over something like MS.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
