<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Why do we ask God \"why\"?<br><br>Because we don't fully understand.<br><br>If you've ever been a parent, or if you've ever been a child who had a<br>parent, you've probably experienced that phase in life where that child<br>asks "why" to everything you say. It might be cute. Initially. It might<br>get annoying. Eventually. But it is borne out of the same need to<br>understand.<br><br>We want to know.<br><br>And in the case of God, in most cases, we simply can't. Our brains are<br>just incapable of comprehending the majesty of God.<br><br>And on top of that, our God is a secretive God.<br><br>- \"It is the glory of God to conceal a matter\...\" (Proverbs 25:2)<br>- \"Truly you are a God who hides Himself.\" (Isaiah 45:15)<br>- \"No one knows the thought of God except the Spirit of God.\" (1 Cor<br>  2:11)<br>- \"The secret things belong to the Lord our God\" (Deuteronomy 29:29)<br>- \"As you do not know the path of the wind, or how the body is formed<br>  in the mother\'s womb, so you cannot understand the work of God, the<br>  Maker of all things.\" (Ecclesiastes 11:5)<br>- \"\'For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways My<br>  ways,\' declares the Lord. \'As the heavens are higher than the earth,<br>  so are My ways higher than your ways and My thoughts than your<br>  thoughts.\" (Isaiah 55:8-9)<br><br>Clearly, Scripture tells us that we don\'t have the capacity to<br>understand God\'s mind or how He intervenes in our lives. Romans 11:33<br>says that God\'s judgments are \"unsearchable\" and His ways are \"past<br>finding out.\" 1 Cor 2:16 says, \"Who has known the mind of the Lord<br>that he may instruct Him?\" Unless God chooses to reveal His plan to us<br>(which rarely happens), his motivations and purposes will probably<br>remain out of reach.<br><br>This means that for all practical purposes, we will likely never know<br>\"why\" until we see Him face-to-face. 1 Cor 13:12 says, \"Now we see<br>but a poor reflection; then we shall see face to face. Now I know in<br>part; then I shall know fully, even as I am fully known.\"<br><br>God has a wonderful plan for you. Fine print: you won\'t always be able<br>to comprehend this plan, and even if you do, you may not approve of it.<br>It may mean living with an incurable disease. Or living in a wheelchair.<br>Or dying.<br><br>But tough times are nothing new. All the biblical writers, even the<br>giants of the faith, went through tough times. Look at Joseph. Hated by<br>his brothers, sold into slavery, imprisoned, falsely accused of<br>attempted rape, threatened with execution. There was no indication that<br>God had explained to Joseph all of the reasons why he had to go through<br>all of that, or what would eventually be done with his life. He was<br>expected, as you and I are, to live out his life one day at a time in<br>something less than complete understanding. **What pleased God was<br>Joseph\'s faithfulness *when nothing made sense.***<br><br>We know that life won\'t be smooth sailing. Where did we ever get the<br>idea that it would be? Christians (and non-Christians alike) have this<br>belief that God will skip along in front of us with his giant cosmic<br>broom, sweeping away all of our troubles and concerns, and when that<br>doesn't happen, we are sad and disillusioned. Where did anyone ever<br>learn that it would be like that? Certainly not from the Bible. Jesus<br>told His followers to anticipate suffering. \"I have told you these<br>things, so that in me you may have peace. In this world, you will have<br>trouble. But take heart! I have overcome the world.\" (John 16:33). Paul<br>wrote, \"In all our troubles my joy knows no bounds. For when we came<br>into Macedonia, this body of ours had no rest, but we were harassed at<br>every turn\--conflicts on the outside, fears within\" (2 Cor 7:4-5).<br>Peter said, \"Dear friends, do not be surprised at the painful trial you<br>are suffering, as though something strange were happening to you. But<br>rejoice that you participate in the suffering of Christ, so that you may<br>be overjoyed when His glory is revealed\" (1 Peter 4:12-13).<br><br>Does this mean we\'re always going to suffer? Paul said we are \"more<br>than conquerors.\" He wrote in Philippians 4:4-7, \"Rejoice in the Lord<br>always. I will say it again: Rejoice! Let your gentleness be evident to<br>all. The Lord is near. Do not be anxious about anything,but in every<br>situation, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your<br>requests to God. And the peace of God, which transcends all<br>understanding,will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.\"<br><br>There appears to exist this great paradox where we are told to expect<br>suffering and hardship, but we are encouraged to be joyful, thankful,<br>and \"of good cheer.\" How can we be joyful in the face of hardship? How<br>can we be secure when we are surrounded by insecurity? How can we be<br>happy when we don't know why?<br><br>Trust God.<br><br>Scripture tells us to \"\t\rust in the Lord; lean not on your own<br>understanding.\" (Prov 3:5) Dr. James Dobson says that \"leaning\" is<br>that demand for answers \-- \"throwing faith to the wind if a<br>satisfactory response cannot be produced. It is pressing God to explain<br>Himself \-- or else! That is where everything starts to unravel.<br><br>\"If we can comprehend even a tiny portion of the Lord\'s majesty and<br>the depth of His love for us, we can deal with those times when He<br>defies human logic and sensibilities. Indeed, that is what we must do.<br>Expect confusing experiences to occur along the way, and don\'t be<br>dismayed when they arrive. Welcome them as friends\--as opportunities<br>for your faith to grow. Hold fast to your faith, without which it is<br>impossible to please Him. \'Lean into the pain\' when your time to<br>suffer comes around. Never yield to feelings of self-pity of<br>victimization, which are Satan\'s most effective tools against us.<br>Instead, store away your questions for a lengthy conversation in<br>eternity, and then press toward the mark.\" ‡<br><br>\<br><br>‡ Dobson, Dr. James. *When God Doesn't Make Sense* ©1993, Tyndale House<br>Publishers, Inc.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
