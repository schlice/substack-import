<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Let's answer each specific question.<br><br>*Is this protected speech?*<br><br>This is most definitely protected First Amendment speech. ***That<br>said***, the department is allowed to regulate how officers appear in<br>public. Most departments (I found to my surprise\*) allow visible<br>tattoos while in uniform. Most departments do specify that the tattoos<br>may not be offensive. While it's clear that this tattoo is not<br>offensive, I can see how it may be misinterpreted. However, this is a<br>problem of the department's own making. By allowing visible tattoos,<br>it's clear that sooner or later they'd run into a problem like this.<br><br>*Should be be fired?*<br><br>Not only should he not be fired, but it would be stupid for them to<br>do so. Since (as we established already) the tattoo is protected First<br>Amendment speech, firing him or otherwise disciplining him over it would<br>be extremely problematic because not only is it protected by 1A, but it<br>*doesn't actually violate department policy.*<br><br>*What if he had the tattoo removed?*<br><br>Even *asking* him (as opposed to ordering him) to remove it would be<br>problematic. As you may know, removing tattoos is a painful process<br>requiring laser surgery. Since the department is requiring the surgery<br>for continued employment, does that make the tattoo removal surgery<br>payable under the department's health plan? If he has to take time off<br>to recover, is that covered under Worker's Comp?<br><br>\<br><br>\* When I was Active Duty in the US Air Force, uniform regulations<br>required that tattoos be not visible while in uniform. Therefore,<br>shoulder and torso tattoos were very popular. I hear that this<br>regulation may also have changed as well...<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
