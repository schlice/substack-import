<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>How do I stop my iPhone 6s from being hacked?<br><br>Your question seems to imply that a hack is "in progress" and you need<br>to "stop" it. If that were the case, power it off. An iPhone that is off<br>cannot be hacked.<br><br>Now, you probably wanted to ask, "How do I *prevent* my iPhone 6S from<br>being hacked?"<br><br>Here's the best things you can do:<br><br>- Keep the latest Apple firmware on it.<br>- Don't jailbreak it. Jailbroken software bypasses critical security<br>  controls, and if you don't know what you're doing (based on the fact<br>  that you had to ask the question in the first place, I'm going to<br>  presume you don't), you could open up security holes.<br>- Don't visit websites without some form of protection. Use approved<br>  browsers only (on an iPhone, you should only use Safari)<br>- Install antivirus. I know it seems silly (viruses on a phone?), but<br>  they do exist. Take a look at Lookout Mobile Security and Avast Mobile<br>  Security.<br>- Don't give your phone to people you don't trust. Require passwords to<br>  be entered in the App Store in order to install apps so only you can<br>  install them.<br><br>Hope this helps<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
