<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What odds would you give on Brett Kavanaugh being confirmed to the<br>Supreme Court? What do you base this on?**<br><br>I would give it a 90% chance, because I'll never say anything is a sure<br>thing, but this is pretty close.<br><br>Here's what I base this on:<br><br>- At the end of the regular investigation period, it was going to be a<br>  party line vote, but he was going to get approved.<br>- The whole Blasey Ford kerfuffle happened, and Republicans allowed<br>  Democrats to climb up on to the hill that they chose to die on: **we<br>  need an FBI investigation.**<br>- Republicans allowed them to die on that hill by giving them an FBI<br>  investigation, which we should all be aware at this point will not<br>  reveal anything. Seriously, if every media outlet in the country was<br>  scouring under every rock and shrub looking for any corroborating<br>  evidence and they were unable to find it, and the FBI themselves was<br>  unable to find it in six background investigations, they're not<br>  going to find anything new in a seventh. (EDIT) I'm seeing tweets from<br>  ranking Republicans confirming that there *will* be a vote this week,<br>  and there will be no further obstruction or delays. Clearly, Dems<br>  chose the hill they were going to die on, and they will die there this<br>  week.<br>- While Dr. Ford's testimony is compelling, we should all be aware by<br>  now that memories are fallible. The fact that she believes her<br>  memories so strongly only shows that she believes what she remembers.<br>  It has been well established in neurology and psychology that [[you<br>  can both be 100% certain, and 100%<br>  wrong](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=ea756d&url=https://www.nationalreview.com/2018/09/cognitive-science-false-memories-more-common-than-you-think/){.external_link<br>  rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>  onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>  qt-tooltip="nationalreview.com"}]{.qlink_container}. Without<br>  corroboration, memories alone are not reliable enough to derail a<br>  presidential nomination.<br>- The FBI investigation also gives all the original yes voters cover to<br>  be certain of their yes votes. The only thing the FBI investigation<br>  will do is embolden the yes voters. It's not going to turn any no<br>  votes into yes votes unless they were already undecided swing votes,<br>  and there are scant few of those. The investigation will give them the<br>  political cover to vote yes.<br>- Therefore, barring some miraculous surprise, there isn't enough<br>  evidence to turn any of the yes votes into no votes. Senators who flip<br>  their yes votes into no votes based on this allegation are climbing<br>  their own hill on which their political careers will die.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
