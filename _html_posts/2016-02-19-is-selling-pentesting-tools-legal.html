<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>In general, (and this is very, very general), it is legal to sell tools<br>for security testing. In general, whether or not it is legal for people<br>to own such tools varies by state, but ultimately you are mostly immune<br>from prosecution if people use your tool unlawfully. If you\'d like a<br>comparison, look at the firearms industry. They build tools to kill<br>people, but if someone uses their tool to kill someone and that killing<br>was unlawful, the manufacturer is immune from liability.<br><br>You are going to have to be very diligent with your EULA, and you are<br>going to have to have your EULA reviewed by an attorney, as well as<br>having your business model and your tools evaluated by an attorney. The<br>attorney will have to tell you whether or not it is legal to develop the<br>tool, whether or not it is legal to sell the tool, and how you should<br>craft your EULA to ensure that you are insulated against unlawful use of<br>your tool.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
