<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**When Donald Trump commits an impeachable offence again, would Congress<br>restart the impeachment proceedings or will they just resend the<br>articles of impeachment to the Senate for a new trial?**<br><br>You have several errors of fact in your question, which I presume are<br>caused by your own biases.<br><br>"When Donald Trump commits an impeachable offence again" is an<br>inaccurate forward-looking statement. It should be "If," not "When." No<br>one can see the future.<br><br>You also said "When Donald Trump **commits an impeachable offence<br>again**" which is inaccurate because no one is convinced that he already<br>committed impeachable offenses. The Senate's party-line acquittal and<br>the party-line House vote for impeachment proved this. Never has an<br>impeachment taken place on a party-line vote. The Framers warned of<br>this: impeachment becoming a party-line weapon. Democrats decided to<br>jump the shark on impeachment anyway. This is where the uncertainty<br>about actual impeachable offenses comes into play.<br><br>Now that we've thoroughly dissected the bias inherent in your question,<br>to answer the actual meat of your question, the Articles of Impeachment<br>have been voted on and passed; the President has already been impeached.<br>The Articles were sent to the Senate, and they voted to acquit the<br>President and not remove him from office. In other words, while the<br>House has the sole power to impeach, the Senate has the sole power to<br>remove from office if they think the offenses sent by the House were<br>severe enough to warrant removal.<br><br>If new offenses are alleged by the House, they will have to start over<br>from square one: new allegations, new investigations, new evidence, and<br>a new vote for new Articles of Impeachment based on these new<br>allegations. These new Articles will lead to a new Senate trial.<br><br>And if it goes just as partisan as the first impeachment attempt, it<br>will fail in exactly the same partisan way that this one did.<br><br>And eventually, the people will grow weary of endless impeachments and<br>will vote the rabble-rousers out of the House to allow for more<br>level-headed persons to take over.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
