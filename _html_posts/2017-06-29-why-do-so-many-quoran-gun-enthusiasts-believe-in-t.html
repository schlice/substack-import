<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Treating a gun as if it is loaded, and knowing that it is unloaded, are<br>two different things. "I didn't know it was loaded" means someone was<br>treating it as if it was unloaded when they didn't confirm for<br>themselves.<br><br>But there is a big difference in knowing for yourself that the gun is<br>unloaded so that you can perform unloaded actions on it (such as<br>disassembly for cleaning) and treating the gun as if it was unloaded<br>without *knowing.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
