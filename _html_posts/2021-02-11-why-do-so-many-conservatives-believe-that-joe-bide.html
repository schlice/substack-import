<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Why do so many conservatives believe that Joe Biden should be<br>impeached?**<br><br>I think you and I may have drastically different definitions of "so<br>many, " but since you didn't specify an actual percentage (or any<br>sources to back up your claim), I'll take it on face value.<br><br>The real reason why "so many" Conservatives believe that Joe Biden<br>should be impeached:<br><br>They are applying the new Trump impeachment standard:<br><br>***If a President can be impeached for perfectly legal First<br>Amendment-protected speech, then any Federal official, past or present,<br>can be impeached for any speech that one political group dislikes.***<br><br>That's right, you heard it here: Trump's speech was absolutely<br>protected by the First Amendment. Not even sketchy, not even<br>possibly illegal, absolutely, 100% First Amendment-protected speech.<br><br>How do I know this with such certainty? Apply the Brandenburg test for<br>incitement speech. The Brandenburg test was developed in *Brandenburg v.<br>Ohio* in 1969, and it is used to determine when inflammatory speech<br>calling for illegal action can be restricted. The Brandenburg test says<br>that speech can be restricted if:<br><br>1.  the speech is "directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless<br>    action," AND<br>2.  the speech is "likely to incite or produce such action."<br><br>BOTH elements are required. The imminence test was exemplified in<br>another case which used the Brandenburg test: *Hess v. Indiana* in 1973.<br>The court concluded that Hess' speech, while laced with vulgarities, did<br>not specify a time for lawless action. The Court concluded that the<br>speech "amounted to nothing more than advocacy of illegal action at some<br>indefinite future time."<br><br>In order to qualify as inciting, it must produce *imminent* *lawless*<br>action. Trump did not even suggest to his listeners that they engage in<br>lawless action, even if it was imminent. *Even if he knew that lawless<br>action would ensue from his speech, it doesn't make his speech inciting<br>because he didn't actually suggest committing lawless action.* So<br>Trump's speech was, therefore, Constitutionally protected. Another<br>Brandenburg test case said that fiery speech is also not<br>unconstitutional. In *NAACP v. Claiborne Hardware* in 1982, the Court<br>discussed why fiery rhetoric is not unlawful:<br><br>> *Strong and effective extemporaneous rhetoric cannot be nicely<br>> channeled in purely dulcet phrases. An advocate must be free to<br>> stimulate his audience with spontaneous and emotional appeals for<br>> unity and action in a common cause. When such appeals do not incite<br>> lawless action, they must be regarded as protected speech.*<br><br>Nevertheless, the House voted to impeach him because they did not like<br>the quality of his fiery rhetoric, completely ignoring *Claiborne* and<br>engaging in conduct which is completely unconstitutional.<br><br>So if we follow this new logic, we can say that any speech that Biden<br>has made that we disagree with is impeachable. We've set a new,<br>unconstitutionally-low bar for impeachment, and more worryingly, **we<br>are undermining the very core of the First Amendment: being able to<br>speak out against the government.** Where does it end? If your speech<br>incites people to march on Washington (even if you told them to do so<br>"peacefully and patriotically") and it turns into a riot, can you be<br>held responsible? Under the Trump rule, you can. Who's going to speak<br>out against the government now?<br><br>And with this new low bar in place, what's to say that the House can't<br>impeach a *former* office holder? Can the House impeach Nikki Haley for<br>speeches she gave at the UN? Can the House impeach Hillary Clinton for<br>actions she took as Secretary of State? Under the new Trump impeachment<br>principles, *in theory,* *yes we can*.<br><br>And if we can try former office holders (who are now civilians) in<br>Congress instead of in the courts, what's to say that you or I can't be<br>tried in the Senate if we've ever had government affiliation? I was an<br>HOA president (and a current VP in a new neighborhood). Our Governing<br>Documents are filed with the county. Couldn't that be interpreted to<br>mean I am a government official? Could I be tried in the Senate? Under<br>the new rules (where civilians can be tried in the Senate because they<br>are former office holders), yes. Bills of Attainder be damned.<br><br>Thank you, Congressional Democrats, for denigrating the very principles<br>of the Constitution, and ignoring them for your own perceived political<br>gain. As usual, it is only the nation, and the Constitution, that<br>suffers.<br><br>\<br><br>*For the time being, I have re-enabled comments on selected answers.<br>Some people like to comment. Some people like to engage with me in a<br>civil manner, and I did kinda miss that\...a little. But do not<br>misunderstand, I take this step very cautiously, and I have no tolerance<br>for harassing or inane behavior. If you don\'t like what I wrote, tough<br>shit. If my answer is grammatically low-quality or is un-cited opinion<br>masquerading as fact, downvote it. If you think I\'m wrong, write your<br>own answer. But Quora is a question-and-answer site, not a debate site.<br>If you are simply commenting to tell me \"ackshually, you\'re wrong,\"<br>don\'t be surprised if I quietly delete your comment. Put anything<br>vaguely harassing in there, and your deletion will be followed by a<br>block/mute, and a BNBR report. I will do this immediately and with no<br>compunction. You have been warned. Be nice.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
