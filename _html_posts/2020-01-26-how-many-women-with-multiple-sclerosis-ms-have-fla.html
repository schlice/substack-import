<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**How many women with multiple sclerosis (MS) have flare-ups after<br>giving birth?**<br><br>Most of them.<br><br>We know that MS has a hormonal component. This is likely why two to<br>three times more women develop MS than men.<br><br>We also know that pregnancy hormones help to suppress MS symptoms. This<br>is either thought to be because of the immunoprotective effects of<br>pregnancy on the mother's body, or because some of the pregnancy<br>hormones (prolactin comes to mind) can actually cause myelin to be<br>rebuilt.<br><br>Whatever the case, most women with MS find that their symptoms subside<br>during pregnancy, and then within a few months of delivery will return,<br>usually with a relapse. This is not harmful to mom or baby, it's just<br>something a woman with MS needs to consider before getting pregnant.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
