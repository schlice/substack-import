<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>So if I were to summarize your question, it sounds like you're asking<br>about the quality of the KJV.<br><br>The main problem with the King James Version of the Bible is that the<br>manuscripts the translators were using were very few in number and<br>contained many copy errors.<br><br>We need to understand that while these translations were being created,<br>we were continually finding more manuscripts, and so our ability to<br>error-check them continually improved over time. This means that older<br>translations of the Bible contain more errors than newer ones, since we<br>had fewer manuscripts at the time that some translations of the Bible<br>were being written.<br><br>In short, ***older translations of the Bible contain more errors than<br>newer ones.*<br><br>Since the production of the King James version, many more manuscripts<br>were discovered which allowed us to error-check the earlier manuscripts<br>and come to better consensus as to the original text. This lack of<br>abundant manuscripts at the time of KJV's creation has induced some<br>well-known issues with its translation, including the false inclusion of<br>[[1 John<br>5:7--8](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=342adb&url=https://ehrmanblog.org/problems-with-the-king-jame-version-what-were-the-translators-translating/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="ehrmanblog.org"}]{.qlink_container}, which ended up being<br>included in the Latin Vulgate, and the KJV, but not later translations.<br>Another well-known issue with KJV is [[the translation of the word rasah<br>in the Ten<br>Commandments](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=9da804&url=https://www.gotquestions.org/you-shall-not-kill-vs-murder.html){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="gotquestions.org"}]{.qlink_container}. KJV translates the<br>word as "kill" and renders the Sixth Commandment: "Thou shalt not kill,"<br>but this translation of that word does not match the context nor the<br>usage of the word throughout the rest of the Bible. Subsequent<br>translations correctly translate the word as "murder" and the<br>Commandment is rendered: "You shall not murder."<br><br>This issue with 1 Peter 3:3, which is only seen in KJV but not in later<br>translations, is yet another example of using fewer, more low-quality<br>manuscripts from which your translation is done. We know that as time<br>went on and we discovered more manuscripts, we were better able to<br>error-check the manuscripts we did have and we were able to produce New<br>Testaments which had greater fidelity to the source.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
