We all have an innate<br>sense of "fairness" and "balance" that we believe should exist in the<br>world. It does not. That doesn't stop us from believing it should. That<br>sense helps to guide us.

We weigh the<br>facts and determine if there is enough of it to find someone guilty. If<br>not, they are "not guilty," not innocent.
