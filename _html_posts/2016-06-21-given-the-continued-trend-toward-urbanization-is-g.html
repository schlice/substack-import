<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>It was gun control in urban areas that allowed the Orlando night club<br>shooter to commit a mass murder instead of just killing a few people.<br><br>The gun control tactic known as gun-free zones created a free-fire<br>zone for the killer to indiscriminately kill as many people as he wanted<br>without fear of being shot, because all the good law abiding citizens<br>were not carrying their concealed firearms in the gun-free zone.<br><br>Urbanization does not imply safety. In fact, urbanization and the<br>increase in socioeconomic boundary zones actually increases the<br>incentive for crime. Guns are more indicated in these zones, not<br>less.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
