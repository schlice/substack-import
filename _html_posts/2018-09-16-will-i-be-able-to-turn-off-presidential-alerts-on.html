<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>In Android, you cannot disable Presidential alerts.<br><br>Start the Messages app and press the menu button (three dots) in the<br>upper right corner, and select Settings \> Emergency alert settings \><br>Emergency alerts. There, you will see "Presidential alerts: Presidential<br>alerts are mandatory and cannot be turned off."<br><br>I imagine that if you root your phone, or use a third party SMS app, you<br>may be able to disable Presidential alerts. I haven\'t looked it up yet.<br>If I get a chance later, I\'ll see what I can find.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
