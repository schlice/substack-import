<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>We\'ve discussed this before regarding the impeachment probe and their<br>requisite subpoenas.<br><br>The United States has **three co-equal branches of government. No one<br>branch has authority over another.**<br><br>*So how can Congress issue subpoenas?*<br><br>When one branch has a Constitutionally-authorized function to carry out,<br>it can subpoena information and testimony from the other branches.<br><br>But what if the other branch has its own Constitutionally-authorized<br>function that *it* is trying to carry out? Which<br>Constitutionally-authorized function wins?<br><br>At this point, it\'s up to the courts to decide. Which branch wins? Is<br>it Congress and their one-sided impeachment probe, or is it the<br>Executive branch and their claim of Executive Privilege? Only a court<br>can tell.<br><br>So if Congress intends to continue driving enforcement of these<br>subpoenas, their next stop is to the US Attorney\'s office and a hearing<br>before a Federal judge, where both branches of government actually get<br>to be fairly represented.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
