<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>And you didn\'t read my whole comment. The salient detail:<br><br>*The fuel pump technician is one of those three million hard-to-fill<br>jobs that require someone with a very specialized skillset who is in<br>high demand.* ***The problem is that the job doesn\'t pay well enough<br>for the company to afford to hire an unskilled worker and pay for their<br>training with no guarantee that said employee won\'t jump ship as soon<br>as they are fully trained and certified.*** *The new hire must come in<br>the door already trained in that specialty for the employer to get any<br>return on their investment. It\'s up to the new hire to pay for the<br>vocational training they need to get a job in such a market.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-businesses-which-are-not-scalable-because-there-are-not-enough-skilled-people-in-the-world/answer/Mark-Gandy<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
