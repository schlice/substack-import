None of the<br>congresspeople in these districts support the wall. Why do the<br>politicians in DC ignore the wishes of the people on the ground?**<br><br>Because border security is a national issue, not a state one. States<br>are barred from contributing to national defense. So the will of the<br>people on the ground is not relevant when it comes to border security.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
