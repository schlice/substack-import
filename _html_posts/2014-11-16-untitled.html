<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: [Fascinating, you actually had different badges for<br>Reserves. Considering they were nothing more than honorary badges (kinda<br>like the Junior Deputy stickers I hand out), I can see why.\<br>\<br>Our uniforms are identical, to the device, to full-time uniforms, with<br>the exception of a \"Reserve\" rocker over the top of our shoulder<br>patch.\<br>\<br>Actually, a few years ago, the department asked the Reserves if they<br>wanted to remove it, since it is not a State requirement that it be<br>there. The Reserves at the time (before my time) decided that they would<br>keep it. As in my case, we are proud to be Reserves and happy to do the<br>job we have been privileged with being permitted to do.\<br>\<br>Which is why, I guess, we have never had an incident of a Reservist<br>abusing his authority, or attempting to act as a deputy outside of his<br>time of duty.\<br>\<br>I\'ve never provided my credentials off-duty unless I was asked to do<br>so. I was pulled over \*late\* one night, and I was armed, so I told the<br>officer that I was a Reserve Deputy and was armed. He asked for my<br>creds, confirmed my status, and sent me on my way. I didn\'t flaunt my<br>creds, but I did tell him who I was and why I was armed. Eh, it<br>conveniently works both ways, I guess. However (and I think I may have<br>mentioned this to you somewhere else), I still had to take a business<br>card and report the contact to my chain, and I copied him on it. This<br>policy prevents the \"professional courtesy\" from becoming an<br>unreported habit without the chain at least being made aware of who is<br>providing the courtesy.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/What-does-it-mean-to-deputize-someone-in-reference-to-the-FBI-and-under-what-circumstances-can-a-common-person-be-deputized-What-is-the-procedure-I-have-heard-of-some-cases-where-the-FBI-deputized-people-and-gave-them-shoot-to-kill-authority/answer/Tim-Dees<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
