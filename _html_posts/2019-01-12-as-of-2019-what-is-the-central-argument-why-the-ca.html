<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**As of 2019, what is the central argument why the catholic church does<br>not allow women to become priests?**<br><br>There is, and always has been, a very clear Biblical argument for gender<br>roles. That some churches actively choose to ignore these biblical<br>commands comes down to what I'd call "creative interpretation" of<br>several key women figures in the Bible, and a willful ignorance of the<br>truth of God's plan as laid out in the Bible.<br><br>So let's start with a few norms:<br><br>- The Bible never contradicts itself.<br>- The Bible tells us that sometimes, God turns things upside-down to<br>  make a point.<br>- Any prohibition on women ruling is not an argument that women are not<br>  equal or capable. It is an argument that there is an order that was<br>  established in the Bible, and God had His reasons for doing so.<br><br>There are five clear, biblical reasons why women should not rule.<br><br>- Teleological: women exercising headship violates the creation<br>  design, for Adam was formed first, and then Eve (cf. 1 Timothy 2:13).<br>  Thus, the prohibitions on women exercising headship in families and<br>  congregations are not arbitrary restrictions over specific domains,<br>  but merely two instances of a broader teleological principle.<br>- A fortiori: nations are comprised of collections of households. If<br>  a woman is not to exercise headship over one household (1 Peter<br>  3:5--6), how much less should she exercise headship over many<br>  households?<br>- Exegetical: Scripture describes the rulership of women over a<br>  nation as a curse, akin to being defeated by children (Isaiah 3:12,<br>  4). A curse is a fitting inversion of God's intended order, as a<br>  judgment on rebellion against it (cf. Romans 1:18ff).<br>- Inductive: Women are not to exercise headship in the assembly (1<br>  Timothy 2:12). The assembly is a kingdom and a nation (e.g. 1 Peter<br>  2:9). Therefore, women are not to exercise headship in kingdoms or<br>  nations generally.<br>- Missional: Israel, and now the church, are God's models for a<br>  rightly ordered society (Deuteronomy 4:6--8; Psalm 19:7; Matthew 5--7<br>  etc), which is why we are commanded to teach all the nations to<br>  conform to this model (Matthew 28:18--20). Thus, Christians must<br>  preach all the nations to reject female heads of state.<br><br>But, I can hear the question forming in your head...<br><br>*What about Deborah?*<br><br>Deborah is the Biblical figure that feminists trot out every time<br>someone (much less a *man*, ugh) says that women should not rule.<br><br>Bringing up Deborah is a classic example of going to the edge to avoid<br>the center. When people hate something God loves, they cast around for<br>extraordinary cases to make it look bad. For example, we know a person<br>secretly hates children when their response to criminalizing abortion<br>is, "But what about victims of rape or incest?"<br><br>But looking at Deborah is worthwhile. While she is the only case of a<br>woman ruling in the Bible that feminists can use, it only takes one<br>example to disprove the negative that women should not rule.<br><br>So what should we think about Deborah?<br><br>Go back to my norms. The Bible never contradicts itself, and sometimes,<br>God turns things upside-down to prove a point. Exceptional cases in the<br>Bible are not generally normative or declarative. Isaiah walking around<br>naked for three years isn't an exhortation to spend your life in a<br>nudist camp. It doesn't undermine the scriptural injunctions against<br>nakedness, but instead *reinforces* them. It does this by calling<br>attention to something feminists don't understand well: *shame*.<br>Isaiah was a walking billboard for Israel's shame.<br><br>There are other examples (i.e. when Hosea married a prostitute, that<br>didn't undermine Proverbs' exhortation against marrying harlots, but<br>displayed Israel's dishonoring of God), but suffice it to say that when<br>you find a Biblical example that goes against a Scriptural norm, perhaps<br>you should ask yourself whether or not it is trying to draw attention to<br>it in order to display shame.<br><br>So, back to Deborah. We can read God's raising up of her in one of two<br>ways:<br><br>1.  God is exalting women rulers.<br>2.  God is *exhorting against* women rulers.<br><br>People tend to assume the first. Deborah was a good leader, therefore<br>women should rule. But if we look at the Bible as a whole, and we<br>understand that in the Bible, there is a God-ordained patriarchy,<br>Deborah's good leadership fits just as well with the second.<br><br>Just like Isaiah's nakedness, Deborah's rule emphasizes the very same<br>thing: Israel's shame. In Deborah's case, Israel has so totally failed<br>to represent God's plan, dishonoring themselves, that a woman had to<br>lead.<br><br>**The shame of Deborah's leadership isn't because women shouldn't lead.<br>It's because men *should*.**<br><br>The good example Deborah sets doesn't contradict the exhortation of<br>men's leadership. It draws attention to it by displaying the contrast<br>between the moral state of the men who *should* have been ruling Israel,<br>and the woman who *was*.<br><br>To reiterate, God sometimes turns things upside-down to prove a point.<br>It is at least possible that God raised up Deborah to highlight Israel's<br>shame.<br><br>\<br><br>If you're reading this and just fuming because of the example of great<br>women like Carly Fiorina or Meg Whitman or Marissa Mayer, these are<br>women exercising authority in matters of production. In the Bible, women<br>naturally held these positions. Don't forget that in Biblical times,<br>there were no corporations; there weren't standalone businesses (for the<br>most part) which existed outside the home. The household was the<br>primitive unit for society. The mission of the household was to expand<br>and carry on God's work of establishing a right order in the world.<br><br>The virtuous woman in Proverbs 31 is a businesswoman. She plants a<br>vineyard and sells the fruit. She bought the field she planted on. She<br>makes linens and trades them to merchants. But she does all of this not<br>as her own boss, or as an employee, but as a *wife*, a part of a team. A<br>wife would have authority over servants and unmarried sons. But her<br>authority was not one of judgement over moral matters, but rather over<br>affairs of utility. Production is a separate issue from justice. Both<br>are about ordering the world, but they are separate entities.<br><br>When the Bible exhorts against women ruling, it is exhorting against<br>them acting as representatives of God as father and king, not against<br>them representing God at all, otherwise they would not be made in the<br>image of God. Women are designed specifically to *complete* man's<br>representation of God, by filling and refining the world.<br><br>The idea of women leading corporations clearly presents a Biblical<br>problem. The idea of women working in production is not new and has<br>existed since Biblical times. But the idea of women working in<br>production *outside of the household* is extraordinary and novel. And it<br>is against the Biblical design. It's no wonder, then, that [[women have<br>been getting progressively<br>unhappier](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=f4c71b&url=https://www.nber.org/papers/w14969){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="nber.org"}]{.qlink_container} as they have been<br>progressively "empowered" in the workplace.<br><br>To be clear, having a woman CEO is not necessarily an issue, because<br>production is both a male and female task. A female executive is not<br>necessarily representing God's father-rule. The problem is not the<br>woman, but the business. It is *the business itself* which has caused<br>the household and the production to become separated, and this creates<br>some difficulties for women to negotiate. It *masculinizes* many women<br>(i.e. short hair, pantsuits, bossy attitudes). If it is at all possible,<br>and in today's society it is usually not, it is far better for women to<br>run the production in the business of their own households, rather than<br>the business in an emaciated household-knockoff.<br><br>**TL;DR: The Christian church is therefore right in not allowing women<br>in leadership roles (and specific to the question, the Catholic church<br>is right in not allowing women priests). Deborah's example is in the<br>Bible to show us not that women are not good leaders, but that *men<br>should be good leaders*.**<br><br>\<br><br>*Again, I have to stress: this is a* *Biblical* *interpretation. If<br>you do not believe in the authority of the Bible, then none of this<br>relates at all to your worldview.*<br><br>*Even if you do believe in the Bible, this in no way is meant to<br>denigrate women or say that women should not be empowered to do whatever<br>they choose to do in life. It is simply a description of what the*<br>*Bible* *says about what women were designed to do. If you don't<br>believe that women were designed, then none of this should apply to your<br>worldview.*<br><br>*I'm always willing to entertain respectful dissent and commentary,<br>which is why I generally leave comments open. But try to denigrate me or<br>disrespect my beliefs, or violate BNBR in any way, and you'll be<br>reported and your comments will be summarily frog-marched to the airlock<br>(i.e. I won't tolerate it and I'll delete your stuff).*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
