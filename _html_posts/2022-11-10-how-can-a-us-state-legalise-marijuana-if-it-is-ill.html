<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>You're absolutely right, a state cannot "make legal" something which is<br>illegal at the federal level.<br><br>But what a state *can* do is to eliminate any of the penalties for that<br>federal crime in their state. This is what Colorado did. They eliminated<br>the penalties for possession of marijuana for personal use. There are<br>still penalties for distribution without a license and other drug<br>crimes, but possession of marijuana in amounts considered to be for<br>personal use is penalty-free.<br><br>The upshot of what happens is that, unless the feds actually want to go<br>into Colorado and actually start cracking heads (which they have done<br>for heavy-duty cartel traffickers, someday ask me how I know), the state<br>isn't going to prosecute the crime. And the state simply never bothers<br>to prosecute the federal crime because penalties are proscribed in the<br>state constitution.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
