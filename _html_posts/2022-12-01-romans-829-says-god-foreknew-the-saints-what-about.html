<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>So sometimes when you have a difficult passage (or you have a passage<br>that seems to defy logic) you have to look at the passage in *context*<br>to see what it's talking about.<br><br>Because *text* without *context* is just<br>*pretext*.<br><br>So let's have a look at Romans 8:26--30 and see if the context aids us<br>in our understanding of this particular verse. And I'm also using the<br>NIV, which might be a bit easier to understand. I also highlighted verse<br>29:<br><br>> In the same way, the Spirit helps us in our weakness. We do not know<br>> what we ought to pray for, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us<br>> through wordless groans. And he who searches our hearts knows the mind<br>> of the Spirit, because the Spirit intercedes for God's people in<br>> accordance with the will of God.<br>><br>> And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who<br>> love him, who have been called according to his purpose. **For those<br>> God foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his<br>> Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brothers and sisters.**<br>> And those he predestined, he also called; those he called, he also<br>> justified; those he justified, he also glorified.<br><br>Verse 29 is referring to the doctrine of election, wherein God *elects*<br>us to begin the path of salvation. Those He chooses are sometimes called<br>"the elect" or in some translations, "the saints."<br><br>When the passage says that God "foreknew the saints," it is saying that<br>God had already decided who was going to be elect, and called to<br>salvation.<br><br>The doctrine of election is sometimes a tough one to wrap your brain<br>around, because if God chooses *some*, it follows that God does not<br>choose *all.* It's clear that God does not choose everyone, because if<br>He did, then everyone would come to faith. God chooses us first, and<br>then, after we see His work in our lives, we choose Him. But His choice<br>is first. Without God's election, no one would ever come to faith.<br><br>> *Are there people whom God HIMSELF doesn\'t know whether they\'ll<br>> repent or not?*<br><br>Now that we have addressed the doctrine of election, we can answer this<br>part of your question.<br><br>God calls us first. He has predestined us to be called, and He calls us<br>by setting our hearts to a condition in which we can experience Him.<br>Then, after we see His work in our lives and feel His presence on our<br>hearts, we choose Him and he justifies us and begins the process of<br>sanctification.<br><br>It may be difficult to understand, but don't get it backwards. God<br>chooses us first, and then we choose Him. If God doesn't choose us, we<br>won't choose Him.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
