<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Are jury trials really fair when then the case involves complex<br>scientific or medical testimony? Wouldn\'t it be better to use people<br>with a background in science or medicine?**<br><br>Let's re-phrase this question into more modern terms and see if it makes<br>sense.<br><br>"Are jury trials really fair when the case involves women's rights<br>issues? Wouldn't it be better to use only women?"<br><br>"Are jury trials really fair when the case involves issues which only<br>exist in the black community? Wouldn't it be better to use all blacks?"<br><br>"Are jury trials really fair when the case involves religious<br>discrimination? Wouldn't it be better to use all Muslims?"<br><br>When you phrase it that way, it seems a little less fair when we limit<br>jury selection based on the issues in the case.<br><br>What makes a "jury of your peers" fair has nothing to do with the<br>juror's knowledge of pertinent issues, or sharing the defendant's race<br>or sex or religious conviction. A jury of your peers is fair when<br>everyone on the jury is "your peer."<br><br>A "jury of your peers" is a phrase which dates back to the Magna Carta,<br>and it basically meant "a jury of fellow citizens." While the<br>Constitution does not use the phrase (the Constitution only calls for<br>"an impartial Jury of the State and district wherein the crime shall<br>have been committed"), courts have interpreted the philosophy in jury<br>selection to mean that the jury must include a broad cross-section of<br>society, to include all races, genders, and national origins.<br><br>Courts are not required to include jurors who match your race, gender,<br>or national origin in order to make a fair "jury of your peers," but<br>they cannot exclude jurors simply on the basis of those identifying<br>characteristics. See *Batson v. Kentucky* for more information about<br>jury selection and removing jurors from a jury.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
