title: '"Do Christians sometimes struggle to believe in the resurrection? Resurrection
  seems like a challenging topic to believe in for me, as most people have yet to
  come back to life, and normally to say such a thing sounds insane."'

<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I know, coming back to life? It's hard to wrap your head around that.<br><br>First of all, while it is unlikely simply because we have never seen it<br>happen, is it *possible* that someone could come back to life? Yes, of<br>course it is possible. Because when we say "all men are mortal," we<br>don't know that for 100% certain. Perhaps someone in the past never<br>died, or someone in the future may not die. We don't know. We haven't<br>seen the birth and death of every single person ever. So it is possible<br>(although certainly very unlikely).<br><br>But at the same time, you, unironically, are living in a universe which<br>exploded into existence out of nothing. You are living on a planet, as<br>part of ***an entire universe, where that universe and everything in it<br>exploded into being, out of nothing.***<br><br>And whatever caused that universe to come into existence can't be part<br>of the universe, because you can't be part of what you created, or you'd<br>have to exist before you existed. So whatever it was that created the<br>universe must be outside of the universe. That means outside of time<br>(eternal), outside of matter (immaterial), and outside of space and<br>energy (transcendent). And in order to have created something as<br>*massive* and *complex* as the universe, it must be extremely powerful<br>and intelligent.<br><br>So, an eternal, transcendent, immaterial, extremely powerful and<br>intelligent cause of the universe, what does that sound like to you? As<br>Thomas Aquinas put it, "this is what most people mean by 'God.'"<br><br>\<br><br>And if God is capable of creating an entire universe, and everything in<br>it, *by literally speaking it into existence*, then why does a<br>trivial matter like resurrection cause you such angst?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
