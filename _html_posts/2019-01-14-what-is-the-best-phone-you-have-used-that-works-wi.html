The whole idea was that your BlackBerry device<br>would simply use the security infrastructure already set up in the<br>phone, and just act as an extension of the phone.<br><br>The BlackBerry can be secured in an infrastructure called *BlackBerry<br>Enterprise Server (BES)*. This allowed corporations to control<br>*hundreds* of different settings on your device, making it exactly as<br>secure as they needed it to be, in order to conform with their security<br>requirements. In turn, the BES server was attached inside the corporate<br>network, allowing the BlackBerry to access intranet content, fully<br>encrypted and secured, from anywhere.<br><br>Remember that at the time, this was revolutionary. Other manufacturers<br>(Apple, Android) had *mobile device management* (MDM) setups, but none<br>were so comprehensive and end-to-end as BlackBerry's setup. Corporations<br>relied on BlackBerry for this, and it wasn't until MDM (as provided by<br>third parties) got good enough that corporations started allowing<br>employees to switch to Apple or Android offerings that they could then<br>secure properly.<br><br>Because of the necessity to secure the tablet in the same way that the<br>phone is secured, the PlayBook employed BlackBerry Bridge to connect to<br>the phone, and indirectly, it made using the PlayBook a seamless<br>extension to using the phone itself. Your email and other corporate apps<br>ran natively on the PlayBook, and the connectivity was directly through<br>the phone.<br><br>To date, there is no "tethering" solution that is as seamless or as<br>complete as what BlackBerry offers.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
