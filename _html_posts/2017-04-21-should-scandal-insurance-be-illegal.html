<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I don't think you have to worry yourself over making sure that scandal<br>insurance can never be offered, because I can't think of a scenario in<br>which it *could* be feasibly offered.<br><br>The insurance agency would essentially have to be an Adjustment Bureau,<br>essentially re-writing historical events such that what actually<br>happened didn't happen. And as you likely know, once something gets<br>posted to the Internet, it's *nearly impossible* to get rid of it.<br><br>So what would the terms be? You can do anything, and we will make it go<br>away? Sounds like science fiction to me.<br><br>I don't think you should worry yourself over this.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
