<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Ah, an easy question. And there are a few really good answers:<br><br>1. Because he claimed he was God.<br><br>If he was actually *not* God, and was actually a magician, then he was<br>either a liar, or he was insane. Not really someone worth believing in.<br>A magician has no ability to save my eternal soul.<br><br>2. Magicians perform sleight-of-hand, not miracles.<br><br>A miracle, as defined by Oxford, is "a surprising and welcome event that<br>is not explicable by natural or scientific laws and is therefore<br>considered to be the work of a divine agency." Sleight-of-hand may<br>*appear* to be miraculous, but it actually can be explained by natural<br>or scientific laws. Miracles, by definition, cannot be explained by<br>science. So if a "miracle" has a scientific explanation, it's not a<br>miracle.<br><br>For those reasons, it doesn't make sense that he *is not* God.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Why don\'t Christians believe Jesus was a magician, as weird though it<br>seems, it is not as big a leap as he was God?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
