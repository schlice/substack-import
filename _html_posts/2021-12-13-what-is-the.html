<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>There are a few, but the undisputed winner in the "Android AirTag"<br>category, by far, is<br>[Tile(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=f0f6e7&url=https://www.thetileapp.com/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="thetileapp.com"}]{.qlink_container}*.*<br><br>Tile is a very solid counterpart to AirTags, and it has the flexibility<br>to work with more than just Apple products (Tile does work on iPhone).<br>They have a number of different styles of Tile trackers to choose from,<br>but the one which matches the AirTag the closest is the Tile Mate. At<br>the time of this writing, a Tile Mate is on sale for \$19.99, and a<br>two-pack is on sale for \$37.99. So for about \$8 more than a single<br>AirTag, you can buy two Tile Mate tags.<br><br>The Tile Mate is a little larger than the AirTag, but it has a keychain<br>hole in it, so you don't need an accessory to attach it to stuff. It<br>does only come in white and black, but it has support for third-party<br>cases if you want to change the color.<br><br>The Tile Pro is a little larger, has a little better range, and runs off<br>of a battery you replace (as opposed to the rest of the Tile lineup,<br>which have non-replaceable 3-year batteries).<br><br>Like AirTags, the Tile Mate uses Bluetooth Low Energy (LE) to connect to<br>your Android phone or tablet. The range of the Tile Mate is advertised<br>as 250 feet, which is pretty good and is usually more than enough for<br>what you'll need.<br><br>What happens if you're not in that range? The Tile app will show you<br>where the tracker was when last connected. If that's not enough, you can<br>mark it "Lost" in the app and crowdsource other Tile users to help you<br>find it.<br><br>For \$3 per month or \$30 a year, you can subscribe to "Tile Premium"<br>for some additional features like Smart Alerts (your phone alerts you<br>when your Tile goes out of range), 30 Day Location History, Unlimited<br>Sharing and Free Battery Replacements (for Tile units with replaceable<br>batteries).<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>What is the \"Android version\" of AirTag?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
