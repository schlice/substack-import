<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [It really depends on the phone.\<br>\<br>If it\'s an Apple, LG, Motorola or a Samsung phone in the US, it\'s<br>exceedingly unlikely that your phone has been hacked. Unless you have<br>jailbroken/rooted your phone, there isn\'t a way to access the<br>multi-user \"shell\" that allows commands to be executed.\<br>\<br>If you are using a Google Nexus phone, the phone uses a version of<br>Android that is much closer to \"stock\" Android as released by Google.<br>There may be more unpatched security holes in stock Android; however,<br>your phone gets updates more frequently. That said, you still only have<br>serious issues if you have a rooted phone.\<br>\<br>Malware (a malicious app on your phone) may allow this, but again it\'s<br>exceedingly unlikely that you have this on your phone, especially if you<br>are not jailbroken/rooted.\<br>\<br>If your phone is jailbroken/rooted, the easiest way to remove hacker<br>access is to unroot it/unjailbreak it.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
