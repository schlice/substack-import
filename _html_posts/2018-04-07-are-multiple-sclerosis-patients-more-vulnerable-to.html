<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Are multiple sclerosis patients more vulnerable to progressive<br>multifocal leukoencephalopathy?**<br><br>Let me see if I can provide an updated answer.<br><br>As everyone has already said, MS by itself does not increase your risk<br>of contracting PML. However, certain medications commonly prescribed for<br>MS can increase your risk of developing PML.<br><br>So there are two factors involved in a person with MS developing PML:<br><br>1.  Taking certain MS medications which are immunosuppressive<br>2.  Having been exposed to the [[JC<br>    Virus](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=6a2af9&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JC_virus){.external_link<br>    rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>    onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>    qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container} and thus being "JC<br>    Positive."<br><br>Currently,<br>[Tysabri(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=c18f05&url=http://www.tysabri.com){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="tysabri.com"}]{.qlink_container} is the primary medication<br>which has been correlated with an increased risk of contracting PML. In<br>fact, Tysabri was pulled from the market when it was directly related to<br>three deaths from PML. Tysabri was re-released with a [[black box<br>warning](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=fa2f55&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxed_warning){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container} about PML and Tysabri.<br>Continued study found that there was a much higher risk of developing<br>PML when you had multiple MS medications in your body at the same time.<br>So if you are going on to, or leaving, Tysabri as a therapy, you will<br>find that they will force you to be medication free for at least four<br>weeks (and possibly more) before you can start Tysabri, or before you<br>can start a new medication.<br><br>However, you can only develop PML as a result of the JC Virus, so if you<br>are JC negative, the Tysabri restrictions will not apply to you. You can<br>be sure that if you start or while you're on Tysabri, your doctor will<br>monitor you very closely for any signs of the JC virus. Interestingly,<br>Biogen (the maker of Tysabri) universally pays for JC virus testing. In<br>fact, they encourage it. If you're JC positive, you can still take<br>Tysabri, but the therapy may be cut short since the risk of developing<br>PML increases over time. This is something you'll want to work out with<br>your neurologist, and determine the amount of risk that applies to you<br>in your given situation. I'll tell you from personal experience that<br>Tysabri worked better than anything I've ever been on. In fact, it<br>worked so well that my body was able to heal some of my lesions. I've<br>only had lesions shrink while I was on Tysabri. Indeed, the efficiacy of<br>Tysabri is higher than any other MS medication out there.<br><br>Risk of PML has also been shown with<br>[Gilenya(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=4825b8&url=http://www.gilenya.com){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="gilenya.com"}]{.qlink_container}, but not as tightly<br>correlated as with Tysabri. In 2012, one case of a person taking Gilenya<br>developing PML was reported, but this was classified as a "carryover"<br>from previous Tysabri treatment. In 2015, three cases of Gilenya<br>patients contracting PML were reported who were not previously treated<br>with Tysabri. I moved to Gilenya from Tysabri, and my doctor continues<br>to do JC virus tests on me, as I have been, and continue to be, JC<br>negative.<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*This answer is not professional medical advice**, nor is it a<br>substitute for professional medical advice.
