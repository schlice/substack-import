<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Is it true that the US Air Force vowed to shoot anyone who storms Area<br>51?**<br><br>TL;DR: No one will even get close to entering the actual facility.<br><br>Area 51 is a military facility adjacent to Groom Lake in southern<br>Nevada.<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-29a5605faaf97cece06f4f206e4d3695){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-29a5605faaf97cece06f4f206e4d3695"<br>master_w="1280" master_h="960"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>This is a sign from the outer border of Area 51. The little inset sign<br>on the big one has little red words on the bottom which read: "Use of<br>deadly force is authorized." It's true. I used to work at another<br>Priority 1 non-nuclear facility: NORAD. We had the same signs. I carried<br>the guns.<br><br>The difference at Area 51 is that the actual facility is surrounded by<br>thousands of acres of desert terrain, which is all owned by the<br>government. Anyone even hanging around the outer border not in a common<br>public area will incur a visit by the local sheriff. Anyone entering the<br>outer border will be arrested. Those orange posts in the picture<br>indicate the outer border of the government facility.<br><br>But what about the base, you say? The closest you can get to the base on<br>public land is Tikaboo Peak, which is still 26 miles (41.8 km) from the<br>facility. You'll have a long way to Naruto run before you even make it<br>to the fence. Same distance as a marathon, basically, but through the<br>desert.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
