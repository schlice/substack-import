<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Don\'t you agree that images of teenage nudity should be regarded as<br>child pornography in the United States?**<br><br>I suppose it really depends on your definition of "teenage." In the<br>United States, "teenagers" are generally considered to be "under 18."<br>"Teenagers" who are "over 18" are considered to be adults.<br><br>And in the United States, "teenagers" (who are under 18) may not be<br>photographed nude. This is covered under Federal child pornography laws<br>(see 18 USC ยง 2252).<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
