<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>It's high time to end hate speech as free speech.<br><br>But there's a problem.<br><br>*Who gets to determine what is considered hate speech? The government?*<br>And what happens when the party that you do not support takes control?<br>And what happens when they define speech that you like as hate speech?<br><br>If you go down this road, *this is exactly what will happen*.<br><br>\<br><br>The short answer is that hate speech is free speech. People have to<br>be free to say hateful things, hurtful things, things which upset you.<br>Protecting speech which everyone agrees with is a waste of time, because<br>*that type of speech needs no protection.*<br><br>So how do you counter hate speech if you can't remove hate speech as<br>free speech?<br><br>You counter it with more speech. Speak out against the hate speech.<br>Overwhelm the conversation with rational arguments why the speech is<br>hateful, and show why it doesn't make sense. That is how you stop hate<br>speech. Allow the troglodyte to speak, and then destroy him with the<br>truth.<br><br>\<br><br>TL;DR: You don't end hate speech by banning it. You end hate speech<br>by allowing it to be spoken, and then destroying it.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
