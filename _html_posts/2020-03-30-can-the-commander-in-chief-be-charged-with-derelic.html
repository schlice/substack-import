<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Can the Commander-in-Chief be charged with dereliction of duty?<br><br>No, because the President is not a member of the military.<br><br>The Commander-in-Chief is not *at* the top of the military chain of<br>command. He is *above* the military chain of command, *outside*<br>the military chain of command, and is thus not subject to the UCMJ.<br><br>There are already remedies listed in the Constitution for punishing a<br>President for conduct which might be criminal (see *Impeachment*).<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
