Since<br>it's not in SCOTUS' job description to answer questions of law, they<br>kicked the case back to the lower courts to hash out.<br><br>This means that the case is still in progress. No final decision has yet<br>been made except for the lower courts removing the citizenship question<br>from the census.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
