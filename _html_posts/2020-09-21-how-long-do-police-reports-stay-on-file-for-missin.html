<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>How long do police reports stay on file for missing parcels?<br><br>There are no police activities for missing parcels.<br><br>There may be police case files open for theft, however. "Porch pirates"<br>do not "cause missing parcels." They cause theft. Package theft is a<br>growing problem in the United States, and home delivery of nearly<br>everything during COVID makes this problem that much more acute.<br><br>Every department has different criteria and different priorities for<br>handling package theft. If a case is open, how long it remains open is<br>up to that department, but usually it is only open until the department<br>decides that there is no longer enough evidence to progress the case any<br>further.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
