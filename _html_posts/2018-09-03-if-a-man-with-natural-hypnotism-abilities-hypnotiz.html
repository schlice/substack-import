<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If a man with natural hypnotism abilities hypnotizes a woman into<br>having \"consensual\" sex when she otherwise wouldn\'t, without either<br>of them being aware of the hypnotism, is that rape?**<br><br>No, since you said that neither of them were aware of the hypnotism.<br><br>Therefore, no one intentionally deceived anyone. Rape involved forcing<br>someone to have sex against their will. The "force" portion of the crime<br>involves a knowledge and intent to deprive someone of their free will<br>and choice in the mutual decision-making process, and if someone has<br>"natural hypnotic powers" and is unaware of them, then there is no<br>"force of will" driving the alleged rapist.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
