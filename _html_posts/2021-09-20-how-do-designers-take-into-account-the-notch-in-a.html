Therefore, the<br>action of ejecting a cartridge should not impart enough kinetic energy<br>to cause a large enough motion in the firearm (or you) to need to worry<br>about.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>How do designers take into account the notch in a handgun where spent<br>shells are ejected, as it relates to throwing the barrel offline during<br>recoil?
