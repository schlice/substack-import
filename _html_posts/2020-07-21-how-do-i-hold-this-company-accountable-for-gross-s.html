<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**How do I hold this company accountable for gross slander and malicious<br>prosecution?**<br><br>Hire an attorney. It's really that simple. If you actually have a case,<br>your attorney will tell you.<br><br>Then you pay your attorney. They are not social justice warriors who<br>swoop in and right your wrongs because rainbows and kittens. They are<br>real people, working for a living. You'll need to pay them for their<br>trouble.<br><br>There's nothing on the internet that's going to hold anyone accountable<br>for anything without a lawyer. I mean, maybe you can stir up the<br>Twitterverse and get the blue check mob to fight on your behalf with a<br>well-crafted meme that goes viral or something, but that's a hollow<br>victory. Real accountability comes through the courts.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
