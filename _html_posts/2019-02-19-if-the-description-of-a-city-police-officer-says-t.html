The police<br>enforce trespassing ordinances when a business owner says that you are<br>not welcome in their building. It's not up to the police to not enforce<br>the law simply because the business owner is violating a Federal law.<br>The police are not lawyers. While they can advise the business owner<br>that service animals are allowed anywhere that people are under Federal<br>law, the business owner is still free to violate ADA if he chooses.<br><br>The business owner violating the Americans with Disabilities Act is a<br>matter which you must address through your lawyer. The police do not<br>enforce the provisions of the ADA, as there are no criminal penalties<br>under that law, only civil penalties.<br><br>Also, city and state police do not enforce federal law. They enforce<br>state law. Federal law enforcement agents enforce federal law. In most<br>cases, despite their job description, city police officers cannot<br>enforce federal law.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
