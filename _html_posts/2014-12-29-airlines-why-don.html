<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Unnecessary in current systems.\<br>\<br>The FDR (Flight Data Recorder) records the positions of all of the<br>aircraft control surfaces as well as the positions of the gauges and<br>dials in the cockpit. There has been discussion lately that FDRs may not<br>be accurately recoring information from \"glass\" cockpit screens, so<br>there has been a move to add video recording.\<br>\<br>The problem, of course, is cost. Airlines have some of the thinnest<br>profit margins of any industry in America, clocking in just about<br>\$4/passenger/flight. Anything that might interfere with that very slim<br>profit margin is going to be very closely scrutinized, and if it\'s not<br>absolutely needed, it won\'t be added.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
