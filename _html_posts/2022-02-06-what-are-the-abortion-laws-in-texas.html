<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>All elective abortions are illegal after six weeks, and there are no<br>exceptions for rape or incest.<br><br>Texas has one of the most stringent abortion laws in the country. If you<br>go into a Planned Parenthood abortion provider in Texas and you don\'t<br>qualify, they have resources available to help you get to a state which<br>will perform the abortion. New Mexico or Colorado are two states nearby<br>where you can go to get your abortion.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
