<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**When it\'s reasonable to suspect on breast cancer? What if I\'m<br>feeling tension and pressure on my chest often? Sometimes even pain in<br>my veins? I\'m 20 and I have thoracic scoliosis.**<br><br>It's very rare for tension and pressure or even breast pain to be breast<br>cancer. Breast pain is rarely cancer. Breast pain is usually hormone<br>related, and usually changes with your menstrual cycle.<br><br>That said, if you have unexplained breast pain that doesn't go away<br>within one or two menstrual cycles, you should see your doctor.<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*This answer is not professional medical advice**, nor is it a<br>substitute for professional medical advice.
