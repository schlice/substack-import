<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Better than WhatsApp and Facetime? Sure, I'll bite.<br><br>First, let's talk about whether or not WhatsApp and FaceTime are "bad"<br>and worthy of "finding something better."<br><br>WhatsApp is owned by Facebook. They collect a *long* list of data on<br>you, all linked to your identity. They collect way more information<br>about you than any other chat app. And we know why they do it: because<br>they sell that data. Remember, if a product is free, *you* are the<br>product. So it's not that they collect data, it's *how much* data they<br>collect. I am uncomfortable with that level of intrusion into my privacy<br>so I can make an end-to-end encrypted call which I can do elsewhere.<br><br>And FaceTime is a walled-garden. While Apple devices have a slight edge<br>in the United States (about 51% of smartphones in the US are Apple),<br>they lag in the rest of the world. And while FaceTime has opened up web<br>sessions which can be accessed elsewhere, it's a workaround, not a<br>seamless solution. There's no FaceTime client for Android. You cannot<br>*start* a FaceTime call on anything but an Apple device. If someone in a<br>FaceTime call creates a *join link* for you, you can join from a Web<br>browser on a PC or Android, but you can't start a FaceTime call unless<br>you're on an Apple device.<br><br>So, is there a better option? Most assuredly, yes.<br><br>That app?<br>[Telegram(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=d1d52e&url=https://telegram.org/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="telegram.org"}]{.qlink_container}. Some highlights about<br>Telegram's video calling capability:<br><br>- Telegram can host video calls with up to 1000 participants<br>- Voice chats in any group can now be turned directly into video calls<br>- In addition to your camera feed, you can share your screen.<br>- Telegram supports all devices: mobile phones, tablets and desktops<br>  included<br>- Telegram is truly cross-platform; there are native clients for every<br>  user, regardless of platform.<br>- Telegram's groups can hold up to 200,000 members.<br>- Telegram calls are end-to-end encrypted for every client on every<br>  platform.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>What video calling app is better than WhatsApp and Facetime?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
