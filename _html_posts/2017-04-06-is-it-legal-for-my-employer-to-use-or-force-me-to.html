<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>There may have been a monitoring requirement when you installed your<br>company's app. That's part of those pesky EULAs and TOSs (which stand<br>for End User License Agreement and Terms of Service) that you never read<br>and just click "I Agree." You would have to go back to the EULA and the<br>TOS and see if you agreed to have your personal phone inspected on<br>demand.<br><br>Doing this (checking the EULA and the TOS) will tell you whether or not<br>they were legally allowed to demand that you unlock your phone and take<br>screenshots of the company's app.<br><br>If there is nothing that you agreed to which says that you must unlock<br>your phone on demand, then no one can force you to unlock your personal<br>phone. Not even the police. Unless:<br><br>1.  A judge orders you to unlock your phone. Failing to do so will cause<br>    you to be held in contempt of court until you decide to comply with<br>    the judge's order.<br>2.  The police have a warrant to search the contents of your phone. If<br>    you don't unlock it for them, they will take it and hack into it,<br>    regardless of how long that might take (such as in the case of the<br>    San Bernardino shooter's iPhone).<br><br>In all practicality, there is no need for anyone to ever have to look at<br>your phone. Your phone interacts with a server, which stores all the<br>same information. Your company can simply check the server to see<br>exactly what you see. Nevertheless, it's all up to what you agreed to<br>when you installed the app.<br><br>It's water under the bridge now; you already unlocked your phone<br>voluntarily. But check the EULA and the TOS to see if they can do it<br>next time.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
