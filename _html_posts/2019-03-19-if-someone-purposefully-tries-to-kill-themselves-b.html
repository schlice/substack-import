<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If someone purposefully tries to kill themselves by running into<br>traffic, is the driver who hits them still charged with a crime?**<br><br>Whether or not a crime is charged is up to the District Attorney in the<br>city in which the incident occurs. If the evidence is clear that the<br>"victim" was actually attempting to commit suicide (i.e. suicide note<br>found online, other evidence of suicidal intent, etc), then it's likely<br>that the DA wouldn't even file charges against the driver, unless the<br>driver was also acting recklessly. Speeding to such a degree that you<br>couldn't have stopped anyway could be charged as simple reckless<br>driving. However, as to the death, the DA probably wouldn't charge the<br>driver in relation to the death if clear evidence existed that this was<br>a "suicide by car."<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
