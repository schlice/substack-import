<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The actual purchase of a car is very easy, if you agree to the price and<br>you are willing to buy dealer upsell items. There are some tax forms to<br>sign, a few dealer forms, and these take about 30 minutes if it\'s done<br>correctly and quickly.<br><br>What takes time:<br><br>- Haggling over price<br>- Dealer upselling<br><br>When you are negotiating your price with the sales team, there is a<br>great deal of back-and-forth that goes on. Generally, a floor salesman<br>does not have the authority to cement the actual numbers; a sales<br>manager must make that call. The \"numbers\" we are talking about<br>include the sale price of the car, the amount you will be paid for any<br>trade-in you wish to present, etc.<br><br>Once you actually cement a number (or a series of numbers) in place,<br>your car moves into \"prep\" where it is prepared for you to drive home,<br>and you move on to a \"finance manager.\" In this office, you will sign<br>the majority of the legal papers you need to sign in order to buy the<br>car. These include sales tax documentation, a bill of sale, temporary<br>number plates, etc. Additionally, this is where the dealer will attempt<br>to \"upsell\" you additional items like extended warranties and<br>dealer-included maintenance services. This is another process which<br>takes time. The finance manager has the ability to get even better loan<br>rates than you can get yourself, and they will often do this so that<br>they can sell you a maintenance package at what \"appears\" to be a<br>lower monthly payment, because they offered you a better loan rate than<br>you could get yourself. This is the beauty of the upsell, but again,<br>this takes more time.<br><br>Once you are done in the finance office, the only thing left is<br>\"delivery,\" where your car is presented to you. If it is new, a dealer<br>will go over many of the features of the car with you. Once delivery is<br>complete, the car is yours!<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
