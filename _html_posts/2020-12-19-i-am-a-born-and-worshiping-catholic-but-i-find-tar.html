<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**I am a born and worshiping Catholic but I find tarot cards, crystals,<br>auras, etc fascinating. I want to pursue this for fun, but is that<br>against God? The first commandment is that he is my only God, and he is.<br>I do not worship Satan, only my God.**<br><br>Personally, I believe that God cares more about what is in your heart<br>than what is in your hands.<br><br>If you learn about crystals and auras and tarot cards because you find<br>it fascinating, I see no issue with that.<br><br>**If you use those things because you truly believe in them more than<br>you believe in God,** then you are practicing witchcraft.<br><br>For a normal, God-fearing Catholic, you should be able to differentiate<br>between learning about something as a hobby or to expand your knowledge,<br>and practicing something as a religion. There is a line there, and it<br>might be easy to cross, but what you do and what you believe are between<br>you and God. No one can tell you otherwise.<br><br>Here's an idea: learn all you like. God gave you not only the ability to<br>learn, but he also gave you a natural curiosity. If God didn't want you<br>to be curious, he would not have imbued you with curiosity.<br><br>But in all your hobbies, *don't ever let them supplant God.* Be mindful<br>of this, and active in ensuring that you don't begin to ever put any of<br>this stuff above God. Your faith is in him, not little rocks or pieces<br>of cardboard. They can never bring you happiness or salvation. They have<br>no powers. Only God does.<br><br>But it's fun to see what people believe and why they believe it.<br><br>Sometimes, I learn about other religions. Is that blasphemy? Of course<br>not. I'm *learning*, not *practicing*. I don't believe the stuff I'm<br>learning about Zoroastrianism or Mormonism or any one of the hosts of<br>other religions I have learned about.<br><br>And that is just fine.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
