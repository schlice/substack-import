<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [The A-10 is an awesome aircraft.\<br>\<br>However, there are other aircraft in the inventory that can perform the<br>CAS (Close Air Support) equally as well, but are also suited for other<br>roles. The F-15 and F-16 can provide CAS, as well as the F-35.\<br>\<br>And the Air Force was directed to cut \$10B per year in previously<br>planned spending over the course of the next five years, thanks to<br>sequestration. There were losses to the service across the board, but<br>the loss of the A-10 would be the largest single hit to any one<br>airframe.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
