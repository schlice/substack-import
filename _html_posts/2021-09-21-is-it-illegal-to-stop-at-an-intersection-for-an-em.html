<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Not only is it not illegal, it is *required*.<br><br>- If an emergency vehicle is approaching you from *behind*, safely pull<br>  over to the side of the road and allow them to pass.<br>- If an emergency vehicle is approaching you on the *other side of the<br>  road* (i.e. coming towards you on a two-way road). also pull over on<br>  your side, unless it is a divided highway (i.e. a road with a<br>  median in it), then you don't have to stop.<br>- And of course, if you approach an intersection and you hear an<br>  emergency vehicle coming, STOP. Wait for the vehicle to pass, and<br>  then you may proceed.<br><br>There isn't a set of vehicle and traffic laws in this country that I am<br>aware of that is not written like this. They must be uniform across the<br>country to enable safe passage of emergency vehicles.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Is it illegal to stop at an intersection for an emergency vehicle?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
