<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>There really aren't any signs of Guinea worm disease (GWD) until the<br>person begins to become symptomatic. A person infected by GWD can be<br>symptom free for up to a year while the larvae gestate. A few days<br>before the worms emerge, the person may develop a fever and redness and<br>swelling in the area where the worms begin to appear.<br><br>When the worms are ready to emerge, a blister will develop. These<br>blisters can be created anywhere, but are usually in the legs and feet.<br>The blisters cause a very painful burning sensation, which immersion in<br>water usually helps to alleviate. The blisters will burst within 24 to<br>72 hours.<br><br>The immersion also causes the worm to appear from the wound and release<br>a milky white substance into the water, which contains millions of<br>larvae, contaminating the water and repeating the cycle.<br><br>Guinea worm disease affects poor, rural communities which do not have<br>access to clean drinking water. It has been categorized as a "neglected<br>tropical disease," one of the first slated to be eradicated. In 1986,<br>there were 3.5 million cases of GWD; in 2014, there were 126.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
