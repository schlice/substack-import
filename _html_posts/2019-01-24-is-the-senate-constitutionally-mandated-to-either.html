<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Is the Senate constitutionally mandated to either amend or consent to<br>appropriations (not allowed to ignore such appropriations)?**<br><br>The correct answer is no, there is no Constitutional requirement for<br>Congress to do its job. This is why, in quite a number of years,<br>Congress has not passed a budget. There is no penalty for Congress to<br>fail to pass a budget, either because the budget could not be resolved,<br>or because of inaction in one chamber.<br><br>Appropriations bills are controlled by law, not by Constitutional<br>mandate. The law governing appropriations is called the Congressional<br>Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 , or just abbreviated as the<br>Congressional Budget Act (CBA). Under CBA, the process works this way:<br><br>- The President submits a budget. He generally has until the first<br>  Monday in February to submit his budget to Congress. It's important<br>  for the President to submit a budget to Congress, because it lets<br>  Congress know what the President's fiscal priorities are for his<br>  agencies, as well as what he will agree to, or veto if it is not<br>  present in the final bill (i.e. border funding in FY2019).<br>- The Appropriations Committees in both Houses of Congress create<br>  budget resolutions based on the President's budget. These<br>  resolutions do not go to the President, but instead go to their<br>  respective chambers for consideration by the entire chamber.<br>- The entire chamber considers, and passes, each one of their budget<br>  resolutions. In current practice, the Senate typically passes the<br>  House bill with the Senate version attached as a single substitute<br>  amendment, which means that the House generally passes their budget<br>  bill first, and the Senate amends their bill to the House bill.<br>- The House and Senate Appropriations Committees will meet to iron out<br>  the differences between their two bills.<br>- The committee produces a conference substitute for the bill which<br>  goes back to the full chambers for review. Usually, like the original<br>  appropriations bill, the House considers conference reports on<br>  appropriations measures first. The first chamber to consider the<br>  conference report may vote to adopt it, reject it, or recommit it to<br>  the conference for further consideration. After the first house adopts<br>  the conference report, the conference is automatically disbanded;<br>  therefore, the second house has only two options---to adopt or reject<br>  the conference report. The measure cannot be sent to the President<br>  until both houses have agreed to the entire text of the bill.<br>- Once both Houses have agreed to the bill, it is sent to the President<br>  for signature. The President can either sign it, veto it, or do<br>  nothing. If he does nothing, the bill automatically becomes law when<br>  it has been on the President's desk for 10 days **when Congress is in<br>  session**. If he takes no action, and Congress is not in session in 10<br>  days, the bill does not become law. This is known as a [[*pocket<br>  veto*](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=3aad86&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pocket_veto){.external_link<br>  rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>  onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>  qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}*.*<br><br>Additionally, specific to your question, there is no penalty for<br>Congress failing to pass a budget. Congress under the CBA has until<br>April 15th to present a budget to the President for signature. Since<br>1977, Congress has frequently not met this target date. In many<br>instances in recent years (1999, 2003, 2005, 2007, 2011 through 2015,<br>and 2017), Congress did not adopt a budget resolution at all. There is<br>also no penalty for Congress missing its deadline.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
