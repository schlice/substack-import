<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**While traveling abroad for years, I\'ve routinely seen mobile phone<br>SIM cards being re-loaded at 7/11. Why isn\'t this available in the<br>US?**<br><br>On the contrary, this is definitely available in the US. It's just less<br>popular.<br><br>What you're referring to is called prepaid cellular. Airtime is paid<br>for up front, before it is used. You can either refill your airtime by<br>buying a card at a retailer (like 7--Eleven or Walmart), or you can use<br>the phone itself and enter a credit card number to refill your airtime<br>over the phone. These phones require no contracts.<br><br>Most US users use postpaid cellular. You are billed at the end of<br>the month for your usage, after you use it. These are contract services.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
