<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>So your two criteria for believing that a spy balloon is difficult to<br>detect are:<br><br>- altitude, and<br>- construction<br><br>So let's discuss those one at a time.<br><br>Altitude. NORAD's phased array radar stations positioned along the<br>coast are designed to primarily track missile launches. They can track<br>missiles which arc outside of the atmosphere, so altitude is usually not<br>a factor in our tracking ability. They also can track satellites, so<br>again it is unlikely that the radar does not have the range to track the<br>balloon. Our space-based IR systems which track the heat signature from<br>a rocket plume are not a factor here, so dual phenomenology is not<br>applicable..<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-ee0b3091f34a0936417decd2c2e40350){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-ee0b3091f34a0936417decd2c2e40350"<br>master_w="4973" master_h="3315"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>*(PARCS phased-array radar unit at Cavalier Air Force Station, North<br>Dakota)*<br><br>Additionally, the balloon was approximately 200 feet tall while aloft,<br>and the tech package hanging from the bottom was the size of a regional<br>jetliner. If PARCS radars can track satellites about that size, they can<br>absolutely track the balloon. Essentially, what flew overhead was a<br>satellite attached to a heliostat weather balloon.<br><br>Construction of balloon. The contention is that the balloon itself<br>is only made of PVC and vinyl, so it cannot be detected on radar. This<br>may be true for the balloon portion, but this is not true for the tech<br>package hanging below it. As I said, it's basically a satellite<br>suspended under a weather balloon. While the balloon may provide a<br>limited radar return, the tech package would not.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
