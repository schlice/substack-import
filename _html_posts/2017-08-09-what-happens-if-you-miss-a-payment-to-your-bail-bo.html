<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>What does NOT happen is you getting thrown back in jail. In fact,<br>this is illegal (and counter-productive, as you'll *definitely* not be<br>able to make payments if you're not working).<br><br>What will happen will be the same as if you miss a payment to any other<br>business to which you owe money. If you don't make a payment within 30<br>days of the due date, the delinquency can be reported to the credit<br>reporting agencies and negatively impact your credit score. They can<br>turn the delinquent account over to a collections agency, or they can<br>take you to small claims court and have your wages garnished.<br><br>What you should do is to call your bail bondsman and explain the<br>situation and work out a payment plan with them. Being honest with a<br>debtor is always better than simply not paying and not communicating.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
