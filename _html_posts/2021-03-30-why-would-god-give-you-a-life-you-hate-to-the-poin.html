<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Why would God give you a life you hate to the point you commit suicide<br>and then send you to hell for killing yourself? It really doesn't make<br>sense, why not just never give them life at all?**<br><br>Why do you think you feel like you have a life you hate? Clearly, you<br>see something outside of your own life that you don't have to which you<br>are comparing, and it bothers you. You probably see other people being<br>successful, getting what they want out of life. Maybe you spend time on<br>Instagram, seeing just how much fun everyone else is having with their<br>lives, and comparing yourself to them. We're always going to see other<br>people who appear to be happier, healthier, more successful. They seem<br>to have everything we want and just somehow can't get.<br><br>But that is folly.<br><br>Remember the parable of the rich man:<br><br>> And he told them this parable: "The ground of a certain rich man<br>> yielded an abundant harvest. He thought to himself, 'What shall I do?<br>> I have no place to store my crops.'<br>><br>> "Then he said, 'This is what I'll do. I will tear down my barns and<br>> build bigger ones, and there I will store my surplus grain. And I'll<br>> say to myself, "You have plenty of grain laid up for many years. Take<br>> life easy; eat, drink and be merry."'<br>><br>> "But God said to him, 'You fool! This very night your life will be<br>> demanded from you. Then who will get what you have prepared for<br>> yourself?'<br>><br>> "This is how it will be with whoever stores up things for themselves<br>> but is not rich toward God." --- Luke 12:16--21 NIV<br><br>Don't envy the people who have more than you. How foolish of us to<br>resent those who are comfortable now, but who may not be right with God,<br>and could be eternally lost. And how foolish of us to resent others who<br>have something that we wish we had when we serve a God who is working in<br>your life to give you the one thing that you so desperately need: more<br>of him.<br><br>Ask God to show you his plan for your life. He desperately wants to be a<br>part of your life, and he wants to do great things with you, and for<br>you.<br><br>But to do that, you must focus less on what you don't have, and more on<br>what you do. You have him. Rest on that, because he is more than enough.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
