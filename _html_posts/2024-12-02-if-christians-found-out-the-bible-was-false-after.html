<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>One author cannot speak for all the authors who wrote their inspired<br>works over thousands of years. There are still 39 other authors who<br>wrote inspired works, and there are corroborated miracles which actually<br>occurred which will still have to be explained. And remember, these<br>miracles were penned thousands of years before they took place. And the<br>math has been done---the probability of these miracles coming true<br>randomly in the life of one man is so astronomically high that it is<br>*functionally* impossible.<br><br>So one book by one author being found to be fraudulent isn't enough to<br>indict the entire Bible, which was written by 40 different authors over<br>three continents in three languages over the course of about 1500 years.<br>One scroll detailing that one book was a lie out of all 66 books of the<br>Bible won't really move the needle.<br><br>And let's go even further; let's pose the hypothetical. *Even if the<br>entire Bible was found to be fraudulent* (which is not possible given<br>the constraints of the question), where have you put your faith? Did<br>you put your faith in a living God who has actually done work in<br>your life, or have you put your faith in a book?<br><br>Finally, there are sources outside the Bible which also detail the life<br>of Christ. In all, there are ten non-Christian sources which are not<br>part of the Bible which also described the life of Christ. They are:<br>Flavius Josephus, a Jewish historian; Tacitus, the Roman historian;<br>Pliny the Younger, a Roman politician; Phlegon, a freed slave who wrote<br>histories; Thallus, a first-century historian; Seutonius, a Roman<br>historian; Lucian, a Greek satirist; Celsus, a Roman philosopher; Mara<br>Bar-Serapion, a private citizen who wrote to his son; and the Jewish<br>Talmud.<br><br>Together, these ten non-Christian sources (again, without the Bible),<br>reveal the following:<br><br>1.  Jesus lived during time of Tiberius Caesar.<br>2.  He lived a virtuous life.<br>3.  He was a wonder-worker.<br>4.  He had a brother named James.<br>5.  He was acclaimed to be the Messiah.<br>6.  He was crucified under Pontius Pilate.<br>7.  He was crucified on the eve of the Jewish Passover.<br>8.  Darkness and an earthquake occurred when he died.<br>9.  His disciples believed he rose from the dead.<br>10. His disciples were willing to die for their belief.<br>11. Christianity spread rapidly as far as Rome.<br>12. His disciples denied the Roman gods and worshiped Jesus as God.<br><br>So *if you had just these non-Christian sources, and your faith was in<br>God and not in a book,* *would you still believe?*<br><br>Most Christians would still believe, even without the Bible, because the<br>faith is in Christ, not in a book.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
