<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What are the chances of getting a refund on a red light camera ticket<br>after the law has been overturned?**<br><br>This is the same as asking about getting your burglary charge thrown out<br>because a year later, they changed the burglary law, and what you did<br>became "unauthorized borrowing."<br><br>The legal principle at play here is that convictions are predicated on<br>the laws in place *at the time of the offense*. If you were found guilty<br>of a crime when a law existed, that's the law you are under. If the law<br>changes the very next day, you're still out of luck, because<br>prosecutions happen based on the law at the time of the offense. The<br>same holds true of red light camera tickets or any other traffic<br>infraction.<br><br>Looks like you're just unlucky on this one. Sorry.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
