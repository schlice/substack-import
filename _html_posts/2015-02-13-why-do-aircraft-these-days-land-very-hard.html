<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Personally, I believe it\'s because there is far less<br>\"seat of your pants\" flying than many pilots are getting these days.<br>It seems there is more simulator time than there is actual flying, and<br>fewer and fewer pilots recognize the benefits of flying light and/or<br>motor-less aircraft (i.e. gliders). Learning how to really control an<br>aircraft should be done, first, without an engine.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
