Only the city has permission to enforce its laws as<br>it sees fit. The city requires the business to designate handicapped<br>spaces, and the city retains the authority to enforce that statute.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
