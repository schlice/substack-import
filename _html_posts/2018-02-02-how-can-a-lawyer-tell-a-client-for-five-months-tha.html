<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Your question doesn't make sense, as a judge issues a court order, not a<br>lawyer.<br><br>A lawyer can't request a court order. A lawyer can file a motion, but<br>depending on whether or not you have already gone to court, there are a<br>limited amount of non-hearing motions that can be filed.<br><br>You may be waiting for your lawyer to file a motion for summary<br>judgment, but there would have to be no genuine issues of material fact<br>which must be litigated. If there is at least one genuine issue of<br>material fact, motions for summary judgment will be denied and the issue<br>will be moved forward to trial.<br><br>Without more supporting detail, we don't really know what your lawyer is<br>waiting for.<br><br>Perhaps it would be worth a second opinion. From another lawyer.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
