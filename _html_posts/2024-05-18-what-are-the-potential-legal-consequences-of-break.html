<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The only actions an HOA can take will be listed in the Governing<br>Documents of that HOA. While all HOAs are different, they do share some<br>similarities in terms of how they address violations.<br><br>If you violate a rule established by the HOA in the Governing Documents<br>(the Covenants, the Bylaws, or the Rules and Regulations), you will be<br>notified. Normally, you will be sent a courtesy notice advising you of<br>the rule violation and giving you a timeframe to fix it. If you fail to<br>fix it within the timeframe they've given you, they may levy a *fine*<br>against you. A fine is simply an amount that is billed to you in the<br>same way that your HOA dues are billed. In most cases, before fines are<br>levied, the HOA will give you an opportunity to address the Board of<br>Directors at one of their meetings before you are fined. The specifics<br>about how many courtesy letters and meetings you will see in your<br>neighborhood are all in your Governing Documents.<br><br>You will continue to be fined until you fix the issue.<br><br>\<br><br>The *legal* consequences come if you don't pay your fines. They're the<br>same consequences if you don't pay your dues. If your account goes<br>unpaid for long enough (fines plus late fees), a *lien* will be placed<br>on your home, since the HOA has a controlling interest in the land on<br>which your home is built. You won't be able to sell your home or<br>refinance it without repaying the lien.<br><br>And if your lien goes unpaid for long enough, the HOA will *foreclose*<br>on your lien, selling your house out from under you to reimburse what<br>you owe.<br><br>As a Board member in two different HOAs in two different states, I have<br>seen only two instances where we have had to place liens on a house. In<br>one instance, the homeowner was actually trying (eventually) to work<br>with us, but it was only the lien that made him sit up and take notice.<br>After we attached the lien to his house, he finally started<br>communicating with us and we worked out a payment plan for everything he<br>owed (which was about twice the original amount when you add in late<br>fees and lawyer costs). In the other, the homeowner was a real jerk and<br>simply refused to work with us. The day we were going to file<br>foreclosure on his lien, his bank foreclosed on the house (he wasn't<br>paying them either), and as the second lienholder behind his bank, we<br>still got paid. Two weeks later, he was arrested on an unrelated<br>domestic violence charge. Real winner, that one. Wanna know the worst<br>part? He was a well-known lawyer in town. Nice.<br><br>\<br><br>In most cases with most HOAs, the Board will do everything in its power<br>to work with you to resolve the issue. The only time problems happen is<br>when you don't work with them. Ignore their letters and meeting requests<br>and you'll end up with fines and possible liens on your property.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
