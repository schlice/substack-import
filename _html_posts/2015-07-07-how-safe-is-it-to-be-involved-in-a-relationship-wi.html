<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [So you\'re worried about getting into a relationship<br>because \"most romantic relationships end up going sour\" and his<br>friends can cause you more grief than, say, a group of MMA fighters? Or<br>a group of physicists? Or a group of (insert any group other than police<br>here)?\<br>\<br>First of all, I don\'t buy the assertion that \"most relationships end<br>up going sour.\" They are what you make of them. If you don\'t make<br>much, then most of your relationships will go sour.\<br>\<br>Second, I don\'t buy that police officers, as a group, can cause you<br>more trouble than others. With the advent of all this video recording, I<br>think it would be very hard for police, as a group, to target an<br>individual just to ruin their day. Each cop may want to help his buddy<br>get back at an old girlfriend who broke his wittle heart (sob), but they<br>all have to think of their own careers and how damaging it can be to<br>harass the public, not only for them, but for the department as a<br>whole.\<br>\<br>I don\'t think a relationship with a police officer is any more or less<br>dangerous than having a relationship with anyone else.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
