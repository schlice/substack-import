<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [We can\'t give you direct legal advice on Quora.\<br>\<br>Best advice: find a criminal defense attorney, pronto.\<br>\<br>You might be able to argue that you were in fear for your life so you<br>can try to mount a defense against grand theft auto charges. But you\'ll<br>need a good criminal defense attorney. And they\'re not cheap.<br>Expect to pay *a lot* for that privilege.\<br>\<br>Once you have retained the services of an attorney, you (ahem, your<br>friend) should turn yourself in, with your lawyer by your side. It\'s<br>the best possible thing you can do for yourself.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
