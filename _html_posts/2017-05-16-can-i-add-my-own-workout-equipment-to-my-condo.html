<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Generally, the answer would be no. The reason: liability.<br><br>If your HOA wants to work with you, they might draft up an agreement<br>which would include some release of liability for anyone who uses it<br>(that way you can't be sued if it breaks and injures someone). You would<br>also have to release them from liability if the equipment gets stolen or<br>broken, and you would be 100% responsible for that.<br><br>But generally, because there is such risk to both you and them in terms<br>of liability, it's not likely that they would allow you to put your own<br>equipment in the common area.<br><br>But talk to them about it. As I've often said, it's not my HOA. Feel<br>free to ask them and see what they would be willing to work out with<br>you.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
