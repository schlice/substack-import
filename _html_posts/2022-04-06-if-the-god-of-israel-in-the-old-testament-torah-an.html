<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>So the reason why this is so confusing has a lot to do with a<br>mistranslation of one word in the King James Version of the Bible. In<br>the KJV, the Sixth Commandment is listed as, "Thou shalt not kill." The<br>Hebrew word *ratsach* is the word which the writers of KJV translated to<br>"kill," but the word *ratsach* is virtually exclusively used to mean<br>killing without justification. The correct translation of *ratsach* is<br>"murder," and nearly all modern translations show the Sixth Commandment<br>as "You shall not murder."<br><br>God does allow killing, and as you rightly noted, the Bible is full of<br>references showing God killing people. He has wiped out whole cities,<br>including women, children, and animals. The Bible also shows God killing<br>the population of the entire world with a flood.<br><br>But does this mean God is evil? Does this mean God is a murderer?<br>Murder, as we mentioned, is killing without justification. Homicide is<br>what it is called when a life is taken, not murder. Not all killing is<br>murder.<br><br>In order for God to be a murderer, he would have to break the law, or<br>act unlawfully. We should remember, however, that God is the almighty<br>creator of everything. He literally created the whole universe and<br>everything in it, including morality and law. Since God is perfect, and<br>all of his ways are just (Deuteronomy 32:4), God *by his very nature*<br>cannot break the law, because he is the law.<br><br>But, you might say, weren't some of those people who God killed<br>*innocent*? First off, nowhere in the Bible does it say that God killed<br>*innocent* people. Additionally, *all* have sinned. No one is sinless.<br>Compared to God, *no one* is innocent. The wages of sin is death (Romans<br>6:23). God is therefore *completely within his rights* **to<br>destroy each and every one of us.**<br><br>When God chose to destroy the earth with a flood, it is because he<br>judged the entire world to be evil:<br><br>> The Lord saw how great the wickedness of the human race had become on<br>> the earth, and that every inclination of the thoughts of the human<br>> heart was only evil all the time. --- Genesis 6:5 NIV<br><br>Throughout Deuteronomy, when God told the Israelites to destroy cities<br>and peoples, it was because he judged that they were evil.<br><br>> You must not worship the Lord your God in their way, because in<br>> worshiping their gods, they do all kinds of detestable things the Lord<br>> hates. They even burn their sons and daughters in the fire as<br>> sacrifices to their gods. --- Deuteronomy 12:31 NIV<br><br>\<br><br>So what does all this tell us?<br><br>The Old Testament showed how God destroyed evil, and when God judged<br>evil people, he sometimes killed them. He was completely within his<br>rights to do so.<br><br>But we are far more fortunate today. Why? **Because God gave us an<br>"out."**<br><br>God gave us Jesus, who paid for our sin with his death and<br>resurrection. Anyone who believes in him and repents of his sin will be<br>saved.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>If the God of Israel in the Old Testament (Torah and Tanakh) allows the<br>killing of some stubborn Israelites and some Gentiles, does that mean<br>that God is evil? Or does God just have a deep and acceptable reasons<br>why he allows killing?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
