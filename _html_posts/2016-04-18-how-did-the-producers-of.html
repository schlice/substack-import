<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>You need to prove three points of fact: 1. The movie accurately portrays<br>reality, 2. The movie intentionally lies about that reality, and 3. The<br>lie causes identifiable monetary damage. Let\'s look at this.<br><br>1. The movie accurately portrays reality<br><br>At best, the movie is a *dramatization*. At worst, it is a fictional<br>story based loosely off of a book (*The Accidental Billionaires: The<br>Founding of Facebook A Tale of Sex, Money, Genius and Betrayal* (2009)<br>by Ben Mezrich.) Indeed, a user over at IMDb makes this exact assertion:<br><br>> Mark Zuckerberg claims that the movie is almost entirely fictional<br>> except in the broadest sense that he, Dustin Moskovitz, and Eduardo<br>> Saverin created Facebook while students at Harvard. \\...\<br>> Screenwriter Aaron Sorkin and director David Fincher insist that the<br>> film is very accurate. Sorkin has even said that it is not fictional<br>> at all, merely dramatized. Much of the film is based on testimony<br>> given at a number of depositions related to \\...\ lawsuits<br>> \against Zuckerberg\. To this extent, the film might be considered<br>> very accurate. However, as the character Mark points out in the film,<br>> people do lie in depositions.<br><br>It is clear, however, that the movie definitely does deviate from<br>reality:<br><br>> One notable change made for the film is that the film totally ignores<br>> Zuckerberg\'s wife Priscilla Chan. The film makes Zuckerberg out to be<br>> a lonely socially maladroit nerd who has casual sex with groupies but<br>> no meaningful relationships and, even at the height of his power, is<br>> still pining away for his college girlfriend. In reality, Zuckerberg<br>> and \wife\ Priscilla Chan began dating in their sophomore year at<br>> Harvard, around the same time Mark was creating Facebook, and have<br>> been together ever since, marrying in 2012.<br><br>Thus, it is pretty clear that even while Sorkin and Fincher insist that<br>the movie is very accurate, there are portions which are indeed<br>fictional, and the entire story is most definitely dramatized, meaning<br>it has been changed from how the actual events to make it more exciting.<br><br>Finally, I\'m pretty sure that no one watching the screenplay believes<br>it to be a documentary, or even a documentary-style re-telling of actual<br>events. I\'m certain the movie contains pre-roll which states that while<br>the movie is based on real people, many events are fictionalized.<br><br>2. The movie intentionally lies about facts<br><br>The movie is a dramatization of depositions in a court case at best, and<br>a screenplay from a book at worst. Because it is not a documentary, it<br>can make changes in order to keep the script moving along. Changing how<br>Zuckerberg is portrayed is one of those changes which enhance the story,<br>but have no basis in reality. So while they make creative changes to the<br>story, I\'m not sure the reasonable person would consider that lying in<br>an attempt to discredit Zuckerberg.<br><br>3. There is articulable, verifiable loss caused by that lie.<br><br>Even if you could prove that there was an intentional misrepresentation<br>of fact, and if you could prove that the reasonable person would<br>consider the movie an accurate portrayal of fact (which are both pretty<br>tough hurdles to overcome in themselves), you would then have to show<br>that there was a verifiable financial loss caused by that lie.<br><br>This is a tough row to hoe, and I think that Zuck\'s legal team probably<br>advised him to just let it go. Considering that at the time, Facebook<br>was doing amazingly well financially, it would have been really<br>difficult to prove that there were financial damages done by the movie.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
