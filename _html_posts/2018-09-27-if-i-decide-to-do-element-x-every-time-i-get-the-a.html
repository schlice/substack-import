I always used to keep a pack of cigarettes in the<br>door pocket of my car, and I smoked in the car as a habit of getting<br>into the car and starting driving. I'd buckle my seat belt, put the car<br>in gear, start driving, and reach for the door pocket.<br><br>So I used a replacement addiction. I now keep a pack of gum in the<br>door pocket. I buckle my seat belt, put the car in gear, start driving,<br>and reach for the door pocket. Except now I grab a piece of gum instead<br>of a cigarette.<br><br>I now get antsy when I drive a car and there's no gum in the door<br>pocket.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
