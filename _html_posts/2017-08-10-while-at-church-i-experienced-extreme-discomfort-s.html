<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>In case you still don't understand why you were the problem, and not the<br>officers, remember the hula hoop.<br><br>Get a hula hoop. Drop it on the ground. Stand inside of the circle.<br><br>Now, recognize that you have control over everything inside the hoop.<br>You have absolutely no control over anything or anyone outside the hoop.<br><br>We cannot control what goes on outside of our hoop. We can only control<br>our reaction to things that go on outside of our hoop. For example,<br>people *don't make us angry* as we commonly like to say. People do what<br>people do; we respond with anger. No one can *make* you angry. If<br>that were true, then it's because someone has a special, magical,<br>psychic ability to manipulate your emotions and make them change. Since<br>this is not the case, then they are not *making* you angry. They simply<br>do whatever they do, and you *respond* to that with anger.<br><br>Applied to this situation, the officers did not do anything wrong. They<br>are citizens of the United States and are allowed to be inside a church.<br>The fact that you felt uncomfortable was *your reaction* to their<br>presence. Since you cannot control what happens outside of your hoop,<br>you must recognize that your reaction was the only thing you *can*<br>control.<br><br>So were you *wrong*? Well, if you questioned the officers asking them<br>why they made you uncomfortable, that would be wrong. They did nothing<br>to make you uncomfortable; you reacted to their presence with<br>discomfort. If you questioned them and asked them why they were in<br>uniform in a church, they probably told you that they are citizens and<br>have a right to be anywhere that you can be.<br><br>Was that *wrong*? No, it wasn't wrong. But it was unnecessary and<br>unneeded. It's questions which come from a fundamental misunderstanding<br>regarding the source of your discomfort, and assigning that source to<br>*someone else* when it should have rightly been assigned to *you*.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
