<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Gender bias. In the vast majority of cases, it is the male who is the<br>aggressor and the female who is the victim. So charge the male, and in<br>the vast majority of cases, you\'re going to get it right.<br><br>But just \"charging\" someone with rape doesn\'t guarantee a<br>\"conviction.\" And when both parties are intoxicated, then there is<br>enough reasonable doubt that can be generated about what was consented<br>to and what was not that it would be very challenging to actually get a<br>conviction when both parties were admittedly intoxicated.<br><br>Best advice: Don\'t have drunk sex. Too many legal issues.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
