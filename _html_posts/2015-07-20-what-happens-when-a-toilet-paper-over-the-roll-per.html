<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [The man learns to position the roll the way the wife likes<br>it, because that\'s how happy marriages are made.\<br>\<br>I entered the marriage as \"under-the-roll,\" now 20 years later, I\'ve<br>been officially re-trained as \"over-the roll.\"\<br>\<br>I know that\'s kind of tongue-in-cheek, but it makes a valid point about<br>marriage. If it\'s a big deal to one spouse but not the other, learn how<br>to compromise. Seriously, it was not a big deal to me, but to her, it<br>was wrong. So I changed. I don\'t think I lost a portion of my manliness<br>because I hang a roll of paper on the wall in a different way.\<br>\<br>It\'s really much ado over nothing.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
