<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Depends.\<br>\<br>Both candidates will use the incident to try to gain votes. Trump will<br>use the incident and claim that Muslims need to be tracked and<br>restricted from entering the country. Clinton will use the incident and<br>say that we need increased gun control and we need to better combat hate<br>crimes against LGBT people.\<br>\<br>The candidate that can sell that position better than the other<br>candidate will get a bump from this incident.\<br>\<br>It also depends on the feelings of the American people. If the American<br>people believe that this was a hate crime, then Clinton will get a bump<br>from this. If the American people believe that this was a terrorist<br>attack and perpetrated by Muslims, Trump will get a bump from this. The<br>government rushing to classify this incident as a terrorist attack may<br>actually play in Trump\'s favor, as public opinion polls currently show<br>that Clinton is soft on domestic terror.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
