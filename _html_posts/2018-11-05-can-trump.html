<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Can Trump\'s campaign continue to play Rihanna\'s music, even if she<br>doesn\'t want them to do so?**<br><br>The answer, as with all legal questions, is "it depends."<br><br>Usually, it is the venue that provides the bumper music. And whether or<br>not the venue can play the music at a political rally depends on the<br>license the venue signed with the Performing Rights Organization, or<br>PRO. The PRO negotiates individual licenses with venues so that they can<br>use the music of the artists with whom they have contracted. Most arenas<br>sign blanket license agreements which exclude rallies and conventions.<br><br>Most. Not all.<br><br>So Rihanna's options may be limited by the contract she signed with BMI,<br>and whether or not they issued a public performance license to Trump.<br>And if they did (and there's a fair bet that they did), Rihanna may be<br>out of luck.<br><br>Many artists have sent cease-and-desist letters to the White House,<br>claiming copyright infringement. But most of those cases fall off the<br>radar, because the campaign does have the proper licensing from the PRO<br>which manages the copyright.<br><br>The artist could, of course, remove the song from use by the PRO, but<br>that would be a pretty ham-handed move which would cost the artist lots<br>of future revenue.<br><br>The artist could also make a separate claim of "trademark infringement,"<br>or "false endorsement," if it appears that the campaign is implying<br>endorsement of the politician by the artist. So if Trump encouraged the<br>crowd to clap along or sing along, there could be a case made for false<br>endorsement.<br><br>But as far as the music itself goes, so long as the licensing is up to<br>date, Rihanna may be left crying all the way to the bank.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
