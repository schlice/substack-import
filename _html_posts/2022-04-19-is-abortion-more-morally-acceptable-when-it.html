<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>That's the thing about morals, isn't it? Morality is usually a person's<br>intrinsic understanding of right and wrong. Morality differs from ethics<br>as morality is personal (from within), and ethics are derived from an<br>organization or group (from outside). A person's morals are generally<br>shaped by their upbringing and their environment.<br><br>The upshot of all of this: *morals can vary from one person to the<br>next.*<br><br>So what one person finds *moral,* another person may find *immoral*.<br><br>\<br><br>So what does any of this have to do with the abortion question? Some<br>people may find it morally acceptable to kill a fetus, while others may<br>not.<br><br>The difference between the pro-life and pro-choice camps turns<br>specifically on the value the two groups place on human life:<br><br>- Pro-life people are primarily focused on the preservation of all human<br>  life, regardless of its phase of development or its temporal location.<br>  Pro-life people generally believe that it is immoral to destroy any<br>  human life, outside of extenuating circumstances.<br>- Pro-choice people place varying values on human life depending on its<br>  temporal location (i.e. its location in space and time). In other<br>  words, they place less value on human life when it is in its very<br>  earliest stages, and when it is present in a mother's womb. Pro-choice<br>  people largely believe that it is *less immoral* to destroy<br>  early-development human life.<br><br>**TL;DR: The morality of abortion at any phase in the development of the<br>baby varies from person to person. You can broadly categorize the<br>difference in morals when you divide people by their pro-life or<br>pro-choice leanings.**<br><br>\<br><br>*Sorry, no comments on this one. This topic is simply too emotionally<br>charged to lead to any productive discussion in the comments.*<br><br>*If you don't like what I wrote, tough shit. If my answer is<br>grammatically low-quality or is un-cited opinion masquerading as fact,<br>downvote it. If you think I'm wrong, write your own answer. But Quora is<br>a question-and-answer site, not a debate site. If you were simply going<br>to comment to tell me "ackshually, you're wrong," then you're the reason<br>why I disable comments. Well done, Karen. You ruined it for everyone.*<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Is abortion more morally acceptable when it's early like within four<br>weeks or is it irrelevant?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
