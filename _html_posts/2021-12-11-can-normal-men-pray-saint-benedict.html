<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Sure. Anyone can pray anything they choose. Nothing bad is going to<br>happen when someone prays with an insincere heart.<br><br>In other words, if you pray for an exorcism when no exorcism is needed,<br>then your words are empty and your prayer is useless.<br><br>It's not the *prayer* that has the power. It's the *faith* behind the<br>prayer.<br><br>How many times in the Bible were people healed by their faith alone?<br>Just look at Bartimaeus, the blind man recorded in Mark, chapter 10,<br>verses 46--52:<br><br>> Then they came to Jericho. As Jesus and his disciples, together with a<br>> large crowd, were leaving the city, a blind man, Bartimaeus (which<br>> means "son of Timaeus"), was sitting by the roadside begging. When he<br>> heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to shout, "Jesus, Son of<br>> David, have mercy on me!"<br>><br>> Many rebuked him and told him to be quiet, but he shouted all the<br>> more, "Son of David, have mercy on me!"<br>><br>> Jesus stopped and said, "Call him."<br>><br>> So they called to the blind man, "Cheer up! On your feet! He's calling<br>> you." Throwing his cloak aside, he jumped to his feet and came to<br>> Jesus.<br>><br>> "What do you want me to do for you?" Jesus asked him.<br>><br>> The blind man said, "Rabbi, I want to see."<br>><br>> "Go," said Jesus, "your faith has healed you." Immediately he received<br>> his sight and followed Jesus along the road.<br><br>Clearly, Jesus did the healing, but he didn't need to touch Bartimaeus,<br>or do anything special. Jesus said that it was his *faith* that healed<br>him. Jesus wants us to repent and be faithful. That's when we receive<br>the rewards he has promised us. It is that faith which brings the power.<br><br>Faith brings power, not empty, vapid words.<br><br>> \<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Can normal men pray Saint Benedict's exorcism prayer?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
