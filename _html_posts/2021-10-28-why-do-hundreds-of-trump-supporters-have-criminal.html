<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>> Why do hundreds of Trump supporters have criminal records for January<br>> 6,<br><br>First of all, you are slightly inaccurate. Federal prosecutors have<br>filed charges against at least 600 people in connection with the January<br>6 riot at the Capitol. Not all of them have been convicted. The vast<br>majority of these have been charged with unlawfully entering or<br>remaining in a restricted area, property damage, and other minor crimes.<br>Most of those have simply pled guilty to minor charges and walked away<br>without doing any jail time.<br><br>> yet instigators, Trump, Trump Jr., Brooks, Giuliani, and Stone have<br>> zero anything? Will they walk away to do it again?<br><br>Because they weren't there. They didn't unlawfully enter or remain in<br>restricted areas. They didn't cause property damage. They didn't resist<br>arrest.<br><br>Trump, especially, did what politicians do: *he riled up his base*. Was<br>this a wise thing for him to do? Probably not. But it's par for the<br>course from a man who we called a "maverick" and a "political outsider"<br>from day one. And it is not illegal. Far from it; it is Constitutionally<br>protected speech. Political speech is even more protected than most.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Why do hundreds of Trump supporters have criminal records for January 6,<br>yet instigators, Trump, Trump Jr., Brooks, Giuliani, and Stone have zero<br>anything?
