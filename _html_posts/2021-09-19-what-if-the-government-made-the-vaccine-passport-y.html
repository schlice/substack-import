<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>it\'s an interesting question. What if the government conditioned your<br>ability to vote on whether or not you had received the vaccine?<br><br>Right away, I see a few problems.<br><br>- There are certain groups of people who simply cannot receive a<br>  vaccine. These people may have medical conditions that preclude them<br>  from getting vaccinated. Unless you have made some exception for these<br>  people, you instantly disenfranchised them, which is unconstitutional.<br>- Next, there are certain people with legitimate religious exemptions.<br>  You have just disenfranchised those voters as well, which is also<br>  unconstitutional.<br>- Finally, and this is a big one, at least 100 million people in the<br>  United States have already contracted COVID-19 and have recovered. And<br>  the jury is still out on whether or not it is medically advisable for<br>  somebody who already has COVID-19 antibodies to take the vaccine. The<br>  prevailing medical opinion is, "Well it can\'t hurt," but that\'s not<br>  necessarily true. From a medical standpoint, it\'s not really<br>  necessary for those people to get a vaccine, and there may be a higher<br>  risk of side effects in giving the vaccine to people who have already<br>  contracted COVID-19.<br>- And just as we do for every other vaccine in this country, we must<br>  have allowances for those people who have legitimate, science-based<br>  objections to this vaccine.<br><br>It just seems like this is yet another scheme to try to find a way to<br>"convince" people to get the vaccine against their will. Maybe if we can<br>condition it on something they really really want, maybe they\'ll go get<br>it. But in the vast majority of cases, the unvaccinated are not so<br>because they\'re obstinate. They are unvaccinated by choice.<br>Well-informed, science-based choice.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
