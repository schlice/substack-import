<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>We know that the Bible is divinely inspired because the Bible isn't just<br>one book written by just a handful of guys who got together and planned<br>what to write. The Bible isn't one book. It's 66 books, written over the<br>course of almost two thousand years, by 40 different authors, in three<br>different languages, and on three different continents. There is<br>diversity in the authors. Everyone from kings to paupers, scholars,<br>fishermen, prophets, a military general, a cupbearer, and a priest<br>contributed various types of writings. Some wrote to record history,<br>while others wrote letters or poetry. They were written in palaces, and<br>prison cells, the wilderness and places of exile. They wrote poetry and<br>prose, laws, correspondence, prophecy, and proverbs.<br><br>But across all of that diversity, despite this vast array of topics and<br>circumstances, there is unity in the message**. Despite all of its<br>diversity, the Bible is unwaveringly consistent in its message, and<br>never contradicts itself or its common theme.** From Genesis to<br>Revelation, we see the same theme: God creates paradise, man rebels<br>against God, God redeems man. God revealed His plan for man's redemption<br>all the way back in Genesis with the sin of Adam and Eve. He repeatedly<br>promised this reconciliation throughout the Old Testament. And He<br>fulfilled that reconciliation through the unlikely life of a baby boy<br>born in the humblest of circumstances. This plan was foretold centuries<br>before it actually happened, and then it did, exactly as it was<br>foretold. This alone is impossible to have happened by chance.<br><br>Despite the vastly different times and contexts in which the books of<br>the Bible were written, all of its authors relay the same message about<br>God's plan for redemption and how that redemption was given life in the<br>person of Jesus.<br><br>In short, **the unity of the Bible demonstrates its supernatural<br>inspiration**.<br><br>In no other religion do you see God going to such lengths to seek out<br>His children. In every other religion, man seeks the approval of god. In<br>Christianity, God seeks the redemption of man.<br><br>In short, in every other world religion, you seek God. In Christianity,<br>God seeks you.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
