<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What would it take to move current (2020) anti-lynching legislation<br>through the US Senate?**<br><br>Congress would need to do its job.<br><br>To set the stage, **laws which do nothing more than political pandering<br>or virtue signaling make bad law.**<br><br>This bill is no different.<br><br>And it seems the only person doing his job in Congress is the<br>oft-controversial Rand Paul.<br><br>Senator Paul knows that you can either virtue-signal or you can write<br>good law, but doing both is a difficult proposition. He claims that the<br>bill is poorly written and leaves the door open to frivolous charges. He<br>is demanding changes to the bill that he says are needed to ensure<br>lynching charges can't be brought for minor injuries. He said he seeks<br>the changes "not because I take lynching lightly but because I take it<br>seriously. And this legislation does not."<br><br>He also knows that being the lone voice of dissent on an *anti-lynching<br>bill* is horribly bad optics, especially in the time of George Floyd. In<br>response to a question about said optics, he replied, "You think I'm<br>getting any good publicity out of this? No. I will be excoriated by<br>simple-minded people on the Internet who think somehow I don't like<br>Emmett Till or appreciate the history of Emmett Till. I'll be lectured<br>by everybody."<br><br>The problem? *He's right*.<br><br>The issue is with what the bill defines as "lynching." The authors of<br>the bill seek to redefine "lynching" in civil law as group violence<br>meant to intimidate people of color or other protected groups. The<br>offense would be classified as "a conspiracy by two or more people to<br>cause bodily harm in connection with a hate crime," with penalties up to<br>life in prison if convicted.<br><br>Senator Paul presented a scenario in which someone could be shoved to<br>the floor in a bar and suffer minor injuries and be accused of lynching.<br>He said that could lead to unfair incarcerations. He claims that the<br>current bill has no protections against such charges, and he wants to<br>make good law. He's right. As it stands, if two or more people cause<br>someone *any* bodily injury, it could be considered a lynching.<br><br>Senator Kamala Harris stood to showboat...err...counter his argument,<br>and in effect, *made his argument for him.* She said, "It should not<br>require a maiming or torture for us to recognize a lynching when we see<br>it and recognize it by federal law and call it what it is, which is that<br>it is a crime that should be punishable with accountability and<br>consequence."<br><br>She went on to point out that the recent killing of Ahmaud Arbery was<br>akin to "a modern lynching."<br><br>In other words, *we can redefine lynching and we can be sloppy with this<br>because* *we'll recognize lynching when we see it**. And we're<br>correcting centuries of injustice, so let's push this through now while<br>we have the momentum on our side.* Indeed, the amount of support from<br>the remainder of Congress indicates that they do have momentum.<br><br>But the strongest leaders are the ones who stick to their principles,<br>even when everyone else won't.<br><br>So to answer the question, what would it take to fix the bill? Add some<br>valid definitions of lynching. Or at the very least, raise the standard<br>to "serious bodily injury," so that only crimes involving conspiracy to<br>cause "substantial risk of death and extreme physical pain" could be<br>charged as lynching. At least if you're going to pass a symbolic bill,<br>pass one that actually works and doesn't make things demonstrably worse.<br><br>\<br><br>*Sorry, no comments on this one.*<br><br>*If you don\'t like what I wrote, tough shit. If my answer is<br>grammatically low-quality or is un-cited opinion masquerading as fact,<br>downvote it. If you think I\'m wrong, write your own answer. But Quora<br>is a question-and-answer site, not a debate site. If you were simply<br>going to comment to tell me \"ackshually, you\'re wrong,\" then you're<br>the reason why I disable comments. Well done, Karen. You ruined it for<br>everyone.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
