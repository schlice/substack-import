<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I am reminded of the following quote:<br><br>*When seconds count, the police are only minutes away.*<br><br>The simple fact remains: **the police are not in the business of<br>protecting you *from* crime.**<br><br>The police are specifically \"law enforcement.\" That means they enforce<br>laws. In order to do that, someone must *violate* the law, and the<br>police will then *enforce* that law. This implies that the police duty<br>actually occurs *post-violation*. In other words, *the crime has already<br>happened by the time the police are engaged.* Under their actual<br>mandate, the police do not get involved until the crime has already<br>occurred.<br><br>Which begs the question: *If the police are not supposed to be<br>protecting me, whose job is it to protect me?*<br><br>Unless you\'re rich enough to hire your own bodyguards, the job of the<br>safety and security of you and your family falls on you (more<br>specifically, the head of the household).<br><br>Under the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution, this country<br>was created as a *free society*. We have certain unalienable rights,<br>among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Some of the<br>other inalienable rights we have which were endowed by our Creator are a<br>natural right to self-defense. We have the right to be secure in our<br>persons. We also have the right to be secure in our homes (and most<br>legislatures in the country have recognized this by instituting some<br>form of [[Castle<br>doctrine](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=1588d1&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castle_doctrine){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container} in their laws). Since we<br>have the right to self-defense, we have the right to defend ourselves<br>from all forms of tyranny: governmental tyranny, tyranny by armed thugs,<br>or by anyone who wishes to deprive us of our fundamental rights to life,<br>liberty, or property.<br><br>This is one of the reasons that the Second Amendment was so important,<br>that it was made number two. As Senator Rubio mentioned during the<br>debate, they didn\'t place the amendments in a hat and draw them out<br>randomly. Their ordering was very deliberate. The Second Amendment is<br>second only to our right to speek freely against the government (in word<br>or in press), to peaceably assemble, and to practice our religions in<br>peace. Immediately following that, we ensured that we had the right to<br>be secure in our persons by ensuring that everyone always retained the<br>right to defend themselves against all forms of tyranny.<br><br>If Senator Rubio is doing his job as the head of his household, he<br>will be buying a gun to defend them against any and all threats to his<br>safety, and the safety of his family, be it from ISIS or from the<br>meth-mouth down the street looking to steal something he can fence for<br>cash for more meth and not caring who he hurts along the way.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
