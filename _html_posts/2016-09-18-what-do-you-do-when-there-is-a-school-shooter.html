<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>> *Question Details:*<br>><br>> *I go to a regular public high school in NJ around 1000 kids what are<br>> some tips for staying alive if this unfortunate event occurs?*<br><br>Great question! While it is extremely rare to be involved in a school<br>shooting, we don't prepare ourselves because we know it's coming. We<br>prepare ourselves *in case* it comes.<br><br>There are three rules that should be followed, in order, if you ever<br>find yourself in any mass terror situation: Run, Hide, Fight. Note<br>that these are to be done in order: run first; if you can't run, hide;<br>if your hiding spot is compromised, fight.<br><br>1.  Run. If you are in a location and you hear shots fired, run. Get<br>    out whatever way you can. Service doors, fire doors, windows if<br>    you're on a ground floor, etc. Get yourself out, and bring as many<br>    people with you as you can. If you're in a public area, head toward<br>    a private area (for example, if you're in the gym and an attacker<br>    comes in the main door, head for the locker rooms, not the main<br>    door, to find a service door). There is absolutely no reason to be<br>    anywhere near such an incident. Get about a block away and regroup.<br>    Gather as many people from the location together with you and call<br>    the police. Stay on the phone with the 911 operator until you are<br>    told to hang up.<br>2.  Hide. *If you can't run* (because perhaps your only exit is<br>    blocked), it's time to hole up for a while. Find cover. Find an area<br>    that you may potentially be able to barricade. It could be a<br>    classroom, a bathroom, or a closet. Assess the situation. Inventory<br>    your location, and find items that might be useful to use as<br>    defensive weapons, like fire extinguishers, office equipment,<br>    cleaning supplies, etc. Be silent, be patient, and let the police do<br>    their job. The police will come get you when the situation is clear.<br>    You can be on the phone with 911 as long as it is safe to do so.<br>    They will keep inventory of where people are holed up and will pass<br>    that on to responding officers.<br>3.  Fight. We never want it to come to this, but *if the attacker<br>    advances on your location*, or breaks in to your barricaded room,<br>    this is when you fight. Remember, you're fighting for your life, and<br>    it's his life or yours. Don't hold back, and don't stop until he's<br>    disarmed and not moving. Kick, punch, claw, do what you must to<br>    defend yourself. Don't be afraid of the fact that he may have a gun.<br>    It's the *person* that is the threat, not the *gun.* Don't focus on<br>    the gun, focus on neutralizing the person.<br><br>These rules are pretty interchangeable for any type of mass terror<br>attack situation.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
