There was ample opportunity to<br>question the constitutionality of the practice.<br><br>Note too that the department was most likely acting in good faith,<br>attempting to enforce the law through what they thought were<br>constitutional means.<br><br>And if a court interpreted those means, at the time, to be<br>constitutional, and it was only recently ruled to be unconstitutional,<br>then it's unlikely that even a civil remedy could be successfully<br>pursued, for the same reason.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
