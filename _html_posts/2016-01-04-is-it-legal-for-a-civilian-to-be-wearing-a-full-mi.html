<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>In the United States, you can wear whatever you want to wear. There are<br>no restrictions on anything you wear, as long as you cover up the bits<br>that are required to be covered. In other words, you must meet the<br>minimum decency standards in the jurisdiction in which you are located.<br><br>In specific to military uniforms, you can wear full military regalia in<br>the United States, even if you are not a member of the United States<br>military. There are some US codes related to military uniforms, but they<br>are largely unenforced because of First Amendment protections. Where you<br>run afoul of the law is if you attempt to extract some form of gain by<br>wearing the uniform. For example, some airlines will board military<br>members in uniform before other passengers. You, in your uniform, cannot<br>board ahead of anyone else as military members do, because you are not<br>one. Therefore, if you do, you could be charged with \"theft of<br>service\" or other \"stolen valor\" charges.<br><br>If you are up front about your wearing of authentic military clothing,<br>you will be just fine. At a US airport, just let them know that you\'re<br>not a military member; you are just a civilian wearing a military<br>uniform, and you do not expect (nor do you want) any special privileges.<br>This is perfectly legal.<br><br>Note that I can\'t speak for other countries, especially Britain,<br>considering you like British military clothing. I\'m only speaking for<br>the United States.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
