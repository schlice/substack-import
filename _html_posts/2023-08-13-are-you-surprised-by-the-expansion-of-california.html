<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Let's not be hyperbolic about this ourselves, okay?<br><br>We're not talking about all travel. We're talking about<br>*state-funded official* travel.<br><br>And it's not "three states," it's "three more states": in July 2023,<br>California added Missouri, Nebraska, and Wyoming to their list of states<br>to which official state travel is banned, bringing the total to 26.<br><br>Think about that. California is self-imposing travel restrictions for<br>their own state officials to *more than half the country* because *they<br>do not agree with the laws that other states choose to pass.*<br><br>Can you not see the dripping hypocrisy here? California is free to<br>pass laws restricting official travel to 26 states (all of which are<br>equal under the Constitution), yet these states are not free to pass<br>whatever laws they choose in their states, presumably with the support<br>of the majority of that state's voting population? Whatever fuss<br>California is choosing to make over the laws of other states only hurts<br>California, not anyone else.<br><br>Oh well, their self-imposed isolation is just fine with the rest of the<br>United States. When has "I'm going to hold my breath until you give me<br>what I want" ever worked?<br><br>If you're in California and you're reading this: move, before it's<br>too late. Before they don't let you leave. More people are leaving<br>California than are leaving any other state in the country right<br>now.\[1\](#ROrmE){#cite-ROrmE .citation_link} Join them. Get out. Get<br>to a state which respects you and your freedom. And as an added bonus,<br>California has some of the highest prices for real estate, so if you<br>sell your house in California, you can get a *bigger house* on *more<br>land* in another state for the same amount of money.
