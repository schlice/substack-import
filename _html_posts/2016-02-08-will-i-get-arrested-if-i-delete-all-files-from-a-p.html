<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>A2A<br><br>Depending on the jurisdiction, [[Christopher<br>Hawk](https://www.quora.com/profile/Christopher-Hawk)]{.qlink_container}<br>is correct for the US and<br>[Ralph(https://www.quora.com/profile/Ralph-1517)]{.qlink_container}<br>for the UK.<br><br>The issue here is that a \"public\" computer is not \"owned\" by the<br>\"public.\" A public computer is available for public use, but is still<br>owned, operated, and maintained by some organization.<br><br>It\'s like calling a restaurant a \"public place.\" It is not. It is<br>\"open to the public,\" but it is still privately owned, and your<br>\"privilege\" to be there can most definitely be revoked by the owner.<br><br>Therefore, you can be charged with \"Damaging Private Property\" if<br>there is no specific computer-related charge that fits. Most files on a<br>public computer are not personal files, not sensitive in any way, but if<br>you deleted them, the system would fail to function. This causes<br>increased maintenance for the entity which maintains the system, and<br>possibly increased costs if they have to seek outside assistance to get<br>the machine operational again. Also, the machine is out of service while<br>it is being maintained, which degrades the overall service the entity<br>can provide to its customers. These are all reasons that an organization<br>might seek charges against you if you intentionally damage files on<br>their system.<br><br>At the very least, failing to follow the user agreement would get you<br>barred from future access to those systems; at worst, could get you<br>charged with a crime.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
