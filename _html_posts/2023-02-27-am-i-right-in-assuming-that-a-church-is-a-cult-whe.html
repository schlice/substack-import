title: '"Am I right in assuming that a church is a cult when they claim that a person
  needs to be baptised in their church to be saved? I assume they say this because
  they said that they study what the Bible says instead of relying on theological
  views."'

<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Britannica Dictionary definition of cult:<br><br>1.  a small religious group that is not part of a larger and more<br>    accepted religion and that has beliefs regarded by many people as<br>    extreme or dangerous.<br><br>I'm pretty sure that a particular church misunderstanding some of the<br>passages surrounding the necessity of water baptism does not make them a<br>cult. They're simply a Christian church who has adopted a flawed<br>understanding of the Bible. That makes them a *sect*, not a *cult*.<br><br>*This is not unique* among Christian churches. We have many sects which<br>develop over time. In fact, some have just developed in the last few<br>years. Christian churches which believe in women pastors or homosexual<br>or transsexual pastors or endorsing gay marriage by marrying gays are<br>examples of *sects* in the church. They have "traditional beliefs and<br>practices" but have deviated from the core teachings of the church. The<br>United Methodist Church has begun the process of splitting off into a<br>new sect because they have altered some of their core beliefs about the<br>teachings of the religion.<br><br>Rodney Stark and William Sims Bainbridge, in [[A Theory of<br>Religion](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=64c930&url=https://www.amazon.com/Theory-Religion-Rodney-Stark-ebook/dp/B000RL6ENE/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="amazon.com"}]{.qlink_container} define church, sect, and<br>cult as follows:<br><br>1.  A *church* is a conventional religious organization.<br>2.  A *sect* is a deviant religious organization with traditional<br>    beliefs and practices.<br>3.  A *cult* is a deviant religious organization with extreme or<br>    dangerous beliefs and practices.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
