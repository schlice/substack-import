<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Because everything in that question is wrong.<br><br>- Guns are not unnecessary.<br>- Guns do not impose a non-trivial risk, when properly secured.<br><br>Guns in the home keep me and my family safe. That sounds pretty<br>necessary to me. Perhaps you are unconcerned with your safety. I\'m<br>happy for you. As far as I\'m concerned, my family\'s safety is my<br>responsibility, along with how I effect that safety. But that\'s my<br>decision to make. Not yours. And it\'s not your place to tell me what my<br>responsibilities to my family are.<br><br>To that end, the risks in my home are my responsibility to mitigate. A<br>gun in my house does not add a non-trivial risk to anyone. I can access<br>my gun quickly enough, and no one unauthorized can get to it. And it\'s<br>not your responsibility to legislate the stupid out of people. If they<br>are too dumb to properly store their firearms, or to properly educate<br>their children on gun safety, or to properly secure a firearm from<br>unknown or visiting children, then they bear that liability on<br>themselves. And lest you think them heartless, they will also bear the<br>guilt from that decision for the rest of their lives, and it will likely<br>kill them too.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
