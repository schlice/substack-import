<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Various answerers here are telling you that the Justices, in their<br>nomination hearings, talked a lot about "precent" and "*stare decisis.*"<br>And yes, they all did this.<br><br>But what do "precent" and *stare decisis* mean? Can you believe in case<br>law and *stare decisis* and still overturn a bad decision?<br><br>In this particular case, the Court was asked to look at *Roe*, because<br>the state was making the case that *Roe* was wrongly decided. This<br>particular case *required* that the Court very specifically review *Roe*<br>to see if it had a strong Constitutional foundation. In other words, to<br>find for the state in question (Mississippi) would be to find that *Roe*<br>was not decided Constitutionally. And it appears that the Court is going<br>to do just that.<br><br>This is not the first time in history this has happened. Lest we forget,<br>*Plessey v. Ferguson* was "precedent" and *stare decisis* for nearly 60<br>years before *Brown v. Board* decided that it was indeed<br>unconstitutional. Should the court in *Brown* have said, "Well,<br>*Plessey* has stood for nearly 60 years as 'settled law,' so we should<br>allow the school to keep kids segregated, because the *Plessey* court<br>said that racial segregation was Constitutional as long as the<br>facilities offered to each race were of equal quality"? Thankfully, the<br>Court in *Brown* found that racial segregation in schools was, in fact,<br>unconstitutional, which was the first in a series of decisions which<br>ultimately, together, overturned *Plessey*.<br><br>Even after all that time, and all that "precedent," and all that "*stare<br>decisis*" and all that "settled law," the Court was able to go back and<br>figure out that a past ruling was, in fact, unconstitutional.<br><br>Yes, courts can rely on past rulings to influence future decisions in<br>order to maintain some precedent and some consistency of outcome. But<br>courts can, in fact, review past cases (when the question of the case<br>turns on the Constitutionality of a previous ruling) and decide if they<br>were judged rightly.<br><br>\<br><br>The Justices did not lie in their nomination hearings. They didn't even<br>lie by omission. They were simply not asked whether or not they would<br>ever overturn *Roe*. Even if they were, they would not answer such a<br>question, because it could bias future decisions. They were asked about<br>tangential legal principles like "precedent" and *stare decisis*.<br>Neither of those two concepts impede the Court when deciding if a<br>previous decision is Constitutional. *Stare decisis* does not prevent a<br>Court from reviewing past decisions for errors, when the case calls for<br>it.<br><br>\<br><br>TL;DR: *Precedent* and *stare decisis* do not invalidate or preclude<br>judicial review.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Did conservative Supreme Court justices lie to Congress about their<br>views on Roe v. Wade?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
