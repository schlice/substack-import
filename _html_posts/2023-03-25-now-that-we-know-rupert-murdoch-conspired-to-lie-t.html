<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>We don't know anything of the sort.<br><br>At best, we know that Murdoch knew that some of his on-air talent was<br>making claims that Dominion voting machines had altered votes, and he<br>didn't stop it. But "conspiracy to lie" isn't a crime.<br><br>But the release of the evidence today in preparation for trial also airs<br>some dirty Dominion laundry, too.<br><br>"Dominion has been caught red-handed using more distortions and<br>misinformation in their PR campaign to smear Fox News and trample on<br>free speech and freedom of the press," the company said in a statement<br>Tuesday, complaining that "to twist and even misattribute quotes to the<br>highest levels of our company is truly beyond the pale."<br><br>Will anyone be losing their "press passes" over this? Hardly. Fox,<br>better than any other legacy media, differentiates its news content from<br>its opinion content, and all of the on-air talent who made the<br>statements were opinion anchors, not news correspondents.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
