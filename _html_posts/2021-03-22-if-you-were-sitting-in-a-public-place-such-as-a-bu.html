It's a<br>public seat, they have every right to sit in that seat next to you. Just<br>because other open seats exist doesn't mean they must take them. The<br>seat next to you is just as available as any other seat.<br><br>You have no legal grounds to file a lawsuit because they chose a<br>publicly available seat. There's no law that says people must practice<br>social distancing. Remember, this is before "social distancing" entered<br>our vocabulary full-time.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
