<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [In truth, the military is still a great way to start your<br>working life. You get a great education, job skills, and experience.<br>These are things which are challenging to get at any time, when you\'re<br>just starting out. Leaving the military, you are far above people who<br>are unskilled, plus you are head and shoulders above similarly skilled<br>people because you have experience. So as far as your career goes, the<br>military is a great way to go.\<br>\<br>However, understand that it\'s not just a job. The military is still the<br>military, and we are actively fighting the Global War On Terror. You may<br>have to go fight for a while. You still have to be prepared for<br>that.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
