<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Thankfully, our rights in the United States do not require<br>that we justify why we want to invoke them.\<br>\<br>We have rights. We exercise our rights.\<br>\<br>Why we exercise our rights is completely irrelevant and none of your<br>business.\<br>\<br>(EDIT) This question was changed since I wrote my original answer, and<br>now introduces a \"miraculous hypothetical scenario\" where suddenly<br>practically no one had a gun.\<br>\<br>You really should clarify your miraculous hypothetical. Did Dr.<br>Doofenschmirtz create a \"Gun Vaporinator\" that instantly vaporized all<br>guns in the Tri-State Area, and then used in on the whole world? (If<br>you\'ve never seen the Disney cartoon *Phineas and Ferb*, you won\'t get<br>the Dr. Doofenschmirtz reference, sorry if I lost you there). Seriously,<br>if you\'re going to create a totally non-plausible hypothetical, you<br>need to define the bounds of your hypothetical.\<br>]<br><br>- Do all guns miraculously disappear from the planet with one button<br>  push?<br>- Do all guns miraculously disappear from only the citizens, but the<br>  police can still have them?<br>- Do all guns that are used illegally suddenly disappear?<br>- Do all guns that are purchased illegally suddenly disappear?<br><br>And if all guns miraculously disappear from the planet, do we also lose<br>all knowledge of how to make one?\<br>\<br>Or why?\<br>\<br>And did they disappear before or after the United States was founded,<br>because it was founded with guns, and its entire national identity was<br>built with guns, and the freedom to own guns was built into the national<br>ethos. If guns disappear before then, how did the United States come to<br>be? Did we fight the British with pitchforks and shovels?\<br>\<br>These are important questions to cover in your purely miraculous<br>hypothetical. We need to know the bounds of this thought exercise.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
