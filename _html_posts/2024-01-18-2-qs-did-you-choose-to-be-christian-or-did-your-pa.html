<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I chose to be Christian. My mom trained me to be Catholic.<br><br>My Christian origin story (what we in the church call a *testimony*)<br>began as most Catholics do: attending CCD (Catholic Catechumenal<br>Doctrine) school during my formative years. We learned all of the<br>formulaic prayers and the basics about Catholicism and its beliefs. And<br>I did all of the things I was supposed to do as a Catholic. I<br>volunteered in every role a lay person could do in the church: I was an<br>altar boy, a sacristan, a lector, a cantor, an organist (a paid<br>position) in high school, and a Eucharistic Minister in college.<br><br>But Catholicism wasn't a choice for me; I was trained in it. I was<br>sprinkle baptized as a baby, received my first Holy Communion, and then<br>moved on to Confirmation (which was supposed to be a free choice, but it<br>was expected of you, so it wasn't really a choice).<br><br>The cracks in my faith first started to show in college when I started<br>getting deeper into theological study. I tried to understand how<br>transubstantiation jibed with the doctrine of the *communicatio<br>idiomatum* and when I asked the priest about it, I was dismissed with<br>the "it's just one of those mysteries of the church" answer. Well that<br>didn't sit right with me. And I hate being dismissed like that.<br><br>My roommate, who was Baptist at the time, took me to a<br>non-denominational service off-base. They got to the greeting part, and<br>*people were actually talking to me! They were genuinely happy to be<br>there!* I was shocked. Was this what church was supposed to be like?<br>What do they know about God that I don't?<br><br>That particular interaction started me down a road of discovery which<br>led me away from the Catholic church and to being baptized as an adult<br>as a Christian. That was absolutely my choice. I wasn't born into it. I<br>found it myself. And when I admitted that I was a sinner, and when I<br>tearfully, prayerfully confessed that I wanted Jesus as my savior and to<br>take over my life because *I just couldn't do it anymore*, the **wave of<br>peace** that swept over me was unlike anything I had ever experienced<br>before. It was a turning point in my life, a moment that I will never<br>forget.<br><br>TL;DR: My birth religion wasn't a choice. My true religion was.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
