<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [There is nothing you can do to stop this type of fraud,<br>except find a better way to verify who your clients are, if you are<br>\"C\" transacting C2C business. If you do business, you risk doing<br>business with a fraudster.\<br>\<br>PayPal should not be demanding the money back from you, because you<br>provided a legal, legitimate service to B. The loss is PayPal\'s, not<br>yours. It\'s not your responsibility to pay for PayPal\'s lack of fraud<br>prevention. The onus is on PayPal to correct the fraud situation and<br>stop B from transacting.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
