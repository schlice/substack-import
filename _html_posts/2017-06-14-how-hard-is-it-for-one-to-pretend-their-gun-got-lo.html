<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Committing crimes is not hard. It's no harder to sell your gun illegally<br>than it is to sell it legally. The "black market" is simply when you<br>don't follow the law and/or regulations when you buy or sell your gun.<br>The reason you sell your gun legally is because it protects you. If<br>you sell your gun to someone who uses it to commit a crime and they<br>manage to trace the gun back to you, some will seek to hold you liable<br>for having a part in the crime. Now, I know that this is a tough<br>connection for them to make, but they will try, at great personal<br>expense to both your wallet and your reputation.<br><br>Add to this the fact that you will be discovered as illegally selling a<br>weapon, and the consequences could be staggering, as you can be<br>separately prosecuted for that crime (which you actually did do), and<br>that's a felony. You're looking at a minimum of a year in jail and more<br>fines.<br><br>Finally, as if that wasn't enough, you then want to lie to your<br>insurance company and claim that your property was stolen. In order to<br>do this, you need to file a police report. If you make it through the<br>investigation (and you're not the first person to ever sell stuff and<br>claim it was stolen), you have committed another crime: filing a false<br>report. If you then take the false report and make an insurance claim<br>using it, you have committed *yet another* crime: insurance fraud.<br><br>Personally, I don't think the best remedy for committing a crime is to<br>commit *more crimes.*<br><br>So it's not that it is difficult to do. It's the consequences which<br>could be difficult to live with if you are caught.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
