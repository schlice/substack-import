<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The Presidential Records Act, in a nutshell, establishes that all<br>presidential records are owned by the public, and then it defines what<br>"presidential records" are.<br><br>Then the Act goes into painstaking detail regarding how records *should<br>be* handled during the president's administration, and what should<br>happen to records after a president leaves office.<br><br>Importantly, the Act establishes that presidential records automatically<br>transfer into the legal custody of the Archivist (at the National<br>Archives) once the president leaves office.<br><br>However, if the president's staff *did not* do a good job keeping<br>presidential records and personal records separate while the president<br>was the incumbent (and since the Act has been established, none have<br>done so), the default process is for the departing president to retain<br>all of the records, and then a review process happens between the<br>Archivist and the president's staff to determine which records are<br>presidential records and which are personal records. The presidential<br>records are delivered to the Archivist for filing at the National<br>Archives, and the president retains his personal records, some of which<br>may end up in the presidential library, when it gets established.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
