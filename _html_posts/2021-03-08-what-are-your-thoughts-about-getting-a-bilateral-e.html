<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What are your thoughts about getting a bilateral epididymectomy in<br>order to avoid ever causing any unplanned pregnancies and thus avoid<br>ever being hunted down for 18+ years\' worth of child support?**<br><br>I kinda think that's putting the cart before the horse, but you do you.<br><br>Although you probably wouldn't get a bilateral epididymectomy, you'd<br>probably get a vasectomy. Instead of removing the epididymus, we remove<br>a section of the vas deferens, apply clips and cauterization to both<br>ends, and close. It is generally regarded as less painful and less<br>invasive. Bilateral epididymectomies are generally reserved for those<br>with epididymitis, and even then, only when other interventions for<br>chronic epididymitis are unsuccessful.<br><br>[https://www.mayoclinic.org/disea\...(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=5755cb&url=https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/epididymitis/symptoms-causes/syc-20363853){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="mayoclinic.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>The problem is that the procedure is difficult to reverse without both<br>significant cost and the likelihood of significant pain. Some<br>practitioners will cut costs by using techniques like sub-optimal<br>magnification and local anesthesia. Cutting costs provides for a lower<br>potential for success and increases the chances of side effects.<br><br>Look, it certainly will accomplish your goal. You can have sex with as<br>many women as you want and you'll never have to worry about having to<br>pay 18 years of child support. Just remember that you're making a body<br>alteration which is difficult and possibly quite painful to reverse.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
