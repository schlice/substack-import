<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Any "transgender policy" designed to protect the integrity of female<br>sports need only specify that participants must have been recorded<br>female at birth on their original birth certificates. Or, if no birth<br>certificate listing sex is available, biology, not an individual's<br>feelings, will determine whether the participant would be allowed to<br>compete as a male or a female.<br><br>This is because, as we know, biology is real, immutable, and binary.<br>This should not be a controversial opinion at this point.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
