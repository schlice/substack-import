<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Why has there been no press about some group starting a drive for a US<br>constitutional Amendment to limit the right to bear arms? Has anyone<br>started the process with any success?**<br><br>This has not been done because there is no political will to do so. The<br>vast majority of Americans do not want to limit the rights of tens of<br>millions of law abiding citizens because of the bad actions of a few.<br>The United States was built on individualism and freedom, and having<br>access to tools which can defend your own life is of paramount value in<br>this country.<br><br>The vast majority of Americans are keenly aware that the gun is just a<br>tool. The gun does not drive people to commit murder. Granted, easy<br>access to guns is a factor, but it is not the driving motivation. Take<br>the gun away and the killer will switch to another tool. Terrorists have<br>used pressure cookers to kill and maim. Terrorists have used<br>trucks to kill people, and terrorists have used airplanes to<br>kill people. The tool should not be at issue.<br><br>The vast majority of Americans know that limiting guns does not<br>limit crime. Addressing the root causes of bad behavior are<br>paramount.<br><br>The vast majority of Americans who own legal guns never commit crimes<br>with their guns. Hundreds of millions of guns are currently sitting<br>quietly in home safes, not shooting anyone. We don't punish the gun for<br>the crimes of the criminal.<br><br>The vast majority of Americans know that adding *yet another law* won't<br>stop someone from killing. You do know that murder is already illegal,<br>right? So what law can you add that will stop someone from murdering,<br>when murder is already illegal?<br><br>So no, the Second Amendment is not going anywhere, any time soon.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
