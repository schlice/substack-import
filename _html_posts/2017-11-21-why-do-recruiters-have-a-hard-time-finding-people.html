<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Why do recruiters have a hard time finding people to join the<br>military? Aren't there thousands of Americans that desperately need a<br>job? I assume there are many that want to join but they aren't<br>qualified, like being overweight.**<br><br>Your question makes it seem like there are just *gobs* of military jobs<br>waiting to be filled, and "thousands of Americans that desperately need<br>a job," and ne'er the twain shall meet, save for some lacking in<br>personal motivation.<br><br>I know it's hard to believe, but getting into the military is not as<br>easy as walking in and signing up.<br><br>Here's just one example of just how difficult it is to get into the<br>military.<br><br>When my son was three, he had a birthday party at a gymnastics center.<br>Yeah, there's no way *that* could go wrong. He broke his arm in a break<br>that medical people will recognize right away as a *supracondular<br>fracture*. That night, he had surgery to pin and set the break, since it<br>was clean through his bone. But kids' bones at this age are more the<br>consistency of soap than bone, and one of the pins slipped out. So five<br>days later, he had a second surgery, where they removed the original two<br>pins, replaced it with three pins, and a new cast. He was a trooper<br>through the whole ordeal, and six weeks later, his pins came out. He's<br>had no recurring problems from his broken arm.<br><br>Fast-forward to the Air Force recruiting office. The medical review of<br>the incident revealed that *two surgeries on the same area is a chronic<br>condition* and is very likely a disqualifying condition, although it<br>would be close. It might possibly be waiverable. That, combined with the<br>fact that his father is a disabled veteran with *a disease caused by his<br>own military service* (oh, the irony) which ever-so-slightly increases<br>his risk of contracting the same disease, and he is disqualified. Can't<br>even sign on the dotted line.<br><br>Could he bounce to another service? Probably. We know the Army would<br>take him because he tried there once and they were willing, but they<br>refused to guarantee him the MOS that he wanted, even if it was in<br>writing. He could have gone over to Navy and applied there, but he's<br>*deflated*. He's been disillusioned. And I don't blame him one bit.<br><br>So in many cases, the lack of sufficient new recruits is a problem of<br>the military's own making, and in others, it's a lack of a *good fit*<br>between the candidate and the service. Military service isn't right for<br>everyone, and some people even learn this after they go to basic<br>training.<br><br>(EDIT) Since many of you are telling me that my son's condition<br>shouldn't have been disqualifying, I want to give you a quick update.<br><br>After speaking to the O-6 in charge of recruiting in the area, he<br>agreed. He also revealed a little bit of inside information: the NCO who<br>my son was working with was inventing reasons to decline people and then<br>*stealing their personal information* (which they then had in droves,<br>including copies of social security cards and passports) so that he<br>could sell it. Said NCO was arrested by military police and is awaiting<br>a court-martial. He can expect a long career turning big rocks into<br>little rocks at Leavenworth. The OIC told me to submit my son's packet<br>directly to him, and he would get it to a recruiter who was not a thief.<br><br>So as if it wasn't hard enough already to get into the military, then<br>you have to deal with this. No wonder we have a shortage of good people<br>in the military. They have to get through the gauntlet of bad people<br>guarding the door.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
