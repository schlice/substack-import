<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I think anyone would have a hard time hijacking a plane these days, Air<br>Marshall or not. Flight deck doors have been reinforced against forced<br>entry, and once they are locked from the inside, they are virtually<br>impossible to enter without someone on the inside letting you in.<br><br>Most flight deck doors have an electronic lock with a keypad on the<br>outside. When the code is entered, the door buzzes and a video feed to<br>the outside is activated. The pilots can then either approve the door<br>unlock request or deny it, keeping the door unlocked. If the pilots fail<br>to respond after a certain timeframe (about 1 minute), the door will<br>unlock (this is to allow entry if the cockpit crew has become<br>incapacitated).<br><br>The door has three settings:<br><br>- Open<br>- Locked with password override<br>- Completely locked with no override<br><br>If the flight deck crew is still conscious, there is nothing you can do<br>from the outside to force the door open.<br><br>Now, if the Air Marshall decides to take his service weapon and start<br>killing people, he may convince the flight deck crew to open the door<br>willingly, as in "I will kill one person every minute until you open the<br>door." Hopefully, some passengers will get brave and subdue the marshall<br>until the aircraft can be landed and the marshall can be taken into<br>custody. If they rush him, he can't conceivably shoot all of them before<br>they get to him.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
