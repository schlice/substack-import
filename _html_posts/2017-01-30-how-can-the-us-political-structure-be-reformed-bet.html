<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>TL;DR: Good thing we don't have a pure democracy and we don't elect<br>presidents based on popular vote. We don't need reform: we have the<br>Electoral College, and we have two houses of Congress, which balance<br>state-based representation with population-based representation.<br><br>*The Electoral College*. The Electoral College was put in place for this<br>very reason. Smaller states were upset because they would have less<br>representation when it came to the election. They were concerned about<br>the tyranny of the majority, where demagogues enthrall large<br>populations of people, and groupthink pervades. The demagogue rides a<br>wave of popularity directly to power, and the people not only support<br>his dangerous agenda, they actively encourage it. PRO TIP: if there is<br>dissension between government and groups of people, you're doing it<br>right. The Electoral College uses the same distribution of Electors as<br>we give that state for the House of Representatives (we'll get there in<br>a second) and the Senate. The formula uses the population of the state<br>along with the size of the landmass of the state to determine how many<br>Representatives (or Electors) are granted to each state. This gives<br>smaller states a more equitable say in Presidential elections than<br>larger, or simply more populous, states. Now, instead of populations<br>electing a President, we have *states* which elect a president. Each<br>state holds its own election, and the winner of the election in each<br>state gets the votes of that state's Electors. There are 538 Electors,<br>which equals the 435 members of the House of Representatives, 100<br>members of the Senate, and three representatives from the District of<br>Columbia, as provided for by the 12th Amendment.<br><br>*Congress*. The same debates which took place later regarding elections<br>took place earlier regarding Congress. Smaller states wanted more<br>representation, and feared the tyranny of the majority. Centralized<br>authority advocates feared having their state's will overridden by<br>smaller states or more distant states that had no relation to them. The<br>framers came up with, I think, a rather brilliant plan. It took pieces<br>from England's parliamentary system and improved on it. They created two<br>Houses of Congress, each with a unique configuration. The layout, by the<br>way, is all detailed in Article I of the Constitution. It is a true<br>combination of population-based representation, and state-based<br>representation, as is much of the Constitution.<br><br>- The House of Representatives is made up of a certain number of<br>  Representatives from each state. That number is determined by the<br>  population of that state (which is determined every ten years as part<br>  of the US Census). The state population provides for congressional<br>  districts, which each get one member of the House of Representatives.<br>  This is population-based representation.<br>- To balance this population/landmass representation, we also have a<br>  Senate, which is composed of two Senators from every state. In this<br>  body, all states are equal, and no state has any more or less<br>  influence than any other state. This is state-based representation.<br><br>Congress functions (when it actually does) because it has a mix of both<br>state-based and population-based representation.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
