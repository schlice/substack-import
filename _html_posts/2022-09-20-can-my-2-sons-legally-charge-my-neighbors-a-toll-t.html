<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Your trolling is a bit sad.<br><br>Looking at the 6 questions you have asked since you joined Quora in<br>August of 2013, you are either<br><br>- a male, married to a woman, with a 14-year old son who you want to<br>  punish by forcing him to wear diapers,<br>- an elderly woman with a hermit living in her basement<br>- a man who asks others if they would be "sucked by a gay"<br>- a person whose landlord apparently opens his mail because of a clause<br>  in his rental agreement,<br>- a person who has a daughter and has no idea who should be "grooming"<br>  her,<br>- or a person with two sons who apparently are the trolls on the bridge,<br>  charging people a "toll" to use a public road, and threatening people<br>  with deadly force. Where I live, you wouldn't last five minutes<br>  wielding a firearm and threatening motorists. The Sheriff's Office<br>  responds very quickly to high priority calls.<br><br>The Quora Partner Program has produced some of the finest examples of<br>trolls to have ever been invented. But you're not one of them.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
