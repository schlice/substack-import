<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>It's not complex at all. I don't understand why we make it so complex.<br><br>If you want to participate in gender-separated sports, you participate<br>as the gender recorded on your birth certificate at birth. If a birth<br>certificate doesn't exist (or there is question as to whether the gender<br>was correctly recorded at birth), then biology determines your<br>gender for the purposes of participation in sports, not personal<br>feelings.<br><br>That said, the problem of intersex people is a much harder problem to<br>tackle, *but a much less pressing issue for protecting the integrity of<br>women's sports.*<br><br>\<br><br>*NOTE: I do not allow anyone in my comments section who has blocked me<br>from responding. I'd love to communicate with you, but if you do not<br>allow me to respond, then I do not allow your comments on my answer.<br>Also note that this courtesy is limited. I will only tolerate hateful<br>behavior for a limited time before I am done wasting my time (and yours)<br>and will just delete the whole thing. Plan accordingly.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
