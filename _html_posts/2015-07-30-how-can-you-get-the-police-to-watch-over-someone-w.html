<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [You did exactly the right thing. Welfare checks are common<br>and police don\'t mind checking on someone. Better to check on them<br>while they are not causing harm to themselves or others than after they<br>start.\<br>\<br>You called the non-emergency number, which was also the right thing to<br>do.\<br>\<br>You did everything right.\<br>\<br>The police probably stopped by to see if she was there, ask her if<br>everything was okay, ask her what her plans were, advise her of any<br>curfew laws that may exist in that jurisdiction for persons under 18,<br>and if everything checked out, leave her alone, unless it was past<br>curfew and she had no plans, in which case they would make her call<br>someone to pick her up.\<br>\<br>If the officers had reason to believe that she might hurt herself or<br>others, they could elect to take her into protective custody so that<br>they could be sure she didn\'t cause herself any harm. But that\'s a<br>judgement call on the part of the officers.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
