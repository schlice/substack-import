<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>You mean, like with his super-secret trump card (see what I did there?)<br>that he created while he was President that gives him "Supreme Leader<br>Over All" powers that he can delete a Supreme Court decision?<br><br>Sure, but I think he lost his wallet in the move out of the White House.<br>So that trump card is gone. Darn, I guess not.<br><br>\<br><br>All kidding aside, the Supreme Court isn't the last word because they're<br>always right. The Supreme Court is always right because they're the last<br>word.<br><br>There is no other word beyond them. Once they render a decision, that<br>decision is final. To my knowledge, the Supreme Court has never<br>overturned a decision that was already overturned. They've never<br>"overturned an overturn."<br><br>And why would they? They found that the original ruling had no<br>Constitutional basis. Would a subsequent Court find that the decision<br>actually *had* Constitutional basis? It makes no sense.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Can Trump reverse Roe v. Wade?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
