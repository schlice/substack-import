<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What Does Jesus mean when he says you cannot serve both God and<br>mammon. How do I respond to this Guy on YouTube?**<br><br>First, "mammon" is an old word which basically means wealth or greed, or<br>sometimes those things personified as a false god. In modern language,<br>we can just say "money" or "the acquisition of money."<br><br>What's important from this passage in the Bible, however, is what it<br>does not say. It does not say that you cannot *lov*e both God and<br>money. It says that you cannot *serve* both God and money.<br><br>The whole verse:<br><br>> Do not treasure up for yourselves treasures on the earth, where moth<br>> and rust cause them to vanish, and where thieves dig through and<br>> steal. But treasure up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where<br>> neither moth nor rust make them vanish, and where thieves do not dig<br>> through and steal. For where your treasure is, there your heart will<br>> be also.\<br>> ---Matthew 6:19--21 NIV<br>><br>> No one can serve two masters. Either you will hate the one and love<br>> the other, or you will be devoted to the one and despise the other.<br>> You cannot serve both God and money.\<br>> ---Matthew 6:24 NIV<br><br>"For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also."<br><br>Who or what you *serve* is quite different from who or what you *love*.<br>You can love lots of things, but who or what you *serve* comes first in<br>your life. If you *serve* the acquisition of wealth and possessions, if<br>that comes before God in your heart, you actually don't love God,<br>because God says that he is to be first in your heart.<br><br>In other words, you can love lots of things, but you can only serve one<br>master. God says to *serve* him. The acquisition of wealth comes later.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
