<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I'm glad that you want to learn this information! It's only useful at<br>the very moment you need it, but you need to know it before you<br>actually need to use it.<br><br>I would highly recommend getting your CPR certification from the<br>American Red Cross (assuming you are in the United States).<br><br>If you are in the United States, [[please check<br>here](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=bc971e&url=http://www.redcross.org/take-a-class/cpr){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="redcross.org"}]{.qlink_container} to see where you can find<br>the nearest class.<br><br>The maneuver you will be learning is called the Heimlich Maneuver, also<br>called "[[abdominal<br>thrusts](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=266008&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_thrusts){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}." In practice, it's a<br>very odd sensation to attempt to do these and not feel slightly<br>perverted while you are doing it. Essentially, assuming your victim is<br>upright, you are "hugging" the victim from the rear, as close as you can<br>get to the victim (i.e. your chest flat up against their back), and you<br>reach around to their abdomen, just below the ribcage. Form a fist with<br>one hand, and cup the fist with the other hand. The fist is placed on<br>the abdomen, and with upward thrusts, you basically want to make a<br>motion as if you are trying to lift the victim off of the ground. This<br>will force air out of the lungs and will force the lodged item out of<br>the throat.<br><br>What you do not want to do is slap the victim on the back. This will<br>only serve to lodge the item further into the throat. The only time you<br>*might* slap anyone on the back is with an infant, and that is only when<br>you *invert* the infant with one hand, and slap the back with the other<br>hand. This is a more skilled maneuver, and the maneuver which is<br>preferred is the prone abdominal thrusts and the finger sweep to clear<br>the mouth. This may need to be followed by CPR if the victim is not<br>breathing, so just knowing Heimlich is good, but incomplete knowledge to<br>effect a rescue.<br><br>Perfecting the execution of these techniques takes a little hands-on<br>practice, which is why I highly recommend a class.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
