<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If you accidentally scratched someone's car while parking, but no one<br>saw you do it, how big would the scratch have to be for you to leave a<br>note for the car's owner?**<br><br>*(US-only answer)*<br><br>There are many answers here, and most of them are wrong.<br><br>If you scratch someone's car with your car, that's an auto accident.<br>Doesn't matter if there's a dent, or a ding, or anything else. If there<br>was vehicle-to-vehicle contact and there is visible damage, an accident<br>has legally occurred. Even scratching the finish on the car constitutes<br>"visible damage." Interestingly, if your cars come in contact but there<br>is no damage, an accident has *not* occurred.<br><br>If you leave the scene *without leaving a note*, it's not only an auto<br>accident, but now it's a hit and run, or in more formal terms, *leaving<br>the scene of an accident*. This is a moving violation, and not only will<br>your insurance have to pay the damages, but if you commit a hit and run,<br>your insurance rates will go up, guaranteed. How much depends on how<br>much the damages cost to fix, but it will be *significant*.<br><br>Not only that, but it's likely that you were seen by someone or<br>something, somewhere. If not a person, potentially a security camera. If<br>you leave, and the police have to track you down, not only will you get<br>the moving violation, you'll get points on your license (which also<br>raises your insurance rates, and can cause you to lose work related to<br>driving), and it's likely that the *other guy's insurance* will also<br>come after you for costs associated with investigations. You could risk<br>running, but it's not a winning bet, and if you were seen, it will be<br>*far more costly than staying.*<br><br>So, what do you do?<br><br>1.  Stay. You have been involved in an accident, regardless of how<br>    small the damages are. As I said above, an automobile accident is<br>    legally classified as vehicle-to-vehicle contact which results in<br>    *any* visible damage. If you stay, it's literally no big deal. Your<br>    insurance will pay the damage to the car you scratched (your<br>    property damage liability coverage), and your car will be covered by<br>    your own collision insurance (after your deductible). As long as you<br>    haven't scratched many vehicles recently (and as long as you weren't<br>    ticketed for the accident), your rates will most likely not go up.<br>2.  Look for witnesses. Either take their contact information, or<br>    video record their statement along with a view of their<br>    identification.<br>3.  If the owner does not show up, or you can't locate the owner after<br>    "reasonable attempts" to do so, leave a note. Many states<br>    *require* that you leave a note in a "conspicuous place" if you<br>    cannot locate the owner. Under the wiper blade is the most common<br>    location. You must leave a note with your name, your address, a<br>    contact phone number, and an explanation of the accident (so that<br>    the victim can't claim that you crushed his car when you only<br>    scratched the paint). In some states, you are required to leave your<br>    insurance policy number if you know it, and your insurance carrier.<br>    Don't say anything else in your note, because any content you write<br>    in the note can be used against you in legal proceedings when the<br>    insurance companies are settling up the charges. And writing your<br>    note with a felt-tip marker so that it might "accidentally" smear<br>    out in the rain? I wouldn't. That's classified as not leaving a note<br>    at all, and in the states that require it, you could be fined for<br>    not doing so. Use a ball-point pen or a pencil.<br>4.  Also, to combat potential insurance fraud, take pictures. Ensure<br>    you capture the vehicle's license plate, as well as the damage to<br>    the car. Also, *take a picture of your note* before you stick it<br>    under the wiper. Again, this can help you combat insurance fraud.<br>5.  Finally, call your insurance company. Report the scratch. This<br>    will help to speed the claim process along, and they can help you<br>    with any other legal requirements you may have in your state<br>    regarding what to do.<br><br>\<br><br>Hi readers!
