<br><br><h2>Space Submission</h2><br><div><br><br>Space name: Christians & Christianity<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>So you're looking for good proof of God's existence, which is what I<br>understood your question to be.<br><br>If it's so difficult to prove God's existence, let's try something that,<br>in theory, should be much easier:<br><br>Prove that God doesn't exist.<br><br>Let me stop you before you try to answer that; it was a rhetorical<br>question. You can't prove that God does not exist.<br><br>As legal scholar and philosopher Mortimer Adler said, \"An affirmative<br>existential proposition can be proved, but a negative existential<br>proposition\--one that denies the existence of something\--cannot be<br>proved.\" For example, someone may claim that a red eagle exists and<br>someone else may assert that red eagles do not exist. The former only<br>needs to find a single red eagle to prove his assertion. But the latter<br>must comb the entire universe and literally be in every place at once to<br>ensure they have not missed a red eagle somewhere and at some time,<br>which is impossible to do.<br><br>This is why you cannot prove that God does not exist.<br><br>But even that aside, that doesn't prove that God exists, does it? No, of<br>course not.<br><br>So let's look at it this way:<br><br>- We exist. We are not an illusion.<br>- We didn't create ourselves, because you can't exist before you<br>  existed, and spontaneous self-creation isn't a thing.<br>- Therefore, we were created by a necessary and eternal *something*.<br>  Note that it must be eternal, because anything that has a beginning<br>  has a cause. Nothing exists without a cause, unless it is eternal and<br>  uncaused. So whatever created us must be eternal. If it has a<br>  beginning, then it must have been caused by something else. The Law of<br>  Causation says this.<br>- There are only two possible causes for us: an eternal universe, or an<br>  eternal creator.<br>- Science and philosophy have proven that the universe had a beginning,<br>  and is therefore not eternal. We were, therefore, not created by the<br>  universe. The universe had a beginning and thus a cause, so it could<br>  not have been our creator.\<br>  \<br>  Additionally, the Law of Causation goes on to say that an effect must<br>  resemble its cause. Atheists have yet to explain how an impersonal,<br>  purposeless, meaningless, and amoral universe accidentally created<br>  beings (us) who are full of personality and obsessed with purpose,<br>  meaning, and morals.<br>- Therefore, the only remaining option is an eternal creator.<br><br>Clearly, there is a lot more detail than this, and this alone can't<br>answer all of your questions. If I may, a really good book to read on<br>this very topic is called [[*I Don't Have Enough Faith to be an<br>Atheist*](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=770f5b&url=https://www.amazon.com/Dont-Have-Enough-Faith-Atheist/dp/1433580756){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="amazon.com"}]{.qlink_container}. It goes through the entire<br>argument very slowly and carefully, and the logic is sound. I really<br>suggest you read it.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>I have been trying to look for good proof of God and I'm struggling.<br>What do you think would help me? Does God even need proof?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
