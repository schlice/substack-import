<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>There are not multiple versions of the Bible. There are multiple<br>translations of the Bible, and translation, as a matter of course,<br>alters words. *How* the translation is done is the reason why there are<br>so many different types of translations.<br><br>To understand this, you must understand that there is not a "one-to-one"<br>correlation between languages. For example, Hebrew has fewer words than<br>English. Therefore, many words in Hebrew have multiple meanings. It's up<br>to the translator to pick the correct word in English to express what<br>the original author was trying to say in Hebrew. Similarly, there are no<br>fewer than six different words for "love" in Greek (familial love,<br>platonic love, love between dear friends, erotic love, etc.), but in<br>English, we only have "love."<br><br>Therefore, when creating a Bible translation, you can either stick very<br>closely to the original words, but you may have a hard time<br>understanding the meaning of what the original author was trying to say,<br>or you can reproduce what the author was trying to say, and stick less<br>closely to the original words.<br><br>Translations which stick very closely to the words are called "word for<br>word" translations. They will very closely retain fidelity to the<br>original words used, but some of the original meaning may be "lost in<br>translation." To try to account for this, some translations will use a<br>"thought for thought" method of translating. The translator will read a<br>sentence and then re-write it in the target language, trying to retain<br>the original words as often as possible, but will more frequently try to<br>retain the original thought that a person reading it in the source<br>language would have understood. Finally, translators may take a<br>"paraphrase" method of translation, where translators will read an<br>entire passage and re-state it in the target language, without concern<br>to the original words, solely trying to "paraphrase" the original idea.<br>As you move from "word for word" translations towards "paraphrase"<br>translations, the translations become more easily understandable and<br>easier to follow along (in fact, some of the paraphrase translations,<br>like *The Message*, read like a novel), but retain less fidelity to the<br>original words used.<br><br>Here's a handy graph of many of the current translations and where they<br>fall on that spectrum:<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-6318b071f7b5cf5baf42863acee2fb10){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-6318b071f7b5cf5baf42863acee2fb10" master_w="730"<br>master_h="417"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
