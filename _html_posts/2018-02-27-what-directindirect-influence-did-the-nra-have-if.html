<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What direct/indirect influence did the NRA have (if any) on SCOTUS'<br>decision in District of Columbia v. Heller to change the long-standing<br>interpretation of the 2nd Amendment from collective rights<br>interpretation to individual rights interpretation?**<br><br>First of all, I'll ignore your begging of the question, framing the<br>issue as a "long-standing collective rights" interpretation --- it was<br>nothing of the sort. If that were the case, every one of the over 330<br>million firearms sales to anyone except for a military member would have<br>been in violation of the Constitution, but that's a separate question,<br>and I won't address it here.<br><br>The NRA was one of [[47<br>organizations](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=0724ac&url=http://www.scotusblog.com/2008/02/amicus-briefs-for-heller-available-in-guns-case/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="scotusblog.com"}]{.qlink_container} who filed *amicus<br>curiae* briefs ("friend of the court" briefs) on behalf of Heller. An<br>amicus curiae brief (or an "amicus brief" for short) is a legal document<br>filed with the court by a non-litigant in the case, but who has a strong<br>opinion about the subject. Briefs advise the court about relevant<br>information from a person, group, or industry which may not be<br>represented by the litigants. Briefs may also advise the court about<br>relevant arguments that the court may not have considered.<br><br>A well-written brief can have a significant impact on judicial<br>proceedings. Some cases are actually decided by an argument solely<br>introduced in an amicus. Findings may be narrowed or broadened based on<br>legal arguments in a persuasive amicus.<br><br>The court has the authority to approve or deny parties to file briefs as<br>amici curiae.<br><br>How much persuasion any one brief had in this particular case is only<br>known to SCOTUS.<br><br>Here's some notable quotes from the NRA's brief:<br><br>> "In adopting the Second Amendment, the Framers guaranteed an<br>> individual right to keep and bear arms for private purposes, not a<br>> collective right to keep and bear arms only in connection with state<br>> militia service."<br>><br>> "By its terms, the Amendment protects the right 'of the people' to<br>> keep and bear arms. The holder of the right is unambiguous: it is not<br>> the States, it is 'the people' themselves."<br>><br>> "Americans' personal right to possess . . . firearms for hunting or<br>> self-defense was part of the essence of the Framers' view of<br>> themselves as a free and democratic people. Had Americans in 1787 been<br>> told that the federal government could ban the frontiersman in his log<br>> cabin, or the city merchant living above his store, from keeping<br>> firearms to provide for and protect himself and his family, it is hard<br>> to imagine that the Constitution would have been ratified."<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
