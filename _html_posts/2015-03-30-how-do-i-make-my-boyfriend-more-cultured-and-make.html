<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [You have to set boundaries in your life and your<br>relationship. You can\'t control him, you can\'t change him, but you can<br>control you, and you have the right to be comfortable with him. To do<br>that, you set boundaries for interaction with you.\<br>]<br><br>- He doesn\'t have to like jazz, but you can set a boundary that you<br>  won\'t be subjected to rap while you drive with him. He can either<br>  listen to jazz, or listen to nothing. It\'s not fair to you to force<br>  you to listen to something you find objectionable. (By the way, I<br>  totally agree about rap, most of it is very degrading towards women. I<br>  *rarely* hear rap \"songs\" that promote a positive image of<br>  women - they mostly talk about getting rich, drinking, smoking weed,<br>  and performing sexual acts with women, but never is the word \"woman\"<br>  used; it\'s always the word for a female dog. Don\'t get me wrong,<br>  some artists have some good songs, but by and large, the genre is<br>  filled with the aforementioned activities.)\<br>- You can have an intelligent conversation without interjecting personal<br>  anecdotes. He can choose to not be objective while having a<br>  conversation, but your boundary is that you will not have personal<br>  anecdotes injected into conversations. When he starts to do that, you<br>  can interrupt him and say, \"Remember, we agreed, no personal<br>  anecdotes.\"<br><br>You have to learn to take people as they are. You don\'t take a<br>boyfriend because you can fix him. An old quote I heard about marriage<br>was \"Women marry men hoping they will change, and they don\'t. Men<br>marry women hoping they won\'t change, and they do.\" If you\'re<br>expecting to \"make him better,\" you\'re in for a rude awakening: you<br>can\'t make anyone do anything they don\'t want to do, and usually if<br>you try you\'ll just get the opposite reaction. If you can\'t accept him<br>the way he is, it\'s time to move on.\<br>\<br>Remember, you can only control you. Try this mental exercise to help<br>you: Stand in one spot and draw a circle around your feet. Everything<br>inside the circle, you can change. Everything outside the circle, you<br>can\'t change. You can set boundaries at the circle for interacting with<br>you, but you can\'t change others outside the circle.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
