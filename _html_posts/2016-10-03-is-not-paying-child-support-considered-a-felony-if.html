<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Short answer: it depends on the state. Some states call the crime<br>"Nonsupport of a Child," which in Indiana for example is a Class D<br>felony.<br><br>Longer answer: It is counterproductive to jail parents who refuse to pay<br>child support. It's the same reason we got rid of debtor's prisons over<br>200 years ago. When you put someone in prison, they most assuredly won't<br>be able to pay child support, so you're not actually improving anything.<br>The goal of the laws is to be a deterrent against failure to pay,<br>instead of a mandatory sentence.<br><br>At a federal level, the Child Support Enforcement Act of 1984 grants<br>districts attorneys and state attorneys generals the authority to<br>collect back child support on behalf of custodial parents. This and<br>other federal child support initiatives are managed by the Office of<br>Child Support Enforcement within the U.S. Department of Health and Human<br>Services (DHHS).<br><br>A deadbeat parent's failure to follow directives from a district<br>attorney or state authority could subject them to penalties including<br>jail time. However, like I said, since a jailed parent is unlikely to be<br>able to make regular payments, it is reserved as a last resort and used<br>more as a deterrent. Because the goal is to encourage parents to pay<br>child support, enforcement typically begins with the removal of certain<br>privileges and/or the application of certain restrictions. For example,<br>a parent owing more than \$2,500 in support may be denied a passport<br>until he or she pays their past due balance.<br><br>In accordance with the Act, state attorneys may take any of the<br>following enforcement measures against a delinquent non-custodial<br>parent:<br><br>- Garnishment of wages<br>- Liens against property or real estate<br>- Reporting the debtor to credit bureaus<br>- Freezing bank accounts<br>- Suspension of professional or driver\'s license (in some states)<br>- Contempt order<br>- Jail time \[1\](#tVlwf){#cite-tVlwf .citation_link}<br><br>If a parent simply cannot pay, it's very unlikely that they will<br>actually go to jail simply because they don't have the money to pay. The<br>parent who cannot pay must make a motion in court to modify the child<br>support order, taking into account the parent's current financial<br>situation. Child support is one of the debts that cannot be waived<br>through bankruptcy proceedings.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-tVlwf){.citation_index} [[Enforcement and Collection of<br>Back Child Support -<br>FindLaw](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=f3f77f&url=http://family.findlaw.com/child-support/enforcement-and-collection-of-back-child-support.html){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="findlaw.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
