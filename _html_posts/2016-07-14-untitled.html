<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>They were trying what we call "pain compliance" when you're dealing with<br>an uncooperative suspect.<br><br>However, they did it wrong.<br><br>Pain compliance is useful in an actively struggling individual. Pain<br>compliance isn't very effective in a docile, but simply non-compliant<br>individual. Physical manipulation of a docile, non-struggling<br>non-compliant person is most likely better than pain compliance. Pain<br>compliance works better on an aggressive person as it may induce them to<br>be less aggressive or face more pain. It simply doesn't work as well on<br>the non-aggressive person.<br><br>Regardless, it sounds like that department needs a refresher on pain<br>compliance.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/What-do-the-police-think-of-the-public-saving-a-14-year-old-from-an-unjustified-arrest/answer/Bill-Stein<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
