<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Does the president have to meet certain criteria to declare a national<br>emergency?**<br><br>No. The National Emergencies Act does not require that there be any<br>criteria met before the President can declare a national emergency.<br>Courts and Congress have generally deferred to the President when it<br>comes to what constitutes a national emergency.<br><br>> Beyond the limitations outlined in \10 USC\ ยง 2808(a), the<br>> \National Emergencies Act\ does not provide any explicit criteria or<br>> guidance for the president regarding what type of circumstances would<br>> qualify as a "national emergency" for purposes of this construction<br>> authority. Both the courts and Congress have typically been<br>> deferential to presidential declarations of national emergencies. For<br>> example, in the context of economic sanctions under the International<br>> Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA)---which was enacted in part to<br>> limit the president's ability to declare unending national<br>> emergencies---courts have generally deferred to the executive's<br>> decisions regarding whether a particular foreign policy issue creates<br>> a national emergency sufficient to invoke IEEPA's authorities, along<br>> with the underlying factual determinations by the executive<br>> branch.\[1\](#EYUql){#cite-EYUql .citation_link}<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-EYUql){.citation_index} [[Declaring an Emergency to Build<br>a Border Wall: The Statutory<br>Arguments](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=58ade2&url=https://www.lawfareblog.com/declaring-emergency-build-border-wall-statutory-arguments){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="lawfareblog.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
