<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>As with all legal questions, the answer is "it depends."<br><br>Also be aware that there are two presidential actions: pardon and<br>commutation. Pardon means that the conviction is wiped out as if it<br>never happened. Commutation only happens after the person is convicted.<br>Commutation "completes the sentence" as if the person completely served<br>the sentence. The conviction remains, but any sentence which remains is<br>commuted.<br><br>In order to answer the question, you would have to refer to the pardon.<br>Regardless of whether the pardon was preemptive, or whether it pardoned<br>an actual conviction, the pardon wipes out the conviction or it wipes<br>out the ability to bring a charge for that time period or that crime,<br>depending on what the pardon says.<br><br>However, that only applies to *that time period* for a preemptive<br>pardon, or to *that* *specific crime* for a conviction pardon. If the<br>charge falls outside of that window, the person can still be charged.<br><br>There are also situations where a person can still be charged *in<br>relation to* that crime, but not *for* that crime. For example, let's<br>take Hunter Biden, who was pardoned for any crimes he may have committed<br>during a specified period of time. If Hunter is called before a House<br>subcommittee to testify *about* what has happened, he would have to<br>testify. He cannot claim a Fifth Amendment exemption from testimony<br>since he cannot be charged. And if he lies about the information under<br>oath, he can be charged with lying to Congress. So while he can't be<br>charged with whatever crime he may have committed, if he commits a *new*<br>crime related to the original crime, *that* crime is chargeable.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
