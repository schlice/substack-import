They are ridiculously expensive and are<br>heavily regulated at the state level.<br><br>Also note that those legal, automatic weapons have never been used<br>in crime since they were heavily regulated. Criminal have used their<br>illegal variants many times, but the legal ones are never used in<br>criminal activity.<br><br>So whatever "agreement" journalists want to come to over automatic<br>weapons, I think we'd all agree that in the US, we've done an excellent<br>job of regulating automatic weapons.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
