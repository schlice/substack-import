<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What and when did the right allow themselves to become fully<br>indoctrinated by the Trump administration's rhetoric to the point<br>they\'ve given up science and logic?**<br><br>I suppose if you can show how "the right has given up science and logic"<br>then maybe this question can be answered. But without more detail, we<br>cannot answer this question other than to say "the right (whoever<br>specifically that is) has not given up science and/or logic."<br><br>In fact, I'd go so far as to say "the right is more invested in<br>science and/or logic than the left."<br><br>Now let's see who can back up those statements.<br><br>(EDIT) I have left comments open, but I'm literally not going to debate<br>every stupid thing Trump has ever said. Trump is not a politician. He<br>doesn't have a practiced vocabulary. He is not an orator like Obama.<br><br>Instead, let's focus on *policy*. What policies has Trump implemented<br>which have abandoned science and logic? What has he done, not what<br>has he said, which has abandoned science and logic? At the end of<br>the day, a blowhard is a blowhard, and we know Trump is bombastic, and<br>his brain-to-mouth filter shut off decades ago. And he was elected that<br>way, so retroactively criticizing him for his run-on mouth is<br>unjustified. So let's instead focus on what makes sense: the policies he<br>has implemented which abandoned science or logic.<br><br>Please don't bother telling me what Trump *said*. Show me what Trump<br>*did* to make your point.<br><br>(EDIT 2) And if you're going to show me what he did, then do so, but<br>make sure that it violates science or logic. Share your logical<br>syllogism for what you are stating violates logic. Violating logic<br>doesn't mean, "Trump is just so...illogical!" That's not a violation of<br>logic. Violations of logic fail logical syllogism calculations.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
