<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Why are President Trump's supporters attacking the Virginia restaurant<br>that refused service to Sarah Huckabee Sanders?**<br><br>Businesses can refuse to serve anyone for any non-protected reason, as<br>long as they are *consistent* with their behavior.<br><br>As long as they deny service to *every* government employee, they are<br>legally okay. But denying service to *one* government employee and not<br>*all* of them is inconsistent, and is probably something the law would<br>refer to as *discrimination*. The Civil Rights Act made discrimination<br>illegal. Just as you can't discriminate against a person simply because<br>you don't like what they're wearing (unless you don't allow that article<br>of clothing in your establishment at all, regardless of who is wearing<br>it), you can't discriminate against a person simply because you don't<br>like them personally, or you don't like what they do for a living.<br><br>While she may have a good case for a discrimination lawsuit, she<br>probably will just drop it.<br><br>And in a free-market economy, people have the right to protest and<br>boycott the restaurant for its treatment. That's how we should be<br>dealing with these types of issues: with our wallets.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
