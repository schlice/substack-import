<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Let's clarify terms. The people I'll call "vaxxers" are people who<br>believe that the government should force everyone who is able to get the<br>vaccine whether they want to or not, because it's best for everyone.<br><br>The people I'll call "vaxx-choice" believe that their immune systems<br>will handle the virus just like their immune systems handle everything<br>else that is thrown its way. They'll possibly get COVID-19, and they'll<br>also possibly (although it's a slim chance) end up in the hospital.<br>There is also the possibility that they will die. They accept this<br>possibility. This group also includes people who have already contracted<br>COVID-19 and have antibodies against the virus naturally, and don't<br>believe they should need to get the vaccine.<br><br>By this point in time, people should all have heard that COVID-19<br>exists. They should know that it causes upper respiratory issues. It can<br>hospitalize you, and it can kill you. They also are fully aware that a<br>vaccine exists, but it has not been approved by the FDA. The FDA has<br>granted it an "Emergency Use Authorization" **which is not a full<br>approval.** The vaccine is only temporarily approved to use with<br>patient's consent, knowing that it has only been anecdotally tested.<br>Full-scale testing is ongoing, and the people being tested are the<br>people who have received the vaccine. Yes, for every one of us who got<br>the vaccine, we are in the test group. The vaccine is being tested on<br>us. Don't believe me? You mean you didn't get information about the<br>[[CDC's v-safe<br>program](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=ac9d33&url=https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/vsafe.html){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="cdc.gov"}]{.qlink_container} when you got the vaccine?<br>They're watching you for symptoms and to see if you develop COVID-19.<br><br>Additionally, recently there have been spikes in disease activity. There<br>is a Delta variant out there as well. What we've learned is that<br>[[nearly all of the new COVID deaths are among the<br>unvaccinated](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=82cbab&url=https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-health-941fcf43d9731c76c16e7354f5d5e187){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="apnews.com"}]{.qlink_container}. What we don't know is what<br>percentage of those infections are in people who have already had<br>COVID-19 and got better. In other words, we don't know if any of these<br>people had it and got it again.<br><br>From that article:<br><br>> An Associated Press analysis of available government data from May<br>> shows that "breakthrough" infections in fully vaccinated people<br>> accounted for fewer than 1,200 of more than 107,000 COVID-19<br>> hospitalizations. That's about 1.1%.<br>><br>> And only about 150 of the more than 18,000 COVID-19 deaths in May were<br>> in fully vaccinated people. That translates to about 0.8%, or five<br>> deaths per day on average.<br><br>None of the previous was opinion. It is all fact. Regardless, these<br>facts tell us two things.<br><br>- If you don't want to get COVID-19 and you haven't had it yet, get the<br>  vaccine.<br>- If you have the vaccine, the chances are literally slim to none that<br>  you'll get sick with it.<br><br>There are some anecdotal reports of some businesses not offering sick<br>time to account for the side effects of the vaccine, which can take a<br>few days from which to recover, and this is causing some hesitancy<br>amongst some to get the vaccine, but the vast majority who haven't<br>gotten the vaccine are "vaxx-choicers" using my definitions from the<br>above.<br><br>So the question now becomes: **why are vaxx-choicers not getting the<br>vaccine?**<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-e4a71f3a0989df90fabd679436d72991){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-e4a71f3a0989df90fabd679436d72991"<br>master_w="1170" master_h="651"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>*(Image courtesy Christian Emmer,* [[*CC-BY-NC<br>4.0*](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=51a49a&url=https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="creativecommons.org"}]{.qlink_container}*)*<br><br>Nearly all of them fully understand everything we've already pointed<br>out. They fully understand that you risk dying by not getting the<br>vaccine. They also fully know that if you're vaccinated, your risk of<br>getting the virus is virtually zero.<br><br>They don't care.<br><br>They also believe that the government hasn't really acted in the most<br>trustworthy way throughout the course of the pandemic. The government<br>has not been completely forthright with all of the information it had,<br>and they question the government's motivations in all things, not just<br>vaccinations.<br><br>In other words, they don't trust the government.<br><br>Trump is literally just pointing out the obvious: some people just don't<br>trust the government. But he never told people to not be vaccinated; in<br>fact, he's been out there saying that people should get vaccinated. He<br>also said that the vaccine was safe, and that's not necessarily true.<br>The only thing we can say for sure is that the vaccine is safer than<br>COVID for some people. The virus literally has a 99.8% survivability<br>rate. Can we truthfully say the same thing about what will happen 20<br>years down the road after a COVID vaccination? However, we do know that<br>for today, for the vulnerable population, the vaccine is marginally<br>safer than COVID infection.<br><br>And the only way you can protect yourself from COVID is the vaccine.<br><br>Whether or not you choose to risk infection is entirely up to you. It's<br>not up to anyone else. The "vaxxers" believe that it's up to you to<br>keep them safe. That's illogical. That's not how we do healthcare in<br>this country. We don't keep you safe by making sure that no one around<br>you can get sick. We keep you safe by making sure that you can't get<br>sick. Like everything in this country, with very few exceptions,<br>healthcare is an individual choice. And the choice about whether or not<br>to be vaccinated is also an individual choice.<br><br>TL;DR: Trump is basically pointing out the obvious, that some people<br>just don't trust the government.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Trump issued a statement saying: \"People are refusing to take the<br>vaccine because they don\'t trust his (Biden\'s) Administration, and<br>they don\'t trust the election results\" Just how dangerous is this kind<br>of rhetoric, when Trump makes this comparison?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
