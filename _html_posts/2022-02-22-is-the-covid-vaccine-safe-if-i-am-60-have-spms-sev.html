<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The correct answer is talk to your neurologist.<br><br>Before you get the COVID vaccine, check with your neurologist, as he or<br>she may want you to modify your MS therapy drug regimen to allow the<br>vaccine to work properly.<br><br>But to clarify a point you made, your reaction to the flu shot was<br>unrelated to your MS. It may have been related to the drugs you were<br>taking at the time, but MS does not cause allergic reactions.<br><br>The only considerations you have to make now are your risk of exposure<br>to COVID, your risk if you contract COVID, and your other drugs,<br>especially your MS therapy drug(s).<br><br>But you need to make that decision ***with your neurologist and/or your<br>care team.*** Make sure you discuss the COVID vaccine you wish to get,<br>and whether or not you need to modify your MS therapy drugs before you<br>take it, and to weigh your risks and benefits.<br><br>Your healthcare is unique to *you*. Don't let anyone tell you that<br>you're stupid if you don't get the vaccine, or that you must get it to<br>make society better. That's just irrational and groupthink-y. You make<br>the decision that is best for you and your health, with your doctor's<br>assistance.<br><br>*Come visit us in the* [[*MS<br>Forum*](https://multiplesclerosisforum.quora.com/)]{.qlink_container}*!*<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Is the Covid vaccine safe if I am 60, have SPMS, severe depression and<br>anxiety, and had a bad reaction to the flu shot 25 years ago with RRMS?<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*This answer is not professional medical advice**, nor is it a<br>substitute for professional medical advice.
