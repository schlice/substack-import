<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Will Democrats be successful in receiving an unredacted copy of the<br>full Mueller report now that The House Judiciary Committee approved<br>their subpoena?**<br><br>Nope.<br><br>AG Barr has shown that he follows the law as it is written. Even a<br>subpoena cannot authorize someone to break the law, so it's unlikely<br>that this AG will break the law because he got a subpoena for material<br>which is patently illegal for him to release.<br><br>But doesn't this just drip of irony? Congress writes the law which AG<br>Barr is following, and now Congress is attempting to subpoena the<br>report, which Barr cannot legally release, under the laws that they<br>wrote?<br><br>If Congress wants the full, unredacted report so badly, they can amend<br>the law which is preventing him from releasing the full, unredacted<br>report.<br><br>They will fail spectacularly in that effort. Which is why they are<br>resorting to this particular tack.<br><br>It's nothing more than a ploy to energize their base, who similarly<br>doesn't believe in the rule of law. just the rule of Orange Man Badâ„¢ and<br>we do whatever we have to in order to get him.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
