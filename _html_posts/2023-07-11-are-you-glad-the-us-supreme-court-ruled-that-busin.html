<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>That is not what the Supreme Court said. If you're going to ask a<br>question, at least ask the right question.<br><br>Neither business in question (*Masterpiece Cake Shop* or *303 Creative*)<br>has ever refused service to an LGBT customer. Ever. You may be confusing<br>"refusing to speak a message with which they disagreed" with "refusing<br>service to an LGBT customer."<br><br>In *Masterpiece*'s case, Jack Phillips never refuses to serve anyone.<br>He'll sell a rack cake to anyone for any reason at any time. Lorie Smith<br>will create websites for anyone, regardless of their race, sex,<br>religion, or sexual or gender orientation.<br><br>What they *will not* do is be forced by the government to speak a<br>state-approved message with which they do not agree.<br><br>The case proves that the First Amendment not only protects your right to<br>speak, but it also protects your right to *not* speak.<br><br>If the cake shop or the web designer were actually refusing service to<br>LGBT people, then you'd have to show where the LGBT person entered the<br>store and asked for a cake with absolutely zero message and zero<br>meaning. Just a cake. Or just a website for a generic business, not for<br>a gay wedding, and was denied simply because they were LGBT. **This<br>never happened.**<br><br>Businesses can still not refuse service to LGBT customers if the state<br>has decided that sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI) is a<br>protected class. It is not protected at the federal level but some<br>states have added SOGI as a protected class. But business owners cannot<br>be forced to speak state-approved messages with which they disagree.<br>Jack Phillips cannot be forced to use his artistic talents to design a<br>cake for a gay wedding, and Lorie Smith cannot be forced to use her<br>talents to create websites celebrating gay weddings. The First Amendment<br>protects their right to not speak messages with which they disagree.<br>They'll make any other cake or any other website, but not those. The<br>state cannot tell them that they must design cakes celebrating LGBT<br>events or risk losing their business license.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
