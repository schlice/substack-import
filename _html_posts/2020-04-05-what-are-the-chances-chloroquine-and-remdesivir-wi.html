<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>What are the chances chloroquine and Remdesivir will cure COVID 19?<br><br>Zero.<br><br>These are most definitely not "cures" for COVID-19. A "cure" would be<br>something that completely kills the virus, or completely and with 100%<br>efficacy, immunizes us against it.<br><br>Chloroquine and some other drugs being tested (azithromycin, remdesivir,<br>etc) can "...alter the pH of the compartment in which some viruses are<br>brought into the cell. This can interfere with the process of depositing<br>the virus\' genome inside the cell and thus block the virus\' ability to<br>reproduce."\[1\](#rIvSK){#cite-rIvSK .citation_link}<br><br>At best, these drugs are antivirals in side-effect only. At best, these<br>drugs make it harder for the virus to replicate in the body, making it<br>less harmful and reducing the severity and duration of an infection, but<br>crucially, **they don't prevent you from becoming infected or<br>experiencing any symptoms**.<br><br>A "functional cure" would be something akin to a vaccine. These drugs<br>are most certainly not vaccines.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-rIvSK){.citation_index} [[FDA approves the emergency use<br>of chloroquine for<br>COVID-19](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=5abcec&url=https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/03/fda-approves-the-emergency-use-of-chloroquine-for-covid-19/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="arstechnica.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
