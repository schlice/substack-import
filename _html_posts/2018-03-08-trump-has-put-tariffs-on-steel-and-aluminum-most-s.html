Most Senate and<br>Congressional Republicans oppose him on this. Which side is wrong, and<br>how ought the wrong ones be punished?**<br><br>Congress has the ability to levy tariffs. However, over the years, they<br>have given that ability over to the President, because (they reason)<br>tariffs are a function more closely related to foreign relations<br>(Constitutionally in the President's wheelhouse) than to spending<br>(Constitutionally in Congress' wheelhouse).<br><br>Therefore, Congress can be as upset as they want to be with the<br>President, **but it was they who abrogated their own Constitutional<br>authority and gave it to the President.** They have even ceded control<br>of tariffs which don't demonstrably relate to foreign policy (like the<br>steel and aluminum tariffs). But they did it anyway.<br><br>For a more in-depth review of what has transpired over the years which<br>drove Congress to make these changes, [[this<br>article](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=0465cf&url=https://www.nationalreview.com/2018/03/tariffs-congress-handed-president-power-to-levy/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="nationalreview.com"}]{.qlink_container} has a great history.<br><br>In other words, *Congress has no one to blame but themselves.*<br><br>If they are that upset, perhaps they should rescind the orders they<br>signed which gave tariff control to the President.<br><br>But isn't this the current issue with our government? No one is actually<br>looking to Congress to fix anything anymore. Has anyone bothered to look<br>at Congress' approval ratings recently? No! Because they're too busy<br>looking at the President's ratings, which are historically 2--4 times<br>higher than those of Congress.<br><br>But because Congress is unable to do its job, it cedes power to the<br>Executive, whose branch is largely unelected (and therefore<br>unaccountable directly to the people).<br><br>*How should this be punished?* Congress should be fired and replaced<br>with representatives who will actually clean up Washington, and make<br>Congress an organization which is responsive to the people again.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
