<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Does President Trump understand that mixed messaging between himself<br>and medical experts hurts the country by creating confusion?**<br><br>I understand that you may be confused by mixed messaging.<br><br>However, I didn't elect "medical experts" to run the country. Medical<br>experts, if they had their way, would keep us in lockdown for the next<br>18 months until a vaccine is distributed. Then, they'd identify everyone<br>who got a vaccine with some sort of identification to prove that you're<br>safe to leave your home.<br><br>Thankfully, medical experts don't run the country.<br><br>Trump takes advice from medical experts and creates policy which<br>balances the need for medical action with the needs of the economy,<br>which can also kill just as efficiently as the virus. Numbers released<br>just today show that 27 million people have filed for unemployment<br>benefits since the start of the pandemic. Think about that. **27,000,000<br>people** can no longer buy food for their kids or afford their houses.<br>And there is a significant number of those families who already had<br>difficulty feeding their kids to begin with, many of them with school<br>food programs being that child's primary meal of the day. So now, not<br>only are they not in school being fed by a school food program, but<br>their caregivers have no means to make money to even potentially buy<br>food. Millions more children, beyond those who were starving before,<br>will be starving now. The UN has already warned that hundreds of<br>thousands of them may die.<br><br>[[U.N. warns economic downturn could kill hundreds of thousands of<br>children in<br>2020](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=e1245d&url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-children-un/u-n-warns-economic-downturn-could-kill-hundreds-of-thousands-of-children-in-2020-idUSKBN21Y2X7?utm_source%3Dquora%26utm_medium%3Dreferral){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="reuters.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>And all of that because maybe 100,000 may die. 27,000,000 impoverished<br>because maybe 100,000 may die. Do those numbers add up to you?<br><br>If they do, then it's probably because you don't understand what<br>"flattening the curve" was all about. Flattening the curve was never<br>about preventing you from getting sick in the first place. Flattening<br>the curve was about making sure that we don't overwhelm the medical<br>system. This also means that yes, people will get sick. Yes, some people<br>will die. But you cannot prevent that. Even with aggressive measures<br>taken (the most aggressive we have the ability to take in this country),<br>people will still get sick and people will die.<br><br>This isn't an argument of lives vs money. It's an argument of lives vs<br>lives. It always has been. If we don't start allowing people to go back<br>to work, and if we don't start allowing people to earn money again, we<br>will be facing a second pandemic, and it has nothing to do with a virus.<br><br>Instead, our strategy should be one of allowing the young, healthy<br>people to go back to work, protecting the most at-risk among us,<br>monitoring disease outbreak, making changes where needed, and getting<br>the country back to work again. The medical professionals would never<br>stand for that.<br><br>It's good to hear what the medical experts say. But then it's important<br>to hear what the President says, which is what happens when you remember<br>who was elected to actually run the country.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
