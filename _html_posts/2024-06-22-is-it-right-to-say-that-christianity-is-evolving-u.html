<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>> **Is it right to say that Christianity is evolving (updated) into the<br>> so-called modern Christianity?**<br><br>No.<br><br>You are certainly free to think of it this way, but Christianity is not<br>"evolving." The whole point of Christianity is that it is the *bulwark*,<br>the "steady foundation" that resists the swirling storms and rapid<br>change of society. The whole point of Christianity is that it espouses<br>the Word of God, and God's Word is unchanging, just as God is<br>unchanging.<br><br>So no, Christianity is not evolving. Some sects which call themselves<br>Christian are *actively choosing* to ignore some facets of the Bible<br>because they want to be "accepted" by society. It is exactly this choice<br>which has almost completely destroyed what used to be the United<br>Methodist Church. The UMC is now a shell of what it once was, because it<br>allowed society to dictate doctrine.<br><br>TL;DR: Christianity is unchanging. Churches which are "evolving" are<br>actually abandoning Christianity.<br><br>And that point is the answer to your second question:<br><br>> **why are they still followers of Jesus though they don't follow his<br>> teachings?**<br><br>Because anyone can call themselves Christian. But calling yourself<br>Christian does not make you Christian. A favorite argument I get from<br>Mormons is that they believe in Jesus, so they can call themselves<br>Christian. It's even in their name: "The Church of Jesus Christ of<br>Latter-Day Saints." But they reject *some* truths about Christ, and they<br>reject *some* truths about the Bible. Roman Catholicism is exactly the<br>same way, but not necessarily by rejecting the Bible. Instead, they<br>misinterpret the Bible and add extra-Biblical "sources" of God's Word<br>which are not explicitly declared in the Bible. They all call themselves<br>"Christian," but it is clear that while they have taken on the name of<br>Christ, they do not fully respect the One whose name they have chosen<br>for themselves, so they *take the name of the Lord in vain.*<br><br>TL;DR: You can call yourself Christian, but that does not make you<br>Christian.<br><br>(also, I realize that in one answer, I have called out the UMC, LDS, and<br>the RCC as being not Christian. But if they are free to believe that the<br>church is evolving and if they are free to believe things which are not<br>explicitly called out in the Bible, I am free to believe that they have<br>"evolved" themselves out of Christianity.)<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
