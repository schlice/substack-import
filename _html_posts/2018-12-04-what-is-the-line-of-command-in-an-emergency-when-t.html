Air<br>Force One is outfitted with the latest in communications gear and lots<br>of other stuff, which means he is never out of touch. From<br>[Wikipedia(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=d308a3&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_VC-25){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}:<br><br>> Operational modifications include aerial refueling capability and<br>> anti-aircraft missile countermeasures. The electronics on board are<br>> connected with approximately 238 miles (383 km) of wiring, twice that<br>> of a regular 747. All wiring is covered with heavy shielding for<br>> protection from a nuclear electromagnetic pulse in the event of a<br>> nuclear attack. The aircraft also has electronic countermeasures<br>> (ECMs) to jam enemy radar, flares to avoid heat-seeking missiles, and<br>> chaff to avoid radar-guided missiles. All small arms and ammunition<br>> stores not under the physical possession of the Secret Service on<br>> board the VC-25s are stowed and secured by the Secret Service in<br>> separate locked compartments, each with a different locking mechanism<br>> for added security. Many of the VC-25\'s other capabilities are<br>> classified for security reasons.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
