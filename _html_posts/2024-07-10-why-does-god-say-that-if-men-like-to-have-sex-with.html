<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Before we begin, we must agree that within the framework of this<br>question, you presume that God exists, He created you, and you at least<br>want to understand why His rules exist. Remember that if you think<br>you're going to comment. I'll point it out to you if you say something<br>stupid like "Yeah, but God doesn't exist, so why tf do you care" or<br>something like that. This discussion presumes that God exists and He has<br>rules.<br><br>The question you asked is *why.* Why does that attraction exist if<br>you're not allowed to have homosexual sex?<br><br>The answer is *sin*.<br><br>Sin is falling short of God's will and good plan for us. Sin is,<br>literally, "missing the mark." Sin was introduced into the human<br>condition by Adam and Eve's disobedience to God. Since then, humanity<br>has been tainted by sin. We live in a fallen world, in fallen, sinful<br>bodies. This sin causes all sorts of maladies which did not exist before<br>that sin. Disease and decay are a result of sin. Disorders of the brain<br>are also a result of sin. The sexual desire for those of the same sex is<br>a result of our sin nature.<br><br>We know this because we know how God designed us, and what He intended<br>for us when it comes to sex and relationship. The Bible is abundantly<br>clear that not only are people supposed to marry man and woman, but they<br>are supposed to only have sex between them, within the boundaries of<br>that marriage. Therefore, anything you do outside of that is sinful.<br><br>You cannot help how you feel. Your feelings are part of your fallen<br>nature. You *can* help what you do with those feelings.<br><br>This is why while you may feel like, as a man, you are attracted to men,<br>you cannot have sex with men.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
