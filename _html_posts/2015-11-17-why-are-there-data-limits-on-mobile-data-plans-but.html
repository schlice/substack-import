<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [As with anything, it\'s all about money.\<br>\<br>It\'s more expensive to transmit data to and from your handset than it<br>is to transmit data to and from your home internet gateway. Therefore,<br>in order for your handset data plan to be cost-effective, the carrier<br>must limit the amount of data you transmit to and from your handset.\<br>\<br>If not, people could effectively use their cellular handsets to replace<br>their home internet service. In a LTE (4G) area, service speeds are good<br>enough to support streaming services, so without limits on those plans,<br>the usage would skyrocket and overwhelm OTA network<br>providers.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
