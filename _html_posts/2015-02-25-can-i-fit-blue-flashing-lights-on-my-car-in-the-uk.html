<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Diplomatic immunity only means that you can\'t be<br>prosecuted for a crime. It doesn\'t mean that officers can\'t stop you.<br>It doesn\'t mean you\'re not subject to the laws of the country in which<br>you are serving. It simply means that your crimes will be reported to<br>your home country who will (in all likelihood) recall you from your post<br>and you will face consequences once you return home.\<br>\<br>Fitting blue flashing lights to your car is only valid if your vehicle<br>is an emergency service vehicle (and this is true in the United States<br>as well). If you are not operating a emergency services vehicle<br>registered with a government agency which provides emergency services,<br>you cannot fit blue flashing lights to your vehicle.\<br>\<br>The only exception to this rule that I know of (in the US anyway): If<br>you drive a \"show car\" and you want to participate in shows where<br>customized (and non-road-legal) lights are permitted, you must disable<br>the lights before driving the vehicle on public roads. This normally<br>means removing a fuse to the lights so that they cannot \"accidentally\"<br>be activated while on a public road. There are plenty of instances in<br>the US where certain light kits are illegal while on the road, but are<br>encouraged at car shows. These owners must disable these lights before<br>driving on public roads.\<br>\<br>We used to have this problem in the 80s when \"Knight Rider\", starring<br>David Hasslehoff, was on the air. People would fit red \"chaser\" lights<br>to their Trans Ams much like the car in the show. Flashing red lights on<br>your car is just as illegal as flashing blue lights.\<br>\<br>]<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-15e663a5d47c5a7952b008140398cf13){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-15e663a5d47c5a7952b008140398cf13"<br>master_w="2048" master_h="1536"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>(\"KITT1\" - Original uploader was Arroww at en.wikipedia - Licensed<br>under CC BY-SA 3.0 via Wikimedia Commons - [[File:KITT1.jpg - Wikimedia<br>Commons](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=94094b&url=http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:KITT1.jpg%23mediaviewer/File:KITT1.jpg){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikimedia.org"}]{.qlink_container})<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
