<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>A law cannot be passed in *controversion* to a ruling by the Supreme<br>Court. So if the court says that a particular law is unconstitutional,<br>Congress cannot write another law which does the same thing in the same<br>way. It would immediately be stayed until the courts can determine if it<br>violates the Constitution in the same way they already ruled that it<br>does.<br><br>But if the Court says that a particular law is unconstitutional, but<br>there is another way to accomplish the same thing without violating the<br>Constitution, then Congress can absolutely re-write the law so that it<br>doesn't violate the Constitution.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Can a law be passed over a ruling by the Supreme Court?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
