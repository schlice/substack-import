<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Churches and other organizations requesting police support<br>for their specific event pay for the time the officers provide to their<br>events. This is not a tax. This is a fee for service that is not<br>normally provided during the officer\'s normal shift. On-shift patrols<br>are not tasked to these assignments; these officers are off-duty (i.e.<br>not part of the on-duty crew). Therefore, since the duty falls outside<br>of the officer\'s normal shift time, the department charges a fee for<br>this service. Tax-exempt status does not apply.\<br>\<br>There are many \"pay assignments\" that officers have the option of<br>working. In our department, the ones that are not picked up by full-time<br>officers go to the Reserves. The organization will still pay, but any<br>monies received go into the Reserve operating fund, not to the Reserve<br>Deputies. In some rare cases, if a pay assignment has to be filled and<br>no one is biting, they may offer the Reserves the option to receive the<br>pay directly instead of having it funnel to the operating fund, but that<br>is the exception rather than the rule.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
