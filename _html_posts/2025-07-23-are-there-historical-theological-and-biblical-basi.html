<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>So as usual, the Quora Prompt Generator loves to talk about Christian<br>truth as "opinion." But Christian belief is not opinion. It is God's<br>word.<br><br>In that respect, these answers aren't "opinion" as informed by<br>"history." They are theologically sound, and Biblically-written. That<br>doesn't make it easy to hear. But it does make it the truth. Thanks,<br>QPG. Failed again.<br><br>So let's get into the meat of the QPG's rather impersonal question,<br>first starting whether Christians "should" be "anti-abortion" and then<br>whether Christians "should" be "anti-gay."<br><br>\<br><br>We can start with Christians being "anti-abortion." First, we must<br>acknowledge that these are very difficult decisions for women. A woman<br>who finds herself in such a position has an awful lot to wrestle with.<br>So I don't want to be insensitive when I discuss this. However, the<br>question was asked about Christian belief, not about sensitivity to a<br>woman's feelings. To that end, please forgive me if this sounds<br>insensitive.<br><br>As a Christian, I don't prefer any of this "anti" language. I'd rather<br>be known for what I stand *for*, rather than what I stand<br>*against*.<br><br>And I stand for life.<br><br>Rather than me re-typing everything, the good folks at<br>[gotquestions.org(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=c2491a&url=http://gotquestions.org){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="gotquestions.org"}]{.qlink_container} already have a<br>comprehensive list of why Christians stand for life. I absolutely<br>believe this, and if I were to write it all out, it would be this:<br><br>> Life is a gift from God. Jesus taught that "the Father has life in<br>> himself" ([[John<br>> 5:26](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=b57bc4&url=https://www.bibleref.com/John/5/John-5-26.html){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="bibleref.com"}]{.qlink_container}). God is the source and<br>> sustainer of life. "The earth was formless and empty" until the Spirit<br>> began "hovering over the waters" and God began creating life<br>> ([[Genesis<br>> 1:2](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=ee6957&url=https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/1/Genesis-1-2.html){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="bibleref.com"}]{.qlink_container}). When He made Adam, God<br>> formed the body and then had to vivify the body in a special work that<br>> only God Himself could perform: "The Lord God formed the man from the<br>> dust of the ground. He breathed the breath of life into the man's<br>> nostrils, and the man became a living person" ([[Genesis 2:7,<br>> NLT](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=61acf4&url=https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/2/Genesis-2-7.html){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="bibleref.com"}]{.qlink_container}). Christians are<br>> pro-life because all of God's gifts should be cherished, including the<br>> gift of life.<br>><br>> Life begins at conception. Several passages of Scripture indicate<br>> that [[life begins at<br>> conception](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=6eb4b2&url=https://www.gotquestions.org/life-begin-conception.html){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="gotquestions.org"}]{.qlink_container}, not at some<br>> arbitrary time later (see [[Psalm<br>> 139:13](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=39b721&url=https://www.bibleref.com/Psalms/139/Psalm-139-13.html){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="bibleref.com"}]{.qlink_container},<br>> [16(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=6d95fd&url=https://www.bibleref.com/Psalms/139/Psalm-139-16.html){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="bibleref.com"}]{.qlink_container}; [[Exodus<br>> 21:22--23](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=569aef&url=https://www.bibleref.com/Exodus/21/Exodus-21-22.html){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="bibleref.com"}]{.qlink_container}; [[Jeremiah<br>> 1:5](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=ef1253&url=https://www.bibleref.com/Jeremiah/1/Jeremiah-1-5.html){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="bibleref.com"}]{.qlink_container}). Medical science<br>> concurs, and an abundance of data is available (see Moore, Keith,<br>> *Before We Are Born: Essentials of Embryology*, Saunders, 2008, p. 2;<br>> Sadler, T., *Langman's Medical Embryology*, Lippincott Williams &<br>> Wilkins, 10th ed., 2006, p. 11; and Krieger, Morris, *The Human<br>> Reproductive System*, Sterling Pub., 1969, p. 88). Christians are<br>> pro-life because life is life, regardless of a person's location,<br>> size, or capabilities.<br>><br>> Human life bears the image of God. Life is a gift, and human life<br>> is unique in that God made mankind [[in His own<br>> image](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=51539d&url=https://www.gotquestions.org/image-of-God.html){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="gotquestions.org"}]{.qlink_container} and likeness<br>> ([[Genesis<br>> 1:27](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=cd3953&url=https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/1/Genesis-1-27.html){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="bibleref.com"}]{.qlink_container}). That fact gives an<br>> inherent dignity and value to human life. The man and woman God<br>> created on the sixth day were the pinnacle of creation, and after God<br>> made them, He ceased from His creative work. God gave the couple<br>> dominion over all other created things ([[Genesis<br>> 1:26](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=cd2b1d&url=https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/1/Genesis-1-26.html){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="bibleref.com"}]{.qlink_container},<br>> [28(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=509dd0&url=https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/1/Genesis-1-28.html){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="bibleref.com"}]{.qlink_container}). As marvelous and<br>> awe-inspiring as other parts of creation are, humanity outclasses them<br>> all. As the psalmist says, we are "fearfully and wonderfully made"<br>> ([[Psalm<br>> 139:14](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=b0f22e&url=https://www.bibleref.com/Psalms/139/Psalm-139-14.html){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="bibleref.com"}]{.qlink_container}). Christians are<br>> pro-life because all humans bear the image of God.<br>><br>> The innocent should be protected. Taking up the cause of the<br>> innocent and those who cannot fend for themselves is a common theme in<br>> Scripture (see [[Exodus<br>> 23:7](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=415d21&url=https://www.bibleref.com/Exodus/23/Exodus-23-7.html){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="bibleref.com"}]{.qlink_container}; [[Proverbs<br>> 6:16--17](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=add635&url=https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/6/Proverbs-6-16.html){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="bibleref.com"}]{.qlink_container}; [[Isaiah<br>> 1:17](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=bdfde4&url=https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/1/Isaiah-1-17.html){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="bibleref.com"}]{.qlink_container}; [[Jeremiah<br>> 22:3](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=f1f688&url=https://www.bibleref.com/Jeremiah/22/Jeremiah-22-3.html){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="bibleref.com"}]{.qlink_container}). It is hard to imagine<br>> someone more innocent or less capable of self-defense than a baby in<br>> the womb. Christians are pro-life because they have a moral<br>> responsibility to protect the weak and innocent.<br>><br>> God has plans for each individual. God told the prophet Jeremiah,<br>> "I knew you before I formed you in your mother's womb. Before you were<br>> born I set you apart and appointed you as my prophet to the nations"<br>> ([[Jeremiah<br>> 1:5](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=ef1253&url=https://www.bibleref.com/Jeremiah/1/Jeremiah-1-5.html){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="bibleref.com"}]{.qlink_container}). God did the forming of<br>> Jeremiah, but even before that, Jeremiah was known, set apart, and<br>> appointed. The apostle Paul had a similar testimony ([[Galatians<br>> 1:15](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=5d0e1d&url=https://www.bibleref.com/Galatians/1/Galatians-1-15.html){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="bibleref.com"}]{.qlink_container}). Christians are<br>> pro-life because there are no "accidents" or mistakes in God's plan.<br>><br>> Everyone has the right to live. As life is a gift from God, no one<br>> else is entitled to take life away. It is the Lord who gives and the<br>> Lord who takes away (see [[Job<br>> 1:21](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=e5cc71&url=https://www.bibleref.com/Job/1/Job-1-21.html){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="bibleref.com"}]{.qlink_container}). God's furnishing of<br>> life to every person means that life is a basic human right---no right<br>> is more basic. Christians are pro-life because they believe in the<br>> right to life; they respect God's decisions and do not want to play<br>> God.<br>><br>> What God thinks is most important. Social pressure, human opinion,<br>> civil laws, and political tides are not what delineate truth. What God<br>> says in His Word takes precedence over what anyone else says or<br>> thinks. Christians are pro-life because, ultimately, they have to<br>> answer to God alone.\[1\](#XIJwZ){#cite-XIJwZ .citation_link}<br><br>So again, truth is not subject to what anyone thinks or feels. God's<br>Word is truth. Christians believe that, and therefore, Christians are<br>pro-life because God's Word says clearly that we are to honor the lives<br>He has created. We know that ultimately, everyone will stand in front of<br>the seat of judgement and will have to answer for how they lived their<br>lives.<br><br>And it's not enough to say, "If you don't want an abortion, don't get<br>one," because if you truly believe that life is a gift from God and no<br>one is to destroy what God has made, then allowing others to destroy<br>what God has made is just as wrong as if we do it ourselves.<br><br>\<br><br>Now about being "anti-gay."<br><br>That's a bit of a loaded question. Christians are not "anti-gay."<br>Christians are "anti-sin." The Bible is replete with admonitions against<br>homosexual behavior and to claim otherwise is simply a flat-out lie (all<br>quotes from NIV):<br><br>> Do not have sexual relations with a man as one does with a woman; that<br>> is detestable. --- Leviticus 18:22<br>><br>> If a man has sexual relations with a man as one does with a woman,<br>> both of them have done what is detestable. They are to be put to<br>> death; their blood will be on their own heads. --- Leviticus 20:13<br>><br>> Or do you not know that wrongdoers will not inherit the kingdom of<br>> God? Do not be deceived: Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters<br>> nor adulterers nor men who have sex with men nor thieves nor the<br>> greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the<br>> kingdom of God. --- 1 Corinthians 6:9-10<br>><br>> We also know that the law is made not for the righteous but for<br>> lawbreakers and rebels, the ungodly and sinful, the unholy and<br>> irreligious, for those who kill their fathers or mothers, for<br>> murderers, for the sexually immoral, for those practicing<br>> homosexuality, for slave traders and liars and perjurers---and for<br>> whatever else is contrary to the sound doctrine --- 1 Timothy 1:9-10<br><br>And lest you think that only gay men are implicated in the Bible,<br>lesbians are also specifically called out:<br><br>> Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their<br>> women exchanged natural sexual relations for unnatural ones. In the<br>> same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were<br>> inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed shameful acts with<br>> other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their error.<br>> --- Romans 1:26--27<br><br>Again, drawing our lessons from the anti-abortion message, Christians<br>are not in opposition to homosexual activity on a whim. We are against<br>all sin. We don't want to see anyone sin. And we believe that Christ has<br>the ability and the power to help us overcome any of our sin.<br><br>And while we love everyone, we will not condone sin. We will not<br>encourage sin. We do not excuse sin. We do not "look the other way" when<br>someone who claims to be a Christian lives a life of sin. If you are<br>truly saved, you will not desire your sin more than you desire God.<br><br>The American church has a huge problem with this. They believe that if<br>we permit and participate and tacitly condone sin, the sinner will see<br>our love and will want to change on their own. This is flawed thinking.<br><br>Does that make us "anti-gay" or does that make us "anti-sin"? I'll leave<br>it up to you to decide.<br><br>But as for me and my house, we will serve the Lord (Joshua 24:15).<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-XIJwZ){.citation_index} [[Why should Christians be<br>pro-life?](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=5a5438&url=https://www.gotquestions.org/Christians-pro-life.html){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="gotquestions.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
