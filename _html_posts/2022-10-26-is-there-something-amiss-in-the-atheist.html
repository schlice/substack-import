<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Yes.<br><br>It is a problem wherein atheists are pre-loading their conclusions into<br>their assumptions. They consider Jesus to be "only a man" because they<br>have a pre-existing conclusion that God does not exist, so any evidence<br>we present that Jesus was both God and man is going to fall on deaf<br>ears. Jesus must be only a man, because they consider no other options.<br><br>There is also (as you will see in many answers to this question) the<br>idea that only certain evidence is acceptable. You're going to get a lot<br>of "WHAT EVIDENCE? SHOW ME THE EVIDENCE!" answers, when the truth is<br>that evidence has been presented many many times, but they simply refuse<br>to accept that evidence.<br><br>The reason they won't accept the evidence is that it is philosophical<br>and logical evidence, not physical evidence. You can't "detect" God<br>using any physical means. You can't "measure" God. These people are what<br>we call "naturalists" or "materialists" because they believe in<br>naturalism (materialism) as the foundation of all life.<br><br>Materialism is false for a number of reasons.<br><br>- There are plenty of things that you can't "detect" but we still<br>  believe exist. Human thoughts and theories aren't comprised only of<br>  measurable chemicals. Sure, chemicals are involved in the process, but<br>  they can't explain all of human thought. Someone's thoughts, whether<br>  they be of love or hate, are not chemicals. What is the specific<br>  gravity of love? What is the chemical composition of hate? These are<br>  absurd questions because thoughts and emotions are not completely<br>  materially-based. Since they are not completely materially-based,<br>  materialism is false.<br>- There is a message resident in all life, what we technically call<br>  "specified complexity." Specified complexity cannot be explained<br>  materially. The message cannot be explained by non-intelligent natural<br>  laws any more than the words on this screen can be explained by the<br>  non-intelligent laws of the motion of electrons.<br>- If life were nothing more than a random interaction of chemicals, then<br>  we should be able to take those chemicals and combine them and create<br>  life, but we cannot. Clearly, there is something more to life beyond<br>  the materials that comprise living beings. Materialists, for example,<br>  can't explain why one person is alive and another is dead. They<br>  contain the same chemicals. Why is a person alive one minute and dead<br>  the next? What combination of chemicals can account for consciousness?<br>- Finally, if materialism were true, then reason is impossible. If<br>  mental processes are nothing more than chemical interactions in the<br>  brain, then there is no reason to believe that *anything* is true,<br>  including the theory of materialism itself. Chemicals can't evaluate<br>  whether or not a theory is true. Chemicals can't *reason*, they can<br>  only *react*.<br><br>Materialists rule out the possibility that Jesus could be God before<br>they even evaluate the evidence. Doing so literally flies in the face of<br>science and reason. This isn't a debate between science and religion.<br>This is a debate between *good science* and *bad science*. Similarly,<br>this isn't a debate between faith and reason. This is a debate between<br>*reasonable faith* and *unreasonable faith*.<br><br>It might surprise you to see who is actually practicing bad science, and<br>who has the more unreasonable faith.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Is there something amiss in the atheist's reasoning that Jesus is<br>fiction if he is the son of God and real if he was only a man, based on<br>the axis that they don't believe that Gods exist? Isn't that dismissing<br>the evidence before evaluating it?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
