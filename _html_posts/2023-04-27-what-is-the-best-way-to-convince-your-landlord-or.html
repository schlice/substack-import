<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>You will have to show them that there is benefit by showing that the<br>chargers will eventually *generate revenue*. One way to do this is to<br>open the chargers up to the public. While residents can charge for free,<br>everyone else pays a fee. Over time, the chargers will eventually start<br>to make money.<br><br>But that's the problem. The HOA or the landlord has to have the capital<br>up front to install the chargers, and depending on the type of charger,<br>that can range anywhere from \$30K to \$200K. If the HOA or the landlord<br>doesn't have that kind of disposable capital lying around, it's a hard<br>sell to try to get them to impose a special assessment on homeowners or<br>take out a business loan.<br><br>TL;DR: Usually, the problem isn't that they don't see the value. It's<br>that they don't have the capital, and installing EV chargers requires<br>up-front capital investment.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
