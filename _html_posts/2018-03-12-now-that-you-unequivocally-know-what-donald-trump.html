<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Now that you unequivocally know what Donald Trump and the GOP are all<br>about, are you afraid that God will punish you if you vote for them<br>again?**<br><br>My friend Mr. Anonymous, God does not punish people for voting. He also<br>does not punish people for not voting. I missed in the Ten Commandments<br>where it said, "Thou shalt not vote for Donald Trump." Maybe you can<br>point out the Scripture to me so I can research it.<br><br>God *might* take issue with those who attempt to sow discontent among<br>people, so perhaps you should think more carefully before you try to<br>bait religious people into answering such questions.<br><br>And yes, apparently I just assumed Mr. Anonymous' gender. Too bad.<br>You're anonymous.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
