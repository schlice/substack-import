<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If you feel a police officer stopped you incorrectly can you put them<br>under citizens arrest?**<br><br>This question comes up on Quora in lots of different ways, all the time.<br>Can you physically resist a police officer if he violated the rules? Can<br>you shoot a police officer who is going to use deadly force against you?<br><br>Basically, the question boils down to: *can I take action against a<br>police officer* *at the scene**?*<br><br>The answer to that very specific question is *no.*<br><br>There is no circumstance under which a police officer, acting "under<br>color of law," is wrong when you are being arrested. You have ZERO<br>authority to stop a police officer from arresting you.<br><br>The old saying goes, "You may beat the rap, but you can't beat the<br>ride." In other words, you may prevail in court, and you may get your<br>charges dropped, but you're still going to be arrested, and there's<br>nothing you can do about that.<br><br>What this means in practical terms: if a police officer is arresting<br>you, you cannot stop that. The reason: **determining whether or not an<br>officer arrested you "incorrectly" is a matter of law to be decided by a<br>jury**. No one else can determine whether or not an arrest is lawful.<br>Not you, not another police officer, not someone recording the arrest,<br>not a bystander on the street, not even a lawyer who happens to show up.<br>It is not a matter of fact to be decided by you at the scene. **ONLY A<br>JUDGE AND/OR A JURY CAN DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT YOUR ARREST WAS<br>LAWFUL.** Therefore, you must operate under the assumption that the stop<br>is lawful, and proceed in that way.<br><br>Yes, that's right. This means *you must allow yourself to be arrested.*<br><br>Once you are arrested, you can contact an attorney who will work with<br>you in order to review the arrest and the charges. If the officer acted<br>"incorrectly" or unlawfully, your arrest will be thrown out in court,<br>and you and your attorney can seek to file suit against the department<br>for false arrest and kidnapping if you so choose.<br><br>But at the scene? The officer is presumed to be acting lawfully, since<br>it's only a jury who can determine whether or not the actions are<br>lawful.<br><br>*You may beat the rap, but you can't beat the ride.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
