Yes they can.<br><br>Can they create a plebiscite for anything they like? No.<br><br>For example, can the federal government create a plebiscite to elect the<br>next President? No. Presidential elections are governed by the<br>Constitution. Can they *use* a plebiscite to determine national opinion?<br>Sure, but they still are required to follow the Constitutional process<br>to elect the President. The plebiscite cannot elect the President.<br><br>In short, in any case where a voting method is prescribed by the<br>Constitution, the Federal government cannot overrule that prescribed<br>method with a plebiscite.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
