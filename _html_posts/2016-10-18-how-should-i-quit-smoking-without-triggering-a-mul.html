<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>> *How should I quit smoking without triggering a multiple sclerosis<br>> attack?*<br><br>***Slowly, cautiously, and under the supervision of your medical<br>team.***<br><br>It's well known that smoking not only makes people who were already<br>predisposed to developing MS even more likely to develop it, but it is<br>also well known that quitting smoking will improve your overall MS<br>prognosis. You will progress to disability at a slower rate after you<br>quit, and your relapses will not be nearly as bad nor last as long. The<br>disease itself will also progress at a slower rate.<br><br>I would highly suggest that you not try to rush the process. Don't quit<br>"cold turkey." Doing so is stressful, and stress brings on relapses.<br><br>What I do recommend is talking to your medical team. Advise them<br>that you want to quit, but relapses often accompany your attempts. They<br>can work with you to lessen the effects of quitting so as to alleviate<br>some of the stress in the process.<br><br>There are definitely products out there that can help make quitting less<br>painful: antidepressants (bupropion), varenicline, nicotine patches and<br>gum all are available. \[1\](#cZuEZ){#cite-cZuEZ<br>.citation_link}Working with your healthcare team (primarily your GP and<br>your neurologist) will be crucial in making sure you can control the<br>side effects from smoking cessation so that you can work through the MS<br>issues.<br><br>And it may just be possible that in order to quit, you may have to<br>endure a relapse. Remember that a relapse does not indicate disease<br>progression; in other words, you are not making your disease worse by<br>enduring a relapse. However, in the grand scheme of things, it's better<br>to quit than to fear quitting because of a relapse.<br><br>In other words, **the benefits of quitting far outweigh the risks<br>involved in doing so.**<br><br>Talk to your medical team, and see if there are supportive therapies<br>that can help you quit, and be successful.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-cZuEZ){.citation_index}<br>[http://www.nationalmssociety.org\...(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=747fcd&url=http://www.nationalmssociety.org/NationalMSSociety/media/MSNationalFiles/Research/Stroup_T_Smoking_and_MS_20151110.pdf){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="nationalmssociety.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*This answer is not professional medical advice**, nor is it a<br>substitute for professional medical advice.
