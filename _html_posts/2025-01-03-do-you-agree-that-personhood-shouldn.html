<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>You're correct, they are *human rights*, not person's rights.<br><br>But at the very least, if we establish "personhood," we could then apply<br>the same laws which protect "persons" we already have, such as the right<br>to life, and to not have that life taken without due process of law.<br><br>Nevertheless, we keep fishing around for a way to either ban all<br>abortions or permit all abortions nationwide, which at least for now,<br>we're not going to get.<br><br>We have correctly returned the abortion debate to the states, where<br>it currently belongs. States, and the voters in those states, get to<br>decide how their state spends their money. The state gets to decide<br>whether they will allow any abortions in that state, and if so, if there<br>are to be any limits to that.<br><br>If, at some point, we get a plurality of people in at least 3/4 of the<br>states who either agree that all abortions should be banned or that all<br>abortions should be permitted, we can pass a Constitutional amendment to<br>say that. But for now, leaving this privilege to decide up to the states<br>(and to the people, respectively) is exactly what the Constitution<br>intended.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
