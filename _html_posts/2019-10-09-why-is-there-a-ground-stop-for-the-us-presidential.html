<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Why is there a ground stop for the US presidential aircraft?<br><br>Because Air Force One does not comply with Air Traffic Control; Air<br>Traffic Control complies with Air Force One. AF1 goes where it wants,<br>when it wants, and everyone else gets the hell out of the way. They do<br>file a flight plan so that ATC can plan around it, but they get everyone<br>out of AF1's way when it's time for them to fly.<br><br>That's why there is a ground hold when AF1 is schedule to take off from<br>or land at your airfield.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
