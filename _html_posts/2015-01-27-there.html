<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Let me start by saying that there is *never* any<br>justification for rape. Ever.\<br>\<br>I want to address what the poster is trying to say, because I think<br>there is something there that women should think about: **what you wear<br>speaks volumes about who you want to portray yourself as.**\<br>\<br>If you go to a costume party and you want to dress up as Santa Claus,<br>wearing a bunny costume would send the wrong message: that you\'re not<br>Santa Claus. What you wear determines the message you are trying to send<br>about yourself. If you\'re trying to say \"I am Santa Claus,\" don\'t<br>dress in a bunny rabbit costume, because, right or wrong, people will<br>think you\'re the Easter Bunny.\<br>\<br>And to make my point more clearly, I offer as evidence the quote of that<br>scholar of ethics, that paragon of virtue, comedian Dave Chappelle:\<br>\<br>]<br><br>> The girl says \"Oh uh-uh, wait a minute! Wait a minute! Just because<br>> I\'m dressed this way does not make me a whore!\" Which is true,<br>> gentlemen, that is true. Just because they dress a certain way<br>> doesn\'t mean they are a certain way. Don\'t even forget it.\<br>> \<br>> But ladies, you must understand that is fucking confusing. It just is.<br>> Now that would be like me, Dave Chappelle, the comedian, walking down<br>> the street in a cop uniform. Somebody might run up on me saying, \"Oh,<br>> thank God. Officer, help us! Come on. They\'re over here. Help us!\"<br>> \"Oh-hoh! Just because I\'m dressed this way does not make me a police<br>> officer!\" See what I mean? All right, ladies, fine. You are not a<br>> whore. But you are wearing a whore\'s uniform.<br><br>\<br>There\'s no way that the average person, let alone the hormone-filled<br>16-25 year old male, can separate those two: the way you dress and the<br>way you are perceived.\<br>\<br>Your outfit does not make you a certain way. But your outfit speaks<br>volumes about how you want to be perceived. You cannot deny that if you<br>walk into a board meeting wearing the same outfit you wore to the club<br>last night, you\'re going to get more than the casual look, and it is<br>going to color the perception that people have of you. You can\'t help<br>but have people make the connection between what you are wearing and the<br>personality type of the person who would normally wear such an outfit.\<br>\<br>Saying, \"I can wear slutty clothes, but you can\'t make the connection<br>in your mind\" is disingenuous. Other posters are saying the same thing.<br>[[John<br>Gibson](https://www.quora.com/profile/John-Gibson-12)]{.qlink_container},<br>a man whose opinion I greatly respect even though we occasionally<br>disagree, is right on point when he says that we have hopelessly<br>intertwined seduction and rape, and it should not be that way. The<br>simple fact is that in today\'s society, *that\'s how it is.*\<br>\<br>So that we are clear here, I need to stop and point out again, **what<br>you wear should never have any bearing on whether or not you are<br>raped.** Ever.\<br>\<br>But if you could shape opinion about yourself by having others perceive<br>you differently based on your choice of outfit, wouldn\'t you want to<br>guide their perception to the right one for you?\<br>\<br>In short, if you don\'t want people to automatically think of you as<br>slutty, don\'t dress like a slut.\<br>\<br>I think there may be something to that.\<br><br>### <br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
