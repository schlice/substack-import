I'm not aware of a Constitutional<br>argument that says not only do you have a 1st Amendment right to be<br>present in the White House Briefing Room, but you have a right to be<br>heard. I've never heard a 1st Amendment argument say that you have a<br>right to be heard. Most classical 1st Amendment arguments state that you<br>have a right to speak, not a right to be heard.<br><br>Therefore, in theory at least, he can be present in the room and never<br>be called on to ask questions.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
