<br/><br/>Answer<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content: <br/><br/>That\'s a great observation you made! The sound of the jets dumps out<br/>the back of the plane, but from there that sound travels in all<br/>directions. On a clear day, some sound goes to the ground, and some goes<br/>to the sky. On an overcast day, the sound that normally goes up hits the<br/>cloud layer, **which has a temperature differential and visible water<br/>vapor,** and reflects back to the ground, thus increasing the audible<br/>sound at the ground.<br/><br/>To clarify, the moisture in the air (trapped at the temperature<br/>differential) is what causes the refraction of the sound.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content language: English<br/><br/><br/>
