<br/><br/>Answer<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content: [I\'ve seen a few answers that hint around the issue, but<br/>whether or not the government has a right to allow or deny a marriage<br/>really hinges on what the government\'s overriding interest is in<br/>regulating what two people do in their own home. *What is the state\'s<br/>business in regulating marriage in the first place?*\<br/>\<br/>This is actually a valid question, because in discourse, it seems that<br/>marriage has so long been accepted that people have forgotten why it<br/>exists in the first place.\<br/>\<br/>Dan said that without marriage, he can\'t transfer property or be a<br/>mutual caregiver. 30 minutes with a lawyer and a few signatures can<br/>remedy that. True, it\'s not as \"easy\" as getting married (assuming<br/>that you believe marriage is \"easy\"), but it functions in the same<br/>way, and it is just as legally binding as a marriage. He also said, \"We<br/>are in love, have been together for 6+ years and want our commitment<br/>recognized by our government so as to protect our household and<br/>relationships status under the law.\" Protecting household and<br/>relationship status is just as easy as defining caregiver status. Just<br/>as you can sign a contract defining property rights, rights of<br/>survivorship and critical care rights, the same document can protect<br/>household and relationship status under the law.\<br/>\<br/>So to the first part of Dan\'s quote, \"We are in love, have been<br/>together for 6+ years and want our commitment recognized by our<br/>government\.\\" What overriding government interest is there in<br/>recognizing commitment? If that were the only thing that government was<br/>doing by sanctioning marriage, why would they not recognize other types<br/>of committed relationships as well? Why would they not recognize, for<br/>example, the commitment of two best friends who have lived together for<br/>decades, and have shared an apartment and bills and the like, and even<br/>perhaps are raising one of their widowed children together? Why<br/>wouldn\'t they be considered \"married\" too? Why would we discriminate<br/>against them because they don\'t have sex with each other? Why would we<br/>not allow a mother and her daughter to be considered \"married\" so that<br/>they can raise the daughter\'s widowed child together? How could we then<br/>exclude plural marriages? The state has no overriding interest in<br/>\"recognizing commitment.\"\<br/>\<br/>So I am back to my original question: what business does the state have<br/>regulating marriage?\<br/>\<br/>**The only state interest here is regulating sex, and the only reason<br/>that the state needs to regulate sex is that because sex between a man<br/>and a woman regularly produces children.** This does not mean that if a<br/>man and a woman do not have children (or cannot have children), that<br/>their marriage is invalid. The child does not validate the marriage.<br/>However, the marriage provides the structure and the benefit that allows<br/>the generativity for children to be in place. And while it may not be a<br/>popular position, it is absolutely true that children have their best<br/>chance of success in life by growing up in a home with the child\'s<br/>biological mother and father. Does this mean that gay couples don\'t<br/>make good parents? Does it also mean that all heterosexual couples are<br/>automatically fit parents? We are not talking about the smaller<br/>percentages of poor examples of any type of relationship. We are talking<br/>about providing children with the best possible chance for success in<br/>life. The state absolutely has the right, and the responsibility, to<br/>ensure that children are given the best chance at success. The state can<br/>therefore incentivize the type of relationship that will produce the<br/>best chance for children to succeed. Therefore, providing incentives to<br/>people who form the union best suited for raising children is necessary<br/>and proper, and is in the state\'s best interest.\<br/>\<br/>Why, therefore, would gay couples want to be a part of an institution<br/>that has no relationship to them? Is it simply because they want to<br/>\"feel\" like a married couple? Are they seeking recognition and<br/>acceptance by others, because I really don\'t think that any external<br/>institution has any bearing on what a gay couple feels towards each<br/>other, and I don\'t think they base their self-worth on what others<br/>think. If it is about acceptance and recognition, then they are trying<br/>to \"normalize\" their relationship by participating in an institution<br/>that makes no sense for them to be a part of. Forcing \"normalization\"<br/>onto society may seem right, but the state has no interest in<br/>normalizing any particular relationship type.\<br/>\<br/>If gays get the right to marry, why would the state not recognize<br/>marriages between multiple partners, or between multiple same-sex or<br/>mixed-sex partners? Is not their commitment just as strong, and perhaps<br/>their survivorship benefit questions more complex? I\'m not trying to<br/>make a \"slippery-slope\" argument, but I\'m saying that recognition of<br/>gay marriage leaves the door open for many other committed relationships<br/>to be called \"marriage,\" whether or not sex is involved. So while Dan<br/>has no interest in destroying heterosexual marriage, diluting or<br/>changing its meaning will essentially destroy it. So while he may think<br/>that it is his right to get married, he is actually seeking to change<br/>the very definition of marriage, which will essentially destroy the<br/>institution and will destroy the very reasons we had state-sanctioned<br/>marriage in the first place.\<br/>\<br/>So I think I am asking the same question. Why do gay people want to get<br/>married?\<br/>\<br/>Love may be blind, but marriage is a real eye-opener.<br/>;-)]<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content language: English<br/><br/><br/>
