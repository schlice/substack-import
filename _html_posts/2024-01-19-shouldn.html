<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>ERROR: Question contains erroneous assumptions.<br><br>HOAs cannot force people out of their neighborhoods simply because they<br>don't like the homeowners.<br><br>HOAs can't even force people out of their neighborhoods *per se*. HOAs<br>simply want to get paid under the terms of their contract agreement. And<br>if you fail to pay (be it your dues or any fines you may have been<br>assessed), the HOA can place a lien on your house, as they have a<br>controlling interest in your property, which they had since before you<br>bought your house. And if you let it go long enough without paying, the<br>HOA can foreclose on your lien and sell your house out from under you in<br>order to be paid.<br><br>In other words, you can't fail to keep up your end of this contract<br>without some pretty serious consequences. The HOA *will be paid*,<br>whether or not you agree.<br><br>If you disagree with a fee or fine, and you've discussed it with your<br>HOA and they refuse to change their minds about it, your only recourse<br>is to hire an attorney and file a lawsuit.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
