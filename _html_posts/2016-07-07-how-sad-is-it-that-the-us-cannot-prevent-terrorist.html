<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>It's not illegal to *be* a terrorist. It's illegal to *do terrorist<br>things.* This dichotomy is what often trips people up in terms of their<br>logical thinking. I can be a terrorist sympathizer and I haven't broken<br>any laws. I can *like* terrorists and I can *morally support* their<br>cause (financing terrorists is actually doing something, which is<br>illegal). Does that make me a terrorist? More importantly, does it break<br>any laws? Until we come up with a *Minority Report* machine and thought<br>crimes, I can support the actions of terrorists without being one. There<br>is a certain line which must be crossed, and in this country, that line<br>is actually doing terrorist things, or plotting to do terrorist things.<br>Supporting terrorists with more than just my good wishes (i.e.<br>financially) is indeed illegal, but if I'm a rah-rah squad for a<br>terrorist, I haven't violated any laws.<br><br>If you are a terrorist who hasn't ever violated any laws (i.e. you just<br>think like a terrorist), you can buy a gun.<br><br>It's an interesting problem. How do we stop US citizens from exercising<br>their fundamental rights as citizens because *they believe in a<br>particular ideology?* Well, you can't. Because that act alone would also<br>violate their fundamental rights as citizens.<br><br>It's a tough balance to strike, but it can be done. For example, if a<br>person is suspected of being a terrorist, you can *delay* the<br>purchase of a gun and give the government the opportunity to charge the<br>person in court (thus preserving his rights as a citizen and also<br>keeping guns out of his hands). If the government chooses not to charge<br>(or fails to charge), the purchase is allowed to proceed.<br><br>(EDIT) In order to make the corollary to dogs, the *owner* would have to<br>be licensed to own a dog. In most municipalities, the *dogs* are<br>licensed. And they're not really "licensed," they are simply<br>"registered" as having received appropriate immunizations. We call it a<br>"license" but it's really nothing more than registration.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
