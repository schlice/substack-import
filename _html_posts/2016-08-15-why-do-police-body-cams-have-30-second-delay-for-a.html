<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The system we are discussing is manufactured by Taser (yes, the same<br>company that makes Tasers). Like most police body cam systems, it has a<br>"Record" button. This allows the officer to start and stop recording.<br><br>It also has a continuously-rolling 30-second buffer *sans audio*<br>which is always recording, regardless of the state of the full<br>recording. That buffer's contents get pre-pended to the video (meaning<br>"stuck on the front") once the "Record" button is pushed. This allows<br>for an additional 30 seconds of video to be added to the full clip<br>beginning 30 seconds before the button push, but without audio you<br>didn't intend to record (like the chit-chat between you and your partner<br>before you stepped out of your car). Therefore, the audio began at the<br>moment the officer pressed the "Record" button. The video without the<br>audio was recorded before the officer pushed the button.<br><br>Depending on department rules regarding when recordings should start,<br>this may have been a violation of procedure. In this case, the officer<br>with the body cam was providing backup and approaching quickly, so he<br>was more worried about the situation than pushing the button. Therefore,<br>because he was only a backup officer, I would be surprised if this was<br>an actual policy violation, but there are only 17,000+ police<br>departments at the state and local level across the country, how could<br>all of their policies be identical?<br><br>Regardless, body cam video adds to the "body of evidence" which can<br>either support or refute an officer's testimony. It is not intended to<br>"replace" an officer's testimony. Remember, the camera cannot see<br>everything. It can only see what it's pointing at. It doesn't have a 360<br>degree view.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
