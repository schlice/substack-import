<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The lack of logic in this question is staggering. Even for a<br>hypothetical scenario, it's hard to wrap your brain around this one.<br>There are a lot of bridges to cross before you can answer honestly.<br><br>First of all, an anti-gun person would never find himself or herself in<br>such a situation. In order to face such a scenario, you would have to<br><br>1.  own a gun<br>2.  have it available to use, which means not in safe storage, or on<br>    your person<br>3.  have already gone through the mental maths justifying its use<br><br>None of these things will happen if you are anti-gun. So the situation,<br>on its face, is ludicrous.<br><br>Second, anyone will react the same way if they are faced with the same<br>scenario; logic does not override the base desire to preserve life. The<br>instinct for self-preservation comes from deep within the subconscious<br>regions of the brain, not from the upper parts of the brain, where logic<br>and reason operate.<br><br>So if you're pro-gun, anti-gun, man, woman, white, black, green, yellow,<br>brown, *whatever,* if your life is on the line, you will act to preserve<br>your own life. Period.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
