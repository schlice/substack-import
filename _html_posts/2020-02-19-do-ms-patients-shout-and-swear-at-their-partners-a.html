<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Do MS patients shout and swear at their partners and children every<br>day?**<br><br>I'm going to take a different tack than my colleagues here and suggest<br>(possibly incorrectly) that this is happening to you, questioner. And<br>your question here is to ask if this is normal behavior.<br><br>So let's start with the facts. Many MS patients will indeed experience<br>cognitive issues. In fact, about 65% of people with MS will experience<br>some [[changes in cognitive<br>functioning](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=3512f2&url=http://www.nationalmssociety.org/Symptoms-Diagnosis/MS-Symptoms/Cognitive-Changes){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="nationalmssociety.org"}]{.qlink_container}, most commonly<br>related to speed of information processing, memory and attention.<br><br>In MS, we talk about cognitive reserve. Cognitive reserve is the way<br>which our brains can protect against cognitive decline caused by<br>anything, from MS to aging.<br><br>> Research has shown that a lifetime of intellectual enrichment from<br>> education and stimulating work and leisure activities helps to lessen<br>> or slow the impact of disease- or aging-related changes in the brain.<br>> In other words, people with cognitive reserve have more protection<br>> from cognitive decline. Cognitive reserve is like savings in the<br>> bank.\[1\](#hwEDP){#cite-hwEDP .citation_link}<br><br>The good news is that anyone can take steps today to improve cognitive<br>reserve, and research shows that it does add cognitive reserve, at any<br>age. Some activities you can participate in in order to improve<br>cognitive reserve:<br><br>- Reading<br>- Creative writing<br>- Journaling<br>- Handiwork<br>- Board or card games<br>- Drawing or painting<br>- Cross word or jigsaw puzzles<br>- Learning a new language<br>- Learning to play an instrument<br><br>In addition, engaging with others -- in a support group, book club,<br>fellowship meetings at your church or synagogue, or through [[advocacy<br>activities](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=9a1503&url=http://www.nationalmssociety.org/Get-Involved/Advocate-for-Change){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="nationalmssociety.org"}]{.qlink_container} -- is another way<br>to stay cognitively active and enjoy the companionship of others at the<br>same time.\[2\](#skJPb){#cite-skJPb .citation_link}<br><br>The bottom line here: if signs exist of cognitive decline, talking to<br>your neurologist is the first step in getting connected to the resources<br>and extended care team which can improve overall brain health and maybe<br>head off some of these symptoms.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-hwEDP){.citation_index} [[Cognitive<br>Health](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=80c9c7&url=https://www.nationalmssociety.org/Living-Well-With-MS/Cognitive-Health){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="nationalmssociety.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>\[2\](#cite-skJPb){.citation_index} [[Cognitive<br>Health](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=80c9c7&url=https://www.nationalmssociety.org/Living-Well-With-MS/Cognitive-Health){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="nationalmssociety.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*This answer is not professional medical advice**, nor is it a<br>substitute for professional medical advice.
