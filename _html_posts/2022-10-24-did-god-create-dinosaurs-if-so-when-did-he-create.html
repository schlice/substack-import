<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Did God create dinosaurs?<br><br>1.  Everything which had a beginning had a cause.<br>2.  Dinosaurs had a beginning.<br>3.  Therefore, dinosaurs had a cause.<br><br>Since we know that the universe had a beginning, the universe also had a<br>cause. So there must have been a creator who was not caused (i.e.<br>self-existent or eternal) who created everything, including dinosaurs.<br><br>Archaeology tells us that dinosaurs existed on the earth between 245 and<br>66 million years ago, which is many millions of years before the first<br>humans existed.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
