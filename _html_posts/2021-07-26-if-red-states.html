<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>They won't be asked. States which exceed their own capacity will do<br>exactly what they planned on doing in those instances. In fact, they<br>already have plans in place to handle any ICU overruns.<br><br>Since most people think of Florida, I can tell you that here in Florida,<br>we can expand our ICU capacity by at least double (or possibly triple)<br>if need be. This is all handled by the State Emergency Response Team<br>under the Division of Emergency Management. These plans were built out<br>long before the initial wave of COVID cases, long before 2020, and long<br>before treatment for these cases improved.<br><br>In other words, we'll create temporary ICUs out of everything from<br>auditoriums to sports arenas before we decide that the best course of<br>action is to leave the state.<br><br>We'll ask for federal emergency dollars to do it. So blue states will,<br>in essence, *contribute* to our disaster relief because money to the<br>federal government comes from everywhere. And that money is not<br>conditioned on whether or not you had a mask mandate in your state.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>If red states\' healthcare systems collapse under the explosion of new<br>Covid-19 delta cases (no mask/vaccine mandates), will neighboring blue<br>state hospitals accept patients from those states, and if so, why?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
