<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>There is this big myth floating around (propped up by books and<br>testimonies from "doctors" who perpetuate this myth based on rumors or<br>overheard conversations) that the medical industry could easily find the<br>cure for lifelong and terminal diseases like cancer, diabetes, and<br>multiple sclerosis, but if they did, they'd lose their revenue stream<br>which keeps people sick. Don't believe me? Read the book *Selling<br>Sickness.*<br><br>[https://www.amazon.com/Selling-S\...(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=5787f8&url=https://www.amazon.com/Selling-Sickness-Pharmaceutical-Companies-Patients/dp/156025856X){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="amazon.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>But that calculus is exceedingly *short-sighted*.<br><br>Imagine being the one researcher, who works at the **one<br>pharmaceutical company**, who finds the cause of MS, and manufactures a<br>simple drug to prevent the cause from ever taking place.<br><br>You would be the person who cured MS.<br><br>You, and your company, would be instantly world-famous. You'd be a<br>*household name.*<br><br>For that researcher, there would be endless speaking engagements and<br>book tours. For that company, you'd be instantly elevated several pegs<br>above the rest of the drug manufacturers. There's all the rest, but then<br>there's you, the gold standard. Anything you produce from that point<br>forward would be an instant huge seller. *Brought to you from the<br>company that cured MS.* What a great tagline for a business. I can't<br>imagine anything that would bring bigger clout.<br><br>Then, you could produce not only the cure, but the simple DNA test which<br>checked to see if you had the specific genome that could develop into<br>MS, and you took the preventative drug and never developed MS in the<br>first place. The possibilities are endless.<br><br>In other words, *when one revenue stream dries up because of a cure, ten<br>more open up.* And that's good business.<br><br>In all businesses, *we want to work ourselves out of a job*. In my<br>industry, we want to develop software that doesn't need to be<br>maintained, that never needs to be fixed. We want to develop hardware<br>that is so redundant and self-healing that we can replace parts before<br>they fail, and the end user would never know the difference. In Customer<br>Service, we want to answer the customer's question before they ever open<br>up a web ticket or pick up the phone.<br><br>In other words, all industries want to make the best possible product,<br>and to work all of the uncertainty out of it. We come pretty close, but<br>never so close that we don't need customer service or ongoing<br>development support.<br><br>The notion that we could easily cure diseases, but we don't in order to<br>keep people sick (and thus on your moneymaking drug) is so far beyond<br>the pale it is sickening to even entertain the notion.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Do they want to find a cure for multiple sclerosis?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
