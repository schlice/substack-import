<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [What could go wrong with an RC flight that would risk a<br>private pilot\'s license?\<br>\<br>I mean, the worst that could possibly happen is that an RC flight kills<br>someone on the ground and the cause was found to be gross negligence of<br>the pilot. I suppose his pilot\'s license could be called into question<br>because of his gross negligence, but RC flying skills are in no way<br>connected to private pilot\'s licenses. At all.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
