<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Is it *likely*? No.<br><br>*Should* it happen? Absolutely.<br><br>> When you have an agency that has gone rogue and is interfering at the<br>> highest level of the country to affect an election; and the directors<br>> of those agencies are willing to alter or leak documents that they<br>> shouldn't or lie under oath to federal investigators or lie to a<br>> committee by claiming amnesia; and they oversee a bureau that will<br>> wipe clean phone records that are under subpoena; or they will not<br>> prosecute one person, but they will another; then it's<br>> institutionalized. And you've got to get rid of it.\<br>> --- Victor Davis Hanson<br><br>So should it be defuned or replaced? No.<br><br>It should be broken up and its agents spread to other Federal<br>agencies within the government. We have a lot of investigatory agencies<br>within the federal government. So take the people in the FBI who<br>investigate currency and give them to the Treasury (Secret Service).<br>Take the people who deal with terrorists, foreign agents, etc. and give<br>them to Homeland Security. Take the ones who work with the Pentagon and<br>make a special unit at the Pentagon.<br><br>The bottom line is that this single organization has too much<br>centralized power, and is a threat to democracy. We don't need a federal<br>police force. We have state level resources, and we have federal<br>agencies to perform specific tasks. There isn't anything the FBI does<br>that other agencies can't (or don't) handle.<br><br>It was a great idea when it was needed. But its time has passed, and it<br>has become corrupt at an institutional level.<br><br>But as the old song says, *Breakin' up is hard to do.* It certainly<br>won't be an easy task, but it is necessary. And it is a noble task. To<br>preserve the Republic, it must be done.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
