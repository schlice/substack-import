<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>There's a lot to unpack here.<br><br>The Constitution doesn't say that "the health and safety of the nation<br>is the purview of the states." What it does do is spell out *exactly*<br>what the Federal government is allowed to do, and nothing more. The 10th<br>Amendment says that everything else that is not specifically listed as a<br>power of the Federal government is reserved to the states and to the<br>people, respectively.<br><br>The Supreme Court ruled on injunctions. They ruled that *one* of the<br>mandates could go into effect while the lower courts were still hashing<br>out the details of the legality of the mandates, and *the other* could<br>not.<br><br>They said, by a 6--3 margin, that OSHA overstepped its boundaries in<br>declaring a vaccine mandate for all businesses (with more than 100<br>employees) nationwide. Congress may have given OSHA the power to<br>regulate workplace safety, but it "has not given that agency the power<br>to regulate public health more broadly."<br><br>At the same time, by a 5--4 margin, SCOTUS allowed the temporary<br>enforcement of the vaccine mandate for healthcare workers at facilities<br>which receive federal funding.<br><br>The mandate is still winding its way through the courts, but at least<br>for now, the government cannot enforce it against all businesses<br>nationwide until its legality has been decided. It can, temporarily,<br>enforce it against healthcare workers though.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>If the constitution says that the health and safety of the nation is the<br>purview of the states, why did the Supreme Court rule for the national<br>healthcare mandate?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
