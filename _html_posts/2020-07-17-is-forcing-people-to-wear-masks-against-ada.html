<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Is forcing people to wear masks against ADA?<br><br>Let's see if we can bring all this together.<br><br>- Businesses are required under ADA to provide reasonable<br>  accommodations to those with disabilities.<br>  - Disabilities are well defined<br>- The inverse of that is that businesses are not required to do business<br>  with someone when reasonable accommodations cannot be met.<br><br>To that end, there are HHS guidelines around acceptable accommodations<br>for those who cannot wear masks; primarily, this is face shields. The<br>business is not required to provide those face shields. In other<br>words, if you can't wear a mask, it is your responsibility to provide a<br>face shield in its place.<br><br>**If you cannot wear either, there is no requirement that the business<br>allow you entrance.** The business does not have to alter its business<br>so drastically that it affects others. Allowing disabled patrons to<br>simply wear nothing is too great a risk to the business and to other<br>customers. Therefore, the business must provide some other accommodation<br>for those who cannot wear a mask: service at your car, home delivery,<br>curbside pick-up, etc.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
