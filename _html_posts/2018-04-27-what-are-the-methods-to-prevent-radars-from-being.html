<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What are the methods to prevent radars from being jammed spoofed,<br>etc?**<br><br>I'll assume you're talking about police radar. The methods by which you<br>could jam or spoof radar are all either illegal or ineffective.<br><br>The only *effective* radar jammer would be an active, broadcasting<br>jammer, and they are illegal. You need a license to transmit on that<br>frequency, and radar jammers are not licensed. It's also painfully<br>obvious to the police officer that someone is using an illegal jammer,<br>as his radar display shows zero when his signal is being jammed. Only a<br>jammer would cause his display to read zero.<br><br>Every other method which has been proposed has been debunked. Or, [[the<br>myth has been<br>busted](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=f4f5eb&url=https://mythresults.com/episode18){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="mythresults.com"}]{.qlink_container}.
