<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Will the Supreme Court declare all United States presidents are above<br>the law until the end of their presidency?**<br><br>No.<br><br>"Above the law" implies that the person is *not subject to the law*, and<br>that is simply not the case. It is instead most likely the case that the<br>President is *ineligible for prosecution while sitting in the office of<br>the President.* Once the President no longer occupies the office (either<br>because he was removed by impeachment or completes his natural term), he<br>is once again subject to prosecution.<br><br>It is also highly likely that the statute of limitations on any charges<br>which are filed would be *tolled* until the President becomes eligible<br>for prosecution. We say that it's "most likely" or "highly likely"<br>because that makes legal sense, but it has never been tested before, so<br>we don't know.<br><br>Therefore, if there is anything that the Supreme Court could decide<br>which would even speak to your question, that would be it.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
