<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Would future weapons such as phasers, laser guns and disrupters be<br>legal under the 2nd Amendment?**<br><br>The 2nd Amendment protects the right of the people to keep and bear<br>*arms*.<br><br>It does not define what those arms are.<br><br>The court in *DC v. Heller* found that there is an individual right to<br>possess "arms," which are any weapon which can be used for a law-abiding<br>purpose. They also carved out *Miller* as an exception, as items like<br>sawed-off shotguns cannot be used for any law-abiding purpose.<br>Therefore, they codified the law-abiding use test for weapons, stating<br>that weapons which cannot be used for law-abiding purposes would not be<br>subjected to 2nd Amendment protection.<br><br>So the answer to the question is: *if phasers, laser guns and disruptors<br>(or any future weapon, for that matter) can be used for law-abiding<br>purposes by law-abiding citizens, then they would be afforded protection<br>as "arms" under the 2nd Amendment.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
