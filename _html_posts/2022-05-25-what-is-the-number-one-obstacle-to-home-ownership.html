<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>There are many obstacles to home ownership these days (mid-2022). But<br>today, the biggest obstacle that most new home buyers face is price.<br>Homes are just too expensive because of a current housing shortage. The<br>median price for a previously owned home sold in April hit a record<br>\$391,000, up 15% from a year ago. As of today, there are only about 1<br>million homes for sale in the US, and that is exceedingly low.<br><br>And loans are more expensive because interest rates have gone up because<br>the economy is in recession. The rate on a 30-year mortgage has jumped<br>from 3.7% in February to nearly 5.5%, the highest level since 2009. Some<br>homebuilders may be starting to worry that new prospective homeowners<br>will pass on buying a house because of this.<br><br>In response, we are seeing the rise of fractional real estate, where<br>you own a percentage of a property and essentially "lease" the property.<br>Jeff Bezos-backed<br>[Arrived(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=cbf6b3&url=https://arrivedhomes.com/about){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="arrivedhomes.com"}]{.qlink_container} just raised \$25M to<br>let people buy shares in single-family rentals with "as little as<br>\$100." Startups like<br>[Fintor(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=5c9a2d&url=https://fintor.com/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="fintor.com"}]{.qlink_container},<br>[Fractional(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=e6ced3&url=https://www.fractional.app/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="fractional.app"}]{.qlink_container}, and<br>[Pacaso(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=87ddbd&url=https://www.pacaso.com/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="pacaso.com"}]{.qlink_container} have also popped up to make<br>real estate more accessible through co-ownership and provide new<br>pathways for investing in the fractional real estate market. Indeed,<br>some pension funds are including real estate investment trusts (REITs)<br>in their portfolios, which shows that they have confidence in the future<br>of this industry.<br><br>Therefore, people won't *completely* own their own homes any more. You<br>may own a fraction of a home, but you won't own your own home if you<br>can't afford to buy it yourself. You'll probably rent the home from a<br>real estate investment trust.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>What is the number one obstacle to home ownership?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
