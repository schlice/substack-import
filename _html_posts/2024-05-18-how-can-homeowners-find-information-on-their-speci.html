<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The HOA should do their best to provide this to you. Either the HOA's<br>website, your personal homeowner portal, or the HOA Directors<br>themselves, should be able to provide you with all of the Governing<br>Documents.<br><br>However, if the HOA is unresponsive, you can always go to your city or<br>county, because the Governing Documents are official record, as they<br>have to be provided with every home sale. You can retrieve your HOA's<br>Governing Documents from them as well.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
