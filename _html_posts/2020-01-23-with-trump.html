<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**With Trump's impeachment into its fourth day, is there any hope that<br>Trump would be removed from the office?**<br><br>No. There is no hope of the Senate removing Trump from office.<br><br>There simply aren't enough votes there to do it. There's nothing new<br>that we're going to hear from impeachment managers on either side. In<br>fact, this is the first time that we'll hear from Trump's legal team, in<br>an official capacity, laying out a number of lines of legal theory,<br>including the fact that the charges don't rise to the level of "high<br>crimes and misdemeanors," and that impeachment under these articles is<br>exactly what the Founders warned us about: turning impeachment into<br>partisan exercises and political weapons, instead of being reserved for<br>only the most egregious crimes, with bi-partisan, overwhelming evidence.<br>Which, in case you're just tuning in, we don't have.<br><br>Since the will of the people is sacrosanct, Trump's team will urge the<br>Senate to basically "float" the issue until 2020, which the Democrats<br>are completely against. Basically, don't remove from office on the<br>grounds that the American people have already seen everything they need<br>to know, and they will make a decision in November if they want to<br>remove the President from office.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
