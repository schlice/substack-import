<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Is it true that if you are a U.S. citizen you cannot legally call<br>yourself a psychologist, even if you do not claim to have credentials or<br>to be a therapist?**<br><br>You can call yourself whatever you want. The 1st Amendment protects that<br>right. If you want to call yourself a psychologist, feel free.<br><br>However, the moment you try to ***act as if you are a licensed<br>psychologist***, you are in violation of the law.<br><br>In other words, feel free to tell anyone who will listen that you're a<br>psychologist. But the moment you try to treat patients in any way, you<br>are in violation of the law, primarily practicing medicine without a<br>license.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
