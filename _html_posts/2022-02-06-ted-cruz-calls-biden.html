<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Is it really history in the making if you have to force the hand of<br>history?<br><br>Is it really a historically significant moment if you have to violate<br>Federal hiring practices to do it? Under Federal hiring laws enforced by<br>the EEOC, it is illegal to discriminate on the basis of race or sex. By<br>declaring that he will only select a black woman, he has now declared<br>that he will violate federal hiring laws.<br><br>It's one thing to look at an entire pool of qualified candidates (which<br>includes men and women of all ages and races) and select a black female<br>because she was the best choice. It's quite another to arbitrarily<br>narrow the playing field before you even choose a candidate. While I'm<br>certain she will be very qualified, and you'll certainly be able to say<br>that, you won't be able to say that she is the *most* qualified, because<br>you have artificially narrowed your candidate pool to only those<br>candidates who, by their very choice, "make history."<br><br>To me, it's a pyrrhic victory. It rings hollow as "history in the<br>making" when you have to violate the law and force it to happen, rather<br>than it happening organically.<br><br>(EDIT) And yes, I know Trump did it too when he chose Amy Coney Barrett.<br>He chose from a list of women. It was wrong when Trump did it, and it<br>will be just as wrong when Biden does it.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Ted Cruz calls Biden\'s promise to nominate the first black woman to the<br>Supreme Court \'offensive\' and \'insulting.\' Why don\'t Republicans<br>see this as \'history in the making\'?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
