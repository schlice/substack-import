<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>So if you are right and the purpose of life is to serve God, then free<br>will makes no sense. Therefore, the fact that we have free will speaks<br>against the purpose of life being to serve God.<br><br>It makes more sense if the purpose of our life is instead to **freely<br>choose whether to love Him or reject Him, without coercion.** For love,<br>by definition, must be given freely, it cannot be coerced.<br><br>Free will makes much more sense if we are to use it to freely choose<br>Him. In that way, He doesn\'t have a bunch of robots in the new kingdom.<br>Everyone who is there is there willingly.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
