<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>In general, unless the facility has a policy prohibiting photography in<br>a sensitive area, the rule in the United States is "if you can see it,<br>you can shoot it." Most areas in which ticketed passengers are allowed<br>in an airport are okay for pictures, as far as I am aware. There may be<br>some restrictions around TSA screening checkpoints; this will be posted<br>at the checkpoint.<br><br>Whether or not the photo will be admissible in court is another matter<br>altogether, and I don't think it was the thrust of the question, so I'll<br>leave that up to the judge and your lawyer to argue.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
