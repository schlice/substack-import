<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>There are two specific sets of laws in place: one for housing, and one<br>for employment.<br><br>The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) applies to employment. It<br>basically says that you cannot discriminate in hiring based on<br>disability. Employers must list the physical requirements of the job,<br>and then can only ask the candidate if they can perform the essential<br>tasks of the job, with or without reasonable accommodations. They<br>must then provide those *reasonable* accommodations if the employee<br>requests it.<br><br>The Fair Housing Act (FHA) says essentially the same thing about finding<br>a place to live. A landlord cannot discriminate against people with<br>disabilities, and they must provide accommodations for the handicapped.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
