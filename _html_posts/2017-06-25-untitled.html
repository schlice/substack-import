<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>He means the story I quoted from the New York Times that says nothing<br>new, just a re-hash of everything we already knew. Obama knew that, like<br>every other government in the world, Russia is trying to break into our<br>systems every single day. Yes, every other government in the world.<br>Russia, Israel, China, North Korea, South Korea, every one with a<br>computer and a way to connect to the Internet is trying to hack us.<br><br>Big freakin' deal. It happens every day. And news flash: it's no secret<br>that we're trying to hack them, too.<br><br>But "meddling in an election" by what? How? Were votes altered? Were<br>voters suppressed? Did they hack voting machines?<br><br>The answer to all of this is no.<br><br>The bigger revelation in the tweet is what Trump actually did say, as<br>opposed to what people are trying to read into it. He said, and the New<br>York Times corroborated, that Obama knew that Russia was thinking of<br>trying something while he was president, and he did nothing about<br>it. Nothing. He pulled a few ambassadors. No sanctions, no retaliation,<br>nothing. And what happened on election day anyway? Nothing.<br><br>So what does this tell us? Russia likes to bluster like all other world<br>governments, and they can't actually hack our election system.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/What-should-Trump-do-about-Russia-now-that-he-has-finally-realized-that-they-meddled-in-the-election-that-won-him-the-US-presidency/answer/Bill-Stein<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
