<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>In a single sentence, evil is the opposite of good.<br><br>Evil is not a *created thing*. Atheists love to say things like "Why did<br>God create evil?" He didn't *create* evil. Evil, in that context, is the<br>absence of good.<br><br>It's like a hole. You don't *create* a hole. You *remove* something, and<br>the void that is left is a hole. Evil is a hole created by the removal<br>of good. God is good, so the removal of God is the "hole" which is the<br>definition of evil. God is love, so the absence of love in a person is<br>un-Godlike, and is therefore evil. That absence of love manifests itself<br>as unloving behavior. The same can be said for God's other gifts: mercy,<br>patience, justice, etc. The absence of those qualities in a person<br>constitutes evil. That evil then manifests itself in behavior that is<br>unmerciful, unjust, impatient, etc.<br><br>The source of evil? It's *us*. We were given free will. We were given<br>the opportunity to choose good or to choose evil. With Satan's help, we<br>chose evil. When Adam sinned, mankind fell. Our bodies were now sinful,<br>and our world was fallen. We live in that fallen, sinful world today.<br>Our sinful world allows us to make sinful choices. We are held<br>accountable for our own sinful choices, and our choices alone.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
