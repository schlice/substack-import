<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Take a look at Quora. Can we answer legal questions here?<br><br>The answer is yes, because the answers we give are general information<br>only. No answer here is intended to create an attorney-client<br>relationship, nor is it a solicitation to create one.<br><br>We also try not to answer specific legal questions, because of the very<br>same problem. We only address specific questions when their answers have<br>general applicability.<br><br>The same goes for medical questions. All of our medical answers are for<br>general informational purposes only, not intended to create a diagnosis<br>or create a doctor-patient relationship.<br><br>The relevant section from Quora's [[Terms of<br>Service](https://www.quora.com/about/tos)]{.qlink_container}:<br><br>> Third Party Beneficiaries \-- Medical and Legal Contributions<br>><br>> All Quora users who provide answers to legal or medical questions are<br>> intended third-party beneficiaries (\"**Legal & Medical<br>> Contributors**\") of this section of the Terms of Use.
