<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Contact the department which issued the ticket. Just Google the name of<br>the department, and their main switchboard number should come up. Tell<br>the operator that you would like to pay your ticket but you lost it.<br>They will direct you to the appropriate department to either get you a<br>copy of the ticket, or give you directions on how to pay.<br><br>Since you're usually not paying the department, but the State's<br>department of revenue, there may even be an online option to pay the<br>ticket. Regardless, the department that gave you the ticket can help you<br>to make that payment.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
