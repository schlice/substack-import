<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Some Christians do.<br><br>Some Christians see any form of participation in Halloween activities as<br>sinful because they believe that Halloween is a satanic holiday<br>established to worship evil spirits and promote darkness and wickedness.<br><br>Some Christians participate in Halloween simply by dressing up in a<br>costume and having fun, seeing it as innocent and harmless.<br><br>*So who is right?*<br><br>- Is there anything evil about a Christian dressing up in an innocent<br>  costume and going around the block asking for candy? *No, there is<br>  not.*<br>- Are there things about Halloween that are anti-Christian and should be<br>  completely avoided? *Absolutely!*<br><br>Since the Bible does not talk specifically about Halloween, if parents<br>are going to allow their children to participate, they should make sure<br>to keep them from getting involved in the darker aspects of the day. If<br>Christians are going to take part in Halloween, their attitude, dress,<br>and most importantly, their behavior, should still reflect a redeemed<br>life ([[Philippians<br>1:27](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=aac073&url=https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search%3DPhilippians%25201%253A27%26version%3DNIV){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="biblegateway.com"}]{.qlink_container}). There are many<br>churches that hold \"harvest festivals\" and incorporate costumes, but<br>in a godly environment. There are many Christians who hand out tracts<br>that share the gospel along with the Halloween candy.<br><br>In my last church in Colorado Springs, our "Trunk or Treat" festival;<br>where church members decorated the "trunks" of their cars, played games,<br>and passed out candy; was our largest community outreach event of the<br>year. And in Colorado Springs, surveys routinely pegged the percentage<br>of the population that was unchurched at 50%. So when parents became<br>concerned about dangerous neighborhoods and letting their children<br>wander the streets at night, they would come to our event. They'd also<br>get to hear about the other great children's programs we offered (as<br>well as the adult programs).<br><br>Ultimately, the decision whether or not to participate in Halloween<br>activities belongs to the individual believer, in the spirit of<br>[[Christian<br>freedom](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=e38c40&url=https://www.gotquestions.org/Christian-freedom.html){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="gotquestions.org"}]{.qlink_container}.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
