<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>What does America need to do to beat the pandemic?<br><br>It's super-easy! We just do exactly the same things we did to beat the<br>common cold and influenza!<br><br>Wait, we didn't beat those? You mean they're still around? I mean those<br>viruses are hundreds, maybe thousands of years old, and they're still<br>around, mutating every year??? Why the heck can't the government beat<br>them?<br><br>Why hasn't the government locked us inside our houses because there are<br>simply some viruses we can't "beat?"<br><br>The short answer is that we may never "beat" the virus. Experts are<br>telling us that COVID-19 may become seasonal, like the cold and the flu.<br>And we will be able to develop a vaccine which will help us to fight off<br>the infection or to make us less susceptible to infection in the first<br>place (depending on the specific action of the vaccine). But that's<br>still going to take 12--18 months after a vaccine trajectory is<br>determined and we have successfully tested it and verified its efficacy<br>before it arrives at our local doctor's office. Therefore, we will<br>likely never "beat" the virus.<br><br>That said, once we stop *living in fear* and ***start living<br>again*, then we will have "beaten" the *pandemic*.**<br><br>We will get to a comfortable point where we will no longer fear the<br>virus. We are not there yet; we still live in fear of the virus. People<br>are distrustful. People are scared. People are hiding behind their<br>masks, keeping everyone at two arms' length. The media does not help,<br>daily barraging viewers with the "record high numbers of cases reported"<br>which only tells half the story. They neglect to tell you that the<br>number of deaths has been steadily on the decline.<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-8a3caff9cd87994088c5ce9d38f41ba1){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-8a3caff9cd87994088c5ce9d38f41ba1" master_w="813"<br>master_h="612"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>This is what the media should be reporting. **We flattened the<br>curve.** Remember that? Remember that this was the whole point of the<br>lockdowns in the first place? We did it. And we don't seem to be<br>mentioning it. The fear-mongering tends to attract more eyeballs to your<br>news screen than the positivity that we did what we were trying to do.<br><br>*But we didn't flatten the curve! We're almost out of ICU space!*<br><br>Well, yes and no. Yes, we are approaching 95-100% utilization of ICU<br>space nationwide, but we always ran 80--85% capacity in ICU anyway. We<br>never ran a completely empty ICU. Additionally, not all of the cases in<br>ICU are COVID-19 patients; in fact, the percentage in the ICU who are<br>there directly because of COVID-19 complications is very low, around the<br>10--15% range, and is steadily falling.<br><br>*But what about the number of cases?*<br><br>Well, I'm glad you asked! Brace yourself. We're probably going to<br>have upwards of *60 million cases of COVID-19 this year*, just like<br>there was for the swine flu of 2009, for which we still have zero<br>immunity. It still, annually, causes hospitalizations and deaths, just<br>like influenza does.<br><br>And yet, I don't remember us shutting down the economy over those 60<br>million cases. Because we're able to treat the disease more effectively,<br>fewer people are dying. A trip to the ICU with COVID-19 now only nets<br>you a 20% chance of dying instead of an 80% chance, and that percentage<br>is falling by the day. Where getting put on a ventilator was pretty much<br>a sure sign that you weren't leaving the hospital under your own power,<br>now you can look forward to recovering from being on the vent.<br><br>Once we stop fearing the virus and start living again, we will have<br>beaten the pandemic.<br><br>TL;DR: We will beat the pandemic, even if we don't beat the virus.<br><br>\<br><br>*Sorry, no comments on this one.*<br><br>*If you don\'t like what I wrote, tough shit. If my answer is<br>grammatically low-quality or is un-cited opinion masquerading as fact,<br>downvote it. If you think I\'m wrong, write your own answer. But Quora<br>is a question-and-answer site, not a debate site. If you were simply<br>going to comment to tell me \"ackshually, you\'re wrong,\" then you're<br>the reason why I disable comments. Well done, Karen. You ruined it for<br>everyone.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
