<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>First of all, while I will answer the question, the real answer is "it<br>depends." The process for filling vacancies on an active Board is part<br>of your individual Governing Documents.<br><br>But in general, the remaining Board members can appoint a replacement<br>Board member who will serve until the next election.<br><br>Remember, your mileage may vary, as every set of Governing Documents is<br>different and they can all define how Board members are replaced during<br>a service cycle, and both state law as well as Governing Documents may<br>be controlling in any one HOA.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
