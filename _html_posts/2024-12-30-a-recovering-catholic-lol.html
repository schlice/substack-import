<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Yes. I am a recovering Catholic. It's supposed to be tongue-in-cheek, as<br>if Catholicism is an addiction and I'm recovering from that. Ha ha, very<br>funny.<br><br>But I had to *un-learn* all the stuff I believe is unbiblical from my<br>childhood through my college time. So literally for the first 22 years<br>of my life, I had to un-learn all of those things Catholicism taught me<br>which are a bit left-of-center from what the Bible actually teaches.<br><br>I now open the floor to questions.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
