<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Under what circumstances does a landlord have the right to enter your<br>apartment without notice (in Colorado)?**<br><br>Landlords in Colorado are not required by law to give notice to enter<br>the unit. This means they can enter at any time, with no notice, for<br>emergencies, non-emergency repairs, and for showings of the unit to<br>other prospective tenants.<br><br>Rental agencies *suggest* that Colorado landlords give tenants at least<br>24 hours notice before entering as a courtesy, and more than half of<br>Colorado landlords surveyed provide 48 hours notice before they enter.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
