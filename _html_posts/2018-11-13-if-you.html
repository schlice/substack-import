<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If your flying an F-18 and your plane alerts you that a Surface to air<br>missle \sic\ has been launched at you what is the first thing you do<br>and how would you remain calm and not panic?**<br><br>This is a valid question, and it goes to the type and the quality of the<br>training you received.<br><br>In training, we were placed into situations which induced great stress.<br>This was done repeatedly and regularly throughout training. This is<br>designed to *numb* you to the stress. Eventually, you start *thinking*<br>through the stress. You can ignore the stress, and you can continue to<br>think, and act. I can remember the point at which I recognized that the<br>stress no longer affected me, and I was able to think through it. It's<br>an out-of-body sort of experience.<br><br>Then, when your C&W (caution and warning) panel is lit up like a<br>Christmas tree, you don't panic. You think through the stress, and you<br>continue to do the primary job: *flying the plane*. And, if you can, you<br>get your plane home safely. And, if you can, you complete your mission.<br><br>Or, as in this question, when your<br>[MAW(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=f9fc53&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missile_approach_warning_system){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container} starts to yell at you,<br>you don't panic. You follow your training, and you employ the<br>appropriate countermeasures.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
