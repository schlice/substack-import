<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>We were indeed *made* in God's image. If only we *stayed* that way.<br><br>The reason why we have flaws and limitations is detailed in the book of<br>Genesis in the Bible. The third chapter, to be precise. It's the story<br>of Adam and Eve, and their fall from grace. The world was created in<br>chapter 1, and they were created by God in chapter 2.<br><br>The Spark Notes version: Adam and Eve were created perfectly. Then sin<br>entered the world, and Adam and Eve (and all of us as their heirs) were<br>*changed*.<br><br>Adam and Eve were literally in perfect bodies, not knowing pain or<br>suffering, disease or death. But then, they sinned against God; they<br>broke His rules. Doesn't matter if the rule was stupid. Doesn't matter<br>if they should have had the knowledge of good and evil without having to<br>break God's rules to get it. The fact is that God told them not to do<br>something, and they did it anyway. They *sinned* against God.<br><br>As punishment, God said the following to the woman:<br><br>> "I will make your pains in childbearing very severe;\<br>> with painful labor you will give birth to children.\<br>> Your desire will be for your husband,\<br>> and he will rule over you." --- Genesis 3:16 NIV<br><br>Then God said the following to the man:<br><br>> "Because you listened to your wife and ate fruit from the tree about<br>> which I commanded you, 'You must not eat from it,'<br>><br>> "Cursed is the ground because of you;\<br>> through painful toil you will eat food from it\<br>> all the days of your life.\<br>> It will produce thorns and thistles for you,\<br>> and you will eat the plants of the field.\<br>> By the sweat of your brow\<br>> you will eat your food\<br>> until you return to the ground,\<br>> since from it you were taken;\<br>> for dust you are\<br>> and to dust you will return." --- Genesis 3:17--19 NIV<br><br>You can see in the quoted and bolded sections that pain and suffering<br>were introduced to humanity, and the world they were cast out into was a<br>*fallen* world (cursed is the ground because of you). After their sin,<br>they could no longer live in perfect bodies as God intended. They now<br>knew pain (Eve knew the pain of childbirth, Adam knew the pain of toil<br>to scratch food from the earth). And they both now knew death (until you<br>return to the ground).<br><br>So pain, disease and death were not part of our original design. They<br>were part of our version 2.0 updates.<br><br>The next two verses are extremely interesting and we can spend a lot of<br>time on them, but they are somewhat unrelated to the question:<br><br>> The Lord God made garments of skin for Adam and his wife and clothed<br>> them. And the Lord God said, "The man has now become like one of us,<br>> knowing good and evil. He must not be allowed to reach out his hand<br>> and take also from the tree of life and eat, and live forever." ---<br>> Genesis 3:21--22 NIV<br><br>Taken together, they foretell the coming of Christ, whose shed blood<br>covers our sins. I'll get there in a minute. But first, why did God say,<br>"The man has now become like one of us...\h\e must not be allowed to<br>reach out his hand and take also from the tree of life and eat, and live<br>forever"? Was God preventing man from becoming all that he could be?<br>Hardly. What He was doing was *protecting the path to salvation.*<br><br>See, God knew that once man had sinned, the only was to salvation was<br>*shed blood as atonement for sin*. God even demonstrates this in chapter<br>21: "The Lord GOd made garments of skin for Adam and his wife and<br>clothed them." ***This is the world's first blood sacrifice. Blood of an<br>innocent was shed to cover man's sin.*** Think about that for a second.<br>God demonstrated, in that moment, how man was to be saved. And the<br>Jewish people practice that blood offering to cover man's sin to this<br>day.<br><br>So that brings us back to the Tree of Life. Why couldn't man live<br>forever? *Because if Jesus couldn't die on the cross, he couldn't pay<br>for our sin, and we would live forever in disease-racked bodies, being<br>permanently separated from God, with no method by which we could be<br>redeemed.* So God saved us by preventing us from being immortal so that<br>Christ could die on the cross as a propitiation for our sins.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
