<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**After all the police shootings in the US, why can\'t you sue officers<br>for murder?**<br><br>First of all, you can't sue for murder. Murder is a criminal charge. The<br>state prosecutes for murder. If the officer was not found guilty of<br>murder (which is the unlawful taking of a life with malice and<br>forethought), then the officer is not arrested and does not go to jail.<br><br>You (as a victim's family) can sue for what is known as "wrongful<br>death." This is a civil charge. In order to sue for wrongful death, the<br>following elements must be present:<br><br>> - The death of a human being;<br>> - Caused by another\'s negligence, or with intent to cause harm;<br>> - The survival of family members who are suffering monetary injury as<br>>   a result of the death, and;<br>> - The appointment of a personal representative for the decedent\'s<br>>   estate.<br>><br>> A wrongful death claim may arise out of a number of circumstances,<br>> such as in the following situations:<br>><br>> - Medical malpractice that results in decedent\'s death;<br>> - Automobile or airplane accident;<br>> - Occupational exposure to hazardous conditions or substances;<br>> - Criminal behavior;<br>> - Death during a supervised activity.\[1\](#xiBST){#cite-xiBST<br>>   .citation_link}<br><br>Generally, it is only the victim's family who has standing to sue for<br>wrongful death (or the personal representative of the victim's estate).<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-xiBST){.citation_index} [[Wrongful Death Overview -<br>FindLaw](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=1818ac&url=http://injury.findlaw.com/torts-and-personal-injuries/wrongful-death-overview.html){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="findlaw.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
