<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What has changed in the past couple of decades to make mass shootings<br>such an issue?**<br><br>*Deinstitutionalization.*<br><br>A big word for a massive change in the mental health landscape in the<br>United States in the 60s. In essence, it was a change from state-run<br>psychiatric facilities (which were, admittedly, in desperate need of<br>overhaul and regulation) to community facilities (halfway houses) and<br>neighborhood clinics. It also set the bar very high for a court to<br>declare a person as "mentally defective," which is the standard required<br>to limit guns.<br><br>But here's the thing: a mentally unstable individual can now *choose* to<br>ignore treatment, and nothing can be done. If they stop showing up at<br>their neighborhood clinic to get their drugs, they stop. No one can<br>pursue them.<br><br>And often, those are the people who need the most help. Many of our most<br>recent batch of shooters have had mental issues, been on psychotropic<br>drugs, etc.<br><br>When we changed how we handle the mentally deficient, we certainly<br>helped the situation in many state-run mental hospitals, but we<br>abandoned much of the treatment that many of these people still needed,<br>because we gave them control of their own treatment. No one would allow<br>a toddler to fly a 747, because they don't have the skills to do so.<br>Neither should the decision to continue therapy for the mentally ill be<br>left to the mentally ill person themselves, as they lack the capacity to<br>determine whether or not they need continued treatment.<br><br>The mental health crisis is bigger than the opioid crisis (no disrespect<br>to the brave people fighting for the problems caused by our current<br>opioid epidemic). Ignoring the fact that the United States changed how<br>it deals with the mentally unstable, followed soon after by an increase<br>in mass shootings by unstable people, does a great disservice to the<br>many people who should be *patients*, not *prisoners.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
