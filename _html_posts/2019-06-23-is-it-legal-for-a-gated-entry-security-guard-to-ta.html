<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>If it is disclosed beforehand that a requirement for entry is a police<br>review of driving record and a NCIC check for wants and warrants, then<br>yes it is perfectly legal.<br><br>I dispute whether or not it is actually done in practice. NCIC isn\'t a<br>system which can be checked willy-nilly. Police are held to strict<br>accountability for every records check they perform, and performing<br>records checks for entry into a gated community, with no reasonable<br>suspicion, let alone probable cause, sounds a bit improbable to me.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
