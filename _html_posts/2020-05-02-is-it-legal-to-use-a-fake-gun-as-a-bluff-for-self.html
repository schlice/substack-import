<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Is it legal to use a fake gun as a bluff for self-defense?<br><br>This is a great question, because it is far more legally nuanced than<br>you might think.<br><br>The TL;DR version: **fake guns are treated just like real guns as far as<br>the laws you are subject to are concerned.**<br><br>First, let's define the environment we are discussing. We are talking<br>about guns that *look* like real guns, but are not. They may even be<br>made by the gun manufacturer, using the same materials as the real gun,<br>and actually respond and feel like the real gun, but lack certain key<br>components (like a firing pin) and lack the ability to have the<br>component added (the slot for the firing pin isn't even milled out) and<br>so while they can even accept a real bullet, they simply cannot fire.<br><br>(EDIT) Since I was specifically asked, this *also* includes BB guns,<br>Airsoft guns, electronic kinetic energy BB guns, and any other<br>non-firearm (a firearm uses a black powder charge to propel a bullet)<br>designed to look and feel identical to a firearm. If your Airsoft<br>gun is electric blue with the required blaze orange tip, it is not<br>designed to look and feel identical to a firearm. But if you can't<br>immediately tell that it is not a firearm within a second of looking at<br>it, it is classified as a *replica* or *imitation* firearm.<br><br>Let's say you were carrying one of these bad boys for some reason (we'll<br>talk about why this is a terrible idea in a minute). In most states, you<br>can carry one of these, but some states do prohibit them like actual<br>firearms.<br><br>*Could you lawfully use that fake gun and point it at someone to defend<br>yourself?* Of course you can. However, the legal consequences are<br>*exactly the same* as if you pointed a real gun at someone.<br><br>As far as "brandishing a firearm," most states have brandishing laws<br>which include "replica" or "imitation" firearms, so you're subject to<br>the same penalties for brandishing a fake gun as you are for brandishing<br>a real gun.<br><br>Pointing any gun (real, fake, BB, whatever, so long as it looks real) at<br>someone is a crime called "assault." The only difference is that in some<br>states, you may not be charged with the more severe "assault with a<br>deadly weapon," although some states do include replica or imitation<br>firearms in their "deadly weapon" laws. If the state has "assault with a<br>firearm" statutes, usually replica and imitation guns (designed to look<br>and feel real) are included, so you would be subject to those.<br><br>In other words, if you're going to point a *fake* **(yet<br>real-looking) gun at someone, you must meet all the same legal criteria<br>for being a person who would point a *real* gun at someone.** In<br>other words, you must be in fear for your life in order to defend<br>against the assault and brandishing charges we listed above.<br><br>So can you see why doing this would be an *extra-bad idea?*<br><br>You have all the intention to use a gun, and you have (hopefully) met<br>all the legal requirements to be in a condition in which you *can* use a<br>gun, but you have a non-functional gun. You have all the *intention*,<br>all the *motivation*, but none of the *ability.* If you actually<br>*needed* to use a gun at that very point (which would be the only legal<br>way in which you could brandish or point that gun), you would not be<br>able to do so.<br><br>(EDIT) Here's another reason why this is a bad idea. If you point your<br>fake gun at someone, that someone has been legally threatened by what he<br>reasonably perceives to be deadly force. That person can use *real*<br>deadly force to counter such a threat. In other words, if you point a<br>fake gun at someone who has a real gun (either an armed civilian or law<br>enforcement), they can *legally* use that real gun in response. This<br>is why cops don't get convicted of murder when they kill kids who point<br>fake guns at them.<br><br>My advice: if you've gotten yourself to the point where you feel like<br>you need to carry a fake gun to defend yourself, it's time to get over<br>the hurdle and get a real gun and some concealed weapons training and<br>your permit.<br><br>\<br><br>*This answer is legal information, not legal advice.
