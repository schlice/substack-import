<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I think that if SCOTUS does decide to rule on this, it will come down on<br>the President's side.<br><br>First of all, Twitter is a private service. You do not have a 1st<br>Amendment right to be heard on Twitter. You don't even have a 1st<br>Amendment right to use Twitter in any way, because it is a private<br>service. Twitter can ban you from the service, and individual users can<br>block you. You don't have any 1st Amendment claim when it comes to using<br>a private service because it's really hard to argue that Twitter is akin<br>to a forum like a town hall, which is physically constrained. I think<br>the courts would hesitate to make such a claim, as it would put an undue<br>and Constitutionally-unsupportable position on private communications<br>platforms. Remember, the 1st Amendment was designed to prevent the<br>government from taking action against you for your speech, not to<br>guarantee you open access to private communications services. Twitter,<br>for all its openness, is still a private company offering a private<br>service.<br><br>Secondly, Trump has two accounts: \@realDonaldTrump, and \@POTUS. The<br>first is a private account, controlled by Trump himself, which he<br>arguably uses on his own, without any White House oversight. The second<br>is the official Twitter account of the President, controlled by the<br>White House, where all tweets are logged and all activity is officially<br>sanctioned and monitored. Trump blocked the individuals from his<br>personal account, not the POTUS account. Trump, as an American citizen,<br>has the right to use Twitter in the way it was intended. If this case<br>goes to the plaintiffs, then you are claiming that you lose your own 1st<br>Amendment rights when you become president, and that you essentially<br>lose control over your private interaction with a private company.<br>Remember, this is not about the public POTUS account, just about Trump's<br>personal account. Trump still remains an American citizen, even if he is<br>president. He does not lose any of his own 1st Amendment rights simply<br>by becoming president.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
