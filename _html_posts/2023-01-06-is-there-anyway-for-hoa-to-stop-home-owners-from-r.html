<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Yes, it is well within the power of the Board to do this.<br><br>It can be accomplished in multiple ways. Here are just a few examples:<br><br>- Amend the Declaration of Covenants or the Bylaws to disallow halfway<br>  houses in the neighborhood. This will require varying percentages of<br>  votes by the homeowners (depending on your state and your HOA), but it<br>  is the most iron-clad way to do it, and it would be virtually<br>  impossible to challenge in court.<br>- Modify the Rules and Regulations to require that the Board approve any<br>  and all rental contracts before they are signed. This change can be<br>  voted on by the Board alone at a regular Board meeting, but it<br>  requires setting up rules for what types of rentals are "allowed" and<br>  what types of rentals are "disallowed." You could also add verbiage to<br>  say that the Board has the authority, in its sole discretion, to<br>  disallow any rentals if it believes that the rental would be<br>  detrimental to the community in any way. This also is more prone to<br>  legal challenge, but if it is well-written (use your HOA attorney to<br>  help draft the final wording of the Rule), it should be able to<br>  survive most challenges.<br><br>These are not the only ways you can accomplish this change. I would<br>recommend an interested Board contact their attorney to discuss methods<br>by which this behavior could be restricted in their neighborhood.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
