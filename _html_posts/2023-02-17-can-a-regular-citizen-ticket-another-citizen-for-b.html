<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>There isn't a jurisdiction I know of which allows a citizen to issue<br>binding citations on behalf of a local government to another citizen.<br><br>The person issuing citations on behalf of a government must be<br>authorized by that government to do so. That's why police officers wear<br>a "badge," which is short for "badge of office." It recognizes the<br>authority they have been granted by the government to enforce the law.<br>The badge is a universally-accepted symbol of authority granted by a<br>government under its authority to create laws and enforce their<br>compliance. The person granted the badge has been trained and authorized<br>by the government to enforce said laws.<br><br>I *have* heard of citizen groups which are occasionally issued handheld<br>radar units. [[This<br>article](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=96b9b3&url=https://www.officer.com/command-hq/technology/traffic/article/10233960/citizens-on-radar-patrol){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="officer.com"}]{.qlink_container} on<br>[Officer.com(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=70b1fa&url=http://Officer.com){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="officer.com"}]{.qlink_container} talks about at least one<br>citizen initiative to run radar. Here is how the program is described in<br>the article:<br><br>> In citizen radar programs, volunteers monitor vehicle speeds using a<br>> department-issued radar unit. The vehicle speed and time are written<br>> on a log sheet. In the event a violation is observed, the volunteer<br>> will attempt to document the vehicle\'s description and license plate<br>> number. Usually, letters are then mailed to the registered owners<br>> advising them of the observed violation. When citizens run radar, they<br>> don\'t issue tickets or appear in court.<br>><br>> \"There\'s no enforcement, but it sends out a strong message,\" says<br>> Lt. Daniel Furseth of the DeForest Police Department in Wisconsin.<br>><br>> The programs are educational for everyone. Drivers who are going too<br>> fast learn they need to slow down, neighbors often learn that vehicles<br>> aren\'t actually traveling as fast as they thought they were, and<br>> police departments learn how to more effectively allocate resources to<br>> address speeding problems in their communities.<br><br>It's a win-win-win. It's the same function as a "smart trailer" (I know<br>you've seen them):<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-6ccefd716195bab8e0d051b07688fec1){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-6ccefd716195bab8e0d051b07688fec1" master_w="500"<br>master_h="350"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>*(image courtesy* [[*Police<br>Magazine*](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=5b7a51&url=https://www.policemag.com/369195/smart-650-radar-speed-trailer){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="policemag.com"}]{.qlink_container}*)*<br><br>This unit not only has a RADAR unit and a display, but it also has a<br>laptop, recording average speeds on the target road at specific times of<br>the day. The software will generate a graph showing when speeds on that<br>road are highest, and officers can be deployed during those times to<br>maximize their effectiveness in reducing speeds.<br><br>But rather than incurring the cost of a smart trailer, you can not only<br>get the same information, but you can alleviate citizen concerns, get<br>them involved in community-based policing, and save money.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
