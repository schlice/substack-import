<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Can you lose your job for not cooperating with a police<br>investigation?**<br><br>Short answer: yes.<br><br>Longer answer: As with all legal questions, the answer is "it depends."<br>And what it depends on is whether you are being accused of a crime<br>or simply being questioned as a witness in a crime.<br><br>Being accused as a participant in a crime. In this scenario, you<br>have been detained by the police, and they want to question you. You<br>assert your right to remain silent until you have had the chance to talk<br>to your lawyer. You will eventually get a lawyer and your lawyer will<br>either advise you to answer the question, or to assert your rights under<br>the 5th Amendment and not answer because your answer may incriminate<br>you.<br><br>However, what you must understand here was quoted by Cicero's maxim:<br>"Though silence is not necessarily an admission, it is not a denial,<br>either." Remember, only the government is enjoined from using your<br>testimony against you (or in this case, your lack of testimony). Your<br>employer can cite the whole sordid affair and simply choose to fire you<br>because they don't want to be involved in your potential lawlessness.<br>Most employment in the United States is "at will" employment, and an<br>employer can fire you for pretty much whatever reason they choose,<br>unless it violates a civil right (in other words, you can't be fired<br>because of your sex, race, national origin, disability status, or<br>religion)<br><br>Being questioned as a witness in a crime. In this scenario, you<br>haven't been detained; you've simply been asked to come down to the<br>police station and give a statement regarding something else. If you're<br>not being detained, you're not under any obligation to cooperate with<br>the police, and they can't compel you to give a statement or "cooperate"<br>at all.<br><br>While it might be difficult for your employer to find out whether or not<br>you were questioned, it's not impossible, especially if the incident<br>about which your cooperation was requested involved your employer. For<br>example, let's say that computers were being stolen from your employer,<br>and your friend and co-worker was being accused of the crime. The police<br>want to question you about it, not because they believe you did it, but<br>because they know you are a friend of the accused. You certainly can<br>choose to not cooperate with them, and that information could make it<br>back to your employer. And yes, they can fire you simply because they<br>don't like the fact that you could be protecting a thief. Again, in most<br>cases, your employer can fire you for nearly any reason they choose, so<br>long as it is not an unlawful reason. Protecting the integrity of their<br>business is certainly a viable reason to terminate someone's employment.<br><br>It's also important to understand that the 5th Amendment only protects<br>you in a *criminal* case. If it's a *civil* case, in many cases they may<br>be allowed to draw an "adverse inference" from your refusal to testify,<br>which means that they are allowed to make the connection that because<br>you refused to testify, you may be protecting information that<br>implicates you. Remember too that the "court of public opinion"<br>generally views pleading the 5th as a tacit admission of guilt,<br>regardless of what the court can or cannot do. If how you are perceived<br>in society is important to you, then it may not be advantageous to plead<br>the 5th.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
