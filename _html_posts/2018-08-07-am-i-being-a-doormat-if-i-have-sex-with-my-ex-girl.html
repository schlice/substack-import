<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Am I being a doormat if I have sex with my ex girlfriend when she<br>tells me she still loves me but can\'t be in a relationship? Is she<br>playing with me?**<br><br>You're not being a doormat unless you're pining for a relationship.<br><br>With your ex, it's all about a good roll in the hay, and that's it.<br>You're her sex toy. You mean nothing to her. She doesn't love you. She<br>loves having sex with you.<br><br>If you're okay with being her self-propelled dildo, if you're okay with<br>being her booty call, then there's nothing wrong with what you're doing,<br>and you're not a doormat.<br><br>If, however, you continue to have sex with her because, deep down in<br>your heart, you really think you can "win her back" and get her back as<br>a girlfriend, then yes sir, you are a doormat.<br><br>She's not interested in a relationship (which also is why she really<br>doesn't love you). She's interested in a fuck buddy, and that's it.<br><br>If you want something more out of a relationship, stop wasting your time<br>with her, and go find yourself a real relationship, and cut it off with<br>the booty call.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
