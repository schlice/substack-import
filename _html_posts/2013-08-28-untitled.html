<br/><br/>Answer Comment<br/><br/><br/>Content: [Marcus, thank you for your well thought out argument. I<br/>appreciate your opinion, and I do love reading them. I always challenge<br/>my own beliefs, and reading opinions like yours always makes me question<br/>my opinions. While I agree with you in principle, I still don\'t believe<br/>that changing the law, and thus changing the definition of marriage, is<br/>the correct approach.\<br/>\<br/>You cannot compare gay marriage to interracial marriage. In my post, I<br/>centered my discussion on the purpose of marriage. People have ascribed<br/>purposes to marriage that are way beyond what the state ever intended.<br/>This is partly caused by the fact that churches marry people, as well as<br/>states. When a church marries a couple, it is for different reasons and<br/>towards different ends than when a state grants a marriage license or<br/>marries people. A religious marriage has much more to do with love and<br/>commitment than the state\'s reasons for granting licenses, which have<br/>absolutely nothing to do with love or commitment. We are talking about<br/>changing law, so our only point of discussion is why the state grants<br/>marriage licenses and why the state has any compelling interest in<br/>regulating who gets married. We are not talking about church marriages<br/>at all. Therefore, basing your arguments on who someone should be<br/>allowed to love are not relevant. Basing your arguments on what<br/>commitments should be recognized by the state is also pointless; the<br/>state does not recognize commitment in any form, it has no compelling<br/>interest in regulating commitment.\<br/>\<br/>States regulate marriage because there has to be some structure around<br/>generativity, or what happens to children who may be created as a result<br/>of this union. The compelling interest of the state is the protection of<br/>children, so the state encourages the union which gives children the<br/>best chance for success. This is why the state grants marriage licenses<br/>to couples comprised of men and women, because the state has no other<br/>compelling interest to regulate any other form of union. The state may<br/>have a compelling interest in regulating polygamy, but since the church<br/>does not allow it, the state also does not allow it. The state really<br/>has no reason to deny it.\<br/>\<br/>Since the only state interest is ensuring that children created by that<br/>union are given the best chance of success, and since men and women of<br/>different colors can procreate, then interracial marriage bans were<br/>based on nothing more than bigotry and hatred. A ban on interracial<br/>marriage did not make sense in the scope of the law. Men and women can<br/>marry, and interracial men and women can produce children. Banning<br/>interracial marriages was contrary to the state\'s reasons for granting<br/>marriage licenses. Therefore, that practice was reversed.\<br/>\<br/>The state does have a compelling argument when not granting marriage<br/>licenses to gay or lesbian couples. When these couples have sex, they<br/>cannot produce children. Therefore, there is no compelling reason for<br/>the state to grant marriage licenses to these couples. It\'s like the<br/>state granting marriage licenses between men and trees. It makes no<br/>sense when looking at the state\'s interest in regulating marriage.\<br/>\<br/>There is no \"right\" for gay or lesbian couples to marry, because<br/>according to the state\'s interests, marriage does not apply to them<br/>because they cannot produce children. There is no \"basic human right\"<br/>to marriage, so the state is not violating any human rights by not<br/>granting marriage licenses to same-sex couples. As far as the state is<br/>concerned, there is no compelling state interest in regulating such<br/>unions.]<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Answer:<br/>https://www.quora.com/Why-are-gay-people-asking-for-the-right-to-marry-If-it-is-legal-stuff-they-are-asking-for-cant-they-go-to-some-separate-setup-for-partners/answer/Marcus-Geduld<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content language: English<br/><br/><br/>
