<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Evidently, authorities just arrested someone from BLM or Antifa<br>outside Kamala Harris\' house. Do conservatives agree that this person<br>should be prosecuted to the fullest extent?**<br><br>First of all, he was arrested about a fifth of a mile away from the<br>traditional home of the Vice President, the US Naval Observatory. VP<br>Harris is not living there because the residence at USNO is being<br>renovated. The VP is currently living at Blair House, the guest house<br>outside the White House.<br><br>Second, Paul Murray is not a BLM or Antifa activist. He's just a fed up<br>Veteran. There are a lot of us out there. He may have some other issues,<br>and apparently he was not taking all of his prescribed medications.<br>There is no indication what his medications were treating.<br><br>Murray was arrested on various weapons charges.<br><br>Now to answer your question: Murray should be prosecuted to the fullest<br>extent for the weapons charges. Whatever he did unlawfully with his<br>weapons should indeed be charged. From the sounds of it, he has some NFA<br>items which were not registered. So he will likely face charged for<br>possessing those without the required permits and tax stamps. And since<br>he lives in Texas, how he got the weapons to Washington, D. C. will also<br>be a question.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
