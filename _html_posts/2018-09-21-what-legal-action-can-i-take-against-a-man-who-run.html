You could sue him in small claims<br>court for assault. In most civil jurisdictions, "assault" is separate<br>from "battery" in that "assault" is the threat, and "battery" is the<br>physical contact.<br><br>But there's no crime here. The 1st Amendment protects his right to<br>speak, even loudly and in your face. If he didn't touch you or<br>physically harm you, there is no crime.<br><br>But he did "assault" you in tort, so you can sue him for assault<br>(specifically, verbal abuse) if you suffered emotional harm from his<br>outburst.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
