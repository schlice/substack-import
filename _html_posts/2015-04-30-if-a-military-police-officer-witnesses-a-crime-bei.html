<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [So there are two questions here; let\'s answer them one at<br>a time.\<br>\<br>*1. If a military police officer witnesses a crime being committed by a<br>civilian, can he or she arrest that civilian?*\<br>The answer, as always, is \"it depends.\" If the military police officer<br>is on a military installation stateside, he can detain the civilian and<br>contact local authorities to come pick up the criminal. This is because<br>stateside, military installations are under \"concurrent jurisdiction;\"<br>the base is both a military installation and a part of a city or county.<br>If the military police officer is not on a military installation, he has<br>the same \"citizen\'s arrest\" powers that anyone has, except that he<br>may be armed under the provisions of the Law Enforcement Officer\'s<br>Safety Act (LEOSA).\<br>\<br>*2. If a member of the military commits a crime and there are no MPs<br>around, like deserting in a combat zone, can superior officers<br>detain/arrest them until there are MPs around?*\<br>Yes, though it\'s unlikely. Normally, a superior officer would order the<br>military member to report to the MPs, and he can be escorted to the MPs<br>by an NCO. He does have the authority to detain a deserter, but like I<br>said, it would be challenging in a war zone.\<br>\<br>If a military member commits a crime under the Geneva Convention or he<br>violates a local law, the superior officer can order the military member<br>be detained and transported to the MPs.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
