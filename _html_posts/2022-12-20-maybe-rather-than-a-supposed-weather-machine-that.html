<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>> Maybe rather than a supposed weather machine that Democrats use to<br>> wreak havoc on republican states, maybe it\'s God\'s anger at them for<br>> worshipping a false idol in trump.<br><br>First, there is no sane person who believes that Democrats have a<br>weather machine that keeps the evil minorities from voting. Sheesh, get<br>a grip.<br><br>Second, God isn't angry at us for sinning. He's sad, but He knows we are<br>*ALL* sinners, and that means me, *and you too*. Yes, you reading<br>this answer, you're a sinner, too. We have *ALL* fallen short of<br>God's glory. None of us deserve God's grace. Every one of us deserves<br>nothing less than to be cast into Hell.<br><br>But the two greatest words in the Bible: *BUT GOD*<br><br>We deserve nothing less than Hell. *BUT GOD* showed us grace when we<br>deserved damnation.<br><br>God doesn't cause bad weather when we vote Republican, just as He<br>doesn't cause bad weather when we vote Democrat, or Independent, or any<br>other way conceivable. Voting is our civic duty.<br><br>> God couldn\'t possibly like such hateful people that republicans are?<br><br>God loves you *despite* the hate in your heart. Know that. But God wants<br>you to be *better*. God wants you to ask Him for forgiveness and for you<br>to live *better*.<br><br>And as difficult as it may be to believe, there are hateful people of<br>*every* political affiliation, even no political affiliation at all.<br>Simply being a Republican doesn't make you hateful. Ultimately, God<br>doesn't care who you vote for. God cares *why* you voted the way you<br>did. God cares that you have repented of your own sins and accepted<br>Christ as your savior.<br><br>Voting is not a sinful act. Voting is actually fulfilling God's command<br>for us to submit ourselves to the government that He put in place, since<br>all of our government leaders are still subservient to His authority. No<br>one ascends to power who wasn't placed there by God. God allows all this<br>to happen in accordance with His plans.<br><br>Voting doesn't make you sinful. Having sinful thoughts and doing sinful<br>things makes you sinful. Can you vote sinfully? Sure, if your goal is to<br>use your vote for sinful purposes. But I'm pretty sure that everyone who<br>votes believes that the people they vote for will do the best job they<br>can in the best way they think it can be done.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
