<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>There is an ocean's worth of difference between "Christians" and<br>"Christian Nationalists," specifically those who hold to the belief that<br>Trump is some kind of "anointed" savior. While he's definitely not the<br>second coming of Christ, he is, in their minds, specially anointed by<br>God.<br><br>Their evidence? Two attempted assassinations, one foiled by mere<br>centimeters, and another foiled by the efforts of the US Secret Service.<br>Additionally, he markets himself as a representative of those people who<br>traditionally have felt marginalized because of their "Christian"<br>beliefs. And he's not a timid representative. On the contrary, he's a<br>tough guy who will bust heads when needed to fight for his people. And<br>that's what these folks are ultimately looking for: someone who will<br>stand up to "the swamp" and to "liberal elites" and fairly represent<br>everyone for a change.<br><br>As hard as it may be to believe, you must understand that people who<br>believe this way are *most definitely* *not* mainstream<br>Christians.<br><br>(And also, as hard as it may be for some of you to accept, I don't hold<br>to this view; I'm merely reporting. Please don't shoot the messenger. I<br>am a Christian, not a Christian Nationalist in this way)<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
