<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>> *You are not guaranteed the right to bear fully automatic arms. Nor<br>> are you guaranteed the right to own tanks, artillery, or nuclear<br>> weapons.*<br><br>Actually, those are both untrue. You can bear fully automatic arms,<br>tanks and artillery. You must have special permission to do so, and<br>getting the investigations and tax stamps required to do so are not<br>cheap. Also, since *new* fully-automatic weapons cannot be<br>registered, there is a limited quantity of them available, which means<br>they too are quite expensive.<br><br>Also, there is no Constitutional restriction into owning nuclear<br>weapons. However, you will likely run afoul of the Nuclear Regulatory<br>Commission's rules on storage and use of such devices. There are copious<br>regulations which you must follow, and you have to be certified in order<br>to be permitted to own actual fissile material. Fat chance that the NRC<br>will ever authorize anyone outside the DoE or DoD to ever own such<br>devices.<br><br>But as far as the Constitution is concerned, the plain language of the<br>Amendment does not prohibit those things. Either cost, complexity, or<br>government regulation does.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/What-needs-to-be-said-to-gun-control-advocates-to-help-them-understand-what-a-right-is/answer/Haywood-Jablowme-9<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
