<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Look, Nicholas, I know that the United States is a very litigious<br>society. But c'mon, man, really? Someone threw a soccer ball at you and<br>you want to sue?<br><br>[https://youtu.be/4PLvdmifDSk?t=1\...(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=082d59&url=https://youtu.be/4PLvdmifDSk?t%3D1m40s){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="youtu.be"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>Applying what Dr. Malcom said to your situation, you're so preoccupied<br>with whether or not you could, you didn't stop to think if you<br>should.<br><br>*Can* you sue? Of course you can. *Should* you sue? In my opinion, no.<br><br>You can sue for assault and battery in civil court. You might get some<br>money for pain and suffering, if you can prove that you have suffered<br>because of the attack. But you've got an uphill battle in front of you.<br>You may have also been doing something illegal too. Did you know that<br>using vulgarity in a school zone may also be illegal in your<br>jurisdiction? You would now have the crime you committed up against a<br>civil infraction your opponent committed, and your misdemeanor trumps<br>his civil infraction. So you ought to be careful wielding the lawsuit<br>stick. You may get some blowback onto yourself going that route.<br><br>My advice to both of you: grow up. You're not little kids anymore.<br>It's time to brush it off, admit your own culpability, accept it for<br>what it is, and move on.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
