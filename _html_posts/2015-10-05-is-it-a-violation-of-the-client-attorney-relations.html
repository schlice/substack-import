<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [While this question borders on a specific question,<br>generally speaking it is legal.\<br>\<br>Whether or not it is considered misrepresentation is another thing<br>altogether.\<br>\<br>If you specifically told your attorney, in writing, that you didn\'t<br>want an order filed, your attorney received your request, understood<br>your request, and then filed anyway, it may certainly qualify as<br>malpractice. But it may not: the court may have ordered him to file an<br>amended order. We don\'t know, and answering any more specifically<br>borders on \"specific legal questions\" which shouldn\'t be asked here.\<br>\<br>So what can you do?\<br>\<br>- File a complaint with the state attorney\'s licensing and disciplining<br>agency. Every state has an agency which licenses attorneys and also<br>provides disciplinary actions. For some states, it\'s the bar<br>association. For others, it\'s the state supreme court. Most of these<br>agencies won\'t actually act unless the violation was egregious (i.e.<br>didn\'t show up in court, has a drug problem, etc). And they move at the<br>speed of government, so expect to not hear from them for some time.<br>They\'re not at all interested in \"speedy resolution\" of issues.\<br>\<br>- Alternatively, get a second opinion. Hire a second attorney to review<br>the work of the first. It\'s not all that expensive: an hour or two in<br>consultation with you plus time reviewing documents. And it will help<br>you decide what to do about your primary attorney.\<br>\<br>Suing for malpractice is tough. You have to have lost your case and lost<br>money in order to sue. You have to prove that your lawyer screwed up,<br>and you have to prove that you would have won your case otherwise. Plus,<br>it\'s often very expensive to sue for malpractice.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
