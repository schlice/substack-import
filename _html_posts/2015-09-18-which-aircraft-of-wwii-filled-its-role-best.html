<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [We spend our time talking about American and British<br>aircraft, which were stellar, but we do forget sometimes to talk about<br>the German aircraft which were producing some pretty impressive numbers<br>themselves.\<br>\<br>The Luftwaffe was producing aces with some pretty impressive kill<br>numbers in planes like the Messerschmitt Me-109, the Focke-Wulf Fw-190<br>and the Messerschmitt Me-262. 99 different German pilots tallied over<br>100 kills *each* in these airframes. The Luftwaffe was a fighting<br>force to be reckoned with.\<br>\<br>The clear leader on the kill board was Major Erich Hartmann, the \"Black<br>Devil of the Ukraine.\" Hartmann tallied an unmatched 352 victories. All<br>but seven of them were Russian. Major Gerhard Barkhorn was next on the<br>leaderboard with 301 kills.\<br>\<br>The RAF had its work cut out for it defending against the Luftwaffe, but<br>Air Chief Marshal Sir Hugh Dowding did just that. His ingenious early<br>warning radar stations were able to detect approaching German aircraft<br>and pass their intel back to Fighter Command to task out Hurricanes or<br>Spitfires. After the Battle of Britain, Prime Minister Winston Churchill<br>made his famous remark, \"Never in the field of human conflict has so<br>much been owed by so many to so few,\" as he spoke of the RAF pilots.<br>And they were incredible. The one example that stands out in my mind is<br>the \"indestructible\" Al Deere. He was shot down *seven times* and<br>survived two mid-air collisions. He ended the war with 22<br>kills.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
