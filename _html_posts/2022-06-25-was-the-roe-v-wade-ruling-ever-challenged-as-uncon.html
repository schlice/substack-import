<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>No, there isn't anything covered by law that is exclusively a state's<br>right issue, because the Federal government can still pass laws which<br>apply to all 50 states. They didn't pass an abortion law because there<br>is no political will to do so, and the only laws proposed only appeal<br>directly to one side of the political debate, and so they did not move<br>forward. Since no one in Congress is willing to compromise, the law did<br>not pass.<br><br>The ruling in *Dobbs* corrected a mistake by the Court. *Roe* was<br>decided on the basis of a made-up right to privacy, which does not exist<br>in the Constitution. This is why that case was overturned.<br><br>Essentially, the Court determined that an issue like this should be<br>handled by the individual states, because they know that Congress<br>doesn't have the requisite authority to enact such a law. This doesn't<br>stop Congress from trying. It wouldn't stop them from passing a law<br>binding on all of the states, but they would have to do so under some<br>Constitutional authority. I'm curious which Constitutional authority<br>they would attempt to cite in order to pass abortion laws for all 50<br>states. The Commerce Clause?<br><br>Nevertheless, because Congress can not/did not act, the issue is left to<br>the states to decide for themselves.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Was the Roe v.
