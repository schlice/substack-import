<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>When my dad was a cop, they raided a drug dealer\'s home. This was<br>during the early 80s.<br><br>This drug dealer had fortified his home so no one unauthorized could<br>make it in. First, he had fenced in the yard and filled it with attack<br>dogs. He then constructed a concrete \"man-trap\" inside the front door<br>and replaced his entry doors with steel security doors. Within the<br>man-trap was a small teller window from which they could transact their<br>business.<br><br>To conduct the raid, first an officer in plain running clothes jogged by<br>the house and tossed raw chickens stuffed with sleeping pills over the<br>fence. Within 20 minutes, the dogs were neutralized as a threat. Then,<br>the main raid force moved in. They took the large department tow truck<br>(which can tow tractor-trailers and Sherman tanks) and drove it through<br>the chain-link fence and through the picture window (essentially, they<br>drove it through the front of the house). The security thug in the<br>living room literally pooed himself when the truck came in. The fenders<br>around the front tires of the tow were diamond-pattern stainless steel,<br>and they were stair-stepped. The raiding group simply climbed up the<br>fenders and into the house.<br><br>I tell you this story because if the police want into your house and<br>they have a warrant (even a \"no-knock\" warrant like this one), they<br>will get in. And if they have a warrant, then a judge has signed off on<br>the evidence presented and agreed that illegal drug activity was indeed<br>taking place inside that home. Remember that the evidence has to be<br>really solid before a judge is going to sign off on a \"no-knock\"<br>warrant, and there has to be real, conclusive evidence that knocking on<br>the door and announcing the warrant will result in lives lost and<br>evidence destroyed. These warrants are not issued lightly.<br><br>What I\'m trying to tell you is that the only people who need to protect<br>themselves against no-knock warrants are criminals.<br><br>So to clarify what I said before and to answer the specific question:<br>*How much would it cost to fortify your home against a no-knock<br>warrant?* It can't be done. If the police want to get in, they will.<br>There is no amount of money that will keep the police out if they choose<br>to get in. Unless you live in a bunker underground and it has no<br>entrance, the police will get in.<br><br>\<br><br>Hi readers! I'm moving! No, not my house, my column!
