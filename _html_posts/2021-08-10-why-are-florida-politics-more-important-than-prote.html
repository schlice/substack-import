<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>So let's see if we can first figure out the risk before we start<br>invoking the *false dilemma* of "it's either Florida politics or a<br>child's health." Thou shalt not use logical fallacies. *Strike one*.<br><br>First, we must get this ridiculous idea of containment out of our heads.<br>If vaccinated people can transmit the virus to anyone, including<br>unvaccinated and vaccinated people, then **there is zero hope of<br>containment.** Masks, which only had a 15% probability of slowing down<br>the virus at best, are entirely useless here. We know that 85% of<br>people who contracted COVID-19 wore their masks "always" or "often" and<br>88.7% of people who did not contract COVID-19 wore their masks as much<br>as that as well. Masks *marginally* help, but not much.<br><br>So if we can't *contain* the virus, and we basically know that **at some<br>point, everyone will get it,** what's the real risk? We must then<br>examine the risk of hospitalization and death from COVID-19 in children.<br><br>The most complete study we currently have is from the UK, which studied<br>the time period February 2020 to February 2021. In that time, 25<br>children under 18 died from COVID-19. That said, most of them had<br>underlying health conditions:<br><br>- Around 15 had life-limiting or underlying conditions, including 13<br>  living with complex neuro-disabilities<br>- Six had no underlying conditions recorded in the last five years,<br>  though researchers caution some illnesses may have been missed<br>- A further 36 children had a positive Covid test at the time of their<br>  death but died from other causes.<br>- Though the overall risks were still low, children and young people who<br>  died were more likely to be over the age of 10 and of Black and Asian<br>  ethnicity.<br><br>Researchers estimate that 25 deaths in a population of some 12 million<br>children in England gives a broad, overall mortality rate of 2 per<br>million children.<br><br>In that same timeframe, 251 children were admitted to the ICU with<br>COVID-19.<br><br>**That means that a child under 18 has a 1 in 50,000 chance of being<br>admitted to the ICU, and a 1 in 500,000 chance of<br>dying.**\[1\](#mRvOV){#cite-mRvOV .citation_link}<br><br>The researchers say these studies are the most comprehensive on the<br>effects of COVID-19 in children in the world, cementing well documented<br>findings that *children are less likely to get seriously ill and die<br>from COVID-19 than adults.* \[2\](#qJycm){#cite-qJycm<br>.citation_link}There is a thousand-fold difference in risk of death<br>between the elderly and children.<br><br>So does this data require the "doom and gloom" analysis that many people<br>are pushing today?<br><br>While caution is always advised, I think that given this data, it makes<br>sense to not *mandate* masks for children, but *strongly advise* them.<br>Perhaps parents can, you know, parent their children and tell them<br>to wear their masks in school, or not. Masks aren't going to stop<br>transmission as we already know. So it's not like we're going to be<br>stopping children from spreading COVID between themselves and then<br>bringing it home. That's a risk that parents have to take, and you would<br>think that parents would be vaccinated, but again, that's up to the<br>parents to decide. It's not for the state to mandate.<br><br>So I'm not seeing the false dilemma of "either Florida politics or<br>children's health." I think that children, among any group, are at the<br>least risk from the worst outcomes from COVID-19. Let's focus our<br>efforts on those who are the most at-risk in society before we focus on<br>those who are arguably the least at-risk.<br><br>That's common sense public health policy, driven by data. If a<br>politician creates policy based on that, then I'm happy.<br><br>\<br><br>*Sorry, no comments on this one. Too contentious a topic, and too many<br>vax-pushers have no common sense, and I have no time to teach it to<br>them.*<br><br>*If you don\'t like what I wrote, tough shit. If my answer is<br>grammatically low-quality or is un-cited opinion masquerading as fact,<br>downvote it. If you think I\'m wrong, write your own answer. But Quora<br>is a question-and-answer site, not a debate site. If you were simply<br>going to comment to tell me \"ackshually, you\'re wrong,\" then you're<br>the reason why I disable comments. Well done, Karen. You ruined it for<br>everyone.*<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-mRvOV){.citation_index} [[Covid: Children\'s extremely low<br>risk confirmed by<br>study](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=1ed728&url=https://www.bbc.com/news/health-57766717){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="bbc.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>\[2\](#cite-qJycm){.citation_index} [[Children Have 'Extremely Low'<br>Risk Of Death And Hospitalization From Covid, Large U.K. Study<br>Shows](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=9733bd&url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/roberthart/2021/07/09/children-have-extremely-low-risk-of-death-and-hospitalization-from-covid-large-uk-study-shows/?sh%3D38947ea25fa8){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="forbes.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
