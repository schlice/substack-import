<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>While the car is indeed your property, when you *voluntarily* drove the<br>car onto school property, you agreed to respect school rules, which<br>includes not smoking on school property. You (and your car) agree to be<br>bound by those rules, and you tacitly agreed to that when you drove your<br>car onto school property.<br><br>If you instead leave you car in the parking lot and walk off of school<br>property (perhaps onto the public sidewalk outside of school property),<br>you can have your smoke.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
