<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Can an officer arrest someone with no proof?<br><br>The level of proof required for arrest in the United States is called<br>"probable cause." It means that the officer has to have a logical<br>belief, supported by facts and circumstances, that a crime has occurred,<br>or is about to occur.<br><br>The level of proof required to *detain* someone is called "reasonable<br>suspicion." It's a "reasonable belief" based on facts and circumstances<br>that a crime may have been committed, or is about to be committed.<br><br>Taking [[Steven<br>Clelland](https://www.quora.com/profile/Steven-Clelland)]{.qlink_container}'s<br>examples, "someone hanging out behind a closed store in the middle of<br>the night, in an area where burglaries have taken place" constitutes<br>"reasonable suspicion" that a crime may have taken place, or is about to<br>take place. That person can be detained and questioned to see if that is<br>truly the case. "Someone behind the same store with a crowbar in his<br>hand trying to force the door open" is "probable cause" to effect an<br>arrest for attempted burglary and possession of burglary tools.<br><br>After the person is arrested, they are arraigned. Arraignment is where<br>the person hears the charges against them and gets to plead guilty or<br>not guilty.<br><br>Some states will automatically schedule a preliminary hearing at this<br>point if the person pleads not guilty, and in some states, a preliminary<br>hearing must be requested. In either case, at the preliminary hearing,<br>the state must prove that they had probable cause to believe that a<br>crime was committed and the defendant did it.<br><br>Back to your question: at this point (the PC hearing), if the officer<br>arrested someone with no proof, the state would not have any proof to<br>show that they had probable cause to effect the arrest, and the case<br>against the defendant would be dismissed and the defendant would be<br>released.<br><br>So can a person be arrested without proof? Yes they can, but they won't<br>get very far through the system before they are released for, you<br>guessed it, lack of proof.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
