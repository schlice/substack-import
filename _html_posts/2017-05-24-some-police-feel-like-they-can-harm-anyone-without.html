<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>You have started with a strawman argument without any proof. There is<br>zero evidence to support your statement that *even some* police officers<br>feel like they can harm citizens and not face punishment. So to answer<br>your question, we're not going to spend the hundreds of millions of<br>dollars to invent a second force to protect citizens from the police<br>when there is absolutely zero evidence that we even need one.<br><br>Now that the answer is out of the way, let's discuss some of the reasons<br>why we don't need what you're asking for.<br><br>First of all, police are under far more scrutiny than civilians, and<br>they are very well aware of that fact. Where a civilian only faces the<br>judicial system, police face review by the judicial system for<br>violations of law, a review board within the department looking for<br>violations of police policy (not law), as well as (these days) potential<br>review by the US Department of Justice for violations of civil rights.<br>What other profession is so scrutinized? Also, how many other<br>professions are being recorded all the time? With the advent of cell<br>phones with embedded cameras, everyone can record at any time, and<br>people love to record the police, just waiting for them to screw up just<br>a little bit to get their 15 minutes of YouTube fame and a few more<br>likes and subscribes. Police generally presume that every time they step<br>out of the cruiser, someone is recording them. With that kind of<br>scrutiny, no officer in his right mind would ever presume that they<br>could harm someone without punishment.<br><br>Secondly, there were some officers a few decades ago who had this<br>mindset, but the nature of the police force is changing. New officers<br>coming on board grew up in a much more "sensitized" environment, where<br>ensuring people's "feelings" are protected is just as important as<br>enforcing the law. Officers who were trained in the environments in the<br>70's and 80's are retiring. So naturally, those old, bigoted attitudes<br>which existed are on their way out anyway.<br><br>Finally, and this is important, no one is saying that it won't happen,<br>or that police are somehow immune to that sentiment. Sometimes, officers<br>with those preconceived ideas about police superiority will slip through<br>the screening process, or some young officer will be mentored by one of<br>those older, bigoted officers, and will pick up some of those attitudes<br>towards those they serve. It has happened, and it will continue to<br>happen, but it will happen less often as we go forward, not more often.<br>There are lots of police officers, and since police come from society,<br>and we acknowledge that those attitudes exist in society, they will<br>exist (albeit to a lesser degree) in our police force.<br><br>So the need for such a protective force is simply not there.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
