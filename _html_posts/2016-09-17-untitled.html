<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>You're conflating design with purpose.<br><br>The purpose of a gun is to cause death in the target. The design<br>of the gun expels a projectile at high velocity in order to achieve its<br>purpose.<br><br>The purpose of a car is to transport people from one point to<br>another. The design of a car involves an internal combustion engine<br>producing power to drive wheels. When people sit inside the contraption,<br>and the engine drives the wheels, it achieves its purpose.<br><br>You can use anything against its intended purpose. Steering wheels were<br>designed to be operated with hands, but you could use your feet, I<br>suppose. The car will still work. You're just not using it according to<br>its design. Guns were indeed designed to achieve the purpose of killing,<br>but you can use them to put holes in paper, or trees, or to hammer<br>nails. Using it in self defense isn't going against its purpose. You<br>have promised to the criminal that you will use it for its stated<br>purpose if they don't stop their actions.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/Just-using-common-sense-does-it-seem-reasonable-that-buying-an-assault-weapon-is-lot-easier-than-getting-a-license-to-fly-or-to-drive-a-car/answer/Paul-Harding-14<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
