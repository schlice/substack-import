title: '"Attraction (interpersonal): Do men find a bit of a tummy on a woman ugly
  or is it erotic to them? In other words does a flat tummy or a bit of a pooch look
  sexier to men?"'

<br/><br/>Answer<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content: [First of all, this is all individual to each man out<br/>there. Remember the old saying, which is actually true, regardless of<br/>what the fashion industry tells you: \"Beauty is in the eye of the<br/>beholder.\"\<br/>\<br/>For me personally, I like a woman who is happy with herself the way she<br/>is. A woman who is 5\'9\" and is barely 110 lbs and is upset with her<br/>weight is unattractive, whereas a woman who is 5\'6\" and is 135 lbs but<br/>is healthy and happy is far more attractive.\<br/>\<br/>There is far more that could be said regarding this, including some of<br/>the old (albeit crass) adages that guys used to tell themselves<br/>regarding a little fat on a girl, but that\'s not stuff that I would<br/>publicly post. Nonetheless, I have grown up around both types and I\'ve<br/>gotta say that it really appeals to me when a woman believes she is<br/>attractive the way she is. Today\'s media-saturated society doesn\'t<br/>usually allow women to feel comfortable with who they are; it<br/>continually pushes them to be something more, regardless of how they<br/>currently look. Otherwise, the fashion industry would find no repeat<br/>business.]<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content language: English<br/><br/><br/>
