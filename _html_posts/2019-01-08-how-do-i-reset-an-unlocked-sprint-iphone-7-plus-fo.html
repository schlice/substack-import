If it is truly not SIM-locked, drop the new SIM in.<br>2.  It would probably be best to call T-Mobile Customer Service and<br>    ensure they have the new device in the system. They may ask for the<br>    IMEI number, which you can get by using the Phone app and dialing<br>    \*#06#.<br>3.  I would also do a full Wipe and Reset on the phone as well, but<br>    that's just me. It's probably not completely necessary.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
