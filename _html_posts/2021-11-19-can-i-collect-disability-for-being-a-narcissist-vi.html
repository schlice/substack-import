This includes people who have a record of such an<br>impairment, even if they do not currently have a disability. It also<br>includes individuals who do not have a disability but are regarded as<br>having a disability."\[1\](#UnYPP){#cite-UnYPP .citation_link}<br><br>Being a victim of a narcissist is exactly that. It's something you seek<br>therapy for, not claim disability for. You can recover. You are not a<br>"forever victim."<br><br>HOWEVER, *the narcissist* may actually be disabled! Narcissistic<br>Personality Disorder (NPD) is a form of mental illness. Mental illness<br>can be a disability if it is significantly impairing, such that it<br>substantially limits one or more major life activities. The degree and<br>extent to which a person\'s functioning is impaired is an important<br>factor in determining mental health disability.<br><br>But for you, as a victim of a narcissist, if you're feeling disabled by<br>your victimhood, it's high time to seek some counseling assistance.<br>They'll help you feel better.
