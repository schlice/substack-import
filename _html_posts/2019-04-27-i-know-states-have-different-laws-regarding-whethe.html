<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**I know states have different laws regarding whether or not they can<br>even use unmarked cars to pull over people for traffic violations, but<br>where it is allowed, what should you do if an unmarked car flashes<br>lights for you to pull over at night?**<br><br>First of all, there is no law which allows you to ignore the commands of<br>a police officer, even if you feel scared or threatened or unsafe. Just<br>know that if you are being stopped by a real officer and you do refuse<br>to stop, you could legally face a "failure to stop" charge, in addition<br>to the reason the officer was stopping you in the first place.<br><br>However, in some states, especially where unmarked cars are used, it has<br>been recommended that if you feel unsafe stopping, you are to slow down,<br>move towards the right shoulder, turn on your hazards, and call 911<br>immediately. The 911 operator will confirm whether or not the officer is<br>real. If he is, you must stop immediately, despite your fear.<br>Failing to stop at that point will most certainly get you arrested and<br>charged.<br><br>If you cannot make the call for any reason, well now you're in a pickle.<br>Your only real option is to drive directly to the nearest police station<br>and beg for forgiveness. It is questionable whether or not you'll<br>actually get it. But that's the risk that you run when you choose to not<br>stop.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
