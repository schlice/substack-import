<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>While I am a conservative and a Trump supporter, I'd ask to see any of<br>the proof you have that the DNC can be even indirectly tied to either<br>assassination attempt.<br><br>What *can* be tied to both attempts is the unhinged rhetoric from<br>the left describing Trump. In fact, it is alleged that the second<br>assassin was *directly* influenced by that rhetoric.<br><br>It's stuff like Biden telling his supporters that they needed to "put a<br>bulls-eye" on Trump. It's the left equating Trump to Hitler, saying that<br>Trump is an "existential threat to democracy." All it takes is one (or<br>two) unhinged individuals to *take them seriously.*<br><br>And as Charlie Kirk [[said today on<br>X](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=922581&url=https://x.com/charliekirk11/status/1835420770467811490){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="x.com"}]{.qlink_container}, this is only the beginning.<br>"They're going to keep trying to kill Trump," he said.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
