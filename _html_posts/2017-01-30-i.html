<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>First of all, everyone's experience at the Academy is different.<br>Although many people find it to be extremely difficult, it is<br>challenging for everyone. I think "absolute hell" is a little bit of an<br>overstatement of the challenges that you will face during your time at<br>the Academy. But remember, it gets better the longer you're there, and<br>nothing lasts forever. It's like Survivor. You need to outlast the bad,<br>and you'll get to the good. Guaranteed, or your money back.<br><br>Here's an insider hint in terms of academics: *they give you more<br>homework than you can possibly accomplish.* This means you have to<br>practice some form of time management to get the important stuff done.<br>It also means you have to determine if there is some homework that you<br>aren't required to do and that you personally don't need to do. If you<br>resign yourself to doing every scrap of homework that is thrown at you,<br>you'll never sleep because there is simply more work to do than can<br>possibly be accomplished in the time allotted.<br><br>Academic Call to Quarters (ACQ) is from 8 to 11 every weeknight. This<br>time is allotted to ensure that there is nothing that interrupts you for<br>three hours a night so you can get homework done. Manage your time<br>correctly, and you can get all of your work done during this window.<br><br>While there are some weekend activities (such as Saturday Morning<br>Inspections, or SAMIs), most weekends are your time. Once any squadron<br>activities are complete, your weekends are usually yours. Sundays, of<br>course, are reserved for your faith activities, if you choose.<br><br>The pass structure also tells you who will be around and when. Based on<br>your class, you will progressively get more and more freedom and more<br>passes. Freshmen will spend most of their weekend time in Arnold Hall,<br>since off-base passes will be few, and any free time off-base will<br>probably be spent with your sponsor family. In contrast, seniors don't<br>spend much of their free time on base, as they focus on transitioning to<br>life outside of the Academy, as an Air Force officer.<br><br>Look, I'm not gonna lie, freshman year will be tough. But you're tougher<br>than them. Many have gone before you, and some of us have even been<br>"fortunate" enough to be on the Dean's "other" list, if you know what I<br>mean. And we \*still\* graduated. A running Academy joke: You know what<br>they call the last graduate in the Order of Merit?
