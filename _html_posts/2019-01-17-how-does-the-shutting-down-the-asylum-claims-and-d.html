<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**How does the shutting down the asylum claims and deploying the<br>military to the border solve the illegal immigration problem?**<br><br>It doesn't "solve" the illegal immigration problem. It helps the US<br>focus efforts elsewhere.<br><br>First of all, the US didn't "shut down" asylum claims. The US said, "If<br>you want to make a claim of asylum, you have to do it at a border<br>checkpoint, or you have to be on an active or expired (within five<br>years) visa. In other words, you either have to present yourself to CBP<br>at a border crossing, or you must be in the country legally. You can no<br>longer be in the country illegally and apply for asylum.<br><br>If you are found in the country illegally, you will be deported. You can<br>come back to a border crossing to make your asylum claim.<br><br>Adding military personnel to supplement CBP also helped the issues at<br>the border. It didn't "solve" anything.<br><br>Nothing will be "solved" until both sides come to the table and<br>*HONESTLY* discuss illegal immigration. Neither side wants to<br>honestly discuss the issue. Until that happens, the problem of illegal<br>immigration isn't going to be solved.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
