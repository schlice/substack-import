<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Can Congress allow witnesses to remain anonymous to the public?<br><br>Yes.<br><br>Congress is free to conduct its investigations in whatever way it sees<br>fit, or to conduct no investigation at all and proceed directly to<br>voting on Articles of Impeachment.<br><br>But that wouldn't play very well with the general public. It would make<br>it seem like they didn't do their due diligence. Hence, hearings.<br><br>But let's see how many Representatives change their votes by the time<br>all of this dog-and-pony show is done. We'll use that to determine how<br>worth it the investigations were to Congress.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
