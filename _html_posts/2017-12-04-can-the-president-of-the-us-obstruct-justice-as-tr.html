<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Yes, the President can indeed obstruct justice. Clinton did it when he<br>tried to influence potential witnesses to not tell the truth. Nixon did<br>it; he paid hush money, he told people to lie, he destroyed evidence.<br><br>It is indeed possible for presidents to obstruct justice.<br><br>Has Trump done it? Did he obstruct justice by firing Comey?<br><br>The short answer is no.<br><br>The President has the authority to fire the director of the FBI under<br>Article II. It cannot be obstruction of justice if you are exercising<br>your power under the Constitution, *even if you do it specifically to<br>avoid your own prosecution!*<br><br>Case in point: George H.W. Bush did it. He pardoned Casper Weinberger to<br>forestall the investigation that would have eventually implicated him.<br>No one talked about obstruction of justice then.<br><br>Trump *could have* done the same thing here! ***He could have pardoned<br>Mike Flynn!*** He has the power to pardon Flynn, but he chose not to. If<br>Flynn was pardoned, he wouldn't have to cooperate with the Special<br>Counsel. *But he didn't!* That alone should tell you that there is<br>no obstruction of justice.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
