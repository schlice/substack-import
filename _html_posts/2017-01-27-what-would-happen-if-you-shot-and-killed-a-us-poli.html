<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>You would be arrested and charged with manslaughter, the fact that the<br>person you killed was a police officer would be an aggravating factor in<br>most jurisdictions.<br><br>As we've said many times on Quora, the intersection between the Castle<br>Doctrine and the No-Knock Warrant is a dangerous one.<br><br>First, we must assume that both of those exist (you live in a<br>jurisdiction with a strong Castle Doctrine and the police had a No-Knock<br>Warrant). If it was not a no-knock warrant and the police announced<br>themselves before and during their entry, shooting them is murder, and<br>you go to jail if you're still alive. The only scenario in which you<br>might go to trial for aggravated manslaughter is if the police were<br>executing a no-knock warrant. If you have no clear Castle Doctrine in<br>your locality, you also go down for murder, because you don't have an<br>absolute right to defend your house with deadly force. So for the sake<br>of this answer, let's assume both of these are true. You get arrested<br>and charged with aggravated manslaughter.<br><br>Then you go to trial.<br><br>Do you win? Hard to say. It hasn't happened very often. But homeowners<br>have indeed won in some of these cases. It is tough; public opinion<br>tends to favor law enforcement when they are operating in accordance<br>with the law. So there's no sure answer for how it will go at trial.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
