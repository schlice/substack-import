<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Thanks for the A2A, Anonymous, this was a fun thought<br>experiment.\<br>\<br>Law enforcement knows that especially with murder, and especially with<br>murder with a knife (which requires force and generally aggravation),<br>the victim probably knew the killer. So the police are going to<br>*start* collecting suspects with you, as no one knew the victim<br>better than the victim\'s spouse.\<br>\<br>Your only option is to run. Far away. There are no other alternatives.\<br>(EDIT: Faking your death is an alternative. See the comments.)\<br>\<br>Ideally, you should have enough money so that you can live off the grid,<br>comfortably, for the rest of your days. Because as soon as you pop up on<br>the grid, you\'ll be caught. So before you commit this murder, you need<br>to have enough money (i.e. several million in cash) so that you can live<br>without any interaction. You will also need a new identity: new Social<br>Security number, new license, new passport. You will need to use this<br>new identity to get yourself out of the country, so it has to be good.<br>The people who provide these services are constantly being monitored by<br>law enforcement, so they have to be good as well. Which also means that<br>these will be expensive.\<br>\<br>Within hours of discovering the body, the police will be after you. Your<br>only hope of escape is to have your escape route pre-planned, and to<br>time the commission of the murder to coincide with your flight out of<br>the country. As soon as the body is discovered and the police take a<br>cursory look at you, they\'ll know you did it (he dropped off the grid<br>at the same time the crime happened). It doesn\'t take a rocket<br>scientist to figure out that you\'re running.\<br>\<br>You will have to survive on your own. You will have to abandon your<br>former life. You will not be able to make any contact with anyone you<br>knew: your parents, your friends, your acquaintances, all gone.<br>Off-limits. You will need to run to a country which has no extradition<br>treaty with the United States. Pick one:\<br>\<br>]<br><br>> Afghanistan, Algeria, Andorra, Angola, Armenia, Bahrain, Bangladesh,<br>> Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brunei, Burkina Faso, Burma, Burundi,<br>> Cambodia, Cameroon, Cape Verde, the Central African Republic, Chad,<br>> Mainland China, Comoros, Congo (Kinshasa), Congo (Brazzaville),<br>> Djibouti, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Gabon, Guinea,<br>> Guinea-Bissau, Indonesia, Ivory Coast, Kazakhstan, Kosovo, Kuwait,<br>> Laos, Lebanon, Libya, Macedonia, Madagascar, Maldives, Mali, Marshall<br>> Islands, Mauritania, Micronesia, Moldova, Mongolia, Montenegro,<br>> Morocco, Mozambique, Namibia, Nepal, Niger, Oman, Qatar, Russia,<br>> Rwanda, Samoa, São Tomé & Príncipe, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, Serbia,<br>> Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Togo, Tunisia, Uganda, Ukraine, United Arab<br>> Emirates, Uzbekistan, Vanuatu, the Vatican, Vietnam and Yemen.<br><br>(Source:<br>[WSFA.com(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=5f8395&url=http://www.wsfa.com/story/22665099/countries-with-no-extradition-treaty-with-us){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wsfa.com"}]{.qlink_container})\<br>\<br>You will have to live completely off the grid. No credit cards, only<br>burner phones (but who are you going to talk to anyway), etc. You can<br>use your new identity to establish a *second* new identity in the new<br>country. This is important, because if your identity is compromised in<br>the States, they can track you down to your new country. You have to<br>create a new, new identity to cover your tracks again. This is an<br>important step that is often missed.\<br>\<br>Then, you\'ll spend the rest of your days looking over your shoulder.<br>Was my deception discovered? Did they figure out where I went? Did they<br>discover my identities? Did her parents hire a hit man to come and kill<br>me? Since you\'re in a country with no extradition treaty, they can\'t<br>really get justice, so they\'ll get the next best thing: revenge. They<br>want their pound of flesh, and if they find you, they will extract it<br>from you, painfully. And since they know you did it, they will be<br>scouring the seedy underbelly of whatever city you lived in, looking for<br>the person who created your fake credentials so they can try to track<br>you down. The stress will age you prematurely.\<br>\<br>Even with enough money to live comfortably for the rest of my days, I<br>can\'t imagine that this would be a fun way to live.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
