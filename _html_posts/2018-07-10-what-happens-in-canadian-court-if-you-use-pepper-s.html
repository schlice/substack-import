<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What happens in Canadian court if you use pepper spray on someone who<br>tries to rape you, but the spray you used is illegal?**<br><br>First of all, not all pepper spray is illegal in Canada. According to<br>the [[Criminal Code of<br>Canada](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=8769f2&url=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="justice.gc.ca"}]{.qlink_container}, it's legal to carry a<br>product designed for personal protection against another human. However,<br>some products like mace (which has a higher concentration of oleoresin<br>capsicum, the chemical found in pepper spray) is considered a prohibited<br>weapon, [[which makes it<br>illegal.](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=2b2619&url=http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/cfp-pcaf/faq/im-ex-eng.htm){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="rcmp-grc.gc.ca"}]{.qlink_container} So if your pepper spray<br>has the Canada-correct amount of OC, it's legal to carry. So if you have<br>pepper spray in Canada, make sure it complies with Canadian law.<br><br>Secondly, even if you did use an illegal device, you are generally<br>allowed to defend yourself. However, Canadian criminal code says that<br>you are allowed to use only force that is reasonable in that<br>circumstance. Therefore, even using prohibited pepper spray against an<br>actual rapist might be permitted. Canada is very situation-dependent<br>when it comes to defenses against crimes against the person. A judge<br>will have to determine whether the force applied (in this case, unlawful<br>pepper spray) was reasonable to use in that situation.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
