<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Do you agree with John Dingell that the Senate should be abolished?<br><br>We can abolish the Senate at the same time that we abolish all the<br>states.<br><br>If you review the rest of Dingell's comments, you can see that what he<br>is really advocating for is a national government that is overarching,<br>and reducing or eliminating the authority of the state.<br><br>One of the things he advocates for is "an electoral system based on full<br>participation." But this ignores the fact that we don't have *one<br>national election*. We have 51 separate elections, and each state<br>decides on its own how to conduct those elections, along with how to<br>divvy up their electoral votes. For example, Dingell and other Democrats<br>make the argument that the minority in a state are *not heard* because<br>100% of the electors in that state vote for one Presidential candidate.<br><br>That doesn't mean the minority is not heard. It means the minority *lost<br>the state election.*<br><br>What Dingell and other Democrats conveniently ignore is the other part<br>of the Great Compromise:<br><br>Citizens vote for Representatives. States vote for the President.<br><br>As part of the original plan under the Constitution, the President was<br>elected by Congress. Opponents of too much centralized power concluded<br>that the legislature could install whomever they got together and chose<br>to head the Executive Branch, weakening its check on Congress if that<br>person was nothing more than a puppet of Congress. This is one of the<br>reasons that the Electoral College was developed in the way that it was:<br>to allow for the states to elect the President but to do it in a way<br>that *mirrored* the structure of Congress.<br><br>It also embodies the fact that *the state is a sovereign entity.* It is<br>only by ignoring this fact that you can lobby for one national election<br>instead of 51 state and territorial elections, and for abolishing the<br>Senate (or neutering it by rolling it into the House).<br><br>The very purpose of the Great Compromise is to balance the needs of the<br>*people* and the needs of the *state*. Each one of those entities is<br>sovereign: the state is sovereign, as is the citizen. The state has as<br>much right to equal representation as does the citizen. The expansion of<br>the population of the country does not change that fact.<br><br>We already have a solution to counter the imbalance of power in the<br>Senate: *the House of Representatives*. The House represents the people,<br>and the Senate represents the state. House representation is based on<br>state population, so California has much more representation in the<br>House than Rhode Island or Nebraska.<br><br>Of course, people were so confused by the 17th Amendment that they think<br>that the House is elected by the people and the Senate is elected by the<br>people so why bother having two?<br><br>I say that to get rid of the confusion, **we should repeal the 17th<br>Amendment** and let states choose their Senators. Then the House would<br>truly represent the people, and the Senate would truly represent the<br>state.<br><br>I'd say rather than slide further down this socialist rat hole, let's<br>fix the issues that got us here in the first place and repeal the 17th<br>Amendment.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
