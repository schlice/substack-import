<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If I have a vacation already paid for and have proof can I get out of<br>jury duty? Jury duty is in the middle of my trip.**<br><br>In most jurisdictions, there are two types of excusal from jury duty:<br>postponement, and disqualification.<br><br>Postponement of your jury duty can happen for any number of reasons,<br>including that you already have scheduled plans to be out of town. It\'s<br>very simple to request a postponement, and in most jurisdictions, you<br>can do it online.<br><br>On the other hand, disqualification as a juror means that you don\'t<br>have to serve during that term at all. There are only a small number of<br>reasons that a juror can be disqualified; for example, if the juror<br>cannot read, write, or speak English fluently enough to effectively<br>serve, or if the juror has a disqualifying disability.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
