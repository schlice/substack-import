<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>No, because that's not how it works.<br><br>In reality, despite what you see on TV, you're not read your rights when<br>you are placed in handcuffs. You're actually read your rights before you<br>are questioned. But you read them together with the investigator. And<br>then, when you're done going through the sheet, which says exactly what<br>the investigator says, you indicate (with a checkbox) that you<br>understand your rights, and then you sign your name.<br><br>So if someone were to claim that they were never read their rights, the<br>investigator would produce the form that they signed showing that they<br>were, indeed, read their rights.<br><br>\<br><br>Second, even if you were not read your rights, that doesn't amount to<br>false arrest. At worst, it means that any testimony you gave is<br>inadmissible.<br><br>False arrest charges can happen when the police had no legal basis to<br>arrest you. Not that they had a legal basis and it was proven to be<br>incorrect, but they had *none*. If they had a valid basis on which to<br>make an arrest and it was proven otherwise and they let you go, this<br>does not amount to false arrest. Police are required to use the<br>information they have *at the time of the arrest*.<br><br>Now, if the police cannot articulate a valid reason for arresting you,<br>and they let you go, then you *may* have grounds for a false<br>arrest/false imprisonment charge. But not if the original basis for your<br>arrest was disproven, and certainly not if you were not Mirandized.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
