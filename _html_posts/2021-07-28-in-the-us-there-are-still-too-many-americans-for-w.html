<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>There are many reasons someone may choose to not be vaccinated. And it's<br>not all about hyper-partisanship like the government is trying to make<br>you believe.<br><br>Remember: the government politicized the virus, the government<br>politicized the vaccine, and now for the trifecta of abuse, the<br>government is doing everything in its power to force people to get the<br>vaccine against their will.<br><br>Anyway, the issue is not one of a lack of information, although that<br>factors in to it. The issue is primarily a ***lack of trust in the<br>government***.<br><br>The government has done an outstanding job at undermining trust in<br>public health, and people are rightly skeptical about what our "public<br>health experts" are telling us.<br><br>It's no surprise that Biden was unable to meet his goal of having 70% of<br>the country vaccinated by the 4th of July. When the vaccines were<br>initially rolled out in December of 2020, 40% of Americans said they<br>were skeptical about them. Their doubling down and shaming those who<br>chose to bypass the jab as "morons" or "ignorant" has also backfired,<br>and has actually reinforced the position that the holdouts already held.<br><br>Nevertheless, there are some people who *should* be getting the vaccine<br>who are not. But the root cause of their reluctance isn't ignorance or<br>conspiracy theories, or Trump. [[A study done by<br>MIT](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=7c4325&url=https://news.mit.edu/2021/when-more-covid-data-doesnt-equal-more-understanding-0304){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="mit.edu"}]{.qlink_container} showed that a substantial<br>portion of public health skepticism was "highly informed, scientifically<br>literate, and sophisticated in the use of data." Skeptics used **the<br>same data sets** as those with the orthodox views on public health.<br><br>From the MIT study:<br><br>> The researchers combed through hundreds of thousands of social media<br>> posts and found that coronavirus skeptics often deploy<br>> counter-visualizations alongside the same "follow-the-data" rhetoric<br>> as public health experts, yet the skeptics argue for radically<br>> different policies. The researchers conclude that data visualizations<br>> aren't sufficient to convey the urgency of the Covid-19 pandemic,<br>> because even the clearest graphs can be interpreted through a variety<br>> of belief systems.<br><br>In other words, because the skeptics are using the same data sets,<br>vaccine skepticism becomes logical and rational.<br><br>> But most vaccine skepticism, if by that we mean reluctance, is not<br>> based on conspiracy theorizing --- it's based on risk-benefit<br>> calculations. You may think it's an innumerate calculation. But when<br>> you look at patterns of uptake in the United States, two factors stand<br>> out, factors that are larger in their effect than partisanship: age<br>> and density. The older you are and the denser your community, the more<br>> likely you are to be vaccinated. The younger you are, and the more<br>> rural your community, the less likely you are to have gotten it. This<br>> reflects the real facts about the risk of death from COVID. People may<br>> be wildly overestimating their risk from the vaccine and<br>> underestimating their risks from COVID --- but they have the<br>> directional thinking correct. Those who are in less danger, act like<br>> it.<br><br>This is why vaccine choice is so important. Why treat someone in South<br>Dakota the same way you treat someone in Manhattan?<br><br>We need a better way to think about skepticism towards the vaccines if<br>we are to move forward and get everyone who needs the vaccine to take<br>it. We have to be able to allow for people's legitimate concerns. And if<br>people are doing their own risk-benefit calculations (as the MIT study<br>found), it would help tremendously if we would not be condescending<br>toward those who have serious, legitimate questions.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>In the US, there are still too many Americans, for whatever reason,<br>aren\'t willing to get vaccinated against COVID, and now cases are on<br>the rise again. Why do so many people refuse, especially when those who<br>are suffering, are mostly unvaccinated?<br><br>\<br><br>*Sorry, had to disable comments.*<br><br>*You see the last line of my answer? The one where I said that it would<br>help tremendously if we would not be so condescending toward those who<br>have serious, legitimate concerns? Yeah, as you can see, those are the<br>people trying to fill my comment section with* ***exactly that type of<br>sickening condescension. YOU are the reason why the government's<br>politicizing of the virus and the vaccine is never going to get<br>better.***<br><br>Let's get this straight: **YOUR OPINION about whether or not their<br>concern is legitimate is COMPLETELY IRRELEVANT. They are as entitled to<br>their opinion as you are.**<br><br>*Thank you for demonstrating the* *exact behavior* *we must seek to<br>avoid.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
