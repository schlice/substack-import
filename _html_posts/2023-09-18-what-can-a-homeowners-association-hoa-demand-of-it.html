<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>An HOA can only demand of its members what it is permitted to demand<br>either by state law, or within its Covenants, Conditions, and<br>Regulations (CC&Rs), the foundational documents which establish the<br>authority of the HOA. The HOA can only demand that homeowners abide by<br>the CC&Rs.<br><br>But here's where people get tripped up. While the CC&Rs can usually only<br>be modified through an amendment process and a percentage of homeowners<br>agreeing to those changes, the CC&R usually permits the HOA to create<br>Rules and Regulations (R&Rs) which assist in the administration of the<br>rules in the CC&R, and those are created and edited by the Board of<br>Directors. And you have to follow those rules as well. And yes, the HOA<br>Board can demand you follow the R&Rs or face fines, liens and potential<br>loss of your home. Usually, those rules revolve around what the outside<br>of your home must look like, and who gets to approve those changes.<br><br>You can certainly legally challenge those Rules and say that they<br>violate the CC&R documents, or that they violate state law, but if they<br>don't do either, and the Board can articulate a valid reason that the<br>rule in question advances the responsibility of the Board (to keep home<br>values as high as possible), then the rule is probably not illegal, and<br>you have to do it.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
