<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Why do pilots land planes at high speeds in recent years rather than<br>letting the plane \"stop flying\" (lose lift from low speed)?**<br><br>Ideally, you'd always like to land at lower speed. However, when you're<br>landing in a crosswind, or when you're landing in squirly winds or gusty<br>winds, a higher landing speed is used.<br><br>Also possible: air density during hot days is lower, requiring a higher<br>landing speed to keep the wings working. This is actually a very common<br>issue here in Colorado in the middle of the summer, where density<br>altitude can exceed 8,000 feet on hot days in Denver. Heat makes the air<br>thinner, just like altitude does. The combination of heat and altitude<br>makes it even worse.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
