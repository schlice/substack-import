<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [It really is a very personal decision, and it can really<br>only be answered by the individual traveler.\<br>\<br>To me, the answer to that question depends on the length of the journey.<br>And it\'s a very personal decision. Personally, I\'m okay with the<br>amenities (food, seats, etc) in a 747 flying overseas sitting in<br>business class. Some people can\'t sleep in the business class seats<br>(which just recline a lot, they don\'t recline horizontally) and need a<br>fold-flat seat like you get in first class. You do get better food in<br>first class than you do in business class, but whether or not it is<br>worth it is really up to the person sitting in that seat. To me, the<br>food in business class is good. It\'s the difference between a high end<br>sedan and a luxury sedan.\<br>\<br>In business class, I have the same amenities (access to the same movie<br>system) that I have in first class, I have power outlets (both 110V and<br>USB power), I have WiFi, so to me a business class seat is perfect. But<br>again, it really is up to the person in the seat.\<br>\<br>If it\'s a special occasion and you\'re really pulling out all the<br>stops, I\'d go first class. But if not, I\'d save the<br>money.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
