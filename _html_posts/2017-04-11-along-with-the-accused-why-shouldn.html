<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>In addition to all the great answers here, the police are not charged<br>with preventing crime. They enforce the law, which means they bring<br>violators to justice. In order to be brought to justice, you have to<br>violate the law first. The police do not prevent people from violating<br>the law; they simply bring those who do to appear before the court to<br>answer for what they did.<br><br>Many Supreme Court decisions have found that not only is it not the<br>police's job to prevent crime, the police also have no *specific duty*<br>to protect any one individual. For example, if you got carjacked and<br>someone in your party was shot, can you sue the police for failing to<br>protect you? Many have tried. The cases that got to the Supreme Court<br>have all shown that the police do not have a specific duty to protect<br>you; they have a general duty to protect the public at large. Unless<br>some specific arrangement was made beforehand (i.e. you were in police<br>custody, etc), the police do not have a duty to defend you.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
