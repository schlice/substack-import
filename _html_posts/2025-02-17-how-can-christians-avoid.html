<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>So in order to avoid "cheap grace," we have to understand what it is.<br><br>The term "cheap grace" was coined by Dietrich Bonhoeffer in his book,<br>*The Cost of Discipleship*. It is a result of a debate in Christianity<br>in the 80s and 90s over what is known as Lordship Salvation.<br><br>During that time, some evangelical pastors were championing a teaching<br>called "carnal Christianity." The idea behind it is that **once one<br>makes a confession of faith, they are saved, *even if there is no<br>immediate obedience to the commands of Jesus and the apostles to live a<br>life of holiness***<br><br>In other words, the idea says "We can have Jesus as savior, but we<br>do not need to have Jesus as Lord."<br><br>Bonhoeffer defines "cheap grace" as "the preaching of forgiveness<br>without requiring repentance, baptism without church discipline.<br>Communion without confession. Cheap grace is grace without discipleship,<br>grace without the cross, grace without Jesus Christ." Notice what is<br>emphasized in Bonhoeffer's definition of cheap grace and what is<br>de-emphasized. **It's called "cheap" because it de-emphasizes the true<br>cost of being a disciple.**<br><br>People who advocate for carnal Christianity, or "free grace" as it's<br>often called, do not deny the necessity of good works (i.e., holy<br>living) for sanctification, but they distinguish *the call for<br>salvation* from *the call to sanctification (or discipleship).*<br><br>Cheap grace masks the cost of discipleship from people. It asserts that<br>as long as we make a profession of faith, we are saved. While this is<br>indeed true, salvation by grace alone through faith alone is so much<br>more than simply speaking the words "Jesus is Lord."<br><br>So to avoid "cheap grace," we need to remember exactly what salvation<br>is, and everything that it involves:<br><br>> We are not saved by a profession of faith. We are not saved by praying<br>> the Sinner's Prayer. We are not saved by signing a card or walking an<br>> aisle. We are saved by a living and active faith (James 2:14-26), a<br>> faith that manifests itself in repentance, obedience and love of God<br>> and our neighbor. Salvation is not a transaction; it's a<br>> transformation. Paul says it best when he says we are "new creations"<br>> in Christ (2 Corinthians 5:17). There is nothing "cheap" about<br>> grace\!\[1\](#gFyUE){#cite-gFyUE .citation_link}<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-gFyUE){.citation_index} [[What is cheap<br>grace?](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=98ab1f&url=https://www.gotquestions.org/cheap-grace.html){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="gotquestions.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
