<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [We have a national DNA database called CODIS (Consolidated<br>DNA Identification System). It receives input from the following<br>sources:\<br>]<br><br>- convicted offenders<br>- arrestees<br>- legal detainees<br>- forensic casework<br>- unidentified human remains<br>- missing persons<br>- relatives of missing persons<br><br>Also, if you are a member of the military, the Department of Defense<br>will maintain your DNA on file so that your remains can be identified by<br>DNA analysis if your remains are damaged beyond physical recognition.\<br>\<br>It\'s not likely that we will ever have a complete record of DNA<br>profiles for everyone, as it is likely to be an invasion of privacy.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
