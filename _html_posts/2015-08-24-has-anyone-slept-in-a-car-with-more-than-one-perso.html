<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Yep. Side of the road.\<br>\<br>I suppose it\'s possible, but I was unaware that cars were airtight. I<br>was pretty sure that when cars go into the water, they fill with water<br>pretty quickly. And air escapes from the cabin somehow. This leads me to<br>believe that cars are not airtight.\<br>\<br>From my experience, while the air intake can be closed off, it doesn\'t<br>make the car airtight.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
