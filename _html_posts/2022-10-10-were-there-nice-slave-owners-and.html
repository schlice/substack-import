<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I'm certain that you are thinking of the American colonies when you are<br>discussing slavery, but did you know that slavery existed in the Bible?<br><br>But slavery in the Bible was very different than the slavery we<br>experienced in the times of colonial America. **The slavery in the Bible<br>was not based on race. Most slavery in Biblical times was voluntary<br>servitude**: people sold themselves as slaves when they could not pay<br>their bills or provide for their families.<br><br>The Bible actually condemns race-based slavery when it says that all men<br>are created by God in His image (Genesis 1:27). It also condemns, in<br>both the Old and New Testaments, the practice of "man-stealing" wherein<br>Africans were kidnapped by African slave hunters, sold to slave traders,<br>and shipped to the New World to become slaves and work on plantations.<br>The Old Testament says, "Whoever steals a man and sells him, and anyone<br>found in possession of him, shall be put to death." (Exodus 21:16 ESV).<br>The New Testament also condemns the practice: slave traders are called<br>"ungodly and sinful" (1 Tim 1:8--10).<br><br>However, the Old Testament did allow for economic-based slavery and<br>regulated it. But that slavery looked nothing like the race-based<br>slavery we experienced in early America.<br><br>While I bet that no slave was truly "content," because man is designed<br>to be free and to exercise free will, I'm certain that some of the<br>Biblical slaves were a lot like indentured servants or office workers.<br>They didn't really "love" their bosses, but they did the work because<br>they needed the money. Our modern employment system has grown and<br>matured significantly, but has as its foundation the voluntary and<br>indentured servitude that has existed since Biblical times.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Were there nice slave owners and \'content\' slaves?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
