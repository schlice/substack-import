<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Why would Trump and Republicans want to get rid of the 14th amendment<br>(birthright citizenship) when his party, the Republicans were the ones<br>that pass it through in the first place? Does that show an ideology<br>shift?**<br><br>As of right now, five people have answered this question and no one has<br>actually answered the question.<br><br>The answer is that Republicans want to clarify birthright citizenship,<br>not get rid of the 14th Amendment. Why? Because the truth is that **the<br>14th Amendment was never intended to confer birthright citizenship.**<br><br>The people who wrote the 14th Amendment intended it to apply to recently<br>freed slaves, and used it as part of the way to reverse some of the<br>injustices of the *Dred Scot* ruling. They never intended it to imply<br>that anyone born on American soil immediately becomes an American<br>citizen.<br><br>The relevant section of the 14th Amendment:<br><br>> All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to<br>> the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the<br>> State wherein they reside<br><br>The part of that phrase causing controversy is "and subject to the<br>jurisdiction thereof."<br><br>The original authors recognized that citizens of foreign governments<br>were not subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, or at least<br>in the way that mattered to them. This is evident in the fact that they<br>presumed the Citizenship Clause of the 14th Amendment was similar to<br>what we had in the Civil Rights Act of 1866, that it excludes American<br>Indians who maintain their tribal ties and \"persons born in the United<br>States who are foreigners, aliens, who belong to the families of<br>ambassadors or foreign ministers\". They all agreed that children of<br>ambassadors were not citizens, but children who were born in the United<br>States to legal immigrants (even if they were not citizens) were.<br><br>However, the same concurrence in opinion does not address the children<br>of illegal immigrants. Indeed, the *Wong Kim Ark* case only<br>addressed the birth of children to people lawfully present in the United<br>States. Edward Erler argued that since the *Wong Kim Ark* case dealt<br>with someone whose parents were in the United States legally, there is<br>no valid basis under the 14th Amendment for the practice of granting<br>citizenship to U.S.-born children of illegal immigrants. He writes,<br>\"Even if the logic is that Wong Kim Ark became a citizen by birth with<br>the permission of the United States when it admitted his parents to the<br>country, no such permission has been given to those who enter<br>illegally."\[1\](#ILRnU){#cite-ILRnU .citation_link}<br><br>Therefore, the question of whether or not legal citizenship is granted<br>to children of illegal immigrants has been handled by Immigration<br>policy. In the near term, it can be overridden with a simple Executive<br>Order. However, the broader Constitutional question of whether or not<br>the 14th Amendment conveys birthright citizenship to the children of<br>illegal immigrants has never been decided.<br><br>Indeed, even the [[American Convention on Human<br>Rights](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=56cc95&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Convention_on_Human_Rights){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container} clarifies (emphasis mine)<br>that "\e\very person has the right to the nationality of the state in<br>whose territory he was born **if he does not have the right to any other<br>nationality**."<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-bce5fa120a23d1dc47d41b2f8f4ccfc3){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-bce5fa120a23d1dc47d41b2f8f4ccfc3" master_w="862"<br>master_h="443"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-33b475d32601e711bc4d52442360743f){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-33b475d32601e711bc4d52442360743f" master_w="251"<br>master_h="90"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>*Jus Soli ("right of soil" or birthright citizenship), common in the<br>Americas but rare in the rest of the world. \[Photo credit: His male<br>lover - This vector image includes elements that have been taken or<br>adapted from this file: BlankMap-World6.svg.NumbersUSAAzerbaijan Law<br>Citizenship, Public Domain,* [[*File:Jus soli<br>world.svg*](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=520260&url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid%3D7798848){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikimedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}*\]*<br><br>To that end, we should pass an Amendment which clarifies the Citizenship<br>Clause of the 14th Amendment. A brief, no-preparation draft:<br><br>> The 14th Amendment is hereby clarified to define persons "subject to<br>> the jurisdiction of the United States" as persons who have been<br>> granted permission to enter the country legally.<br><br>From here, we can debate on who among that group gets birthright<br>citizenship.<br><br>But saying that every illegal who sneaks across the border and drops a<br>kid on US soil creates a new citizen is problematic for many reasons.<br><br>**TL;DR: There is no ideology shift. The 14th Amendment means today<br>exactly the same as it meant when it was written. It's about time we<br>start applying it that way.**<br><br>\<br><br>*Sorry, no comments on this one.*<br><br>*If you don\'t like what I wrote, tough shit.
