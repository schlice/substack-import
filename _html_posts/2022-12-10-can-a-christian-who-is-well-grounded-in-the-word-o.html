<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>In general, no.<br><br>The reason: a Christian who is well-grounded in the word of God and very<br>prayerful will know a few passages just by memory:<br><br>> So do not fear, for I am with you;\<br>> do not be dismayed, for I am your God.\<br>> I will strengthen you and help you;\<br>> I will uphold you with my righteous right hand. --- Isaiah 41:10<br>><br>> Even though I walk\<br>> through the darkest valley, (some translations say "the valley of the<br>> shadow of death")\<br>> I will fear no evil,\<br>> for you are with me;\<br>> your rod and your staff,\<br>> they comfort me. --- Psalm 23:4<br><br>The Psalms are full of passages which talk about not being afraid (27,<br>46, 118, etc). I won't list them all here, but if you're feeling afraid,<br>Psalms is a great place to go for encouragement.<br><br>> Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid or terrified because of<br>> them, for the Lord your God goes with you; he will never leave you nor<br>> forsake you. --- Deuteronomy 31:6<br>><br>> Indeed, the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Don't be afraid;<br>> you are worth more than many sparrows. --- Luke 12:6<br><br>So does this mean that nothing should ever frighten you? So if you're<br>afraid of heights and you climb a tree, should a Christian never feel<br>that twinge of fear? No, that's not what these passages are saying.<br>Sometimes, fear is a natural reaction. It keeps us safe in dangerous<br>situations.<br><br>But the fear you're describing is fearing evil, and fearing challenges.<br>And what these passages tell us is that God will be with us. He wants us<br>to turn to Him when we are afraid, and He will uphold us. He will<br>protect us. He will strengthen us and guide us.<br><br>In fact, you can take that thought a little further: *if you are afraid<br>of Satan and of challenges, it's because your faith is not strong enough<br>yet.*<br><br>God has promised that if we turn to Him in our time of fear, He will<br>strengthen us and uphold us. He will never leave us, never forsake us.<br>And he has never broken a promise. So we have good reason to trust Him.<br><br>Do not live in *fear*. Live in *faith*. Turn to Him in your times of<br>fear. God is bigger than the boogeyman, as the VeggieTales song goes.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
