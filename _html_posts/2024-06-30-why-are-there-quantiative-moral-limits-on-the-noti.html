<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>That's a very dangerous notion, but Christians do it all the time in<br>self-examination. They say things like, "Well, at least I'm better than<br>*that guy*. I must be good." No, the Bible doesn't give a quantitative<br>sin level because *all sin is bad. All sin convicts you.* The true<br>question is: how good do you have to be? And the true answer is:<br>you must be perfect.<br><br>*But...but...no one is perfect! Only Jesus was perfect!*<br><br>Ah, right again. Only Jesus was perfect. God requires perfection to<br>enter Heaven, and no one is perfect. So either no one gets in to heaven<br>at all, or God has to make a way for us to get there.<br><br>And He did.<br><br>God took the punishment for our sins on Himself. He paid our<br>debt by sending His only son to die on a cross to pay the debt which we<br>rightly owe. In this way, God is completely just (sin debt is paid) and<br>completely merciful (He sent His son to die for us). God does not<br>abandon justice for mercy. God is both just and merciful. It is God's<br>grace that moved Him to save us. We didn't deserve that grace. We didn't<br>do anything to earn it. Yet we have it anyway.<br><br>How amazing is that?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
