<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What maintenance and tests is the HOA (Home owners Association)<br>required to do for retention ponds?**<br><br>If the HOA owns the retention pond, then it is up to the HOA to do the<br>maintenance of the pond. The relevant laws are managed by the state, but<br>the EPA [[has set<br>guidelines](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=eae8eb&url=https://www3.epa.gov/npdes/pubs/pondmgmtguide.pdf){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);" qt-tooltip="epa.gov"}<br>]{.qlink_container}for organizations to follow when inspecting and<br>maintaining retention ponds. It doesn't matter if it's a HOA or a<br>business which owns the retention pond, whoever is the owner of the land<br>is required to do the maintenance of the pond.<br><br>States can establish stricter regulations than these, but most states<br>simply follow the EPA guidelines.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
