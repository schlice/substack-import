<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What \"LORD JESUS SPOKE the truth ABOUT life\".IF after 2000 YEARS ANY<br>person REALIZES What JESUS SPOKE AND the truth, What WILL HAPPEN TO the<br>person?**<br><br>The seminal verse of the Bible, the central theme, the "thesis<br>statement" of the whole Bible, is John 3:16.<br><br>> For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that<br>> whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.<br><br>So let's break this verse down, because there's a lot packed in here:<br><br>For God\<br>John is talking about God himself here, and what God has done, and why.<br><br>so loved the world\<br>God loves everyone in the world, and the entire world, in exactly the<br>way he created it, with all of what we perceive to be its "faults."<br><br>that he gave his one and only Son\<br>This is a difficult one to wrap your head around. Imagine your wife is<br>in labor with your one and only son, and the doctor says that it's so<br>bad that one of them will die. You hear those fateful words: "It's your<br>son's life, or your wife's. You have to decide." You decide that your<br>other kids need a mother, and if you're selfish, you need your wife, so<br>you tell the doctor to save your wife. How difficult would that have<br>been for you to do? Now think about this: God sent his son to this earth<br>knowing full well that he would suffer and die. He made that choice,<br>long before Jesus was ever born.<br><br>that whoever believes in him\<br>Again, God says that the ONLY method of salvation is believing in Jesus<br>such that you know the sacrifice he made for you, that he accepted on<br>himself the sins of the world --- past, present, and future --- to save<br>you and to make you right with God again. And it also implies that<br>salvation is available to *anyone*, regardless of when they lived.<br>*Jesus died once, for all*. He took on the sins of the world and<br>opened the door to salvation. It is through him that we are saved. And<br>anyone can enter that door. All that is required is faith.<br><br>shall not perish\<br>This is a tough one to swallow, because it says that *some will perish*.<br>Yes it's true, not all will be saved. If, by believing, you shall not<br>perish, then *not believing* implies that you *will perish*.<br><br>but have eternal life\<br>God reaffirms that salvation is only by grace through belief in Jesus<br>and his sacrifice for you.<br><br>But you can see the implication in this phrase. **Those who do not<br>believe will not be saved.** In my estimation, when I hear "do not<br>believe," that to me implies a conscious choice. Someone has heard the<br>word, understands the word, and maybe even accepts what it says. *And<br>they actively choose to not believe in the salvation offered by Jesus.*<br>That, to me, is someone who "does not believe."<br><br>So what happens to them? Eternal separation from God. *And eternity is<br>an awfully long time to be wrong.*<br><br>And what happens to those who believe? Salvation, and eternity in<br>communion with God.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
