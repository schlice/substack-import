<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [The answer is \"it depends on which one you think tastes<br>better.\"\<br>\<br>Since \"which is better\" is a subjective answer, I will tell you about<br>the definite difference between the two.\<br>\<br>In Italy, and anywhere traditional Italian pizza is made, it is cooked<br>in a brick oven using hardwoods as the heat source. The pizza oven heats<br>to very high temperature (approaching anywhere from 850-1000 degrees),<br>cooking the pizza in minutes and producing a hard, crunchy crust.<br>Italian pizzas are generally smaller, and are easy to eat like a<br>cracker, retaining its shape as you pick it up.\<br>\<br>When Italian pizza recipes were brought to America (to New York City,<br>where most immigrants came, and later to Chicago), pizza ovens were not<br>wood-fired, as there wasn\'t much wood to be had in the big city.<br>Coal-fired ovens were the order of the day, and the temperature was<br>significantly (in pizza-land) cooler, around 450-550 degrees. This<br>resulted in longer baking times and produced softer crusts than you<br>could achieve with a wood oven. Thus, you see New York-style pizza as<br>very large, thin slices that are routinely \"folded\" down the middle<br>for ease of eating.\<br>\<br>Electric pizza ovens are usually set to around 500-550 degrees. They<br>don\'t generate the same quality of heat that brick wood-fired ovens do,<br>and the pizza cooks differently.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
