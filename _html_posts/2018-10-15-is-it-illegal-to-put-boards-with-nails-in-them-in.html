<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Is it illegal if I put boards with nails in my side yard to get who is<br>even driving through my yard?**<br><br>It's questionable whether or not the nails would be considered a "booby<br>trap" (some states may see it differently) but even without that legal<br>distinction, it's universally a very bad idea. The nails are designed to<br>disable a vehicle's tires, much like a spike strip. However, police<br>spike strips actually insert small metal tubes into the tire, deflating<br>it slowly (at least, that's how it's designed).<br><br>Let's say you put your nail boards in the side yard and a car drove<br>through and lost control and smashed into a tree, killing the passenger.<br>I'm sorry to say that you'd be on the hook for criminally negligent<br>homicide.<br><br>There are much better ideas for controlling the vehicle traffic through<br>your side yard. You could put landscaping on one side to prevent<br>vehicles from driving through. You can put boulders in place; the<br>boulders would have to be big enough to stop a car from passing through<br>undamaged, but small enough that they can be easily moved with a Bobcat.<br>Landscape companies can put the boulders in place for you. Intermix the<br>boulders with some plantings and it looks very natural.<br><br>You could try fencing, or even removable vehicle barriers if you<br>actually want to be able to move your own vehicles into that area.<br><br>Save yourself the legal trouble and just stop cars from going through<br>that area in the first place.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
