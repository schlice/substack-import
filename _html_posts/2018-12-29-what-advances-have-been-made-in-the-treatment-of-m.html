<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>What advances have been made in the treatment of Multiple Sclerosis?<br><br>In the realm of advancements in treatment of MS, we made a *massive*<br>leap in the 90's, and we've made incremental leaps since then.<br><br>In the 90's, a class of drugs formerly used to treat cancer patients was<br>approved to treat MS. That class of drugs is called *interferons*. Two<br>interferons, interferon-1A and interferon-1B were marketed as Avonex and<br>Betaseron respectively. This was the first time we had a medication<br>which could actually slow down the progression of the disease and lessen<br>its impact. This was *revolutionary* in the treatment of the disease.<br><br>But its effects were limited. Interferons only seemed to be effective on<br>relapsing forms of the disease, and efficacy was not wonderful. Those<br>with progressive forms of the disease were still out of luck.<br><br>We have advanced since then. We now have some medications which are<br>approved to treat progressive forms of MS. We even have one medication<br>specifically designed for a symptom of MS (Ampyra is specifically<br>designed to help MS patients who have difficulty walking), and that's a<br>first. All of our other treatments for symptoms were originally targeted<br>at other diseases.<br><br>Our medications have advanced beyond interferons. We have synthetic<br>proteins (Copaxone) and medications which prevent immune cells from<br>crossing the blood-brain barrier (Tysabri). We have oral medications now<br>(Tecfidera, Aubagio, Gilenya), rather than just IM or SC injectables.<br>The newest infusion-based medication (Ocrevus) is administered by<br>infusion once every six months.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
