<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Why is it that government has no duty to protect citizens, but firearm<br>infringement is done to \"protect citizens\"? If all infringements are<br>to protect citizens, the duallity under color of law for public safety<br>is by law null and void?**<br><br>Logical fallacy.<br><br>The logical fallacy you have committed is called **the false<br>equivalence**. You have claimed that the responsibility of the<br>government to *provide for the common defense* and to *promote the<br>general welfare* is equivalent to the police's responsibility to protect<br>citizens.<br><br>These two are not equivalent.<br><br>The police have a *general duty* to protect the population *at large*,<br>in the same way that laws are not designed to protect *one person,* but<br>all people. Similarly, the government writes laws and enacts policies<br>which protect the population at large, which is their responsibility.<br><br>Keeping firearms out of the hands of convicted violent felons and the<br>mentally deficient are specific things that government does to promote<br>the general welfare. These things are not specifically called out in the<br>Constitution, but are ways that the government promotes the general<br>welfare in the most specific way possible in order to achieve the<br>compelling state interest.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
