<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Should Trump impose 'Martial Law' on border to stop migrant caravan?<br><br>He cannot stop the migrant caravan. Until they reach the border.<br><br>Once they try to enter the country illegally, they can be arrested and<br>deported.<br><br>But yes, he can impose a kind of "martial law" at the border to make<br>deportations easier. Martial law in the United States is primarily the<br>suspension of *habeas corpus*, which is essentially the judicial<br>branch's oversight of law enforcement. What Trump can do is to change<br>one immigration rule: illegal immigrants cannot ask for political asylum<br>when they entered the country illegally. Potential refugees can ask for<br>asylum while outside of the country (at a US embassy), while at a US<br>border crossing, or while *legally* present in the country (i.e. on a<br>tourist visa), or for up to one year after entering the country legally,<br>even if that status has since changed to an unlawful one.<br><br>However, streamlining the caravan's return to wherever they came from<br>would be helped by removing the rule which allows illegal immigrants to<br>claim asylum, which sets off a sometimes months-long procedure whereby<br>the claims of political or religious persecution must be investigated.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
