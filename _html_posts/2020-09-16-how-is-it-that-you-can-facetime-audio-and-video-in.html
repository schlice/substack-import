<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Apple cleverly obfuscates the fact that FaceTime uses a different method<br>to communicate than cellular calls.<br><br>Cellular telephone calls ride on the Public Switched Telephone Network<br>(PSTN) after they arrive at a receiving station and are transferred to a<br>landline. PSTN is also colloquially called POTS (Plain Ol' Telephone<br>Service). Placing a call on the PSTN is more expensive because it relies<br>on interconnected switching telephone networks which have been in place<br>since the 1800's.<br><br>(Incidentally, there is an industry effort underway to replace the old<br>DC switched PSTN network with an x86-based network much closer in design<br>to the Internet.)<br><br>Because these switched networks are all independently and privately<br>owned (usually by governments), there are fees to access it.<br>Longer-distance calls incur more fees.<br><br>In contrast, the Internet was created in such a way that the only fees<br>to you are assessed at the point of entry into the network (i.e. your<br>Internet Service Provider). You are not charged interconnect fees based<br>on where your packets are routed. Your packets can go anywhere in the<br>world for one low price!<br><br>FaceTime calls ride on the Internet, while cellular telephone calls use<br>the PSTN. This is why there is a difference in fees.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
