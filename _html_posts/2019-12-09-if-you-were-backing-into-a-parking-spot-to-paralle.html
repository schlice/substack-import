<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If you were backing into a parking spot to parallel park and someone<br>pulls in head first and takes the spot, whose spot is it?**<br><br>There are no rules as to who gets a spot. General parking spots are<br>never reserved, and anyone can park in any parking spot, except for<br>legally reserved spots such as handicapped spots.<br><br>There are *etiquette* rules regarding who gets to park in a parking<br>spot, and it's clear that the other car violated the rules of proper<br>driving etiquette. If you're making your way into a spot, etiquette says<br>that you get the spot.<br><br>But that's rules of etiquette, not of law. The other driver may be a<br>complete asshat by not respecting driving etiquette, but it's not<br>illegal.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
