<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Isn't hiding the "whistleblower" from President Trump a violation of<br>his Sixth Amendment Right to confront his accuser?**<br><br>Of course it is.<br><br>The idea behind the "whistleblower" statute is to protect the<br>whistleblower from reprisal, not to shield his or her identity.<br><br>The statute prevents the accused from taking action against the<br>whistleblower for things like revealing company secrets while reporting<br>the alleged unlawful activity. It was not designed to circumvent the 6th<br>Amendment. The President still has a right to confront his accuser.<br><br>(EDIT: Let's be clear here. There is no court, and there is no criminal<br>case, so the 6th Amendment doesn't directly apply. We're not talking<br>about filing a motion or anything so procedural. It's the *idea* behind<br>the 6th Amendment that we're discussing).<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
