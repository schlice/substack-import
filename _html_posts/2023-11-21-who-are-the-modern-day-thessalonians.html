<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Thessalonica is now the city of Thessaloniki in northern Greece. It\'s<br>located on the Chalcidice peninsula, at the head of the Gulf of<br>Salonika, in the foothills of Mount Khorti√°tis.<br><br>Unless you're asking who today is *acting* like the Thessalonians of the<br>Bible's day.<br><br>If that's the case, I don't think we have a *city* like Thessalonica, a<br>church in a city surrounded by non-Christian peoples hostile to<br>Christianity. I think we have believers *embedded in cultures hostile to<br>Christianity,* such as you would find in Afghanistan or North Korea or<br>Somalia. Life is brutally hard for them.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
