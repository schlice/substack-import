<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: [Of course. The right course of action would be to go to<br>the department and file a complaint against the officer.\<br>\<br>Your assertion, however, is that police are never held to account by<br>their own departments, so people have no recourse. I was attempting to<br>show other methods that recourse can be taken.\<br>\<br>The correct course of action would be to collect all the video that was<br>taken of the incident (because everyone videos cops all the time,<br>there\'s bound to be at least one other video of the incident) and take<br>it to the officer\'s supervisor and file a complaint. But you then have<br>to trust that the department will handle it correctly and discipline the<br>officer for his violation of protocol.\<br>\<br>Do you trust that the department will provide the retaliation you\'re<br>looking for? Because you\'re not looking for justice. If the officer is<br>internally disciplined by the department and that\'s it, would that be<br>enough retaliation for you? It would be just, because the department<br>would have solved the problem and the officer was held to account for<br>his actions. But would his discipline have been enough for you? Once<br>you\'ve exhausted your proscribed actions, now what? Was his punishment<br>enough for you? If it wasn\'t, then you\'re not looking for justice,<br>you\'re looking for retribution.\<br>\<br>If you want retribution, go to YouTube or the media.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/Is-this-case-a-good-example-of-when-people-should-obey-the-police-regardless-of-their-behaviour/answer/Bill-Stein<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
