<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>According to the Americans with Disabilities Act, service animals which<br>are trained to assist with a recognized disability can go anywhere that<br>people can go. Therefore, service animals are permitted in the passenger<br>compartment of aircraft, as they likely must perform one or more of<br>their duties for their human handler throughout the flight.<br><br>Note that [[Stanton<br>Nicholas](https://www.quora.com/profile/Stanton-Nicholas)]{.qlink_container}<br>got it half right. "Service animals" are legally protected by the ADA.<br>"Emotional support animals" are *not* trained to do anything<br>special, and therefore are *not protected by the ADA*.<br>Establishments have the right to restrict emotional support animals from<br>places of public accommodation. But they don't, because in today's<br>hypersensitive, overly-maligned society, it would be bad PR to restrict<br>someone's emotional support animal. So they just don't bother. So in<br>truth, they can restrict emotional support animals, but in practice,<br>they generally don't.<br><br>Any animal, service animal or not, can be restricted if it is<br>uncontrollable or if it is a danger or disruption to the other people.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
