<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Given the opioid crisis, would you support the death penalty for major<br>drug dealers? If yes or no, why?**<br><br>What a person does for a living does not determine the punishment they<br>get for a crime.<br><br>Punishment is based on the *crime*, not the *person*.<br><br>The difference is akin to your child doing something wrong and you<br>telling him, "You're bad!" as opposed to telling him, "That was bad" or<br>"that was a bad thing to do."<br><br>The size and scope of the opioid crisis doesn't make me handle **drug<br>dealers** differently. The size and scope of the opioid crisis may make<br>me rethink penalties for the distribution of opioids.<br><br>There is a difference.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
