<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>It's not "all" Christians. It's "some" Christians. Particularly, it's<br>Christians who like to make assumptions about people.<br><br>This trait isn't limited to Christians, either. All kinds of people like<br>to make assumptions about others. It's not any better when they do it<br>than when Christians do it. It's a poor method of human interaction. It<br>indicates shallow thought and a lack of reason.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Why, when you don\'t become a Christian, do all Christians automatically<br>assume you are an evil, God hating, atheist pagan?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
