<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**How are the HOA rules and city ordinances that regulate the appearance<br>of peoples homes not violate the first amendment? Isn\'t how I choose to<br>keep my house as much an expression as what I choose to wear?**<br><br>You abrogate those rights of free expression when you sign a contract<br>agreeing to allow a third party to control those expressions.<br><br>When you buy a house in a covenant-controlled community, you sign a<br>contract. That marathon document-signing session you went through at the<br>title company included a covenant that you agreed to. You agreed to<br>allow the HOA to control the external appearance of your house. You also<br>agreed to follow any other rules that the HOA legally comes up with (and<br>by legally, I mean in accordance with the Bylaws of the Association,<br>which you also signed).<br><br>In addition, you agreed to allow the HOA to have an *ownership interest*<br>in your property. This means that if the HOA fines you and you don't<br>pay, the HOA can put a lien against your property for the unpaid amount.<br>If you still don't pay, they can foreclose on that lien, selling your<br>property out from under you to cover their unpaid expenses (plus<br>attorney's fees, of course).<br><br>You signed that contract. You agreed to all of this.<br><br>A Homeowner's Association, under state law, has broad authority to<br>regulate many things that are within its purview, including the outward<br>appearance of your property.<br><br>You agreed to that, in writing. There is no First Amendment violation<br>here, because you agreed to allow the HOA to control the external<br>appearance of your home.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
