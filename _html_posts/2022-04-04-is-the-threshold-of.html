<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>No, law enforcement is not required to back off when they are met with<br>the threat of deadly force. They are allowed to stand their ground in<br>any state in which a civilian can stand their ground.<br><br>It does seem like there is increased scrutiny on law enforcement, as<br>they are somehow expected to "de-escalate" every situation which might<br>involve the threat of lethal force. That criticism does have some legs,<br>but it's not universal. Police can't de-escalate every situation.<br><br>So while there may be the *appearance* that civilians have more right to<br>stand their ground than law enforcement officers do, in *reality*, they<br>have the same rights.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Is the threshold of "Stand Your Ground" laws less than required for Law<br>Enforcement?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
