<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The only way to remove a United States president who is "not performing<br>well" is to not re-elect him in the next election. Impeachment is<br>not for presidents who are "not performing well." Impeachment is for<br>*high crimes and misdemeanors*, not for "poor job performance."<br>Although, Democrats have watered down the impeachment to the point where<br>"anything we don't like" is an impeachable offense.<br><br>The United States chose not to include a recall option for the President<br>(like many other countries have) because the office of the President was<br>never designed to represent the people. It was designed to be the head<br>of the Executive Branch, to execute the laws written by the *true*<br>representatives of the people, the Congress. There was never intended to<br>be one seat of power in the United States.<br><br>But the office of the President has morphed into the representative of<br>the people, which the framers never intended. And Congress has given<br>more authority to the President than the framers ever intended either.<br><br>Recall was never envisioned to be something that would be needed.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
