<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Will the next American administration make a definitive law regarding<br>that a sitting President is not above the law and can be charged with a<br>crime while in office?**<br><br>No, because it doesn't make sense.<br><br>The reason it does not make sense is because the Constitution vests<br>all of the authority for prosecution in one person: the President of<br>the United States.<br><br>Article II Section 1: "The executive Power shall be vested in a<br>President of the United States of America."<br><br>Not the President and the Attorney General. Not the President and the<br>Director of the FBI. The President.<br><br>This was done intentionally as part of our system of *checks and<br>balances*.<br><br>The framers knew that Congress was going to be the most powerful branch<br>of the government. To check that power, they vested the power of law<br>enforcement in a unitary office (the President).<br><br>To that end, *all prosecutorial authority in the United States flows<br>from the authorization of the President*. When a prosecutor files a<br>charge on behalf of the Federal government, the authority to execute<br>that prosecution comes from the President. It makes no legal sense for a<br>Federal prosecutor to be able to prosecute the person who has provided<br>his authority to prosecute. In reality, anyone in that position would<br>simply disallow the prosecution, as he has the full authority to do so.<br>This effectively means that **while that person holds that office, he<br>cannot be prosecuted.**<br><br>This does not mean this person is above the law. If evidence exists (and<br>I mean real legal evidence, not the stuff Congress is blathering on<br>about) that the President has actually committed a crime, the<br>Constitution actually has a remedy for that situation: *impeachment*.<br>Once the person no longer holds the prosecution-immune office of the<br>President, he can be indicted and prosecuted. Remember, it's not that<br>the President can't be indicted, it's that the *current holder of the<br>office of the President* cannot be directly indicted.<br><br>If real, prosecutable evidence exists, you'll hear a US Attorney state<br>that they are ready to move forward with a case for indictment of the<br>President; all they are waiting for is for that person to become<br>eligible for indictment.<br><br>This has been researched by the White House Office of Legal Counsel<br>(OLC) on several occasions, and they have published [[several<br>papers](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=f465ac&url=https://www.justice.gov/olc/opinion/sitting-president%25E2%2580%2599s-amenability-indictment-and-criminal-prosecution){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="justice.gov"}]{.qlink_container} explaining the<br>Constitutional reasons why you cannot indict a sitting President, which<br>I have summarized here for you.<br><br>People mistakenly believe that it is *only* the OLC's opinion that<br>prevents US Attorneys from filing indictments against the President, and<br>that Congress, by passing a simple law, could somehow make the President<br>eligible for indictment while in office. This is not the case.<br><br>This would require a Constitutional amendment to alter the structure of<br>the Constitution such that you weaken the office of the President by<br>removing the executive power from the President, or by making the<br>executive power no longer unitary (i.e. vested in more than one person).<br>But it cannot be done with a change in law; it must be done with a<br>change to the very structure of the Constitution.<br><br>**TL;DR: Since the President holds all of the executive authority and<br>thus all of the authority of prosecution, it makes no sense for a<br>President to be able to be indicted while in office. The Constitutional<br>remedy is to remove the President from that office, and the Constitution<br>already has that remedy available: impeachment.**<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
