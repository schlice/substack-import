<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Is there a way to force a home owner association to prove that they<br>are equally giving people warnings over the same things?**<br><br>You can request all of the HOA's documentation on the notices they have<br>issued to homeowners, as well as meeting notes for all Board meetings,<br>but finding out whether or not they are providing equal warnings will be<br>difficult, if there is no record of how the HOA receives notices of<br>violations.<br><br>Secondly, the inequality must be deliberate. If a Board member receives<br>a notification of a violation directly from a homeowner and then forgets<br>and does not communicate that to the rest of the Board to send a notice,<br>is that inequality in warnings?<br><br>In our HOA, we have a centralized violation system that records reports<br>of violations and records what notices were sent and when. The notices<br>are auto-generated, so they are all recorded and available for homeowner<br>inspection. We advise our homeowners to report violations directly to<br>the Managing Agent who administers that system so that the violation can<br>be adequately recorded. We also advise them that they can talk to<br>anyone, including Board members, but we recommend that reports of<br>violations go to the Managing Agent. Email suffices as a way to record<br>interactions with any of our Board members or our Managing Agent.<br><br>If an HOA Board is not being forthcoming with their records, you may<br>have to involve a real estate attorney in your area who specializes in<br>HOA law.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
