<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Since Nancy Pelosi is obviously going to replace Biden ASAP with<br>Kamala if Biden wins, why didn\'t they just run her to begin with?**<br><br>I assume you're referring to her 25th Amendment play, making a group who<br>could legally work with the VP to take Acting President status.<br><br>While I don't think that it's going to happen "ASAP," I don't believe<br>Biden would even complete a single term (if he could get himself<br>elected, which I also doubt).<br><br>Why didn't they run Harris as President? SHE DROPPED OUT!!! Remember the<br>Democratic primaries? Democratic voters *rejected her overwhelmingly*.<br>She couldn't poll out of single-digits, and she dropped out before the<br>first state primaries started taking place. She isn't even wanted by<br>*her own party!*<br><br>But the Progressive wing of the party, they know better than *even the<br>Democratic voters.* They knew that the only way they could get her in<br>was to firmly attach her to the coattails of someone as milquetoast as<br>Joe Biden, someone who even the moderate Democrats could get behind.<br>Clearly, she was rejected by the voters. But if *we* want to make her<br>President, we can attach her to Biden. He's already showing signs of<br>failing health. She's a shoo-in. Then she can appoint another Socialist<br>as VP (Bernie?), and we can fundamentally transform America into the<br>Democratic Socialist paradise we've always dreamed of.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
