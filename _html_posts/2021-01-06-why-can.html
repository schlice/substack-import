<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Why can't Donald Trump be charged with sedition?<br><br>He can. In fact, anyone can be charged with anything.<br><br>The question is, can he be *convicted*.<br><br>The truth is, despite what you've heard here so far, he can't.<br><br>The actual charge is *seditious conspiracy.* Under Federal law, it is a<br>crime for two or more people within the jurisdiction of the United<br>States<br><br>- to conspire to overthrow or destroy by force the government of the<br>  United States or to level war against them;<br>- to oppose by force the authority of the United States government; to<br>  prevent, hinder, or delay by force the execution of any law of the<br>  United States; or<br>- to take, seize, or possess by force any property of the United States<br>  contrary to the authority thereof (18 USC ยง 2384).<br><br>To differentiate sedition from free speech, the government must prove<br>that the defendant actually conspired to use force. In other words,<br>two or more people making political speeches *advocating* for using<br>force to overthrow the government have not necessarily committed<br>sedition. In the vast majority of cases, that's protected free speech<br>(however undesirable). It is when you begin *actively planning such an<br>action* (such as coordinating the logistics of an actual overthrow<br>operation, distributing bullets, actively opposing lawful authority,<br>etc) that you cross the line into seditious conspiracy.<br><br>The goal of the law is to prevent attacks against the US while still<br>preserving the First Amendment.<br><br>In addition to the difficulty in proving seditious conspiracy,<br>*political speech* is even *more* protected. Politicians are the very<br>people entrusted with safeguarding our political system. It is most<br>likely that they would be the very ones speaking out against how our<br>system is run. To that end, political speech, being the very speech<br>which is designed to redress issues in government function, is the most<br>tightly scrutinized, with the largest amount of deference given to the<br>protections afforded under the First Amendment.<br><br>So absent some discovery of Trump actually sitting in on planning<br>meetings wherein discussions of how the Proud Boys are going to start a<br>revolution, I think you will find it unlikely that he could be charged,<br>let alone convicted, of sedition. Political speeches, *even speeches<br>which actively advocate for using armed force to overthrow the<br>government*, are also protected First Amendment speech, despite exactly<br>how distasteful such speeches may be.<br><br>\<br><br>*For the time being, I have re-enabled comments on selected answers.<br>Some people like to comment. Some people like to engage with me in a<br>civil manner, and I did kinda miss that\...a little. But do not<br>misunderstand, I take this step very cautiously, and I have no tolerance<br>for harassing or inane behavior. If you don\'t like what I wrote, tough<br>shit. If my answer is grammatically low-quality or is un-cited opinion<br>masquerading as fact, downvote it. If you think I\'m wrong, write your<br>own answer. But Quora is a question-and-answer site, not a debate site.<br>If you are simply commenting to tell me \"ackshually, you\'re wrong,\"<br>don\'t be surprised if I quietly delete your comment. Put anything<br>vaguely harassing in there, and your deletion will be followed by a<br>block/mute, and a BNBR report. I will do this immediately and with no<br>compunction. You have been warned. Be nice.*<br><br>*And if the crowd gets too belligerent here, I'll delete and disable<br>comments. They don't have to be on. Engage civilly or not at all.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
