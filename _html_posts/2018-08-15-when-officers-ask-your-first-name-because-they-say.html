<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**When officers ask your first name because they say you look similar to<br>someone they\'re looking for, would the officer just assume it\'s your<br>name or would they fully identify you first before listing you as a<br>possible suspect on a report or complaint?**<br><br>They would indeed positively identify you if they are searching for<br>someone. The idea is to make sure you are not the person they are<br>looking for.<br><br>In most jurisdictions, you must identify yourself truthfully to law<br>enforcement. In most jurisdictions, failing to identify yourself<br>truthfully is its own offense, and if they believe that you are lying,<br>they can arrest you and they can hold you until you can be fully<br>identified.<br><br>Again, if they're looking for someone, and you're not the someone, it's<br>in your best interest to be truthful, not only so that they know you're<br>not the person they are looking for, but also because as I said, lying<br>about your identity is, in most jurisdictions, a crime in and of itself.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
