<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>First, you're conflating two technologies.<br><br>Red light cameras take a picture of your car if it enters an<br>intersection (i.e. crosses the white line) after the light turns red.<br><br>Speed cameras are cameras with integrated RADAR units which check your<br>speed on a length of road and take a picture if your car is exceeding<br>the speed limit.<br><br>Speed cameras can be challenged in exactly the same way that standalone<br>RADAR units can be challenged. The size of the aperture, the distance<br>from the target, and the wavelength of the radar beam are all used to<br>determine the width of the beam at the target. If the width of the beam<br>is greater than one lane, then it is possible that the camera targeted<br>the wrong vehicle. Easy peesey.<br><br>Challenging a red light camera is much harder. The camera shows the<br>vehicle entering the intersection clearly after the light was already<br>red.<br><br>The color shift argument is also not likely to ever succeed. The reason<br>that the lights are positioned the way they are (and the reason that we<br>don't have a single, color-changing light) is so that ***the color of<br>the light is irrelevant***.<br><br>A gray light at the bottom of the stack is the green one. A gray light<br>in the middle of the stack is the yellow one, and a gray light at the<br>top of the stack is the red one. You can be color blind and still drive<br>effectively. On horizontal stacks, the green light is always on the<br>right, and the red light is always on the left. In the US, this is a<br>national standard.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
