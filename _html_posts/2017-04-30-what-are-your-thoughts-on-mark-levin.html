<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I mostly like them. They are pretty common sense and would go a long way<br>to fixing government bloat and dysfunction that took us away from our<br>original purpose.<br><br>I'd change a few and add a few though.<br><br>In case you're wondering, here's the full list:<br><br>> 1.  Impose Congressional term limits<br>> 2.  Repeal the Seventeenth Amendment, returning the election of<br>>     Senators to state legislatures<br>> 3.  Impose term limits for Supreme Court Justices and restrict<br>>     judicial review<br>> 4.  Require a balanced budget and limit federal spending and taxation<br>> 5.  Define a deadline to file taxes (one day before the next federal<br>>     election)<br>> 6.  Subject federal departments and bureaucratic regulations to<br>>     periodic reauthorization and review<br>> 7.  Create a more specific definition of the Commerce Clause<br>> 8.  Limit eminent domain powers<br>> 9.  Allow states to more easily amend the Constitution by bypassing<br>>     Congress<br>> 10. Create a process where two-thirds of the states can nullify<br>>     federal laws<br>> 11. Require photo ID to vote and limit early voting<br><br>Here's what I would change:<br><br>I would replace #5. My #5 would say: **Repeal the 16th Amendment and<br>replace it with the**<br>[FairTax(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=58cd5b&url=http://www.fairtax.org){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="fairtax.org"}]{.qlink_container}. Consumption is a far more<br>stable income source than income for the government. I won't go through<br>the whole thing here, but I like a national sales tax better than an<br>income tax.<br><br>I would also amend #6 and make it read: Subject federal departments and<br>bureaucratic regulations to periodic reauthorization and review **and<br>make all regulations passed by such agencies directly attributable to<br>the Congressional departments that authorized the federal agency.**<br>Federal bureaucrats have no accountability, and the regulations passed<br>by their departments have the full force of law. This is a<br>bureaucracy. And Congress let it happen. That needs to be addressed.<br><br>I don't like #9. I think the bar would have to be higher to bypass<br>Congress, like 4/5th of the states (40 out of 50). I know it's already a<br>high bar to get a Constitutional amendment passed, but I still feel like<br>you're approaching mob rule if you allow 3/5ths of the states to bypass<br>Congress. If you've already implemented #2 and #3, then the Senate and<br>the Supreme Court are already back to their original concepts, so<br>getting an amendment to pass Congress should be easier.<br><br>Otherwise, it's a great step in the right direction.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
