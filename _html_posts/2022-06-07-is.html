<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>It's not a good pro-choice argument, because it is based on two flawed<br>premises:<br><br>1.  Many women died due to illegal abortions before *Roe.*<br>2.  The reason that women survive pregnancy in greater numbers since<br>    *Roe* is because of abortion.<br><br>As has been pointed out already, the main protagonists in the push to<br>legalize abortion intentionally lied to make the problem seem greater<br>than it was. People like Dr. Bernard Nathanson:<br><br>> 'We fed the public a line of deceit, dishonesty, a fabrication of<br>> statistics and figures. We succeeded \[in breaking down the laws<br>> limiting abortions\] because the time was right and the news media<br>> cooperated. We sensationalized the effects of illegal abortions, and<br>> fabricated polls which indicated that 85% of the public favoured<br>> unrestricted abortion, when we knew it was only 5%. We unashamedly<br>> lied, and yet our statements were quoted \by the media\ as though<br>> they had been written in law.'\<br>> ---John Powell, *Abortion: the silent Holocaust*. 1981<br>><br>> 'How many deaths were we talking about when abortion was illegal? In<br>> NARAL (National Association for Repeal of Abortion Laws) we generally<br>> emphasized the drama of the individual case, not the mass statistics,<br>> but when we spoke of the latter it was always 5,000 to 10,000 a year.<br>> I confess that I knew the figures were totally false, But in the<br>> \"morality\" of our revolution, it was a useful figure, widely<br>> accepted, so why go out of our way to correct it with honest<br>> statistics?\' The official figures of maternal death due to illegal<br>> abortion before abortion was legalised was 160. Dr Nathanson estimates<br>> the actual figure to be around 500 maternal deaths per year.\<br>> --- Bernard Nathanson, Richard Ostling. *Aborting America*. Pinnacle<br>> Books. New York 1979.<br><br>Yes, women will get illegal abortions, but there will be many fewer<br>deaths because we now have advanced technologies like abortifacient<br>drugs which will induce delivery of a nonviable fetus. However, risk in<br>doing something illegal isn't a reason to make it legal. Indeed, robbing<br>a bank is very dangerous, but we don't make it legal simply because of<br>the risk of death from doing it.<br><br>Ultimately, it was advances in medical technology and medical care which<br>caused maternal deaths to decrease, not abortion. Maternal deaths were<br>already declining well before *Roe.*<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Is "making abortions illegal will only make them more dangerous, because<br>women will get them illegally anyway" a good pro-choice argument? What<br>should I say when someone tells me that it's not?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
