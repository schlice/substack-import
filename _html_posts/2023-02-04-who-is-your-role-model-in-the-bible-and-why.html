<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I'm going to go with Joseph.<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-71b653aed248ad13ad57fe379a6b5f2a){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-71b653aed248ad13ad57fe379a6b5f2a"<br>master_w="1200" master_h="627"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>Joseph was more loved by his father than any of his other children, so<br>much so that his father gave him a colored cloak.<br><br>His brothers resented him for this. They ultimately decided to not kill<br>him, but instead decided to sell him off into slavery.<br><br>While he was in slavery, he was taken to Egypt and he came to serve<br>Potiphar, one of Pharaoh's high officials. While serving Potiphar,<br>Potiphar's wife tried (unsuccessfully) to seduce Joseph. In a fit of<br>rage, she claimed that Joseph raped her, and Joseph was thrown in<br>prison.<br><br>While in prison, he learned that Pharaoh was deeply troubled by dreams.<br>Joseph, through his favor with God, was able to learn the meaning of the<br>dreams, and he reported what he knew to Pharaoh. Pharaoh was so<br>impressed with Joseph that he released him from prison, and after being<br>a special advisor to Pharaoh for a time, was made governor of Egypt. He<br>had to prepare the country for a famine, and he wisely rationed the<br>country's food in preparation.<br><br>While serving in this capacity, Joseph's family came to Egypt to seek<br>their rations from the government. They did not recognize him, and he<br>only revealed his identity when he was sure that they had reformed.<br>Their reunion was triumphant, and Joseph invited them to all re-settle<br>to Egypt and live with him. This story is found in Genesis 37 and<br>Genesis 39--45.<br><br>All throughout his struggles, Joseph was faithful. He was faithful to<br>God when he was sold into slavery and when he was imprisoned. While the<br>story does have a happy ending, there is no indication that, while going<br>through all of this hardship, he was ever told of God's plan for him.<br>Joseph was expected, just like you and I are, to live life in something<br>less than complete understanding of God's plan for us.<br><br>What pleased God was Joseph's faithfulness ***when nothing made<br>sense.***<br><br>That's the kind of faith I strive to have. Nothing makes sense in my<br>life, but I pray to have the faith of Joseph, who stayed faithful<br>despite nothing making sense.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
