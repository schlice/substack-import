<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I was going to get into the political part, but I really don't want to.<br>Just too much controversy. Maybe one day I'll be brave (or stupid)<br>enough to do it, but that day is not today.<br><br>Instead, I'm only going to focus on the religious part of your question.<br>You said that "this care allows those children to be who God made them<br>to be."<br><br>Since you invoked God in this discussion, let's discuss exactly what God<br>intended.<br><br>When God designed the human body, it was *perfect*. It did not age. It<br>did not get sick. It did not die. God doesn't do anything halfway. God<br>doesn't make junk. He actually made the human body absolutely perfect.<br>This was the body that Adam inhabited, and then Eve after him.<br><br>But something changed.<br><br>Sin entered the world when Adam and Eve *disobeyed God*. This was<br>the world's first sin, and it introduced a whole *host* of changes into<br>the world, including in those perfect bodies that God created. Those<br>bodies were now *fallen*, bags of skin which would decay, develop<br>disease, feel pain, and eventually die. Women (yes, the real ones with<br>two X chromosomes and functioning uteruses) would feel the pain of<br>childbirth. Men (yes, the one with the Y chromosome and a functioning<br>penis) would toil to grow food, scratching at the hard ground to get it<br>to eek out some subsistence, and their lives would be filled with<br>suffering. They would grow old, and at the end of their lives, they<br>would die.<br><br>And all that happened because of sin, not because of God.<br><br>Diseases, including the mental condition which causes you to not feel<br>comfortable in your own skin, are a result of sin entering the human<br>condition. It is one of many conditions which humans face, caused by the<br>introduction of sin into the world.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
