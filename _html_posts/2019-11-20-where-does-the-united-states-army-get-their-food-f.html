<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>While I appreciate [[Steven L.<br>Gaudry](https://www.quora.com/profile/Steven-L-Gaudry)]{.qlink_container}'s<br>reposting of my older answer, it doesn't really apply to this question.<br>So I\'ll provide a more accurate one.<br><br>**Where does the United States Army get their food from compared to the<br>Air Force?**<br><br>All of the military services get their food from the same place: the<br>Defense Logistics Agency (DLA).\[1\](#kyBhB){#cite-kyBhB<br>.citation_link}<br><br>Now I bet I can hear the gears turning. If they all get their food from<br>the same place, then...<br><br>Why is Air Force food so much better?<br><br>There are several reasons for this, but primarily, you need to<br>understand that while the food is all *sourced* from the same place,<br>that's about all that the services share. Each service gets to determine<br>*what it buys, how much it buys,* and *how much of its budget it spends<br>on food.* Each service spends money out of its own procurement budget to<br>purchase food, and each service gets the opportunity to determine how<br>much money it will spend, and on what food items. Basically, all the<br>services are shopping at the same grocery store, but they don\'t all put<br>the same stuff in their cart.<br><br>Hopefully, that last paragraph told you why Air Force food is better<br>than the other services:<br><br>- The Air Force spends more money on quality food, spices, and sides.<br>- The Air Force is smaller, and has fewer mouths to feed.<br>- The Air Force is a younger service, and thus has had the opportunity<br>  to review the other services and to see what worked and what didn't,<br>  and adjust accordingly. We did this exercise with *everything* while<br>  building the Air Force in the 40's and 50's. We put committees<br>  together and *reviewed how the Army and Navy did it,* and *how we<br>  could do it better.*<br><br>Ultimately though, and this is hard for everyone to hear, but it's the<br>truth, the reason Air Force food is better than the other services is<br><br>- As part of their multi-service review of quality of life, the Air<br>  Force chose to place a greater emphasis on quality of life than the<br>  other services. Their food budget proves this. Of course, many other<br>  things do as well, including things like the quality of enlisted<br>  housing, and the sheer wealth of services available to Airmen. But we<br>  were talking about food, and good food means good quality of life,<br>  happier troops, and ultimately, more productive troops.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-kyBhB){.citation_index}<br>[https://fas.org/sgp/crs/natsec/R\...(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=056396&url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/natsec/RS22190.pdf){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="fas.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
