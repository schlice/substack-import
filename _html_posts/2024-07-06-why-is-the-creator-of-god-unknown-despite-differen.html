This is<br>what we call the "infinite regress" and it is a problem when you have no<br>first cause.<br><br>The first cause is necessarily uncaused. The great Uncaused Cause.<br>Ultimately, that is the being who created us, even if by proxy, by<br>creating our creator.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
