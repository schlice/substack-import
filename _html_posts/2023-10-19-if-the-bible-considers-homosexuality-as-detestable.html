<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The Bible is replete with references about homosexual behavior (all<br>quotes from NIV):<br><br>> Do not have sexual relations with a man as one does with a woman; that<br>> is detestable. --- Leviticus 18:22<br>><br>> If a man has sexual relations with a man as one does with a woman,<br>> both of them have done what is detestable. They are to be put to<br>> death; their blood will be on their own heads. --- Leviticus 20:13<br>><br>> Or do you not know that wrongdoers will not inherit the kingdom of<br>> God? Do not be deceived: Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters<br>> nor adulterers nor men who have sex with men nor thieves nor the<br>> greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the<br>> kingdom of God. --- 1 Corinthians 6:9-10<br>><br>> We also know that the law is made not for the righteous but for<br>> lawbreakers and rebels, the ungodly and sinful, the unholy and<br>> irreligious, for those who kill their fathers or mothers, for<br>> murderers, for the sexually immoral, for those practicing<br>> homosexuality, for slave traders and liars and perjurers---and for<br>> whatever else is contrary to the sound doctrine --- 1 Timothy 1:9-10<br><br>And lest you think that only gay men are implicated in the Bible,<br>lesbians are also specifically called out:<br><br>> Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their<br>> women exchanged natural sexual relations for unnatural ones. In the<br>> same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were<br>> inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed shameful acts with<br>> other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their error.<br>> --- Romans 1:26--27<br><br>Jesus didn't need to say anything. Everyone knew what was detestable.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
