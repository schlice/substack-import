If you mean that it<br>will always be watching and will record motion when it sees that,<br>virtually any camera system out there will do "event recording" where<br>the camera senses an event and records it. If "record 24/7" means that<br>you want to save *all* of the camera's feed, even if nothing is<br>happening, you need something backed by a larger hard drive, or the<br>cloud. I will assume you mean the latter: you want to record<br>*everything* the camera sees, all the time, 24/7.<br><br>If you want something backed by a hard drive, you need a local "DVR"<br>solution. Any of these with a DVR would be easy to install. Just make<br>sure that the camera system you choose will record 24/7:<br><br>[[wireless camera home security<br>dvr](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=28d9ad&url=https://smile.amazon.com/s?k%3Dwireless%2Bcamera%2Bhome%2Bsecurity%2Bdvr%26ref%3Dnb_sb_noss_2){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="amazon.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>If you want something backed by the cloud, you need Nest. Nest is the<br>only cloud-based service which will allow you to record and keep video<br>24/7 (as far as I know --- if anyone knows of another service which will<br>record and keep 24/7 video, let me know).<br><br>[[Nest - Create a Connected<br>Home](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=9d906b&url=https://nest.com/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="nest.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>I have a system which records true 24/7 video. This works very well for<br>me as I can go back and review footage which often is outside of my<br>camera's "trigger" zone for events, but I want to see it anyway. I don't<br>want to miss something because my camera didn't choose to trigger on<br>that event.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
