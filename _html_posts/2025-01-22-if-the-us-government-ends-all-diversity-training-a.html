<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The Civil Rights Act already covers "restricting and silencing the<br>voices of people of color." We don't need an office of Diversity,<br>Equity, and Inclusion to advocate for it. It's already a thing in<br>government, and it's been a thing in government for over 50 years.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
