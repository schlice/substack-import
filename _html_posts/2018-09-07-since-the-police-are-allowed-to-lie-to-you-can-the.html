<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Since the police are allowed to lie to you, can they lie about things<br>like You Must Open the Door, You Must Open the Trunk, or You Cannot<br>Videotape?**<br><br>The answer is "it depends."<br><br>Let's look at each of these:<br><br>You must open the door: I assume you're talking about "you must open<br>the door without a warrant." There is only one circumstance in which you<br>must allow access, and that is called *exigent circumstances.* In that<br>case, the police won't even bother asking you. If they ask, and they<br>don't have a warrant, you don't have to say yes.<br><br>You must open the trunk: In most cases, you don't have to allow a<br>search without a warrant. If the police want to search your car without<br>a warrant, they must have *probable cause.* If they have probable cause,<br>they will arrest you, impound your vehicle, and do the inventory search<br>at the police station, and that's legal. If they truly believe something<br>illegal exists in the car, they can get a warrant very quickly.<br><br>You cannot videotape: Yes, there are circumstances where they tell<br>you you can't video, or you have to move to \<some safe distance away\>.<br><br>What's most important here: for the first two, you can be arrested from<br>the results of those searches. For the third, you can be arrested for<br>refusing to stop video recording. If the police were wrong about any of<br>these, and they did a search without a warrant and they did not have<br>justification, your lawyer can get anything found during those searches<br>overturned, since they didn't get warrants.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
