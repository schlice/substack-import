<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Because they have a different definition of "evidence" than you do.<br><br>You likely consider any truth that is not discovered by the scientific<br>method as "non-evidence," while they do not.<br><br>As we've said a million times on this platform, the scientific method is<br>*one way* to discover truth. Many truths cannot be discovered using the<br>scientific method. For example, we don't have physical evidence that the<br>Nazis were evil or that sunsets are beautiful. We believe these things<br>to be true, but not because we have physical evidence to prove them.<br><br>The concept of the existence of God, as an example of something that<br>theists believe, is not something we can prove through physical or<br>scientific evidence within space and time. By definition, God is<br>immaterial and transcendent. He is immaterial because He is not made of<br>physical matter like us, and He is transcendent because He exists beyond<br>space and time. Therefore, we cannot expect to find direct scientific<br>evidence for His existence, nor can we discover physical traces of Him<br>such as His hairs or footprints. Such evidence is not only currently<br>unavailable, but it is also impossible in principle.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
