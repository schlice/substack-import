<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>No, I think that is overkill. But requiring pregnant women to visit a<br>doctor *at least once* to confirm that she is not too far along, and<br>has a pregnancy which can safely be aborted by abortion medication<br>*should be enforced.* That should be the minimum standard, in order<br>to properly safeguard women, and we're not even doing that.<br><br>Currently, what started as a temporary hold over from COVID lockdowns,<br>there is no doctor visit required. Abortifacient drugs can be prescribed<br>over the Internet and delivered to your house. This has led to<br>skyrocketing rates of women in ERs with complications from failed<br>chemical abortions (i.e. pieces of baby left in the womb going septic,<br>babies which were too old and being incompletely aborted, or worse,<br>resulting in a torn uterus and internal bleeding).<br><br>And roughly half of all abortions today are chemical abortions.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
