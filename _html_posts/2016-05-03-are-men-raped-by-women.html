<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>In some states, rape is a crime that only a man can perpetrate against a<br>woman. In others, rape can be perpetrated by members of either sex.<br><br>Can women *physically* rape men? I mean, a man has to be erect in order<br>to have sex, right? Doesn\'t that mean that he must *want* to have sex,<br>and therefore it is consensual?<br><br>The law almost universally says that male arousal is a physical<br>reaction, not necessarily one that is controlled by conscious effort,<br>either in the affirmative or in the negative. Additionally, injectable<br>and oral drugs called *vasodialators* (i.e. Viagra) can induce erection,<br>potentially against the will of the male victim.<br><br>The legal hurdle which must be overcome to determine whether or not a<br>rape has occurred is *consent*. A male can have sex without consent,<br>so in states that permit females to be charged with it, rape can be<br>committed by females.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
