<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Yes they can. I've seen it happen, as I was in the emergency vehicle<br>doing the "forcing."<br><br>Sometime in 1989, I was sitting in the passenger seat of a Chrysler K<br>car, fully equipped with a "Kojack light" when we approached a red<br>light, one car back from the intersection. A New York police detective<br>was driving. We observed what looked like a traffic accident (with<br>injuries) that had just taken place on the far corner of the<br>intersection.<br><br>The detective flipped a switch, and the Kojack light at my feet filled<br>the footwell with red, rotating light. "Stick that thing on the roof,<br>would you?" he said. I grabbed the light off of the floorboard and stuck<br>it out onto the roof of the car.<br><br>We then had to get to the accident, but there was a car in front of us<br>at the red light. The detective pushed a momentary switch on the knee<br>plate and the siren came on for each push. It made that sort of "woop<br>woop" sound you hear sometimes from police vehicles. The implication for<br>the driver ahead was "Please get out of my way so I can get to the scene<br>of the accident in front of you." The car in front of us proceeded<br>through the red light, past the accident, and drove off. We pulled up to<br>the accident to start assisting, which we primarily did by providing<br>first aid and calling in appropriate police and ambulance personnel.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Can an emergency vehicle force a driver to let it through?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
