<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**At what point on the Stratify JCV blood test is your level too high to<br>start Tysabri?**<br><br>The answer is that there is no specific point at which Tysabri is<br>contraindicated.<br><br>The JCV test simply determines whether or not the patient has or has not<br>been exposed to the JC Virus. At readings of \<0.20, the test is<br>Negative. At readings of 0.20-0.40, the test is Indeterminate. And at<br>readings of \>0.40, the test is Positive.<br><br>Your neurologist will balance this finding with the benefits of Tysabri,<br>understanding that it carries a risk of PML. Also understand that for<br>those who are JC positive, the risk of PML increases over time taking<br>Tysabri; it is not static.<br><br>I know of plenty of people who were JC positive who took Tysabri. They<br>had to get off of it sooner than those who were JC negative.<br><br>Ultimately, you and your neurologist must weigh the risk of Tysabri<br>versus the reward: the medicine with the best efficacy of any MS therapy<br>drug today, period. It is well-tolerated, and only needs to be infused<br>once every 28 days, so it is also convenient.<br><br>Everyone's situation is different. Some people don't have any other good<br>choices because other medicines may be contraindicated. Taking Tysabri<br>while JC positive is not impossible. It simply must be done very<br>carefully and fully understanding the risks.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
