<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The question is not whether or not you are a co-signer on the loan, but<br>whether or not you are listed as a co-owner on the title.<br><br>Co-signers, by themselves, cannot take possession of a vehicle they are<br>paying for. Just being a co-signer on the loan doesn't give you rights<br>to a vehicle for which you are not listed on the title. However, if you<br>are on the title as a co-owner, you have as much right to the<br>vehicle as your ex.<br><br>If you are a co-owner and if you can get to it safely, you can simply<br>walk up to it with your keys and drive away. You can't be arrested for<br>driving your own vehicle.<br><br>If you can't get to the vehicle, you should talk to the bank. Let them<br>know which one of you is willing to continue to make payments on the<br>vehicle, but you are reluctant to do so if you are not in possession of<br>the vehicle. In that case, maybe you could help the bank locate the<br>vehicle so they could repossess it and sell it.<br><br>If he wants to keep the vehicle, perhaps he could refinance the vehicle<br>so that he is the sole owner and you are no longer financially<br>responsible.<br><br>But I, like the other answerers, am confused why the car wouldn't have<br>been addressed in the divorce. I know that wasn't part of the question,<br>but it is unusual.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>**I co-signed a car loan and my ex is behind on payments? What are my<br>legal options to repossess? I don't want to pay for it if I won't have<br>it in my possession.**<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
