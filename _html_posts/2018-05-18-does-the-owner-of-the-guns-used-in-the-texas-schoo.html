<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Does the owner of the guns used in the Texas school shooting, the<br>killer's father, have any criminal liability under current Texas or<br>federal law?**<br><br>Unless the father had prior knowledge that the son was going to commit<br>murder and opened the safe for him (which would fall under a conspiracy<br>charge), only the person committing the crime is criminally liable for<br>the murders.<br><br>Ownership does not confer special criminal liability for use of<br>something, especially if it was used without permission and without<br>foreknowledge. I'm certain that law enforcement is currently questioning<br>the father and asking him about his son's access to the gun safe (if<br>there was one).<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
