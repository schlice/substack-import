<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Shouldn\'t there be a law that people who hold public office must send<br>their children to public schools?**<br><br>Why?<br><br>Do you think that politicians send their kids to private school because<br>they think they're *better* than everyone else? You wanna force them to<br>send their kids to public schools to *knock them down a few pegs*?<br><br>Or maybe you think that since politicians are voting to fund these<br>schools, their kids should have to attend the schools they think are so<br>wonderful. Force them to "eat their own dog food, fly their own planes,"<br>so to speak.<br><br>However, I think politicians send their kids to private schools for the<br>same reason that any American sends their kids to private schools:<br>they are objectively better than public schools.<br><br>And here's the kicker: this says more about the education system than it<br>does about the politician.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
