<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>In Trinitarian theology, God the Son (Jesus Christ) is considered fully<br>God, co-equal and co-eternal with the Father and the Holy Spirit, within<br>the divine being. While the Son is subordinate to the Father in terms of<br>function and role, especially due to the Incarnation, this<br>subordination is not one of *essence* or *inferiority*. It\'s a<br>voluntary submission for the purpose of *redemption*, not a<br>reflection of inherent *inequality*.<br><br>So yes, God the Son is indeed part of the Trinity. As a man, He has<br>access to everything that a man has, including free will.<br><br>He subordinates Himself below God the Father in terms of His *role* in<br>the Trinity.<br><br>Does He have the *right* to do something which God the Father would not<br>approve of? Yes, He does. He completely has free will. But whether He<br>*would* do something against the will of the Father is dependent on<br>perspective. While Jesus experienced limitations during His earthly<br>ministry due to His humanity, the doctrine of the Trinity suggests that<br>within the Godhead (Father, Son, and Holy Spirit), **there is perfect<br>unity of knowledge and will.** Therefore, while Jesus in His human form<br>may have limited knowledge, as God, He possesses all knowledge.<br><br>So Jesus the man had the *potential* to do something outside of the will<br>of God, but He never would (and He never did) because He was *sinless*,<br>which means He never missed the mark of God's glory. Jesus *as part of<br>the Godhead* has perfect unity of knowledge and will with the Father<br>and the Spirit, so everything that Jesus wants to do is the same as<br>what the Father and the Spirit want to do.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
