<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**How do we get gun owners to finally accept that the second amendment<br>is outdated and will be repealed soon?**<br><br>Hypnosis.<br><br>Drugs.<br><br>Bribing with large sums of money (by the way, I might be open to that<br>one. Reach out and let me know how large a sum we're talking).<br><br>Because beyond that, here in reality, the Second Amendment, being part<br>of the Bill of Rights, is so integral to the fabric of our country, that<br>repealing it will literally destroy the government as we know it.<br>Understanding that the Bill of Rights, as it stands, was so major a part<br>of states' acceptance of the Constitution, destroying the Bill of Rights<br>by repealing any of its constituent amendments will render that trust<br>irrevocably broken. At best, the Constitution will be dissolved and<br>States will revert to individual countries. At worst, it will plunge us<br>into the next civil war.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
