<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>LOL<br><br>First of all, Warren was *excoriated* by the Cherokee Nation for<br>thinking that DNA evidence *at all* means you're part of a tribe:<br><br>> *A DNA test is useless to determine tribal citizenship. Current DNA<br>> tests do not even distinguish whether a person's ancestors were<br>> indigenous to North or South America. Sovereign tribal nations set<br>> their own legal requirements for citizenship, and while DNA tests can<br>> be used to determine lineage, such as paternity to an individual, it<br>> is not evidence for tribal affiliation. Using a DNA test to lay claim<br>> to any connection to the Cherokee Nation or any tribal nation, even<br>> vaguely, is inappropriate and wrong. It makes a mockery out of DNA<br>> tests and its legitimate uses while also dishonoring legitimate tribal<br>> governments and their citizens, whose ancestors are well documented<br>> and whose heritage is proven. Senator Warren is undermining tribal<br>> interests with her continued claims of tribal<br>> heritage.*\[1\](#IPiEF){#cite-IPiEF .citation_link}<br><br>Secondly, the media going along with it, claiming that she actually *is*<br>Native American because she has somewhere between 1/64th and 1/1024th<br>Native American lineage in her DNA, makes them look like apologists and<br>not journalists.<br><br>Third, Trump called her "Fauxcahontas," not Pocahontas. That name is<br>brilliant and she deserves it.<br><br>Finally, Trump did exactly what Trump does: he forced Warren to respond<br>to the charge, and she stepped in it eloquently. Like the linked article<br>says, Trump makes his opponents do stupid stuff and then he beats them<br>with their own stupidity.<br><br>But if you're liberal, I encourage you to continue with this<br>foolishness. You can never have enough political ammunition come<br>Election Day.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-IPiEF){.citation_index} [[Trump\'s Superpower: Making His<br>Opponents Do The Stupidest Possible<br>Thing](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=3159f9&url=https://www.dailywire.com/news/37164/trumps-superpower-making-his-opponents-do-ben-shapiro?utm_source%3Dshapironewsletter%26utm_medium%3Demail%26utm_content%3D101618-news%26utm_campaign%3Dposition2){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="dailywire.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
