<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Before you can answer why we get sick and die, we have to answer what it<br>is about us that is made in God's image.<br><br>Even atheists know that God has no physical form. He has no body. They<br>can't see Him, they can't detect Him, so they don't believe in Him. So<br>how can humans be made in the image of God if He has no body?<br><br>We just described God. Is there anything in humans that has no physical<br>form, that is separate from our bodies, which might be said to "live on"<br>after we die?<br><br>It's our *soul*.<br><br>Our soul is made in the image of God. Not our bodies.<br><br>So now that we know this, we can talk about these perfect bodies which<br>God created for us. They never know pain. They never get sick. They<br>never die.<br><br>Well, that's how they were designed, anyway. Until sin invaded the<br>world. Once that happened, our bodies became *fallen*. They became<br>*mortal*. Women would know the pain of childbirth. Men would get old,<br>get sick, and die. They would scratch at the hard ground to plant their<br>food, and their life would be filled with struggle.<br><br>We live in a fallen world, in fallen, mortal bodies, because of sin. But<br>we're not out to save our bodies. We're out to save our *souls*. God's<br>plan for our world was already revealed to the apostle John and has been<br>recorded in the book of Revelation. It describes the end of the world<br>and the fact that believers will be resurrected to live with God<br>forever. That is our hope.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
