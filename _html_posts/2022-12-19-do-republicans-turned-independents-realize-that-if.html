You'll vote for the candidate who best<br>represents your values, whatever party that candidate happens to belong<br>to. If that person happens to be Republican, so be it. Same if that<br>person happens to be a Democrat.<br><br>Going independent as a *voter* really has very little significance other<br>than...<br><br>> What exactly does that accomplish other than exclude you from primary<br>> voting?<br><br>In states which restrict their primaries to registered members of their<br>party, going independent guarantees that you will not be able to help<br>select the Republican or Democrat candidate (which should be just fine<br>for you, as an independent). When it comes time for the general<br>election, you'll still pick whoever represents your values best.<br><br>You are an idealist; you believe that candidates should fight for your<br>vote, and they should do it by appealing to you. The candidate would<br>have to show that they possess the same values that you do.<br><br>But since you ideologically "straddle the fence," so to speak, you're<br>not likely to find a candidate who checks all of your boxes. You're<br>probably going to be dissatisfied with every candidate. No one candidate<br>will be perfect for you.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
