<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If landscapers kill, damage, or destroy plants on someone else\'s<br>property (someone who did not hire them), can they be criminally<br>charged?**<br><br>Whether or not it is a criminal charge is dependent on state, but in all<br>cases, such destruction must be willful (i.e. they intend to do so).<br><br>Nearly every destruction of property law in nearly every state requires<br>that the destruction be willful. If it's not willful, it likely can't be<br>charged as destruction of property.<br><br>And also in nearly all cases, the destruction must exceed certain set<br>dollar amounts to become higher level misdemeanors, or possibly<br>low-level felonies.<br><br>\<br><br>*Just a reminder --- this answer is not a substitute for professional<br>legal advice.
