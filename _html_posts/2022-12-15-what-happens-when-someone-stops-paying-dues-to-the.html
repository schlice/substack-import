<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>In Homeowner's Associations in Florida, this is what will happen. Most<br>other states will look similar, but the timeframes and amounts may be<br>different, to comply with those states' laws:<br><br>1.  The HOA will send you letters indicating that your dues are unpaid.<br>    You'll start accruing late fees.<br>2.  When the account has gone delinquent for a period of time specified<br>    in the Governing Documents (usually around six months, and<br>    especially if you're being uncooperative or non-communicative), the<br>    Board will transition your account over to the HOA attorney. Once<br>    that happens, it can't go back; you'll only deal with the attorney<br>    and not the Board to address that delinquency moving forward. The<br>    attorney, in addition to your past due dues and the late fees, will<br>    start adding his or her fees as well. Kind attorneys will allow you<br>    to establish a payment plan (which the Board would have done, had<br>    you communicated with them).<br>3.  When the amount due hits a minimum of \$1000 (as required by Florida<br>    law), the attorney (with the approval of the Board) can place a lien<br>    on the property.<br>4.  When the account has gone sufficiently long without payment (and<br>    again, if the homeowner is being uncooperative or<br>    non-communicative), the attorney will begin foreclosure proceedings<br>    on the property. This means that the HOA will sell your house out<br>    from under you, basically kicking you out onto the street, and they<br>    will use the proceeds to pay back all the dues and fees. The HOA<br>    will take possession of the house, clean it up, and sell it.<br><br>So how far will the HOA go? They'll *literally* sell your house out from<br>under you to get the money they are owed.<br><br>Look, if you don't want to cut your grass the way they want, fight them<br>on those stupid little things. But don't stop paying your dues, or some<br>very bad juju will befall you.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
