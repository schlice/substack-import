<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Yes, He will.<br><br>When He returns, all of those asleep will rise. It's in the Bible. I'll<br>highlight it:<br><br>> *But we do not want you to be uninformed, brothers, about those who<br>> are asleep, that you may not grieve as others do who have no hope. For<br>> since we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so, through<br>> Jesus, God will bring with him those who have fallen asleep. For this<br>> we declare to you by a word from the Lord, that we who are alive, who<br>> are left until the coming of the Lord, will not precede those who have<br>> fallen asleep. For the Lord himself will descend from heaven with a<br>> cry of command, with the voice of an archangel, and with the sound of<br>> the trumpet of God.* *And the dead in Christ will rise first.*<br>> *Then we who are alive, who are left, will be caught up together with<br>> them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air, and so we will always<br>> be with the Lord. Therefore encourage one another with these words.<br>> \-- 1 Thessalonians 4:13--18 ESV*<br><br>So there you have it. It's going to happen.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
