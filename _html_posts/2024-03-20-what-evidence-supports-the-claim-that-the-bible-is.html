<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>While we don't have the original copies of the New Testament, we do have<br>*manuscripts*. Think of a manuscript as a photocopy before photocopiers<br>were invented. Someone literally rewrites a paper, by hand, to make a<br>copy. Certainly, that process could introduce errors, but you can<br>determine if those exist by looking at *multiple* manuscripts.<br>Therefore, the more manuscripts we have, the more sure we can be that we<br>have the original text.<br><br>Here's the cool part: **The New Testament documents have more<br>manuscripts, earlier manuscripts, and more abundantly supported<br>manuscripts than the best ten pieces of classical literature**<br>*combined.*<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-fe74ced8ab2f1eb09b19a6b6b12dc1a3){.portrait .qtext_image<br>.zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-fe74ced8ab2f1eb09b19a6b6b12dc1a3" master_w="749"<br>master_h="1001"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>This chart shows us the number of manuscript copies for the New<br>Testament as well as other ancient documents, and it shows the timespan<br>between the original and the earliest surviving copies of that document.<br>You can see that of all of these early documents, the New Testament has<br>more and better manuscript support than anything else from that era.<br><br>So is it likely that there is mistranslation? No. We have reliable<br>copies of the originals, so we know what they said.<br><br>Modern technology helps us as well. In the age of digitization, we have<br>all of this stuff online (of course). You can visit<br>[BibleHub.com(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=4d62d6&url=http://BibleHub.com){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="biblehub.com"}]{.qlink_container} and read the modern<br>translation along with the original, side-by-side.<br><br>[https://biblehub.com/(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=3bdeb0&url=https://biblehub.com/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>\<br><br>Part of what you may be thinking of when you think of "mistranslation"<br>is actually related to the differences between languages. There is not a<br>"one-to-one" correlation between languages. For example, Hebrew has<br>fewer words than English. Therefore, many words in Hebrew have multiple<br>meanings. It's up to the translator to pick the correct word in English<br>to express what the original author was trying to say in Hebrew.<br>Similarly, there are no fewer than six different words for "love" in<br>Greek (familial love, platonic love, love between dear friends, erotic<br>love, etc.), but in English, we only have "love."<br><br>Therefore, when creating a Bible translation, you can either stick very<br>closely to the original words, but you may have a hard time<br>understanding the meaning of what the original author was trying to say,<br>or you can reproduce what the author was trying to say, and stick less<br>closely to the original words.<br><br>Translations which stick very closely to the words are called "word for<br>word" translations. They will very closely retain fidelity to the<br>original words used, but some of the original meaning may be "lost in<br>translation." To try to account for this, some translations will use a<br>"thought for thought" method of translating. The translator will read a<br>sentence and then re-write it in the target language, trying to retain<br>the original words as often as possible, but will more frequently try to<br>retain the original thought that a person reading it in the source<br>language would have understood. Finally, translators may take a<br>"paraphrase" method of translation, where translators will read an<br>entire passage and re-state it in the target language, without concern<br>to the original words, solely trying to "paraphrase" the original idea.<br>As you move from "word for word" translations towards "paraphrase"<br>translations, the translations become more easily understandable and<br>easier to follow along (in fact, some of the paraphrase translations,<br>like *The Message*, read like a novel), but retain less fidelity to the<br>original words used.<br><br>Here's a handy graph of many of the current translations and where they<br>fall on that spectrum:<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-6318b071f7b5cf5baf42863acee2fb10){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-6318b071f7b5cf5baf42863acee2fb10" master_w="730"<br>master_h="417"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
