<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>> Hi I made a promise to God on my salvation that I won\'t do a certain<br>> sin that I struggled with again but I broke it a week later.<br><br>Woody Allen once said, "If you want to make God laugh, tell Him about<br>your plans."<br><br>Said in another way, *you* told *God* that you planned on not sinning?<br>Yeah, I'm betting He laughed when you said that.<br><br>When you made your promise, did God say, "Okay, I'll hold you to your<br>promise"? I'm betting He didn't. Because He's going to fulfill<br>*His* plans in your life, not *yours*. God knows that you're<br>a sinner. I know that you're a sinner. I'm a sinner. We all are. We all<br>are human, and we all fall short of God's glory.<br><br>The beauty of this arrangement is that God has forgiven us for our sin.<br>Accepting Him as our savior, and repenting of our sin (turning away)<br>is all that He requires.<br><br>When you "broke your promise," did you do it willingly? Did you say, "I<br>know I made a promise to God, but I don't care, I'm going to do what I<br>want anyway"? Because if that's what you did, you might want to question<br>your actions. It might also lead others to question whether or not<br>you're actually saved *at all,* **because this is not what a saved<br>person does.**<br><br>No, you probably unintentionally broke your promise, because you are a<br>sinner, just like all of us are. On occasion, our humanity wins out and<br>we unwillingly sin. We can't help it sometimes, regardless of how<br>willing we are to avoid sin.<br><br>With that understanding, let's answer the next question:<br><br>> Will he take away my salvation? Did I lose eternal life?<br><br>No. Once saved, always saved. You cannot "lose" your salvation by<br>doing something.<br><br>- Believers believe in a process called *regeneration*. Back in the day,<br>  we were called "Born-Again" Christians, but the process is the same<br>  (cf John 3:3, Titus 3:5). Believers are "born again" (or regenerated)<br>  when they accept Christ. In order to lose salvation then, they would<br>  have to be "un-regenerated" and there is no indication in the Bible<br>  that such a thing exists.<br>- The Holy Spirit indwells all believers (cf John 14:17, Romans 8:9) and<br>  baptizes all believers into the Body of Christ (cf 1 Corinthians<br>  12:13). In order to lose salvation, they would have to be<br>  \"un-indwelt\" and detached from the Body of Christ, and there is no<br>  indication in the Bible that such a thing exists.<br>- John 3:15 says that whoever believes in Jesus Christ will \"have<br>  eternal life.\" But if you believe in Christ today (and thus have<br>  eternal life) but you can lose it tomorrow, then it was never<br>  \"eternal\" in the first place. Therefore, if you can lose your<br>  salvation, the promises of eternal life in the Bible would be in<br>  error.<br>- Along with that, if you are "saved" but then you "lose your<br>  salvation," you were never "saved" in the first place.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
