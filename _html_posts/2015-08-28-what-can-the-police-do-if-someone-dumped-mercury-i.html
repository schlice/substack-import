<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [First thing first: turn off the pool filter. You don\'t<br>want the mercury making it into the pool filter, or you\'ll likely have<br>to replace the entire filtration system.\<br>\<br>The good thing here is that the spill is contained (within the pool, but<br>contained nonetheless). As long as you turn off your filter, the spill<br>can remain contained. The EPA will assist with the cleanup.\<br>\<br>Next, according to the US EPA website:\<br>\<br>]<br><br>> Spills of One Pound or More (i.e., if it Looks like Two Tablespoons or<br>> More)\<br>> \<br>> Any time one pound or more of mercury is released to the environment,<br>> it is mandatory to call the [[National Response Center<br>> (NRC)](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=0fd8ad&url=http://www.nrc.uscg.mil/nrchp.html){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="uscg.mil"}]{.qlink_container}. The NRC hotline operates 24<br>> hours a day, 7 days a week. Call (800) 424-8802. Note that because<br>> mercury is heavy, only two tablespoons of mercury weigh about one<br>> pound.\<br><br>\<br>The EPA will ensure that the spill receives the appropriate<br>investigation, and it will likely not be conducted by your local police<br>department, so 911 is still not the appropriate number to call.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
