<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Understand that you are asking a specific question, but I<br>can answer with general legal information for Virginia.\<br>\<br>You can sue for anything in this country. What sort of chance you have<br>at prevailing in your lawsuit is dependent on many factors, including<br>the laws in your jurisdiction.\<br>\<br>However, in this case, the death took place 12 years ago, and the<br>statute of limitations on wrongful death is two years. Medical<br>malpractice is also two years, but can be tolled up to ten years in<br>certain circumstances.\<br>\<br>I\'m reasonably certain, based on a cursory review of Virginia law, that<br>the statute of limitations for both wrongful death and malpractice have<br>expired.\<br>\<br>However, as in all cases, you need to consult with a malpractice<br>attorney licensed in Virginia in order to see what all of your legal<br>options are. Most consultations are free or are a flat fee. Contact your<br>local bar association for assistance in finding the appropriate attorney<br>for your situation.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
