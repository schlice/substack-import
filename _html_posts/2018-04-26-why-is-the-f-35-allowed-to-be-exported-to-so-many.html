<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Why is the F-35 allowed to be exported to so many countries, since<br>it\'s supposed to be such an advanced fighter?**<br><br>I'm confused. Are other countries not *worthy* enough to own advanced<br>fighter technology to safeguard their own countries? I mean, if they're<br>in the market to buy some new fighters for their own air force, should<br>we only sell them F-4s or F-104s (great aircraft in their own right,<br>mind you) because they're less advanced?<br><br>Or maybe you're concerned that they might use that advanced technology<br>*against us*? Don't worry. It may be the same plane, but 1. we have more<br>than them, and 2. we fly them far better than they do. They won't risk<br>that much of a financial investment by turning around and attacking *us*<br>with it. Then we destroy the plane and they don't get a refund.<br><br>I guess I don't understand why we feel the need to restrict what other<br>people buy. Granted, there are of course export restrictions on<br>sensitive technology (such as encryption technology), and those<br>particular parts of the plane's avionics are not resold to other<br>countries, but the airframe is not something we don't sell because it's<br>"too advanced."<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
