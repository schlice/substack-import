<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Faith and belief are related. You need some level of faith to reach<br>belief, because none of the things we believe in religion can be<br>positively identified by science. So instead, we deal in logic,<br>probability, and rationality. Therefore, we have a certain set of facts,<br>which only takes us so far because there is still a gap between<br>observable fact, and belief. It is faith which fills that gap.<br><br>So can you believe in God without having faith in God? The question<br>becomes: *why* do you believe in God? What exactly do you believe in?<br>You probably believe in the observable facts that our universe had a<br>beginning, and thus had a beginner. So you know, intuitively, that God<br>exists. So you do believe in God.<br><br>But you don't have *faith* in God? You don't have faith in *what* about<br>God? Do you think he won't keep his promises? He hasn't failed us so<br>far. What makes you believe he won't continue to keep his promises?<br><br>It's really challenging to believe in God, which requires faith, and<br>then state that you don't have faith in God.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Are faith and belief the same thing? Can someone believe in God without<br>having faith in God?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
