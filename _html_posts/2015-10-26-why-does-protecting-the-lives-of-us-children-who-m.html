<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Your question is illogical. You have posed a \"false<br>equivalency,\" or at the very least, an equivalency that cannot be<br>proved.\<br>\<br>Your equivalency says that \"The Second Amendment\'s existence equals<br>children dying in school shootings.\" Since you simply cannot prove that<br>the removal of the Second Amendment will prevent school shootings, your<br>logic does not pass muster.\<br>\<br>This also does not imply that anyone who approves of the Second<br>Amendment simply accepts the status quo. There are many things that are<br>contributing factors to the rise in school shootings. One of these *may*<br>be readily-accessible guns.\<br>\<br>But does that mean throw the baby out with the bathwater? Do we<br>sacrifice a natural right (the right to self-defense, which I think is<br>far more important than the ability to resist governmental tyranny) for<br>the *possible* (not even probable) benefit of reducing (not eliminating)<br>school shootings? Are there other things we can do to prevent school<br>shootings?\<br>\<br>Let me offer a counter equivalency. The logic here doesn\'t pass muster<br>either, but the logic is in the same vein as your logic.\<br>\<br>*My kids go to public school in a district where schools are secured by<br>armed guards, employed by the district.*\<br>*We have never had a shooting in any school in my district.*\<br>\<br>Is there a cause-effect relationship there? Have we simply not had a<br>school shooting because we have armed guards? No, not likely. It\'s more<br>likely that the incidence of school shootings is so low, and the number<br>of schools is so high, that probability dictates that we\'ll likely<br>never see a school shooting. But does armed guards help? You bet it<br>does.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
