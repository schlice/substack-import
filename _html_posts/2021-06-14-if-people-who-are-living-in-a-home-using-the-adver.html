<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Side-step the entire process and file for eviction.<br><br>So long as adverse possession hasn't kicked in yet (as [[Cliff<br>G.](https://www.quora.com/profile/Cliff-G-13)]{.qlink_container}<br>mentioned, it takes upwards of 7 years, and you indicated that someone<br>is living in the house for only around 2 years), you or your fiancee are<br>still on the deed, so you can begin eviction procedures.<br><br>(EDIT) You commented on Cliff's answer and said something about Phoenix,<br>so I'll presume you are in Arizona. Arizona has one of the shortest<br>adverse possession claims periods, requiring the adverse possessor to<br>continuously possess the property for two years before they can make a<br>right of possession adverse possession claim.<br><br>Also, while you have a cause of action for trespass, the statute of<br>limitations for trespass is also two years.<br><br>You must act quickly or adverse possession may kick in, and they may be<br>able to file for right of possession by adverse possession.<br><br>If you lose your adverse possession claim, investigate the money order<br>fraud. If they fraudulently paid a government agency using fraudulently<br>obtained money orders through misrepresentation, contact the police and<br>investigate that. It's a long shot, but perhaps the tax payments can be<br>invalidated along with the adverse possession.<br><br>While I understand your issues, if possession has been continuous by the<br>adverse possessor for two years or more, you may still be able to regain<br>possession of the property before they file for right of possession, but<br>you must seek the advice of an attorney. Contact the state bar<br>association to help you find an attorney who will help you.
