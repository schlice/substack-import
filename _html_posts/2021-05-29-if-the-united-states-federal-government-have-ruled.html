Forcing an employee to get vaccinated in order to retain<br>their employment would be coercing an employee into violating Federal<br>law (taking a vaccine against their will). If the only reason they are<br>taking the vaccine is to retain their employment, and they otherwise<br>refuse to take the vaccine, this would be a violation of Federal law.<br>All states have laws which prevent employers from legally firing<br>employees for refusing to violate Federal law.<br><br>\<br><br>*This answer is not professional legal advice, nor is it a substitute<br>for professional legal advice, or a solicitation to offer professional<br>legal advice.
