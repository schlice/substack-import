The Holy Spirit is God.<br><br>But<br><br>**God the Father is not Jesus. Jesus is not the Holy Spirit. God the<br>Father is not the Holy Spirit.**<br><br>A helpful image:<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-5bd24f46e8e187f5d22cac5dc1fe85be){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-5bd24f46e8e187f5d22cac5dc1fe85be" master_w="473"<br>master_h="385"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>The Trinity is a challenging concept, and trying to conceptualize in a<br>human fashion something that is beyond our comprehension is always going<br>to be a daunting task.<br><br>> Could Jesus fulfill a prophecy through someone today using the Holy<br>> spirit?<br><br>Any time you ask yourself a "Can God..." question, the answer is ***yes,<br>God can***. So can Jesus fulfill a prophecy through someone today using<br>the Holy Spirit? Yes, God can.<br><br>But whether or not He *will* is dependent on Him and the prophecy. Most<br>of the remaining prophecies will be fulfilled at the end of the age.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
