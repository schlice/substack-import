<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>You will be arrested and charged with brandishing a weapon. If you<br>pointed the weapon at the person, you would have committed the civil<br>crime of assault. You could also be charged with **assault with a<br>deadly weapon** depending on the state. In order to draw your weapon,<br>you have to be in *fear for your life*. You can\'t just \"feel<br>threatened\" because someone is \"bigger than you\" or \"louder than<br>you\" or \"generally intimidating.\" Even if they are harassing you, you<br>still can\'t draw your gun.<br><br>You can only meet force with equal force. You have to be in fear for<br>your life before you can draw your gun. And even then, if you\'re the<br>only person armed, expect that you will get FAR more attention than<br>your aggressor.<br><br>Your assertion that you were \"threatened\" could potentially be used as<br>a defense against the aforementioned charges, but the finding that you<br>were in fear for your life would be a point of fact for the jury to<br>decide. If they don\'t find you in fear for your life, then it\'s you<br>who was the actual aggressor.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
