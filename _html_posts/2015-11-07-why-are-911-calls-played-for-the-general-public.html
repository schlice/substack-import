<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [You are using a public service, funded 100% with taxpayer<br>dollars. Your use of that service can and should be audited to ensure<br>you or the police are not wasting taxpayer dollars.\<br>\<br>The media takes advantage of that fact to boost ratings, which is its<br>primary job (and I bet you thought their primary job was to report the<br>news). 911 calls, at least the ones they play on TV, are inflammatory.<br>That gets more eyeballs on your news show, which boosts ratings and<br>ultimately makes more money.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
