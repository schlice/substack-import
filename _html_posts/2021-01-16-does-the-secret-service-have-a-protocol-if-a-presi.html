The Constitution has one. It's called<br>*impeachment*.<br><br>They must impeach the president in the House, and then the Senate must<br>vote to remove the President from office.<br><br>But actual sedition and treason are crimes: *seditious conspiracy* and<br>*treason*. Our friends at FindLaw spell out the difference between the<br>two this way:<br><br>> While seditious conspiracy is generally defined as conduct or language<br>> inciting rebellion against the authority of a state, treason is the<br>> more serious offense of actively levying war against the United States<br>> or giving aid to its enemies.\[1\](#zCZFO){#cite-zCZFO<br>> .citation_link}<br><br>You can think of it this way: seditious conspiracy is the first step on<br>the road to treason.<br><br>They are both very difficult to prove. In order to prove seditious<br>conspiracy, you would have to prove that the President conspired with at<br>least one other person to *actually use force* against the government.<br>Making a speech about overthrowing the government is not enough. But<br>coordinating troop deployments and handing out bullets is.<br><br>Treason is a crime which only happens during *a declared war.* It is<br>generally known as the crime of giving aid or comfort to the enemy, or<br>directly waging war against the country. Clearly, in order to have an<br>enemy, Congress must have declared war.<br><br>The constitutionality of charging and convicting a president of a crime<br>while he's in office is still debatable, since it's never really<br>happened such that a president might be arrested. Generally, you need to<br>remove the president from office first, and then charge with a crime.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-zCZFO){.citation_index} [[Sedition -<br>FindLaw](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=e3d9b6&url=https://criminal.findlaw.com/criminal-charges/sedition.html){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="findlaw.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
