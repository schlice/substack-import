<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [I really don\'t think there are \"everyday felonies\"<br>committed by \"almost every American.\" There are felonies that are very<br>easy to commit, people do them all the time, and they\'re also not well<br>known. Here\'s a few examples:\<br>\<br>- You drive your ATV onto protected wilderness land (very easy for us in<br>Colorado to do). Even doing so accidentally, you have violated the<br>Federal Wilderness Act, which is a felony. Bobby Unser did this in 1997,<br>accidentally, during a blizzard. He was convicted anyway.\<br>\<br>- You \"call in sick\" to take a powder day (also common for us skiiers<br>in Colorado). If your company doesn\'t have a \"personal day\" provision<br>(mine has converted \"sick days\" to \"sick/personal days\" to avoid<br>this issue), you \"calling in sick\" can be considered a Federal felony<br>called \"Honest Services Fraud\": a \"scheme\" to defraud your company<br>of their \"intangible right\" to your \"honest service.\" Note that no<br>one has ever been convicted of this yet, but it is possible.\<br>\<br>- You find drugs in your kid\'s room (again, really likely for us in<br>Colorado). Instead of calling the police, you flush the drugs and elect<br>to deal with your kid yourself. But the police had opened an<br>investigation into your kid\'s underage Marijuana use yesterday. Since<br>you just destroyed evidence in an ongoing police investigation, you have<br>just committed the felony of \"obstructing justice.\"\<br>\<br>These are just a few felonies you could commit without even knowing you<br>were committing a felony. I agree that it\'s hard to unknowingly commit<br>a felony, but there are things that happen in every day life that could<br>be illegal.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
