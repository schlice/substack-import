<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Trump has threatened to send U. S. military to close the southern<br>border. Would this be a violation of The Posse Comitatus Act of 1878?**<br><br>No.<br><br>The Posse Comitatus Act says that the military cannot enforce state law.<br>The military can indeed enforce Federal law and can defend the country<br>in general.<br><br>Border protection falls under the purview of the US government, not the<br>state; therefore, it is not a violation of Posse Comitatus to enforce<br>the nation's border.<br><br>(EDIT) But if that's not enough, I give you The Constitution, Article<br>IV, section 4:<br><br>> The United States shall guarantee to every state in this union a<br>> republican form of government, **and shall protect each of them<br>> against invasion;** and on application of the legislature, or of the<br>> executive (when the legislature cannot be convened) against domestic<br>> violence.<br><br>I'm pretty sure that it would be drop-dead easy to make the case that<br>tens of thousands of migrants attempting to illegally cross the border<br>would constitute an invasion.<br><br>The US Armed Forces exist to defend the United States against all<br>enemies, foreign and domestic, which is expressly authorized by the US<br>Constitution. In fact, guarding the Southern border was the Army's<br>primary peacetime mission until 1940, and no one ever declared that<br>doing so was in violation of Posse Comitatus. The Border Patrol wasn't<br>even formed until 1924, so claiming the intent of Posse Comitatus was to<br>prevent US Army troops from guarding the border is nonsense.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
