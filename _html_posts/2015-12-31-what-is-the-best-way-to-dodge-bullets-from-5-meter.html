<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>> *Additional question details:*<br>><br>> *Just curious. If someone suddenly starts shooting at me, should I<br>> run, tuck and roll, do front flips or back flips, which way will make<br>> it more likely for the person to miss when he or she shoots?*<br><br>You can do whatever the heck you want to do to aid your belief that you<br>can actually get out of the way of a bullet. Especially a bullet fired<br>at such a close range, there is nothing you can do to avoid being hit.<br><br>As *Mythbusters*<br>[discovered(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=4f120a&url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3D2qY0DA7DG9s){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="youtube.com"}]{.qlink_container}, it is theoretically<br>possible to evade a bullet if you are a great distance away from the gun<br>(a minimum of 500 yards, or roughly 457 meters), you can see the gun<br>firing (by the time you hear the report, you\'re dead, so you have to<br>see the muzzle flash), and you move the correct direction out of the<br>way, assuming you are prepared to jump out of its way because you are<br>staring at the shooter and anticipating a shot.<br><br>Practically, not everyone is a crack shot. At 5 meters away (\~15 feet),<br>you\'d really have to be blind or have never fired a gun ever to miss.<br>But further away, it\'s likely that many shots with a handgun will miss.<br>If someone starts shooting at you, the best thing you can do is find the<br>shortest distance to cover and run there. Doing silly things like<br>tucking, rolling, or flipping, will not get you to cover in the fastest<br>way possible. Therefore, if someone starts shooting, keep low and run<br>for cover.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
