We certainly do everything in our power to minimize<br>collateral damage, but we cannot entirely prevent it.<br><br>Hamas' actions were against *illegitimate non-military targets.*<br>This is specifically outlawed by the Geneva Convention.<br><br>"Human shields" are a misnomer. When the enemy conducts military<br>operations from a non-military location, that non-military location<br>becomes a lawful military target, along with everyone inside of it.<br>This is the enemy's concern, not ours. If the enemy does not want us to<br>target their civilians, they should not turn their civilians into lawful<br>military targets.<br><br>While our enemy may not follow the internationally accepted practices of<br>war, we still do. Thus, we can say that we were waging legitimate war<br>while our enemy was acting as a terrorist, provoking retaliatory action.<br><br>The difference becomes how our actions are perceived on the world stage.<br>When we act in accordance with the accepted practices in war, our<br>actions are considered to be *legitimate* to the world. When we violate<br>the accepted practices of waging war, our actions are considered to be<br>*illegitimate* and we are considered to be the aggressor and not the<br>victim.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
