<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Generally, HOAs have broad latitude to manage the areas under their<br>control.<br><br>In your case, not only does the HOA control the property, but you<br>indicated that you are a gated community. This means that the HOA<br>controls *everything* inside the gates, including the streets. They can<br>boot improperly parked cars. They can tow cars. And they can issue<br>speeding citations to homeowners or vendors who violate the posted speed<br>limits.<br><br>This certainly sounds like a drastic step, but the HOA is likely taking<br>such a step because speeding in your community has been a major issue.<br>Perhaps there have been some close calls with cars vs pedestrians, and<br>they have all related to speed. But one way or another, the HOA is<br>taking this step to fix an issue which a majority of homeowners have<br>told them they want to see addressed.<br><br>Hopefully, the gate guard is informing vendors as he lets them into the<br>community that speed limits are strictly enforced by radar cameras. You<br>should take the extra step when you contact a vendor to come out to your<br>property and let them know that the HOA is VERY strict about speed<br>limits, and that you will be passing any speeding violations on to the<br>vendor for payment, along with photo proof that it was their driver who<br>violated the speed limit. Be prepared to take the vendor to small claims<br>court to get your money back.<br><br>I would prefer the HOA bill the vendor directly, especially given that<br>you may likely need to pursue legal action to receive payment for<br>speeding fines, but it's not my HOA. So long as the HOA enforces the<br>policy uniformly across all homeowners, it's likely a legally sound<br>policy and likely to be upheld should you attempt to challenge the<br>legality of the rule. Part of the problem you will run into if you take<br>the vendor to court is that you don't personally control the radar<br>camera. What if it is mis-calibrated? What if it is improperly<br>installed? Will someone be available to be called as an expert witness<br>on the operation of the camera and to show its service and calibration<br>history? Without that, it's the camera's word against the driver, and<br>the driver can simply claim the camera is a piece of garbage and is<br>wrong, and the judge may agree, which means that you're stuck paying the<br>fine unless you challenge the camera's operation with your HOA. Passing<br>the fines on to the homeowners just seems like more headache than it's<br>worth, but again, it's not my HOA.<br><br>I would just be very careful to advise my vendors that any speeding<br>violations will be passed on to that vendor, and then be prepared to<br>take that vendor to court to pay that fine.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
