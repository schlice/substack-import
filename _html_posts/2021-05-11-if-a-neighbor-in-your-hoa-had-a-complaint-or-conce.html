<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>In the vast majority of cases, HOAs do not handle disagreements between<br>neighbors. HOAs handle violations of their rules.<br><br>But let's assume for argument's sake that you meant that the neighbor<br>had a complaint about me violating an HOA rule. I'd prefer that my<br>neighbors remain "neighborly" and if they think I'm in violation of an<br>HOA rule, I'd appreciate it if they came to me and told me about it<br>first so I could fix it before the HOA became involved.<br><br>But even if they went directly to the HOA, I'd simply get a courtesy<br>letter saying I was in violation, and I'd fix it straight away. No harm,<br>no foul.<br><br>Anonymous letters are cowardly and childish. If someone sent me an<br>anonymous letter, I'd literally blow it off and leave it until the HOA<br>sent me their courtesy letter and then I'd fix it. I don't respond to<br>anonymous letters. If you want to tell me something, have the courage to<br>stand behind your beliefs.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>If a neighbor in your HOA had a complaint or concern about you, would<br>you rather they contacted you to discuss it directly, sent you an<br>anonymous letter or just reported their issue to the HOA and let them<br>handle it?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
