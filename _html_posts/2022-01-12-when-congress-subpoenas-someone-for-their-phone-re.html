<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Sure. But this will only do two things:<br><br>1.  You lose all your message history<br>2.  Since the subpoena goes to the cell phone company and not you, they<br>    get all the messages anyway, and your actions prove to them that you<br>    are willing to destroy evidence. There's no way that could backfire<br>    on you.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>When Congress subpoenas someone for their phone records, can they just<br>delete their messages before handing it over?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
