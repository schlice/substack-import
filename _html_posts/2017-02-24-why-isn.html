<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>HSCT (hematopoietic stem cell therapy) is a very dangerous and risky<br>procedure. People seem to think that you can take a shot of stem cells<br>and it will magically cure you. The current therapy is not this at all.<br><br>HSCT works in this way:<br><br>- Stem cells from the patient are harvested, genetically modified and<br>  reproduced in a lab.<br>- The patient is given high-dose chemotherapy to destroy their immune<br>  system as well as their bone marrow, where immune cells are produced.<br>- Once all of their immune system (and bone marrow) is completely gone,<br>  the patient's lab-grown stem cells are re-injected into their body.<br>- The stem cells form new bone marrow, which produces new immune cells.<br><br>During this time, the patient is extremely susceptible to disease, as<br>they essentially have no immune system. After the bone marrow re-grows<br>and the immune system starts to work again, the patient has to get new<br>vaccines to combat all the childhood diseases again, as if they were<br>"reborn." This is part of what makes this procedure so dangerous: there<br>is literally no immune system during that time. The patient must be<br>isolated in a clean environment (ICU, isolation) because of the danger<br>they are in.<br><br>For now, this therapy is reserved for people who have not responded to<br>any traditional therapies, and whose health warrants such invasive and<br>dangerous intervention.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
