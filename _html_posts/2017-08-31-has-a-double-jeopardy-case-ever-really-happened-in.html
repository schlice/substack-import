<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>"Double jeopardy" "cases" are a misnomer, since a case would not<br>actually be brought if double jeopardy attaches.<br><br>There was a case that established case law surrounding how double<br>jeopardy would attach if there were multiple crimes being charged. In<br>[[Blockburger v. United<br>States](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=d3848a&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockburger_v._United_States){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}, the Supreme Court<br>established that if separate charges are supported by separate facts,<br>even if they are rolled into a single case, the defendant can be retried<br>for individual charges not separately charged previously. Justice James<br>Sutherland wrote the opinion for a unanimous court:<br><br>> *Each of the offenses created requires proof of a different element.<br>> The applicable rule is that, where the same act or transaction<br>> constitutes a violation of two distinct statutory provisions, the test<br>> to be applied to determine whether there are two offenses or only one<br>> is whether each provision requires proof of an additional fact which<br>> the other does not.*\[1\](#XFuBp){#cite-XFuBp .citation_link}<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-XFuBp){.citation_index} [[Blockburger v.
