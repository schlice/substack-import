<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>You are protected by the First Amendment when you dress up in a police<br>uniform.<br><br>The minute you try to a) gain special favors, or b) try to perform the<br>duties of a police officer, you are impersonating a police officer and<br>can go to jail.<br><br>Same holds true of military impersonators. People dress up in military<br>uniforms all the time, and while we in the military think that\'s<br>disgraceful, if we believe in the Constitution, they have a right to do<br>it.<br><br>The minute they walk into a Starbucks and try to get a 10% military<br>discount on their latte, they are impersonating a military member to<br>attempt to receive illicit gain, and are in violation of law in all<br>states (it's called *theft of service*). The point at which the<br>impersonation moves from protected free speech to illegality is when the<br>impersonator attempts to extract some gain from the impersonation, or<br>attempts to perform the duties of the impersonated.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
