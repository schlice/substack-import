<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Will the Senate go along with the House which is set to vote and<br>increase the stimulus checks from \$600 to \$2,000, in the bill already<br>signed, as demanded by President Trump?**<br><br>What? MSN got it wrong? There's a surprise.<br><br>There was already a separate bill in the works which would increase the<br>\$600 payments to \$2000. It will also start Congressional<br>investigations into voting fraud, and will repeal Section 230 of the<br>Communications Decency Act, holding big tech site owners responsible for<br>the content they curate.<br><br>So with that agreement (that they would pass the follow-on bill), he<br>signed the first bill to keep the government running, provide small<br>business loans, and give the \$600 initial checks, and then the add-on<br>bill will add an additional \$1400 in relief checks.<br><br>\<br><br>*Sorry, no comments on this one.*<br><br>*If you don\'t like what I wrote, tough shit. If my answer is<br>grammatically low-quality or is un-cited opinion masquerading as fact,<br>downvote it. If you think I\'m wrong, write your own answer. But Quora<br>is a question-and-answer site, not a debate site. If you were simply<br>going to comment to tell me \"ackshually, you\'re wrong,\" then you're<br>the reason why I disable comments. Well done, Karen. You ruined it for<br>everyone.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
