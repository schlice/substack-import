<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**How do you implement a rule to restrict the number of rentals in your<br>Home owners Association (if one does not exist now)?**<br><br>Your Board of Directors can do this, as they can modify the Rules and<br>Regulations at any time. They can make a modification to the R&R, vote<br>on it, and have it take effect immediately.<br><br>I will caution you, however. When it comes to things that severely<br>impact homeowners (especially things that may financially negatively<br>impact homeowners), courts do not look fondly on rule changes. While<br>they are technically binding on homeowners, courts are not in favor of a<br>small group of people imposing their will on the community, especially<br>when the change is unpopular or unresearched.<br><br>In that case, if you want the change to not only be binding **but to<br>stand up to court challenges**, make the change in the Covenants of the<br>HOA. In order to do that, you will need a percentage of homeowners to<br>agree to the change (that percentage is different in each state, but<br>it's usually no less than 3/4 of all the homeowners), and then you will<br>need a lawyer to draw up the paperwork to get the Covenants amended with<br>the City in which they are filed.<br><br>I will give you an example. We had an incident with a homeowner who<br>turned his home into a luxury rental, violating tons of rules along the<br>way (we eventually foreclosed on that property, but it was a years-long<br>battle). We decided that to try to forestall events like this again, we<br>attempted to limit short-term (VRBO and AirBNB) rentals in our<br>neighborhood by implementing a Covenants amendment requiring rentals to<br>be a minimum of 6 months and requiring a filing of a rental agreement<br>with the HOA along with a refundable deposit of some significant amount<br>(I think we were going to make it \$100 initially). The community, while<br>initially showing support, decided not to pass that amendment. Oh well,<br>there's only so much we can do to limit the damage done by rentals to<br>neighboring home prices. If homeowners eventually become sufficiently<br>motivated, perhaps we can run that amendment again, but for now, we<br>can't limit rentals to a specific timeframe because the homeowners<br>didn't approve it.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
