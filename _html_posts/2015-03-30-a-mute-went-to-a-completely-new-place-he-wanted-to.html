<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Braille computer display.\<br>\<br>The mute will type a message on the computer using the keyboard, which<br>then displays on the braille reader below the keyboard. The blind person<br>will read the \"display\" and get the water.\<br>\<br>It\'s the same technology that blind people use today to read computer<br>screens.\<br>\<br>I do like [[Dusan<br>Ondris](https://www.quora.com/profile/Dusan-Ondris)]{.qlink_container}\'s<br>suggestion of text-to-voice. It should be simple enough on a mobile<br>phone to use such an app, and it\'s likely that a mute person may have<br>that app handy for day-to-day use.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
