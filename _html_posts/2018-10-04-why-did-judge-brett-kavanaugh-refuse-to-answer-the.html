<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Why did Judge Brett Kavanaugh refuse to answer the question given by<br>Senator Kamala Harris, who asked if he talked to anyone at a law firm<br>about special prosecutor Mueller\'s Trump investigation that indicates a<br>conflict of interest?**<br><br>Thanks for the A2A. I'm afraid I can't give you much more information<br>than everyone else did.<br><br>Harris asked Kavanaugh if he spoke with "anyone" at Kasowitz Benson<br>Torres regarding the Mueller probe, which is a law firm founded by<br>Trump's attorney, Marc Kasowitz. She then gave the ominous warning, "Be<br>sure about your answer, sir."<br><br>Understanding the tone of the question thanks to her warning, Kavanaugh<br>demured: "I'm not sure I know everyone who works at that law firm," he<br>said.<br><br>You can see the trap, can't you? Kavanaugh did. He answered that he<br>could not remember whether or not he spoke to anyone specifically at<br>that law firm regarding the Mueller probe, but he'd be happy to have his<br>memory refreshed.<br><br>Harris continued, "With all that you remember, you have an impeccable<br>memory, you've been speaking for almost eight hours, maybe more with<br>this committee, about all sorts of things you've been asked. How can you<br>not remember whether or not you had a conversation about Robert Mueller<br>or his investigation with anyone at that law firm?"<br><br>Kavanaugh again asked if his memory could be refreshed. He asked if<br>there was someone specific that Harris was asking about which would help<br>him remember.<br><br>She answered, "I think you're thinking of someone and you don't want to<br>tell us."<br><br>So you can see the trap: she was trying to bait him into admitting that<br>he had a conflict of interest. But clearly, she didn't have anything or<br>she would have said so.<br><br>Political dinner theater.<br><br>Don't forget to tip your server. Try the veal.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
