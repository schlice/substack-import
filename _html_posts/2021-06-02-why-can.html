<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>So hold on here a second, let me see if I understand your question. Are<br>you saying that only the theist has a burden of proof to meet? Are you<br>claiming that the atheist doesn't also have a burden of proof? In other<br>words, are you suggesting that it requires too many leaps of faith to be<br>a theist? Are you saying **it doesn't require any faith to be an<br>atheist?** And are you also saying that the burden of proof required for<br>the atheist is somehow so much less than what is required for the<br>theist?<br><br>Because that would be a mistake. In fact, it requires **much more<br>faith** to be an atheist than it does to be a theist.<br><br>The atheist makes a claim that there is no god. This is an untenable<br>position to hold from a philosophical standpoint. As legal scholar and<br>philosopher Mortimer Adler says, \"An affirmative existential<br>proposition can be proved, but a negative existential proposition\--one<br>that denies the existence of something\--cannot be proved.\" For<br>example, someone may claim that a red eagle exists and someone else may<br>assert that red eagles do not exist. The former only needs to find a<br>single red eagle to prove his assertion. But the latter must comb the<br>entire universe and literally be in every place at once to ensure they<br>have not missed a red eagle somewhere and at some time, which is<br>impossible to do. This is why intellectually honest atheists will admit<br>they cannot prove God does not exist.<br><br>There's also the question about the seriousness of the charge. Being an<br>atheist isn't just a lifestyle choice. It could have serious<br>consequences, which could potentially be an eternal mistake. To<br>understand the seriousness of the charge and the evidence required,<br>let's look at an example. If someone set two glasses of lemonade in<br>front of you and told you to drink one, but one glass might be more tart<br>than the other, you probably wouldn't need a whole lot of evidence<br>before deciding which one to drink. But if instead you were told that<br>one was sweetened with sugar and the other with rat poison, you'd need<br>tons of evidence before you took a drink.<br><br>This is where a person sits when they are deciding whether or not to<br>live as a theist or as an atheist. Since being an atheist could possibly<br>result in irreparable and eternal consequences, it would seem that the<br>atheist should be required to produce detailed and overriding evidence<br>to support their position, *but they cannot*. **Atheism simply cannot<br>meet the test for evidence for the seriousness of the charge it makes.**<br>Instead, the atheists and those whom they convince of their position<br>slide into eternity with their fingers crossed and hope they do not find<br>the unpleasant truth that eternity does indeed exist and that such a<br>place is an awfully long time to be wrong. As Mortimer Adler says, "More<br>consequences for life and action follow from the affirmation or denial<br>of God than from any other basic question."<br><br>Being a theist doesn't prevent me from doing anything in my life that<br>the atheist can do. So living as a theist gives me exactly the same kind<br>of life that living as an atheist does. In other words, **it doesn't<br>cost me anything to be a theist, and the potential benefit is eternal.**<br>So to repeat a catchphrase:<br><br>***If I'm wrong, and there is no god, I've lost nothing. But if you're<br>wrong and there is a god, you've lost everything.***<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>**Why can\'t theists meet their burden of proof about God? Then say<br>faith is a good enough reason to believe in God . Faith is ignorance not<br>evidence based**<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
