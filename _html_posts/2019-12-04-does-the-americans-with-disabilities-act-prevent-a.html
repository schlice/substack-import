<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Does the Americans with Disabilities Act prevent an employer from<br>being fired if their Tourette syndrome causes them to use profanity on<br>the job?**<br><br>The Americans with Disabilities Act prevents employers from terminating<br>employees specifically because they have a disability, Instead, it<br>requires employers to provide *reasonable accommodations* to employees<br>with disabilities.<br><br>It does not require that the employer change his or her business in an<br>*unreasonable manner*. For example, it does not require that the<br>employer spend inordinate amounts of money to accommodate the employee.<br>It does not require the employer to change business practices or change<br>how they conduct business.<br><br>In this case, the employer could rightly be concerned if the person with<br>Tourette's Syndrome were in a customer-facing role. Profanity in a<br>customer-facing position would not be ideal. If this business did not<br>have any positions that this person could do which were not customer<br>facing, the employer could probably not find a position this person<br>could perform, and could reasonably terminate that employee.<br><br>If the employer had a non customer-facing role in which they could place<br>the employee for which he is qualified, he could place the employee in<br>that role.<br><br>**TL;DR: Under certain conditions, the employee can be fired and it<br>would not violate the ADA.**<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
