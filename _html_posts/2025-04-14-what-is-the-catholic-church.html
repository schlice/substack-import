<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The Catholic Church encourages believers to confess sins of thought.<br>Impure thoughts are a common category of sin heard in confessionals.<br><br>Catholics believe that we sin "in our thoughts and in our words, in what<br>we have done, and what we have failed to do." They are not wrong in<br>this; our minds are indeed sinful, and we sin in our thoughts. In fact,<br>they ask for forgiveness from those sins of the mind at the beginning of<br>every mass.<br><br>So yes, the Catholic Church does encourage their adherents to confess<br>sins in the mind.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
