<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>So since you're asking about violating God's will, this is clearly a<br>religious question. Be aware of that while we proceed.<br><br>There is a world's worth of difference between who you are and<br>what you choose to do. Just because you "are" some way, or you<br>believe you "are" some way, doesn't require you to behave in any<br>specific way. You control your choices. You are not a slave to your<br>biology.<br><br>Now that that's out of the way, Christians believe that homosexual<br>*behavior* is sinful, because it goes against God's plan for the<br>sexes, and for marriage and relations between a husband and a wife.<br>There's a mountain of evidence talking about how homosexual activity is<br>sinful, in both the Old and the New Testaments (all quotes from NIV):<br><br>> Do not have sexual relations with a man as one does with a woman; that<br>> is detestable. --- Leviticus 18:22<br>><br>> If a man has sexual relations with a man as one does with a woman,<br>> both of them have done what is detestable. They are to be put to<br>> death; their blood will be on their own heads. --- Leviticus 20:13<br>><br>> Or do you not know that wrongdoers will not inherit the kingdom of<br>> God? Do not be deceived: Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters<br>> nor adulterers nor men who have sex with men nor thieves nor the<br>> greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the<br>> kingdom of God. --- 1 Corinthians 6:9-10<br>><br>> We also know that the law is made not for the righteous but for<br>> lawbreakers and rebels, the ungodly and sinful, the unholy and<br>> irreligious, for those who kill their fathers or mothers, for<br>> murderers, for the sexually immoral, for those practicing<br>> homosexuality, for slave traders and liars and perjurers---and for<br>> whatever else is contrary to the sound doctrine --- 1 Timothy 1:9-10<br><br>And lest you think that only gay men are implicated in the Bible,<br>lesbians are also specifically called out:<br><br>> Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their<br>> women exchanged natural sexual relations for unnatural ones. In the<br>> same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were<br>> inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed shameful acts with<br>> other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their error.<br>> --- Romans 1:26--27<br><br>Now that we've established this point, where do we go from here? How do<br>we treat someone who encourages LGBT behavior?<br><br>We love them. That's all we're commanded to do. Love them.<br><br>Does that mean we have to be best friends? Nope. The Bible says to love<br>them, not to like them. Love, in this context, is a doing. It's a verb.<br><br>When most people talk about love, they're usually referencing a feeling.<br>They say things like "falling in love" as if it's something outside of<br>your control. You lock eyes with someone, your heart beats faster, you<br>get all sweaty, and that's described as love. That's a feeling, it's not<br>love! You can run around a building and feel the same way. That's<br>*romance*, that's *infatuation*, it may even be *lust* if it's not<br>controlled. But it is not love.<br><br>God commands us to love, but you can see that in the Bible passages<br>which discuss God's command to love, it's a command to *action*, not a<br>command to *feeling* (as if you can control your feelings, anyway):<br><br>> *But to you who are listening I say: Love your enemies, do good to<br>> those who hate you, bless those who curse you, pray for those who<br>> mistreat you. --- Luke 6:27--28*<br>><br>> *But love your enemies, do good to them, and lend to them without<br>> expecting to get anything back. --- Luke 6:35*<br><br>Luke says "do good" right after he says "love." Love is associated with<br>doing.<br><br>That said, it's important to understand that feelings come and go based<br>on external stimuli or your interpretation of them. Feelings are<br>involuntary; love is a command. Don't equate feelings with love. Love<br>includes feelings, but it's more about action.<br><br>If you want to feel good about someone, do good for them. Doing good for<br>someone is a stimulus that can change your feelings.<br><br>\<br><br>So what do you do with the person who encourages LGBT against God's<br>will? Love them. Do good for them. If you get into a religious<br>discussion, you might mention what the Bible says about homosexual<br>activities and that Christians should discourage those actions,<br>especially among believers. But most of all, love them by doing good for<br>them.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
