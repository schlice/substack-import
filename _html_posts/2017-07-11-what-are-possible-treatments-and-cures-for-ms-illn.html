<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>There are treatments available, but they do not treat the actual disease<br>itself. The treatments available today lessen the severity of relapses,<br>reduce the duration of relapses, and increase the amount of time between<br>relapses. The treatments also slow the progress of the disease. All of<br>the approved MS medications do these things, with varying degrees of<br>success for each person, as well as various routes of administration (SC<br>injection, IM injection, infusion, or oral pill).<br><br>The treatments still do not treat the actual cause of the disease,<br>because it is still unknown.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
