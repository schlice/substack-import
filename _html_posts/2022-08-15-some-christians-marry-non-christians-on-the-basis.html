<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The first thought that comes to mind is they should pre-order their<br>divorce attorney while they order their marriage license, because that's<br>a recipe for marital failure. They should also sign a pre-nup, because<br>planning for divorce makes a lot of sense in this situation.<br><br>I'm not saying that such a couple *can't* make it work, but in today's<br>society, people do a lot of different things to make marriage about<br>something that it was never intended to be about. And when you do that,<br>your chances for success decline rapidly. Society's way is to remove God<br>from all of the things that God made for us, and at no time in history<br>has that ever ended well.<br><br>And "not wanting to mix faith and marital life" is the same thing. It's<br>about as illogical as saying "I don't want to mix coffee with water."<br>Marriage was *ordained* by God. Marriage was around for thousands of<br>years before government showed up and co-opted it. Marriage *is* faith.<br>Marriage, in faith, is about children, and raising them together in a<br>common household. The Bible is clear about this.<br><br>But we've made marriage into a process which is more about **the desires<br>of adults rather than the needs of children**.<br><br>Just ask Jonah: ignoring God doesn't ever end well.<br><br>\<br><br>Original answer:<br><br>Some Christians marry non-Christians on the basis that s/he doesn\'t<br>want to mix faith and marital life, ignoring God\'s warning not to be<br>yoked with a non-believer. What thoughts come to you?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
