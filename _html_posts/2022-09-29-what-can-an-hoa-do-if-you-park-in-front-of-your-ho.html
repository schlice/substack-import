<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The answer is "it depends."<br><br>First, it depends on the restrictions on parking you may have in your<br>Governing Documents. Next, it depends on whether or not you live in a<br>gated community.<br><br>If your HOA's Governing Documents has a rule which states that you may<br>not park in front of your house, then you may not park in front of your<br>house. If you do park in front of your house in violation of your<br>Governing Documents, the HOA can take action.<br><br>The action they can take will depend on whether or not your HOA is<br>gated.<br><br>- If you live in a gated community, then the HOA owns the roads and can<br>  enforce parking using *physical* methods: they can tow your car, or<br>  they can boot your car until you pay a fine, depending on what your<br>  Governing Documents say.<br>- If you do not live in a gated community, the HOA can only fine you for<br>  violating the Governing Documents.<br><br>In either case, if you do not pay the fines, the HOA can put a lien on<br>your house to cover the unpaid fines, and if the amount gets high enough<br>(which is usually specified by state law), the HOA can foreclose on that<br>lien and sell your house out from under you to pay for the money they<br>are owed.<br><br>In short, not following your HOA's rules can indeed become very legally<br>troublesome for you.<br><br>If you don't like the HOA's rules, you can either work to change them,<br>or you can sell your house and move to a community with better rules, or<br>no HOA and no rules at all.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>What can an HOA do if you park in front of your house?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
