<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**How will this effect private citizens who come on school grounds with<br>a concealed weapon? Isn\'t this changing the gun free zone status for<br>the school?**<br><br>In order for a teacher to qualify to conceal a weapon on school grounds,<br>two things need to happen:<br><br>1.  The teacher needs a Concealed Weapons Permit from the local sheriff<br>2.  The teacher needs to be certified as a school security guard in<br>    order to carry a weapon in the school's gun-free zone.<br><br>This means that the teacher must go through the normal process that<br>every other concealed weapons permit holder goes through, but then the<br>teacher must take and pass all of the training required to be certified<br>as a security guard within the district.<br><br>This doesn't change the "gun-free zone" status of the school, as<br>currently only police and certified school security guards can carry<br>weapons on school grounds, and that won't change. We're simply allowing<br>teachers to become "volunteer" security guards.<br><br>Likely, this will start with teachers who already possess concealed<br>weapons permits taking school security guard training and becoming<br>certified school security guards. Then they would be permitted to take<br>their concealed weapons onto school property.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
