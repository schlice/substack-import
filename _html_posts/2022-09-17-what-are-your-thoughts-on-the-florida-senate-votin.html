<br><br><h2>Space Submission</h2><br><div><br><br>Space name: Jon's political corner<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>When the Reedy Creek Improvement District was implemented, Florida<br>desperately wanted to become more than just the home for Florida Man and<br>endless swamps and the place people go to retire. The deal with Disney<br>gave them far more power than a theme park operator should ever have,<br>but at great benefit to them and to the state. For all intents and<br>purposes, it put Florida on the map as a tourist destination.<br><br>Fast-forward to today. Disney retains that power that a theme park<br>operator should not rightly have, and Florida has grown *outside of*<br>Disney. Sure, the continued existence of Disney is exceedingly<br>important, but it only provides about half of Florida's tourist revenue.<br>RCID has become a *hindrance* in many respects to the state, and has<br>been a thorn in its side as of late. Tallahassee has been waiting for an<br>opportunity to have the chink in DIsney's armor exposed.<br><br>And Bob Chapek, in his infinite wisdom, conveniently highlighted their<br>chink.<br><br>The next iteration of special district for Disney will happen, but this<br>time it will be the state dictating the terms. Disney doesn't have a leg<br>to stand on; they're not a side show attraction that they can pack up in<br>a week and move to a new location. Disney has bet the farm on Florida<br>for the Walt Disney World Resort, arguably the crown jewel in the Disney<br>Parks portfolio. They've invested way too much money to abandon it now,<br>and now they're committed.<br><br>So as the Florida law says, RCID will be dissolved and a new special<br>district will be built in its place. It will still allow much of the<br>self-governing that they had before (the RCFD and the city services will<br>remain, just under new management), but the state will have a lot more<br>influence in *how* things are done, not necessarily the day-to-day<br>management of the property. The future growth of Disney will now be much<br>more of a *partnership* between Disney and Florida, whereas in the past<br>the future growth of Disney was *solely* in the hands of Disney, and<br>Florida could do little but look on and adapt accordingly. Now,<br>Florida's interests can be included alongside Disney's interests.<br><br>In short, Disney had an airtight deal, and that deal was DIsney's to<br>lose.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>What are your thoughts on the Florida Senate voting 23-16 in favor to<br>strip Disney of its self-governing status?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
