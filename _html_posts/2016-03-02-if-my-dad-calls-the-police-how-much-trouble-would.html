<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>If you take the car and your dad calls the police and reports it stolen,<br>the car will get pulled over and you will be arrested and sent to jail.<br>The charge in most jurisdictions is \"grand theft auto.\" Yes, it is a<br>real charge, not just a video game. It is a felony. Assuming your dad<br>presses charges, you will spend a minimum of one year in jail, and pay a<br>minimum fine of \$1,000 (probably more depending on where you live).<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
