<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Would the suspension of the second amendment prevent a determined<br>psychopath from obtaining a gun?**<br><br>HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA<br><br>When has a *law* ever stopped a criminal (let alone a mentally<br>unstable criminal) from doing *anything???*<br><br>Even if you could magically take every gun away from every law abiding<br>person in the United States, there will still be criminals who get their<br>guns from the black market. Guns are routinely smuggled in across the<br>border (which is wide open and works very well allowing guns across).<br><br>Odd how the same people who want to remove the Second Amendment don't<br>care about plugging the holes where actual, illegal guns are smuggled<br>in.<br><br>And what if a determined psychopath snuck up on a cop, stabbed him in<br>the neck with a knife and stole his gun?<br><br>Wait! I have a great idea! Let's take the guns away from the cops so<br>the psychopaths can't steal those guns, either!<br><br>It's like the bully in Kindergarten who steals all the other kids toys,<br>and your solution is to take the toys away from everyone so the bully<br>has nothing to steal. Except now he uses crayons as toys. Are you going<br>to take everyone's crayons away?<br><br>And in all actuality, *who cares about guns?* Determined psychopaths<br>used a *pressure cooker* to make a bomb in Boston, and because they<br>were morons, they didn't kill a lot of people, but they could have<br>killed a lot more than they did. Shall we ban pressure cookers? And what<br>happens when a determined psychopath uses a liquid propane tank to<br>fashion a bomb? Shall we ban liquid propane tanks? And what happens when<br>a psychopath decides to kill a building full of people by padlocking the<br>door and lighting it on fire with gasoline? Are we going to start<br>regulating padlocks and registering purchasers of gasoline? How will<br>this affect that kid in gym class? Will he need a Federal permit to open<br>his gym locker?<br><br>***When do we stop focusing on the objects used to commit crime, and<br>start focusing on the people committing crime?***<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
