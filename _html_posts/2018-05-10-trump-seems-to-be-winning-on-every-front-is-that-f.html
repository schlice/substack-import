<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Trump seems to be winning on every front. Is that fair?<br><br>You answered your own question, because you said that Trump *seems*<br>to be winning on every front.<br><br>Therefore, whether or not Trump is *actually* winning is very dependent<br>on the glasses through which you view Trump's actions, and those glasses<br>are colored by your political viewpoint.<br><br>If you're a liberal or a Democrat, you'll clearly see everything that<br>Trump does, with few exceptions, to be childish buffoonery, and with<br>each passing day, you'll see the country falling further and further<br>backwards in social progress. You'll declare "NOT MY PRESIDENT" because<br>he didn't win fairly, because Russia helped him win, and you'll see that<br>the whole Stormy Daniels thing is *totally and completely unrelated in<br>any way to Bill Clinton and Monica Lewinsky.* You'll see that Hillary<br>and Bimbo Eruptions is *totally and completely unrelated in any way to<br>Michael Cohen and his payouts.* And you'll continue to wait for the day<br>when Robert Mueller comes forward with that all-convincing proof that<br>Trump colluded with Russia to steal the election from Hillary, because<br>everyone knows it's true.<br><br>In the meantime, while liberals can only see Stormy Daniels and Robert<br>Mueller through their glasses, if you're a conservative or a Republican,<br>you'll see far more "wins" than Democrats see. You'll see the tax cuts<br>putting money back in your pocket and jobs back into society. You'll see<br>that his tough talk on Twitter and elsewhere, along with a no-compromise<br>attitude, actually convinced a murderous little tyrant to come to the<br>table and discuss peace. You'll see that he has no qualms using the very<br>same tactics that Obama used to undo some of the terrible decisions that<br>Obama made, and will do so unapologetically. You'll see far more<br>#fakenews in daily life than a liberal would ever admit to. And you'll<br>be proud that Trump is putting our nation back on to a path to being one<br>of the greatest nations in the world, again, unapologetically.<br><br>So whether or not you see Trump as a laughing stock or as a success will<br>depend largely on which glasses you wear.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
