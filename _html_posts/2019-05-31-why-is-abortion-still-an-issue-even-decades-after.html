<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Why is abortion still an issue even decades after Roe v. Wade?<br><br>First, law, like science, is never "settled." Remember, *Plessy v.<br>Ferguson*, which made racial segregation legal, was "settled law" for 60<br>years before the Court overturned it.<br><br>Law is never settled. There is either "good law," or "bad law." Good law<br>welcomes challenges and easily overcomes them. Bad law is afraid of<br>challenges, and falls because it's...well...bad law.<br><br>*Roe v. Wade* is bad law.<br><br>*First, I want to note that this is* *not* *an answer about<br>abortion. You can ask questions about abortion separately. This is an<br>answer about law. Secondly, my personal opinions about abortion are<br>wholly irrelevant to a legal discussion. Don't be surprised if comments<br>about "abortion is murder" or "you don't respect women" get summarily<br>deleted.*<br><br>*Now, back to our regularly-scheduled legal discussion.*<br><br>*Roe v. Wade* is bad law because it is based on a precedent of bad law.<br>The decision in *Roe* came from a previous bad decision: *Griswold v.<br>Connecticut*. In this decision, the court magically "discovered" a right<br>that wasn't written into the Bill of Rights. Like the Court was an<br>explorer, poking through the sunken wreckage of the Constitution, and<br>discovered a right that no one knew was there. The right we are talking<br>about is the right to privacy. The Court said in *Griswold* that a right<br>to privacy exists in the Constitution, but it can only be found in the<br>"emanations and penumbras" of the Constitution, not actually in the<br>written words. Now I'm going to boil down the findings in *Griswold* to<br>something we can all easily understand, but know that *Griswold* was a<br>complex decision. Basically, if you look at certain rights, like the 5th<br>Amendment, the 4th Amendment, the 8th Amendment, and the 14th Amendment<br>(and even the 2nd Amendment), you can sorta see a trend. The trend in<br>those Amendments is that you have certain personal rights which are<br>protected. In general, a right to be free from government intrusion into<br>your life. Putting all of those trends together, the Court found that<br>there is an overall "right to privacy" in the Constitution.<br><br>The easiest way to describe what the court did is this way: Let's assume<br>a shopkeeper has a sign on his door which says "No Dogs or Cats<br>Allowed." A reasonable person would say that it's okay to bring a pet<br>ferret in, because the sign calls out dogs and cats. If the owner didn't<br>want ferrets, he would have stated that ferrets were not allowed. Those<br>who think like the progressives on the Court do would look at that sign<br>and say, "Oh, the owner doesn't want dogs or cats, he must mean that he<br>doesn't want any *pets* in, so you can't bring ferrets, snakes,<br>pot-bellied pigs, or any other pet either."<br><br>*Roe* built on the shaky, unreliable decision in *Griswold* and found<br>that if you have a right to privacy, you have a right to privacy with<br>what you do with your body, and found that you have a right to have an<br>abortion. *Roe* was also a terrible decision because they *completely<br>ignored* the issue of whether or not the baby is alive and therefore has<br>rights as a human. Not that they found that the baby did not have<br>rights. They *ignored the question*. Therefore, if any court, ever,<br>finds that the baby is alive and does have human rights, then *Roe*<br>literally goes out the window, and the writers of the *Roe* decision<br>openly acknowledged this.<br><br>This is the biggest problem that I have with *Roe*. Not that it was<br>built on shaky legal foundations; while that much is true, that's not my<br>big issue. My big issue is that they totally acknowledged that they were<br>ignoring whether or not the baby was alive, and thus had rights, and<br>they went ahead with their decision anyway. Some quotes from the<br>concurring opinion written by Justice Blackmun in *Roe:*<br><br>> *We need not resolve the difficult question of when life begins. When<br>> those trained in the respective disciplines of medicine, philosophy,<br>> and theology are unable to arrive at any consensus, the judiciary, at<br>> this point in the development of man\'s knowledge, is not in a<br>> position to speculate as to the answer...*<br><br>This is the most notable of the quotes that indicates just how badly<br>*Roe* was written. Instead of saying, "we can't figure out whether or<br>not the baby is alive, so we're going to proceed assuming the baby is<br>alive," they said, "we can't figure out whether or not the baby is<br>alive, so since they can't figure it out, we won't try either, and we'll<br>just ignore the whole thing." Just incredible.<br><br>> *There has always been strong support for the view that life does not<br>> begin until live\' birth.*<br>><br>> *Physicians and their scientific colleagues have regarded that event<br>> with less interest and have tended to focus either upon conception,<br>> upon live birth, or upon the interim point at which the fetus becomes<br>> \"viable,\" that is, potentially able to live outside the mother\'s<br>> womb, albeit with artificial aid. Viability is usually placed at about<br>> seven months (28 weeks) but may occur earlier, even at 24 weeks. The<br>> Aristotelian theory of \"mediate animation,\" that held sway through<br>> out the Middle Ages and the Renaissance in Europe, continued to be<br>> official Roman Catholic Dogma until the 19th century, despite<br>> opposition to this \"ensoulment\" theory from those in the Church who<br>> would recognize the existence of life from the moment of conception.<br>> The latter is now, of course, the official belief of the Catholic<br>> Church. As one brief amicus discloses, this is a view strongly held by<br>> many non-Catholics as well, and by many physicians. Substantial<br>> problems for precise definition of this view are posed, however, by<br>> new embryological data that purport to indicate that conception is a<br>> \"process\" over time rather than an event, and by new medical<br>> techniques such as menstrual extraction, the \"morning-after\" pill<br>> implantation of embryos, artificial insemination, and even artificial<br>> wombs...*<br><br>Reading the opinion, you can see that if science ever determines that a<br>baby in the womb is alive, and therefore is to be afforded human rights,<br>then the whole foundation upon which *Roe* was built will crumble.<br><br>That's a terrible foundation on which to build a law.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
