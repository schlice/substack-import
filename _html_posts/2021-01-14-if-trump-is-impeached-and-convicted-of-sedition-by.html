Impeachment is a political process, whereas<br>criminal conviction requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt.<br><br>The only way in which impeachment and removal from office paves the way<br>for criminal conviction is that Trump becomes eligible for indictment<br>once he is out of office.<br><br>But literally, wait a week, and he'll be eligible.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
