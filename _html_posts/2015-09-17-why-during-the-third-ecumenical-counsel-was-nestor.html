<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Your assertion that Nestorius was \"merely defending what<br>scriptures taught\" was exactly what was at issue during the Council.\<br>\<br>During the Third Ecumenical Council at Ephesus (also known as the<br>Council of Ephesus), Pope Celestine I and Roman Emperor Theodosius II<br>found that Nestorius, in defending his view of the Immaculate<br>Conception, was actually advancing the idea that the hypostatic union<br>did not occur at birth, and Mary gave birth only to Christ, not to the<br>divine *Logos*. He asserted that the *Logos* could not be \"born\" since<br>it existed before Mary, and to say that the divine could be born would<br>be to deny the nature of the divine. He also asserted that the *Logos*<br>occupied the area normally occupied by the soul, which allowed Jesus to<br>exist without the stain on the soul from the Fall.\<br>\<br>The Council found this to be a contradiction to the hypostatic union,<br>and found Nestorius\' view to be heretical. The Council found that<br>separating the divine from the human, and saying that the divine can\'t<br>be born, would mean that Jesus was *less than* human because he was born<br>without a soul.\<br>\<br>Source: [[Council of<br>Ephesus](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=8d1e25&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_Ephesus){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
