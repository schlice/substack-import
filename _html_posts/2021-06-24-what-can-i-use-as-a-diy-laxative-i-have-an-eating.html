<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Not sure what you consider a "DIY" laxative. Do you mean something<br>that's not a medicine, but is still a laxative?<br><br>You might consider mineral oil:<br><br>[https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/dr\...(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=544a73&url=https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-153865/mineral-oil-laxative-oral/details){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="webmd.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>But use with caution: as with all laxatives, don't use for more than 7<br>days without consulting with your doctor. Mineral oil can block other<br>medicines, and also blocks vitamin absorption, so do not take with food.<br><br>Since it can take 6--8 hours to produce a bowel movement, it's best to<br>take it at night so you give it a full night to work.<br><br>Beyond 7 days, you should only use general use laxatives with the advise<br>of your doctor.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>What can I use as a DIY laxative? I have an eating disorder and I have<br>trouble using the bathroom. Don\'t tell me to \"just eat\" that isn\'t<br>gonna do crap.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
