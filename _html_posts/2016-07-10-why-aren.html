<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>A2A<br><br>I don't mean to sound rude, but your assumptions are all incorrect.<br><br>- They cannot "single-handedly" send someone to jail. They can only<br>  bring someone to the jail and present the District Attorney with<br>  evidence that shows that the suspect has committed the crime of which<br>  he is accused. The police only have the power to bring you to jail for<br>  three days (72 hours). It is at that point that the District Attorney<br>  must find that the police have collected enough evidence to formally<br>  charge you, and the DA must have filed formal charges against you, or<br>  you must be released.<br>- They are already highly trained. Police receive extensive classroom<br>  training in state law (over 300 hours), mostly in the section of state<br>  law which pertains to crime and the criminal justice system. Each<br>  police department runs a Police Academy for each incoming class. The<br>  curriculum for the class is approved by the state POST (Peace Officer<br>  Standardization and Training) Board. Officers also receive continuous<br>  refresher training on a monthly basis, updating them on changes to the<br>  law and informing them how those changes impact their daily jobs<br>  (called in-service training). Despite what some may lead you to<br>  believe, they do not have to memorize the law book or you get to go<br>  free. They do have to know enough to know what you did wrong, and they<br>  can look up the relevant statute. So long as the evidence matches the<br>  charge as written, they are fine.<br>- Again, despite your misconceptions, police officers are far from dumb.<br>  Yes, basic entry requirements only require a high school education (or<br>  a GED), but if an officer expects to move up in his career, advanced<br>  degrees are nearly a requirement. Many officers already possess<br>  advanced degrees, usually in Criminal Justice or other related fields.<br><br>Not sure where you got all your misconceptions (TV? Movies?), but<br>they're all wrong. Sorry about that, they just are.<br><br>Now, to answer your basic question: Why aren't there more requirements<br>to become a law enforcement officer in the US?<br><br>It's hard enough getting enough people to fill a class. With the<br>stringent requirements we already have, we can receive 600 applicants<br>beginning the testing process for an upcoming academy, and by the end of<br>the testing and investigations period (usually takes about three months<br>to complete), we can barely field a class of 40 recruits. On top of<br>that, look at the environment we are currently in here in the United<br>States. Organizations like Black Lives Matter have spread a false<br>message: that the police are the most dangerous thing that a young black<br>man has to be concerned with. This couldn't be further from the truth.<br>According to statistics compiled by *The Washington Post*, police killed<br>990 people in 2015. 494 of them were white, and 258 were black. A police<br>officer is actually 18.5 times more likely to be shot by a young black<br>man than the other way round. These realities, and the false messages<br>being spread today, make getting recruits in the door in the first place<br>very difficult.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
