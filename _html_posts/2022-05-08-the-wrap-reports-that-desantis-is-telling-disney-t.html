<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Nope. There's no federal issue here. This will be resolved by the<br>Florida courts.<br><br>However, what the Governor's plan is here is tough to tell; he hasn't<br>really revealed much of it yet (as of 7 May 2022).<br><br>We've all been going off of the assumption that, like with most things,<br>this will simply be re-negotiated. In fact, the legislation that was<br>signed dissolving Reedy Creek by July 2023 says, in the next sentence,<br>that any organization affected can renegotiate, with the effective date<br>being July 2023. This says (without saying) that what the legislators<br>were really going for was to dissolve an old special district *and<br>replace it with a new one.*<br><br>Oddly, a week or so later, in another press conference, Governor<br>DeSantis doubled down on his rhetoric, saying that he did not want to<br>renegotiate Reedy Creek; he wanted to dissolve it, and that Disney would<br>pay their bond debt, not Orange or Osceola County taxpayers.<br><br>I don't yet have a good understanding what his angle is here. The<br>special district was, in truth, beneficial for both Florida and Disney.<br>Disney still paid their property taxes, over \$300 million last year,<br>and an additional \$250 million in other state fees. So while there may<br>have been some tax incentives, Disney wasn't making out like bandits at<br>the state's expense. So I'm a little confused by this.<br><br>We shall see as the story unfolds.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>The wrap reports that DeSantis is telling Disney that Florida won't pay<br>off debts to dissolve the special district. Is it possible that this<br>will evolve into a lengthy legal battle to the Supreme Court?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
