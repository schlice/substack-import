The idea behind minimum wage<br>is to give young kids some opportunity to work and gain a little<br>experience with things like punctuality, dealing with customers, and<br>gaining a little time in a job before moving on to your career.<br><br>Police are career professionals. Police work is definitely not an<br>entry-level job, and is definitely not the kind of job where you want<br>entry-level people.<br><br>Pay an entry-level wage, and you'll get entry-level employees.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
