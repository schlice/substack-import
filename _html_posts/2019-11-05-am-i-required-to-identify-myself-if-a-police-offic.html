Just don't<br>answer the door. No law says you are required to answer the door.<br><br>Just know that if they have a search warrant, they can break your door<br>and then you have to fix it.<br><br>Hope they don't have a search warrant.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
