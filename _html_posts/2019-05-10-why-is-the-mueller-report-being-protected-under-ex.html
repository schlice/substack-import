<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Why is the Mueller Report being protected under Executive Privilege? I<br>thought that was to protect private conversations between the President<br>and his advisors, so that they could speak freely on challenging<br>subjects.**<br><br>First, let's discuss what exactly is being protected, since it seems<br>like you're a little confused about how we got to this point.<br><br>The Attorney General already released the Mueller report. According to<br>law, some of the parts of the report could not be released, such as<br>information about grand jury testimony, so some of it had to be<br>*redacted*. So let's understand what I just said: Congress passed a law<br>that says that grand jury testimony is protected information and cannot<br>be released. Therefore, some of the redactions in the Mueller report<br>were done because of laws passed by Congress. Some were for other<br>reasons, such as other investigations in progress, or privacy concerns.<br><br>Congress wants to now see the full, unredacted report. Bear in mind<br>what I just said in the last paragraph: some of the redacted portions of<br>the report were redacted because of laws. Passed by Congress.<br><br>Barr explained to them exactly what was redacted and why. He even<br>offered to provide a *less-redacted* report for their review in a<br>secured room, with tight controls on the physical copies of the report<br>such that if they chose to do so, they could review the less-redacted<br>report. He would restore the information redacted because of privacy<br>concerns, and he would restore the information regarding other federal<br>and state investigations currently in progress, but he would not restore<br>the information which he is required to protect by law.<br><br>This, too, was not good enough for House Democrats. The Democrats on the<br>House Judiciary Committee, in a party-line vote, voted to subpoena the<br>full, unredacted report, which Barr is not authorized by law to<br>produce.<br><br>Barr, again, refused to break the law and refused to release that full,<br>unredacted report, because a subpoena cannot authorize someone to break<br>the law.<br><br>The House Judiciary Committee doubled-down on their demand for the AG to<br>break the law, and decided, in yet another party-line vote, to hold him<br>in *contempt of Congress*. For refusing to break the law. That they<br>wrote.<br><br>In an effort to forestall any further hand-wringing over the AG's<br>refusal to release the full, unredacted report (which, in case you<br>missed it above, he can't do under the law), the President claimed<br>executive privilege over the full, unredacted report, as well as<br>Mueller's investigation notes (which also contain a great deal of<br>personal information, as well as legally protected information).<br><br>Next, let's talk about [[Executive<br>Privilege](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=19a368&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_privilege){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}.<br><br>There are two flavors of Executive Privilege: there is the one you<br>mentioned (presidential communications privilege) which is rooted in the<br>separation of powers, and there is also "deliberative process privilege"<br>which is rooted in common law. For example, when Congress demanded,<br>under subpoena, materials related to the Justice Department operation<br>known as *Fast and Furious*, the AG rejected that subpoena, citing<br>"Presidents have repeatedly asserted executive privilege to protect<br>confidential Executive Branch deliberative materials from congressional<br>subpoena."<br><br>President Trump did exactly the same thing in this case, citing the<br>deliberative process privilege under which the full, unredacted report<br>was being protected. The *New York Times* noted that this was Trump's<br>"first use of the secrecy powers as president".<br><br>However, it shouldn't have been necessary for Trump to assert Executive<br>Privilege over the unredacted report. The AG was not authorized, under<br>law, to release the full report. The House Judiciary Committee should<br>not have attempted to force the AG to violate the law. So Trump stepped<br>in to forestall the release of the full, unredacted report. Now, instead<br>of dealing with a recalcitrant AG, Congress must overcome an assertion<br>of Executive Privilege. Historically, only two claims of Executive<br>Privilege over congressional subpoena were ever heard by federal courts,<br>and neither of those cases made it to the Supreme Court.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
