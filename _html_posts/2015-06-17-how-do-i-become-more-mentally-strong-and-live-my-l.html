<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [If I may be so bold as to suggest some reading, I recently<br>read a book called *Daring Greatly* by [[Brené<br>Brown](https://www.quora.com/topic/Bren%C3%A9-Brown)]{.qlink_container}.<br>The sub-title is \"How the courage to be vulnerable transforms the way<br>we live, love, parent, and lead.\" Brené is a \"shame researcher\" and<br>has a great TEDx talk that went viral on YouTube.\<br>\<br>In essence, she talks about how our personal shame holds us back, and<br>having courage by allowing ourselves to be vulnerable is a more<br>authentic way to live your life. I highly recommend her book to you. If<br>you want the Cliff Notes version, look her up on<br>YouTube.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
