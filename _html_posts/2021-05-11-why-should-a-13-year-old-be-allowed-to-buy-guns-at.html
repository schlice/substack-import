Just as outside of the gun show, there are two types<br>of sellers: FFL dealers, and private sellers.<br><br>The same rules that apply outside of the gun show apply inside the gun<br>show.<br><br>- If you buy a gun from an FFL dealer, you will fill out a 4473 and you<br>  will have a background check performed through the NICS system before<br>  you can buy your firearm. You must follow all federal and state laws<br>  in the state where the transaction is taking place in order to<br>  purchase the gun. At a minimum, you must be 18 to buy a rifle and 21<br>  to buy a handgun.<br>- If you buy a gun from a non-FFL seller, it is considered a private<br>  sale, and federal law does not require a background check. Some states<br>  do require background checks for all sales, but most do not. All<br>  federal laws still apply to private sales.<br>- A FFL dealer is a FFL dealer whether he's in the gun show or not. He<br>  can't refuse to sell you a gun inside the gun show knowing that you'd<br>  fail your background check, and instead bring you out to his car, and<br>  conduct a private sale out of his trunk.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Why should a 13-year-old be allowed to buy guns at gun shows, as they<br>are currently allowed to do?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
