In the event<br>a hostile government arises, do they really think they could fight back<br>and not be annihilated?**<br><br>This has been answered so many times on Quora that I'm not going to give<br>you all the detailed answers again. I'll bullet them and leave it to you<br>to research this on Quora:<br><br>- Many in the military will not fight their own citizens<br>- Many in local law enforcement will not fight their own citizens<br>- [[Asymmetric<br>  warfare](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=3c3bcc&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymmetric_warfare){.external_link<br>  rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>  onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>  qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br>- The government will not annihilate its own people. It needs people to<br>  make money for it, so it can't kill them all.<br><br>If we've gotten to the point where the government is willing to kill one<br>third of the population, we're no longer America. That would be a sad<br>day indeed.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
