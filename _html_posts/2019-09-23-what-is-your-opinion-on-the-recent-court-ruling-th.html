<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What is your opinion on the recent court ruling that that has<br>essentially made it legal for women to be able to go topless in<br>Colorado, Kansas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Utah, and Wyoming?**<br><br>This case is interesting, and it highlights the changing landscape of<br>gender equality, and how courts are changing along with it.<br><br>First of all, specific to this ruling, a Fort Collins, Colorado<br>ordinance banning female toplessness (even though the state holds a less<br>restrictive view) was struck down in the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals<br>(which encompasses the six states in the title). Basically, in doing so,<br>it has stated that city bans on female toplessness in those six states<br>are unenforceable. Colorado allows public nudity as long as it is not<br>sexually oriented. Cities, however, previously enacted public nudity<br>bans against female toplessness.<br><br>The two women who sued were part of the "Free the Nipple" campaign,<br>which started on Instagram, which blocks the exposure of female breasts.<br>They argued that the 1st and 14th Amendments were violated here, as the<br>law restricted freedom of expression and unequally forced women to not<br>go topless while not having the same force against men, and the court<br>agreed.<br><br>The city argued, and it's not a trivial argument, that society is to<br>blame for the disparity. It is society, they argued, that has sexualized<br>the female breasts, and therefore female breasts are more analogous to<br>sex organs than to generic female body parts. The city still retains the<br>ability to restrict the public display of sex organs if it so chooses,<br>for the maintenance of the public decency and to avoid contributing to<br>the delinquency of children.<br><br>However, the court noted, we are in a new time, and how we interpret the<br>validity of many gender based laws "may in fact reflect 'archaic and<br>overbroad generalizations about gender' or 'outdated misconceptions<br>concerning the role of females in the home rather than in the<br>marketplace and world of ideas.' J.E.B., 511 U.S. at 135 (quoting<br>Schlesinger v. Ballard, 419 U.S. 498, 506-- 07 (1975), and Craig, 429<br>U.S. at 198--99)".<br><br>With this "new understanding" of how we judge "gender equality," laws<br>must be held to a much higher standard than they have been before. In<br>other words, things like outmoded societal standards (such as the one<br>sexualizing the female breast) no longer stand up in court, and the 14th<br>Amendment will apply in more cases than ever before.<br><br>This case illustrates how the court is changing along with society, and<br>as standards change, so too does the way we read and interpret the law.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
