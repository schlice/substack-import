<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Since we can impeach Trump as many times as we want, should we keep on<br>impeaching him until the Senate gets tired of us doing that so they will<br>reluctantly vote to remove Trump from office just so they won\'t have to<br>continue having hearings?**<br><br>That's a great plan.<br><br>I guarantee that the public will never get tired of House Democrats<br>accomplishing nothing other than little token pieces of legislation<br>while they spend GOBS of taxpayer dollars and waste valuable time in an<br>endless string of impeachment investigations.<br><br>I guarantee that none of those "at-risk Democrats" (i.e. Democrats who<br>won in 2018 in areas that Trump carried) will be voted out of office in<br>2020.<br><br>It's a foolproof plan. What could go wrong?<br><br>/sarc<br><br>My sarcasm aside, Democrats are already seeing public opinion turning<br>against the impeachment we have now. Independents are turning against<br>impeachment as the weeks drag on. Even as impeachment is being debated<br>by the entire House today (Dec 18, 2019), some Democrats are poised to<br>vote against at least one Article of Impeachment. Another impeachment<br>charade is not expected to change public opinion; in fact, if the<br>current trend of opinions towards impeachment continues, further<br>impeachments will progressively get more unpopular, further galvanizing<br>support for the President against impeachment, as well as threatening<br>the seats of at-risk Democrats in the House, and at worst, swing the<br>House back to Republican leadership.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
