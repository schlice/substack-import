<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Our school district will send automated messages via whatever method(s)<br>we choose: email, text message, and/or phone calls playing a<br>pre-recorded message. Based on the severity of the message, you can<br>choose how the message is delivered. For example, my routine messages<br>are only delivered by e-mail; urgent messages are delivered by all three<br>methods to ensure I don\'t miss them.<br><br>Ideally, if there was action required of the parents (something as<br>simple as school closing early because of weather, or as complex and<br>panic-inducing as schools closing early because of a bomb threat), the<br>school would already have a pick-up plan in place and parents would be<br>directed to that location.<br><br>Active shooter situations evolve much more quickly, but the response by<br>the school is the same: inform as much as possible, direct parents what<br>to do and what not to do.<br><br>For example, while the active shooter situation is ongoing:<br><br>\"This is a message from \<your_school_district\>. There is currently an<br>active incident at \<your_child\'s_school\> and we are evacuating<br>students at this time. Please DO NOT COME TO THE SCHOOL since we need to<br>minimize traffic to allow local law enforcement response. We will<br>contact you again shortly with a pick-up location.\"<br><br>Then, when the pick-up location has been determined:<br><br>\"This is a message from \<your_school_district\>. The students at<br>\<your_child\'s_school\> are being evacuated to \<evacuation_location\>.<br>Please report to this location now to pick up your child. Please do not<br>leave without ensuring that your child is accounted for.\"<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
