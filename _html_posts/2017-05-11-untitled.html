<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>This is the first time I've read this as well.<br><br>I was there in the room for the birth of all three of my boys. My oldest<br>son was born 21 years ago, and they had a segregated, sterile delivery<br>room, and then a "semi-private" LR room. My other two were all born in<br>LDR rooms. I agree wholeheartedly with your sentiment. So I was in my<br>scrubs when my son was born. I was actually mouth agape behind my mask<br>when my son was born, and I literally had to think about closing my<br>mouth in order to remember to take a picture. It was the most<br>awe-inspiring feeling I have ever felt. I never knew how deeply I could<br>love until I saw that one event.<br><br>(side note: I didn't cut any cords. I decided to let the doctor earn<br>their paychecks ;-)<br><br>And I cried like a baby throughout your story, with equal parts joy and<br>sorrow. Excellent writing, thanks for sharing.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/Do-fathers-really-need-to-be-in-the-delivery-room-during-the-birth-of-their-children-Is-there-really-any-need-for-them-to-do-so-Is-it-okay-to-choose-not-to-witness-it/answer/Rin-Sonier<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
