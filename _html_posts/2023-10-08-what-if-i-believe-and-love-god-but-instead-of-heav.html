<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>No.<br><br>And even worse, now that you know God and you love God, you can only<br>either believe in Him or reject Him. If you reject the God you know and<br>love, you doom yourself to hell.<br><br>Don't worry, your eternity will be as quiet and restful as you like. But<br>"returning to nothing" is not what we have as our eternal destiny.<br><br>If you love and believe God, then trust Him to give you exactly what you<br>need, exactly when you need it. And that even means when your day comes.<br>If you believe and love God, then you obey God as well.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
