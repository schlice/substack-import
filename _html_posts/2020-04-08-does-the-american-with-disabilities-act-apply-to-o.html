<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Does the American With Disabilities Act apply to OCD?<br><br>The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) does not specify the actual<br>conditions which it applies to. It simply defines what constitutes a<br>disability. It states that a person with a disability is "a person who<br>has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or<br>more major life activity." This includes people who have a record of<br>such an impairment, even if they do not currently have a disability. It<br>also includes individuals who do not have a disability but are regarded<br>as having a disability.<br><br>Therefore, if OCD "substantially limits one or more major life<br>activity," it would be covered. "Major life activities include, but are<br>not limited to, caring for oneself, performing manual tasks, seeing,<br>hearing, eating, sleeping, walking, standing, lifting, bending,<br>speaking, breathing, learning, reading, concentrating, thinking,<br>communicating, and working."\[1\](#tvUDN){#cite-tvUDN .citation_link}<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-tvUDN){.citation_index} [[The ADA Amendments Act of 2008<br>Frequently Asked<br>Questions](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=c2ae6d&url=https://www.dol.gov/agencies/ofccp/faqs/americans-with-disabilities-act-amendments){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="dol.gov"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
