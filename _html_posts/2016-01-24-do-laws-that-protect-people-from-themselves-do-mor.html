<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>In a free nation, people should have the right to do with themselves as<br>they choose, as long as what they do doesn\'t impact others.<br><br>Laws which do nothing but protect you from you are generally not in<br>keeping with the ideals of the nation. Examples would be adult<br>motorcycle helmet laws and adult seat belt laws, or laws which restrict<br>the size fountain drink you can buy to protect you from the bad effects<br>of sugar.<br><br>Those who say that such laws keep health costs low are attempting to<br>confuddle the issue. Everyone knows that for the most part, it\'s the<br>patient who pays his own healthcare costs unless the patient is unable<br>to pay, in which case it\'s not likely the patient would have a car or a<br>motorcycle. If the patient has insurance, then the people who pay for<br>that insurance (usually the patient\'s employer) should be the ones<br>taking issue with your lifestyle, since they are the ones who have to<br>pay the bulk of your medical costs. These would be issues for healthcare<br>payors to handle, not the government through law. Indeed, many<br>healthcare payors (employers) are offering incentives to their employees<br>for making healthy lifestyle choices, and offering discounts on things<br>like health club memberships and promoting weight loss and monitoring<br>your \"numbers\" (i.e. frequent biometric screenings).<br><br>Many things can be legislated, but there are similarly many things that<br>shouldn\'t be legislated.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
