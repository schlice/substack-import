<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>There's an argument to be made that revenue customers have priority over<br>non-revenue customers (passengers with tickets paid with points, or<br>passengers flying on passes).<br><br>But by the same token, non-employees have priority over employees.<br>Every. Time.<br><br>That's just poor customer service, regardless of what the policy says.<br><br>The people who ran the Nazi death camps for Hitler also said, "it's<br>written in the policy, so that's how we have to do it" and look where it<br>got *them*.<br><br>We seem to have created a world where common sense is actually uncommon,<br>and using it will cause you to lose your job. Well, I feel bad for those<br>airport employees because they're losing their jobs either way.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
