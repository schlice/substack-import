<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Can I build my own custom firearm?<br><br>My kids ask me, "can I have a cookie?" I answer them, "I'm certain you<br>can. Your hands work, and if you get a cookie, they will be able to<br>direct that cookie into your mouth, and last I checked, your mouth still<br>works."<br><br>At which point they roll their eyes at me and then grudgingly say,<br>"*may* I have a cookie?" And then after a short pause, I'll say,<br>"yes you may."<br><br>Back to the question:<br><br>*Can* you build your own custom firearm? The answer is it<br>depends on how much skill you have at gunsmithing. As [[Terry<br>Baird](https://www.quora.com/profile/Terry-Baird-9)]{.qlink_container}<br>mentioned, the AR platform is one of the most customizable rifle<br>platforms on the planet, and with all sorts of replacements and<br>attachments, you can build a really incredible custom firearm with a<br>limited amount of gunsmithing knowledge.<br><br>*May* you build your own custom firearm? The answer is<br>generally-speaking, yes, depending on which state you live in. That<br>said, whether you buy or build, in the end, you will have a functioning<br>firearm, and that firearm is subject to all of the laws surrounding the<br>firearm in question where you live.<br><br>One thing you cannot do in any state is build a functioning<br>*automatic* firearm, since that is restricted under federal law. An<br>automatic firearm is one which fires more than one bullet with one<br>trigger pull. No automatic firearms which have been built since 1986 can<br>be registered by civilians.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
