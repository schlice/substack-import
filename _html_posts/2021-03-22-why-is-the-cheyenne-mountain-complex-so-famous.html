It was called the "WOPR" (pronounced "whopper"). I think it was<br>every other tour group that I took into the Mountain which asked to see<br>the WOPR. Most of them actually were asking in jest. Most.<br><br>*Editor's Note: It is virtually impossible to hack into NORAD's<br>computers, because they are not on the Internet. We do operate some<br>Internet-facing websites, but the actual processing systems are not<br>connected to the Internet. There are also no dial-up lines into the<br>NORAD processing systems, like in the movie.*<br><br>*Dr. Strangelove* featured military people inside Cheyenne Mountain<br>trying to save the world.<br><br>One of my favorite TV series, *Stargate: SG-1* starring Richard Dean<br>Anderson (and co-starring the late great Don S. Davis, who every single<br>one of us Air Force guys would have loved to have as a commander) was<br>set in a sub-basement of Cheyenne Mountain. I'm actually in the process<br>of re-watching SG-1; I'm on Season 3.<br><br>*Editor's Note: there are no sub-basements below Cheyenne Mountain.*<br><br>The one that really stands out to me, though, is the *Terminator* series<br>of movies. The main electronic protagonist of that movie was a computer<br>system called Skynet. In actuality, Skynet was the original codename of<br>the NORAD Computer System (NCS) which actually did air detection and<br>correlation of radar data, since the Mountain was built in the 50s.<br><br>Okay, war story alert: I was stationed at NORAD from 1996 to 1999. We<br>were in the middle of a massive upgrade, removing the aforementioned<br>aging NCS system and replacing it with the most wonderfully-acronymed<br>system: CCPDS-R (Correlation Center Processing and Display Subsystem -<br>Replacement).<br><br>The date came for the decommissioning of NCS (which, as was previously<br>mentioned, was codenamed "Skynet"). Anyone want to venture a guess as to<br>the date they chose to decommission NCS?<br><br>Yep, you guessed it: August 29, 1997. ***The very same day that<br>Skynet was shut down in the Terminator movies, the same day that Skynet<br>became self-aware.***<br><br>I was there, in Core Processing inside Cheyenne Mountain, on August 29,<br>1997. We were all in the central administration area, where the main<br>processors (each the size of a refrigerator) were all facing. We were<br>playing the theme song to *2001: A Space Odyssey* in the background. The<br>generals were all there to do the honors. One by one, they powered off<br>the main processors, and the disk packs behind them (a row of washing<br>machine-sized disk drives) slowly started to spin down over the course<br>of about a minute. The silence in that room, following that process, was<br>deafening.<br><br>And every one of us *Terminator* geeks were literally holding our<br>breaths, waiting for NCS to become self-aware and turn itself back on.<br>Seriously, like half of us who were in that room were there because we<br>really weren't sure that when we turned it off, it would stay off. True<br>story.<br><br>Moral of the story: NCS did not turn itself back on. And those disk<br>packs, which had been running for decades, actually spun on ball<br>bearings; once they spun down and sat there for about a minute or so,<br>they would have completely seized up and would never have spun again. We<br>had to relay that message throughout the crowd so they could literally<br>rest assured that there was no way the system was going to come back to<br>life. Also true story.<br><br>I received one of the power buttons from NCS:<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-4decd33f6c6eb39d83e7d7fa049f232b){.portrait .qtext_image<br>.zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-4decd33f6c6eb39d83e7d7fa049f232b"<br>master_w="6936" master_h="9248"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Why is the Cheyenne Mountain Complex so famous?<br><br>\<br><br>(EDIT) Wow, 2k upvotes, thank you! In honor of your support, I'll pass<br>on a little bit of trivia about the Mountain.<br><br>- The complex is actually made up of 15 individual steel buildings: 13<br>  3-story buildings, and 2 2-story buildings.<br>- The facility is not built inside a massive open cavern; the tunnels<br>  for the buildings were individually dug and the buildings constructed<br>  inside the tunnels. It was a truly joint project: the Army Corps of<br>  Engineers dug out the tunnels, Navy SeeBees built the buildings, and<br>  the facility is hosted and operated by the Air Force. The mission is<br>  carried out by the combined US-Canadian command NORAD.\<br>  \<br>  (UPDATE): The facility is now run by the Space Force. Go figure.<br>- The granite removed from the tunnels was used as the base for the<br>  parking lot.<br>- The buildings are physically separated from each other but are all<br>  electrically connected and grounded together.<br>- The buildings are not resting on the ground; instead they rest on a<br>  series of 1300 springs. Each spring is about .5 ton. The buildings can<br>  bounce and sway on the springs, and can move approximately one foot in<br>  any direction. The idea is to absorb any seismic activity without<br>  affecting operations. All water, air, and electrical conduits between<br>  buildings is made of flex conduit to allow for the buildings to move<br>  independently of each other.<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-ccd05065f1e60933ff2f922d6dca304e){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-ccd05065f1e60933ff2f922d6dca304e" master_w="512"<br>master_h="384"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>- - Interestingly, when we decommissioned NCS and removed the processors<br>    and disk packs, the building got so light that the springs pushed it<br>    out of position relative to the other buildings around it. The ramps<br>    connecting the two buildings were then off, and people and carts<br>    were having difficulty traversing the gap. Engineers had to go under<br>    the building and individually re-tension the springs to fix the<br>    issue.<br>- The complex is powered by commercial power from Colorado Springs, but<br>  we have backup power delivered by six diesel generators, the kind that<br>  power locomotives:<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-7c970bea8a799b1b05142ad1683adef2){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-7c970bea8a799b1b05142ad1683adef2" master_w="980"<br>master_h="649"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-287bf68073530016b83e2e8ae6d97052){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-287bf68073530016b83e2e8ae6d97052" master_w="630"<br>master_h="503"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-5778c5ba2e3c784fb731684c220e32ce){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-5778c5ba2e3c784fb731684c220e32ce" master_w="978"<br>master_h="650"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>- Each generator is capable of generating 2.5 MW of power, and four<br>  generators can support full operations within the facility. Normally,<br>  we run on full commercial power to save diesel fuel (we have a 500,000<br>  gallon diesel tank carved into the rock), but any time there is<br>  lightning within 5 nautical miles of the Mountain, we put two<br>  generators on line and tie them in with the commercial power.<br>- The power lines feed a bank of batteries comprising one of the largest<br>  uninterruptible power systems (UPS) in the US. The UPS only has enough<br>  juice to run the Mountain for about 15 minutes, but it's really only<br>  there to smooth the transition between commercial and diesel should we<br>  have a catastrophic commercial power loss. The batteries are connected<br>  only to the A bus, which is where the critical systems receive their<br>  power. Ancillary systems run off of the B bus.<br>- We have five lakes inside the mountain. One holds the aforementioned<br>  diesel fuel, one holds 1.5 million gallons of drinking water, and<br>  three hold 1.5 million gallons of industrial water (a total of 4.5<br>  million gallons of industrial water) used for the cooling towers to<br>  remove heat from the facility, and for fire suppression.<br>- Interestingly, heat is a negative cost as the facility uses the heat<br>  generated by people and machines to heat the inside of the facility.<br>  The facility only needs to be cooled.<br>- Water is also a negative cost as they discovered a natural spring<br>  during construction which provides all the water needed for the<br>  facility.<br><br>Let me know if you have any other questions about the facility. It is<br>still in operation today, by the way.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
