It requires the last owner of<br>the device to log in to their Google account in order to complete the<br>factory reset.<br><br>Additionally, the previous owner can go into their own Google profile on<br>the web and delete the device from their recently used devices. This<br>will also clear out the FRP if you are having difficulty doing this<br>on-device.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
