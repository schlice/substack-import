Your employer can<br>"force" you by requiring you to do so, and then firing you if you fail<br>to do so (i.e. you get pulled over and are given a citation for failing<br>to wear a seat belt).<br><br>I mean, they can't really "force" you to wear your seat belt. However,<br>they can condition your continued employment on you not being pulled<br>over for a seat belt violation.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
