<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**The current Trump administration seems to be testing the powers of the<br>Executive branch, but this all seems to be precedent instead of actual<br>law. Why do you think these powers and their limits have not been<br>accurately portrayed through written laws?**<br><br>They don't need to be in written laws. They're inbuilt into the<br>Constitution. It's called the system of *checks and balances.*<br><br>As James Madison explained in Federalist No. 51: \"the great security<br>against a gradual concentration of the several powers in the same<br>department, consists in giving to those who administer each department<br>the necessary constitutional means and personal motives to resist<br>encroachments of the others. \\...\ Ambition must be made to<br>counteract ambition.\"<br><br>The founders worried greatly that the executive would become nothing<br>more than a puppet for the legislature. To counter this concern, the<br>Executive branch was designed with a unitary Executive in whom the full<br>power of law enforcement and prosecution is vested. Additionally, the<br>Department of Justice *works for the Executive Branch*, and ultimately,<br>directly for the President. And this doesn't mean that the Attorney<br>General is the President's "lap dog." But it does mean that the DOJ<br>follows the President's lawful orders, as well as assisting with<br>implementing his policies through lawful enforcement.<br><br>The legislature is limited in what it can do if it believes that another<br>branch is exceeding its authority: it can defund that agency, or it can<br>impeach appointed Federal officers. This is its check against an<br>out-of-control Executive.<br><br>The legislature seems to believe that they are "FBI-lite," and they can<br>use their oversight power to investigate alleged criminal behavior.<br>Spoilers: they can't. The legislature's oversight power is directly<br>related to Federal agencies complying with the laws that the legislature<br>writes. If the legislature becomes aware of another branch of government<br>violating the law, they are required to immediately report that<br>information to a Federal Attorney (usually in the DC District) or to the<br>Attorney General. The FBI does not work for them, and they are not<br>tooled to investigate criminal activity. But they've all got it in their<br>heads that they're going to uncover the next Watergate, so they keep<br>pushing.<br><br>This is why it appears that the Executive is pushing back when it never<br>had to do so in the past. It only does so in response to unprecedented<br>pushes by the legislature.<br><br>Regardless, this "constitutional crisis" legislators incessantly whine<br>that we are involved in is nothing of the sort. There is no crisis. The<br>friction between the three co-equal branches of US government is not a<br>bug, but a feature.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
