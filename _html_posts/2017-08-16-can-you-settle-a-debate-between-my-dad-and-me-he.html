<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>You are right about double jeopardy. The right against double jeopardy<br>protects Mr. Simpson from being tried again in a criminal court for the<br>same crime. Even if a video was discovered which clearly showed him<br>killing his wife and her friend, he could not be re-tried in the<br>criminal court.<br><br>There are indeed limitations on double jeopardy. It only attaches to<br>criminal trials, and it does not preclude subsequent civil suits for the<br>same complaint. Our friend OJ was acquitted of the murder, but he was<br>subsequently sued in civil court for, and found guilty of, wrongful<br>death. Also, "double jeopardy" only attaches if you were in "jeopardy"<br>the first time.<br><br>In this specific case, OJ cannot be re-tried for the same murder for<br>which he has already been acquitted. Jeopardy attached, and the jury's<br>acquittal terminated jeopardy. Once jeopardy is terminated for that<br>crime at that location, it cannot be re-attached, including through the<br>introduction of new evidence, or even through reversible error of the<br>court.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
