<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: [It\'s okay, I can understand the confusion.\<br>\<br>You have two options here: pursuing criminal assault charges (as you<br>were criminally assaulted), or pursuing civil assault-and-battery<br>charges.\<br>\<br>If you choose to go the criminal route, you are hoping that the police<br>will find and arrest the person who assaulted you. After being convicted<br>of assault, he will be put in jail for a minimum of one year (as felony<br>assault carries a minimum of one year in jail), and will be forced to<br>pay court costs and your medical fees. To go the criminal route, you<br>visit the police station and ask to report an assault. You\'ll go<br>through the same process that I detailed in my original answer, and<br>you\'ll be interviewed by the detectives, who will talk to you about the<br>case, what happened, and any evidence you have, including what you\'ve<br>already discussed with your chiropractor. The detectives will take it<br>from there. Your \"attorney\" will be a lawyer from the District<br>Attorney\'s office, if they choose to arrest him and press charges. If<br>they find him but they don\'t charge him, you can still take your case<br>file from the police to a personal injury attorney\...\<br>\<br>\...to aid you in a civil court case. Filing in civil court is not about<br>arresting someone for a crime. The civil court route is only interested<br>in seeking damages (in the form of money) for what was done to you: pain<br>and suffering, and medical expenses. Assault is both a crime and a civil<br>tort. You don\'t have insurance; why should you be forced to pay for all<br>of those expenses out-of-pocket, when he\'s the one who unlawfully<br>attacked you, unprovoked? He should be held to account for his actions.<br>As I mentioned, if you don\'t want to charge him and send him to jail,<br>you can simply seek the advice of a personal injury attorney in your<br>area. If they find him and can file court documents against him, he will<br>have to appear in court and can be held accountable for his actions. He<br>may be forced to pay your medical expenses and a reasonable amount for<br>the pain and suffering that you had to go through during this whole<br>ordeal.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/What-is-involved-in-filing-a-police-report-What-can-I-expect-from-the-detectives-or-from-the-police-department/answer/Bill-Stein<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
