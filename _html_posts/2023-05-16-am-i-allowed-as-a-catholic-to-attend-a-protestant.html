<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>My apologies, but to everyone who says you can't share in the communion<br>meal at a Protestant mass, they are indeed highly mistaken. This may<br>differ for some Protestant denominations, but for the vast majority of<br>us, it is simply not true.<br><br>One of the major differences between Catholicism and Protestantism is<br>the idea that Protestants believe that the Last Supper was *symbolic*.<br>It was a parable, just like Jesus had been teaching throughout His<br>entire earthly ministry. The bread is not Jesus' *actual* body. The wine<br>is not Jesus' *actual* blood. When Jesus did this, He was creating a new<br>tradition: **every time you eat this bread together, remember my body,<br>broken for you. Every time you drink this cup together, remember my<br>blood, poured out for you.**<br><br>So as a baptized believer in Christ, you are welcome to share the "meal"<br>with us (such that it is --- we either get those little "Jesus<br>Chicklets" of bread and the little cup of grape juice, or we get the two<br>conveniently pre-packaged in one little dual-lidded cup)<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-ad089c7638833894af98ccb851bcafac){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-ad089c7638833894af98ccb851bcafac" master_w="620"<br>master_h="413"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>*(Jesus Chicklets and grape juice cups)*<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-64df0ba11dd6dcb0d222594e82798789){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-64df0ba11dd6dcb0d222594e82798789"<br>master_w="3802" master_h="2000"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>*(Same thing, but in one pre-loaded dual-lid cup)*<br><br>Even the "meal" is symbolic. It's not really much of a "meal," is it.<br><br>We do ask that only believers partake in communion. A believer is<br>someone who believes that Christ is indeed their Lord and Savior. It is<br>a special time for us, a time consecrated by Jesus for us to *commune*<br>with Him and with each other, so it is reserved for Christ-followers.<br><br>But as I have said before, even practicing Catholics can be believers<br>(and most are). So please, come, listen to the message. Share fellowship<br>with us. Sing to God. You don't even have to sing well. And make sure<br>you say hi. I love to meet new people in church.<br><br>\<br><br>That said, the inverse is not true. A Protestant cannot receive Holy<br>Communion at a Catholic Mass. You must be a practicing Catholic who has<br>received the Sacrament of Communion before you may receive the elements<br>at a Mass.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
