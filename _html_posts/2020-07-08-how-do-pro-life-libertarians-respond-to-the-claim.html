<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**How do pro-life libertarians respond to the claim that the baby does<br>not have a contract with the mother to be on her property, and as such<br>the mother is allowed to \"evict\" the child if she sees fit to do so?**<br><br>The claim is ridiculous on its face. Children under the age of 18 (in<br>most states) are unable to enter into contracts, so there would never be<br>a way for a baby to legally be present inside a mother's body. A<br>mother's body is not a room for rent. It is a place where babies can<br>grow.<br><br>Additionally, the baby didn't choose to be there; you chose to host the<br>baby there. The mother agreed to host the baby in their body at the time<br>that she consented to sex. Because consenting to sex also implies<br>consenting to the possible side-effects of sex (some might call them the<br>actual reasons we have sex in the first place, but whatever) which<br>include creating a baby and having it live in your body for nine months.<br>Clearly, this is not true when the mother is raped, as she did not<br>consent to any of the possible side-effects of sex. Even pro-life<br>libertarians are willing to be reasonable in this case because of this<br>logic.<br><br>You cannot disclaim consent to pregnancy by saying that you used birth<br>control. Birth control is not 100% effective, so using it implies that<br>you take on the risk of pregnancy, and taking on the risk of pregnancy<br>implies that you consent to all conditions of that, because you cannot<br>consent to the risk of pregnancy without consenting to the conditions<br>which come with that. So even using birth control is not foolproof. The<br>only 100% effective birth control is abstinence. If you get pregnant<br>while abstinent, you shouldn't be talking to the doctor, but the priest.<br><br>But *contracts*? That's a legal thing, and minors lack the capacity to<br>enter into contracts, so the argument analytically false.<br><br>\<br><br>*Sorry, no comments on this one.*<br><br>*If you don\'t like what I wrote, tough shit. If my answer is<br>grammatically low-quality or is un-cited opinion masquerading as fact,<br>downvote it. If you think I\'m wrong, write your own answer. But Quora<br>is a question-and-answer site, not a debate site. If you were simply<br>going to comment to tell me \"ackshually, you\'re wrong,\" then you're<br>the reason why I disable comments. Well done, Karen. You ruined it for<br>everyone.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
