<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>First of all, the answer to any legal question is "it depends."<br><br>Secondly, in the vast, vast majority of cases, there is never "proof"<br>that a man is the father of a child. Paternity tests are not mandatory<br>when a woman has a child. For example, when a man and a woman are<br>married, there is a *presumption* that the man is the father of the<br>woman's child. The paternity test is the *exception*, not the *rule.*<br><br>Child support is handled on a state-by-state level. And in nearly all<br>states, **a non biological parent can indeed be ordered by a court to<br>pay child support.**<br><br>Since I'm in Florida, I'll use that as the example. There are different<br>legal definitions of fathers in the state of Florida (and in many other<br>states as well). They are:<br><br>- Presumptive Father: A presumption of fatherhood is established if a<br>  minor child is born during the marriage.<br>- Putative Father: A unmarried man who claims to be the biological<br>  father of a minor child, or the mother claims that he is the<br>  biological father.<br>- Prospective Father: If the man was living with the mother at the time<br>  of conception, was married to the mother at the time of conception, is<br>  identified on the birth certificate as the father, or is named in an<br>  application for government assistance as the father.<br><br>The type of father you are determines the conditions under which you<br>have to pay child support in Florida.<br><br>- Presumptive fathers will be ordered to pay child support and will<br>  receive visitation.<br>- Putative and prospective fathers will be ordered to pay child support<br>  and will not receive visitation. To get visitation, the father must<br>  file a Petition To Determine Paternity and Related Relief. But by<br>  doing so, you submit yourself to the courts and admit that you are the<br>  father.<br><br>If you don't want to pay child support because you are not any of the<br>above fathers, you must prove this by filing a Petition To Disestablish<br>Paternity. There are some conditions to the filing of that petition;<br>your attorney can help you with that.<br><br>\<br><br>*This answer is not legal advice, nor is it a substitute for legal<br>advice, nor is it a solicitation to offer legal advice.
