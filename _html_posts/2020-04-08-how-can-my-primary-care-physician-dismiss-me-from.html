What about the American With Disabilities Act?**<br><br>Hi<br>[Mary(https://www.quora.com/profile/Mary-Vaughan-17)]{.qlink_container},<br>thanks for your question.<br><br>The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) specifically addresses<br>disabilities. The ADA defines a person with a disability as "a<br>person who has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits<br>one or more major life activities." This includes people who have a<br>record of such an impairment, even if they do not currently have a<br>disability. It also includes individuals who do not have a disability<br>but are regarded as having a disability (or people who are perceived by<br>others as having a disability).<br><br>Unless you, and others, categorize your condition as a "disability," you<br>are not covered by ADA.<br><br>That said, this doesn't mean you are without legal recourse.<br><br>In the United States, most employment is "at will," which means either<br>you or your employer can terminate the working relationship for any<br>reason, or no reason at all, so long as it is legally permissible. So<br>let's talk about legal permissibility. When you quit, this is called<br>*voluntary termination* and when you are fired, this is called<br>*involuntary termination.* There are two types of involuntary<br>termination.<br><br>- When your employer gives you no reason for your termination (i.e.<br>  "thanks, but we no longer need you here"), unless there is some<br>  documented issue which was the unspoken "cause" for your termination,<br>  this is called an *involuntary termination without cause*, and is<br>  generally legally permissible These would be things like downsizing<br>  and general layoffs.<br>- When you are fired for a specific reason, this is called<br>  *involuntarily termination with cause*, and the cause must still be a<br>  lawful reason. This generally is for things like violating policy,<br>  disrupting the workplace, and similar reasons. This should be the last<br>  step in a progressive disciplinary action plan which should be well<br>  documented.<br><br>In your case, you were terminated because you have a health condition<br>(not necessarily a disability). This is generally considered termination<br>for cause. In most circumstances, this is only valid if your condition<br>prevents you from performing the essential elements of the job with or<br>without reasonable accommodations. Also, if your condition is<br>contagious, or your condition causes you to risk the health and safety<br>of others, it can be grounds for termination.<br><br>I would strongly suggest you contact a licensed attorney in your area<br>who specializes in employment law. You have a unique set of<br>circumstances, and there may be legal remedy here. A lawyer can help you<br>sort out your options.<br><br>\<br><br>*This answer is not a substitute for professional legal advice.

Seek the advice of a licensed attorney in the<br>appropriate jurisdiction before taking any action that may affect your<br>rights. If you believe you have a claim against someone, consult an<br>attorney immediately, otherwise there is a risk that the time allotted<br>to bring your claim may expire.*<br><br>*Quora users who provide responses to legal questions are intended<br>third-party beneficiaries with certain rights under Quora\'s* [[*Terms<br>of Service*](https://www.quora.com/about/tos)]{.qlink_container}*.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
