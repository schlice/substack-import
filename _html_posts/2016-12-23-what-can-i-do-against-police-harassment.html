<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>If you ever believe that police conduct is improper, it is up to you to<br>report that behavior. You have several options.<br><br>1.  You can go down to the local police department in question and file<br>    a complaint. Be aware that you will have to identify yourself and<br>    give real personal information (name, address, phone number, SSN in<br>    some jurisdictions, etc), and provide a written affidavit.<br>    Investigators will question you. It seems a bit intimidating, but it<br>    is necessary.<br>2.  If you don't get anywhere with the local department, your best next<br>    step is to go to your local media. Most local TV stations have a<br>    "Call for Action" hotline. Call them, tell them your story. They<br>    will make some phone calls on your behalf to the department in<br>    question. If your complaint didn't get any traction, the local media<br>    sniffing around for a story may prod them into action. You will<br>    either hear something being done, or you will clearly hear why the<br>    department believes nothing needs to be done.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
