<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>How has MS changed me for the worse? Well, let's see. I lost my<br>commission in the Air Force and am now a disabled veteran. That's not<br>necessarily a bad thing on its own, except that I "wasn't done." I<br>wasn't ready to be done serving (and I'm still not). After I started my<br>injectable MS medication, I developed depression, which made me a very<br>bitter and angry person. I started on the "side-effect shuffle" where I<br>took one medication which came with a side effect, and I took a second<br>medication or supplement to treat that side effect, and it came with its<br>own side effect, etc. At one point, I was swallowing upwards of nine<br>pills a day, which didn't do anything to help my depression.<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-cd8121d4fae1b6cdbf05bab5f7f2422a){.portrait .qtext_image<br>.zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-cd8121d4fae1b6cdbf05bab5f7f2422a"<br>master_w="2988" master_h="5312"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>*Taste the rainbow!*<br><br>The damage from doing all of that was profound and affected me more than<br>the MS did, which just fed my depression.<br><br>It took me more than ten years to realize that Western medicine's plan<br>wasn't working when it came to my *overall* health, as opposed to the<br>treatment of my MS. My MS was well-controlled, but my overall health<br>suffered. I will always be grateful that my MS drugs were there when I<br>was diagnosed, as I firmly believe that the amount of disability I have<br>(which is currently very small) is due in large part to the fact that I<br>started MS drugs within six months of my diagnosis, and that was 13<br>years ago. After developing a nasty kidney stone from at least one, if<br>not two, of those pills in that picture working together to do me in, I<br>knew I needed a change. I added a naturalist doctor to my care team, and<br>with his help, we swept all of those pills away (with the exception of<br>the Gilenya, my MS medicine, the white/yellow capsule in the lower<br>right), and we are undoing all of the damage which was done over the<br>last 10 years and beyond. It's a slow process (I took nearly 20 years to<br>get there, I could give him at least a year to undo the damage done,<br>right?) but we are making progress, and it is visible and it is very,<br>very encouraging.<br><br>So has MS changed me for the better? After going through everything I<br>went through to get here, I can say that now, even with MS, I'm in<br>better health than I was even before I developed the disease. Going<br>through depression forced me to deal with some deep-seated issues in my<br>life that I hadn't dealt with up to that point, and I feel like I'm a<br>better man now because of it. My pride and my arrogance was getting in<br>the way of my personal growth. It's just too bad that it took MS and<br>depression to move past those. I'm now realizing all that I *can* do<br>with MS and I'm working around the things that I struggle with. I'm<br>closer to my family, and I believe I am happier, too. I'm finally coming<br>to grips with, and feeling more content with, the changes in my life.<br>That will become very important in being able to effectively deal with<br>the changes to come. MS is unpredictable, so being better prepared now<br>to deal with the changes in the future will go a long way to making<br>those changes more bearable.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
