<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The short answer is that it is lawful to prohibit police from activating<br>their BWCs unless they are actively responding to a call for service, or<br>have engaged in an incident. The civil rights organizations feel that<br>it's dangerous for police to be able to record everything, because that<br>feels too much like a "police state" and that the video can be used<br>against honest citizens taking part in Constitutionally-protected<br>activity.<br><br>Those same civil rights organizations will have to reap what they sow<br>when the police videos presented at trial do not contain any of the<br>"lead-up" details before an incident, the very things that those same<br>privacy advocates wanted police to have BWCs for in the first place. The<br>BWC will only be activated when an officer engages in a call or is<br>responding to a call.<br><br>You can see an incident, but if you don't see what happened *before* the<br>incident, you don't see the justification for the use of force recorded.<br>This means that you must fall back to traditional jurisprudence in order<br>to determine whether or not the use of force was lawful, and the BWC<br>itself becomes less efficient. So depending on the local ordinances and<br>the timing of the officer engagement, it is possible that some of the<br>lead-up to the incident may not be recorded.<br><br>A jurisdiction is well within its rights to limit police in this way.<br>They must understand, however, that there are consequences to such laws.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
