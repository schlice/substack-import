<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The Bible tells us what it sounds like.<br><br>It was recorded in Acts 2, after the apostles were given the gift of the<br>Holy Spirit. The apostles shared the gospel with the crowds, speaking to<br>them in their own languages. The crowds were amazed: "We hear them<br>declaring the wonders of God in our own tongues!" (Acts 2:11). The Greek<br>word translated "tongues" literally means "languages." Therefore, the<br>gift of tongues is speaking in a language the speaker has never learned<br>in order to minister to someone who does speak that language.<br><br>Imagine this: a room full of people from all over the world. Spanish,<br>French, German, Russian, Korean, Japanese, Polish, Nordic people, all<br>represented in the room. Then one person gets up and starts speaking.<br>***But everyone, from every country, could understand what he was<br>saying, in his own native language.***<br><br>This is what "speaking in tongues" looks like. It means speaking in<br>languages that the speaker never learned to communicate God's Word to<br>people who do not speak their language.<br><br>Anything else that you may have heard of being related to speaking in<br>tongues is nonsense and is unbiblical. Incoherent babble is exactly<br>that: *incoherent*. Speaking in tongues was speaking in a language that<br>everyone could understand. If you hear something and you don't<br>understand it, you are not hearing speaking in tongues.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
