<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Because of the design of the reader, you can't get a smartphone to<br>directly communicate with the magnetic strip. Samsung's MST (Magnetic<br>Secure Transfer) won't work with today's card readers.<br><br>So there are a few solutions:<br><br>1.  Add an external reader to the pump that will accept NFC. Any<br>    smartphone that supports NFC-based payment systems (Apple Pay,<br>    Android Pay, etc) can then be used at the pump. The smartphone would<br>    be initially scanned and the pump would place a hold (probably about<br>    \$50) on the card. Once the transaction is complete, the hold would<br>    clear and the actual charge would be made.<br>2.  Implement a cloud-based solution where the pump and the smartphone<br>    connect to the same portal, and the payment is authorized to the<br>    card on file. When the user scans the QR code, the pump is<br>    authorized. At the conclusion of the dispense, the payment on file<br>    gets charged.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
