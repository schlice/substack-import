For brevity, here\'s the summary:\<br>\<br>]<br><br>> Overall, the teenagers in the sample had a median age at first sex of<br>> 16.9 years. Black males had the lowest observed median (15.0), and<br>> Asian American males the highest (18.1); white and Hispanic males, and<br>> white and black females, reported similar ages (about 16.5 years).<br>> Hispanic and Asian American females had rates of first sex about half<br>> that of white females, although these protective effects were<br>> explained by differences in family structure. Even after controlling<br>> for background characteristics, black males had rates of first sex<br>> that were about 3-5 times the rates of the other gender-and-ethnicity<br>> groups. In addition, Asian American males were less likely than<br>> Hispanic males to be sexually experienced, and Hispanic males had<br>> almost twice the rates of sexual activity of Hispanic females.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
