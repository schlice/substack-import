<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Why is it so hard to prosecute a US president?<br><br>The power of prosecution was vested in a single, unitary president. All<br>prosecutorial authority in this country flows from that one person. This<br>is part of the *system of checks and balances* in the US. The singular<br>authority over the Executive Branch vested in one person is a hedge<br>against the power of the Congress.<br><br>To that end, you cannot prosecute a sitting president. That person<br>controls all prosecutions, and so cannot be prosecuted.<br><br>*So does that mean the President is above the law?*<br><br>Of course not. The Constitution provides a method to deal with<br>presidents who may break the law: ***impeachment and removal from<br>office***.<br><br>Once that president has left office (either through impeachment or at<br>the natural end of his or her term), they are once again subject to<br>prosecution.<br><br>And before you ask, since the president cannot be prosecuted while in<br>office, the statute of limitations is *tolled* (or paused) while in<br>office. The clock starts again the day the new president is sworn in.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
