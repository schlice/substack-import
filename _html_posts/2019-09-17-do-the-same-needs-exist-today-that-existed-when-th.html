<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Do the same needs exist today that existed when the 2nd Amendment was<br>written to the extent that it is still necessary?**<br><br>I'm going to edit my answer.<br><br>I think the first thing you have to do is identify what exactly was the<br>"need" that drove the creation of the 2nd Amendment.<br><br>People who did not study Constitutional Law probably think the<br>*ONLY* need is the one that is listed in the prefatory clause<br><br>> *A well-regulated militia, necessary to the security of a free State*<br><br>That was indeed one of the needs which existed at the time of the<br>drafting of the 2nd Amendment.<br><br>BUT DON'T BE FOOLED! IT'S NOT THE ONLY ONE!!!<br><br>We need only look to the writings of the Founders to see that. James<br>Madison postulated that because the American people were armed, they<br>would be almost impossible to subdue through military force, even if one<br>assumed that the federal government would try to use an army to do so.<br>In *Federalist* No. 46, he wrote:<br><br>> Besides the advantage of being armed, which the Americans possess over<br>> the people of almost every other nation, the existence of subordinate<br>> governments, to which the people are attached and by which the militia<br>> officers are appointed, forms a barrier against the enterprises of<br>> ambition, more insurmountable than any which a simple government of<br>> any form can admit of. Notwithstanding the military establishments in<br>> the several kingdoms of Europe, which are carried as far as the public<br>> resources will bear, the governments are afraid to trust the people<br>> with arms. And it is not certain that with this aid alone they would<br>> not be able to shake off their yokes.<br><br>But most important was the right to self-defense. The framers saw this<br>right to be preeminent among all the other needs for a Second Amendment.<br>The Constitution was built on the idea of natural rights and the Natural<br>Law as espoused by men like Blackstone, and they saw the right to defend<br>oneself as the premier natural right. From this natural right, you can<br>infer many other rights, for both the individual and for the group, but<br>the most closely related to this right is the right to arms. The<br>Founders saw the rights of individual arms possession and resistance,<br>and of collective revolution where necessary, as aspects of the right to<br>self-defense. They also saw that the widespread possession of arms by<br>the people would be a powerful deterrent to both political and<br>non-political crime.\[1\](#HXGQV){#cite-HXGQV .citation_link} To that<br>end, the 2nd Amendment was codified, but with what prefatory clause?<br>There were so many reasons why we needed an individual right to keep and<br>bear arms, but which one to choose? Records indicate that this<br>particular prefatory phrase was used because it was the most<br>understandable by the people of that time (they had just finished a<br>personal armed insurrection against the British), and so they would most<br>readily understand that terminology. The prefatory phrase, however, does<br>not limit the operative phrase, because the one scenario pointed out in<br>the prefatory phrase is not the only reason the Amendment was written.<br>The self-defense aspect was seen as nearly universally understood, so<br>they thought it pointless to include it in the text of the Amendment.<br><br>Nevertheless, the point here is that the *right* of self-defense (and<br>therefore the right to possess arms in furtherance of that self-defense)<br>is a right which predates the Constitution. That's the thing about<br>rights. They don't turn on *need*. They exist, whether or not you may<br>need them at that time. Rights existed before government. Government<br>doesn't grant or deny rights based on need. Governments are restricted<br>from infringing on rights for any reason, including whether or not you<br>may think any one particular person *needs* that right.<br><br>However, if enough of the country agrees that the 2nd Amendment is no<br>longer needed and personal firearms ownership is an antiquity of the<br>past (i.e. I'm perfectly safe walking down any city street at any time<br>of the day or night in any city in any state in the US, and I have no<br>need for personal protection), then they can repeal that amendment. They<br>simply ratify another one and it says "The Second Amendment is hereby<br>repealed."<br><br>Simple. Except not at all.<br><br>The trick is that you have to get two thirds of the Congress and three<br>quarters of the states to agree that the 2nd Amendment is no longer<br>necessary. And there is *nowhere near* that kind of consensus in the<br>United States. In fact, the majority of the United States still believes<br>that the 2nd Amendment is relevant and important, even if we no longer<br>need a people's militia to defend our homeland.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-HXGQV){.citation_index} [[2nd Amendment and the Ideology<br>of<br>Self-Protection](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=19ad9d&url=https://www.firearmsandliberty.com/kates.self.protection.html){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="firearmsandliberty.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
