<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>It's not even on the same planet, let alone in the same ballpark, as<br>feasibility.<br><br>Disney World took ten years to construct, opening in 1971. Disney's<br>newest theme park (Animal Kingdom) opened in 1994. Rebuilding costs<br>using today's dollars would stretch into the tens of billions.<br><br>[[Blake Walker\'s answer to How much did it cost to build Walt Disney<br>World?](/How-much-did-it-cost-to-build-Walt-Disney-World/answer/Blake-Walker)]{.qlink_container}<br><br>And note that this answer is roughly six years old.<br><br>So even if they did decide to leave Florida, it would take them decades<br>and billions to rebuild.<br><br>Disney World isn't one of those traveling circus things that sets itself<br>up in the empty field next to the Walmart. It's 27,000 acres of<br>immersive theme park which took decades to build out. You can't simply<br>"rebuild" that somewhere else.<br><br>It would be cheaper to wait it out and wait for Florida to swing<br>Democrat again than it would be to rebuild Disney World somewhere else.<br><br>So rather than being all "doom-and-gloom," let's talk about what *will*<br>happen.<br><br>The law change which dissolved the Reedy Creek Improvement District was<br>specifically designed to allow these organizations to fix the issues<br>with those districts and file to have them restart *on the same day that<br>the old versions expire*.<br><br>**This isn't a law which permanently dissolves RCID. This is a law which<br>forces it to be renegotiated.**<br><br>And have no doubt: whether or not Disney participates in that<br>renegotiation, there will be a special district which encompasses all of<br>Disney's property. Whether it will be RCID version 2, or whether it will<br>be something entirely created by Orange and Osceola counties, it will<br>exist. It's too economically beneficial for the counties to do without.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Some states are inviting Disney to relocate Disney World in light of<br>their dispute with Florida. Is this really a feasible idea?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
