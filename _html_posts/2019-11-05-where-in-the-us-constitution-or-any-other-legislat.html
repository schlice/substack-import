<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Where in the U.S. Constitution or any other legislative document does<br>it state that the POTUS has absolute immunity from criminal process of<br>any kind?**<br><br>Article II, Section 1, Clause 1:<br><br>> *The executive Power shall be vested in a President of the United<br>> States of America.*<br><br>What this means is that the President *is* the Executive. In the<br>office of this *one person* has been vested *ALL* of the<br>Executive power.<br><br>Not the President and the Attorney General.\<br>Not the President and any US Attorney.\<br>Not the President and the Director of the FBI.<br><br>The President. Alone.<br><br>This means, quite literally, that any prosecutorial power that exists<br>anywhere in the Federal government, from the Attorney General to any US<br>Attorney, *flows directly from the Office of the President.*<br><br>This is a very important concept to understand. The unitary executive<br>theory places executive power in the hands of a single president to<br>provide a check against the power of the Congress, which the framers<br>thought to be potentially the most powerful branch of the government.<br><br>Since all prosecutorial authority flows from the office of the<br>President, it is impossible to indict a person who holds that office. It<br>is impossible to use ones own authority against oneself. Besides the<br>fact that it would be detrimental to the proper functioning of<br>government, the power to indict at a Federal level flows from the office<br>of the President, and takes place at his pleasure. A simple "no" is all<br>that is needed to stop any prosecutor from filing an indictment against<br>the person who occupies the office from where his actual prosecutorial<br>power originates.<br><br>Think about it this way: which deputy can arrest the Sheriff? The answer<br>is *none of them*. In fact, in most counties, they had to pass a<br>specific law in order to provide for what to do in a circumstance in<br>which the Sheriff needs to be arrested. Do you know who, in general, is<br>the person who is authorized by law to arrest the Sheriff? It's the<br>County Coroner. Break that little tidbit out at your next cocktail<br>party.<br><br>But it's also important to understand that **the power is vested in<br>the *office*, not the *person*.** This means that *while that<br>person holds that office, he cannot be indicted or prosecuted. The<br>person is subject to the law, but because of the office he holds, he is<br>immune while he holds the office.* Conversely, this means that *as soon<br>as the person no longer holds the office, that person is free to be<br>indicted.* The Constitution has a remedy for effecting this sort of<br>change, if a president is found to be indictable: impeachment. Once<br>a president has been impeached and removed from office, the US<br>Attorney's Office can then file indictments against that former<br>president (who no longer occupies the protected office). If the<br>president is not impeached, indictments can take place once that<br>president finishes his or her term in office.<br><br>(By the way, if this president were actually guilty of committing a<br>crime, this whole impeachment drama would be much easier)<br><br>And before you complain about "running out the clock," any prosecutor<br>would actually file indictments in Federal court and when they are told<br>that they cannot actually indict the President while he is in office,<br>the statute of limitations would be tolled until the person becomes<br>eligible for indictment. People doubt this, but that's because it has<br>never actually happened. There's no reason to believe that the statute<br>of limitations would not be tolled when the person being indicted is not<br>eligible for indictment.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
