<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Morals and ethics are relative. Unless we all share a common ultimate<br>moral authority (like God), which we do not, then each person's moral<br>authority is different, and therefore no one can be subject to the same<br>set of moral standards.<br><br>So rather than asking whether or not it is moral or ethical to do<br>something, let's ask whether or not it is *legal*, and whether or<br>not it is *appropriate* for an able-bodied person to use a<br>handicapped restroom stall.<br><br>First off, there are no laws against able-bodied individuals using<br>handicapped stalls in restrooms, as far as I know.<br><br>This leaves us the question of appropriateness. Is it appropriate for an<br>able-bodied person to use the handicapped stall in a restroom?<br><br>The answer is yes. So long as there is not a wheelchair-bound individual<br>waiting for that stall, and if there aren't any other usable stalls<br>available, then it is appropriate to use the stall as you need. Do try<br>to do your business promptly and vacate the stall in case a<br>wheelchair-bound person is waiting, since that's pretty much the only<br>stall they can use. Please keep your Instagram and Facebook surfing and<br>your Flappy Bird playing to a minimum while you're in the handicapped<br>stall.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
