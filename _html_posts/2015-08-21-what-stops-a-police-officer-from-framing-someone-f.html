<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>> *Additional Comments:*<br>><br>> *It seems like if a police officer doesn\'t like you, he can do<br>> anything he wants with no repercussions. He wants to put you away in<br>> prison for a while? He confiscates some crack from someone else and<br>> slips it in your pocket. Boom. His word against yours, which the cops<br>> always win. He wants you dead? He find you in an area with no<br>> witnesses, shoots you dead, and puts a gun in your hands.*<br>><br>> *Is there actually anything preventing this?*<br><br>You don\'t have to be a cop to do any of the things you said. Bad people<br>do this all the time, and far more often than cops.<br><br>The only thing that prevents people from doing the things that you<br>mentioned is a conscience. Lose that conscience, and everything in life<br>becomes an exercise in moral relativity.<br><br>But if you're asking if there are anything preventing a police officer<br>from doing any of this, the answer is that there is nothing specific.<br>The same laws that prevent anyone from doing these things also prevent<br>police officers from doing these things. Basically, police officers are<br>not unique in this regard.<br><br>What makes police officers different here is that they have a great deal<br>of experience with these types of cases. They know how to "game the<br>system" and do the worst to you with the least likely backlash against<br>themselves. And it is true that the qualities which make a person a good<br>police officer also make a person a good criminal. The only difference<br>between the two is the moral strength of the person in question.<br><br>In other words, there is nothing structurally in place to prevent a<br>police officer specifically from doing any of these things. It's up to<br>police departments to hire people with good strong moral character to<br>prevent these types of abuses from taking place.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
