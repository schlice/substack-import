<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I think it's funny that you believe that children who grow up in a<br>Christian household never experience sin.<br><br>> "You have heard that it was said to the people long ago, 'You shall<br>> not murder, and anyone who murders will be subject to judgment.' But I<br>> tell you that anyone who is angry with a brother or sister will be<br>> subject to judgment." --- Matthew 5:21--22 NIV<br><br>Are you saying that these kids have never been angry with a brother or<br>sister? Because according to Jesus, that's a sin, just like murder.<br><br>And "getting into heaven" isn't just accomplished by "rejecting sin,"<br>even though that's a part of it for sure. Repentance and belief are the<br>requirements. Those things are indeed easier for kids who grow up in<br>Christian households.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Can children of Christians who protect them from anything non-Christian<br>go to heaven even though they don't get the chance to "reject sin" so to<br>speak?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
