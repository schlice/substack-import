<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Could relatives of the three killed in Springfield, MO, successfully<br>sue Middlesex, New Jersey and its sheriff for wrongful death for<br>ignoring the ICE detainer and releasing the man that later became the<br>alleged killer?**<br><br>Wrongful death would mean that the preponderance of evidence showed that<br>the action (or inaction) of the respondent caused the death of the<br>subject.<br><br>These four elements are generally required for a wrongful death suit:<br><br>1.  The death of a human being;<br>2.  Caused by another\'s negligence, or with intent to cause harm;<br>3.  The survival of family members who are suffering monetary injury as<br>    a result of the death, and;<br>4.  The appointment of a personal representative for the decedent\'s<br>    estate.<br><br>It's that step 2 where this suit would fail. You would have to prove<br>that the sheriff had an obligation to follow the ICE detainer, and then<br>negligently failed to follow it.<br><br>The county sheriff is not the US Customs and Immigration Services (what<br>used to be called ICE). The county sheriff is under no obligation to<br>enforce Federal law, as he is not a Federal agent, in exactly the same<br>way that a Federal agent cannot enforce county ordinances.<br><br>To that end, the county sheriff is under no obligation to honor USCIS<br>detainers. Therefore, there was no wrongful death caused by the sheriff.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
