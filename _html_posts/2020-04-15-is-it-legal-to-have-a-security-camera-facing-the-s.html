If your camera is on your property, you can point it at anything<br>that you can see from that spot. So long as you are using your camera to<br>view your property, if it incidentally captures someone else's property,<br>or even a street, it's a legal use of a security camera.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
