<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [If you were trying to portray the United States as<br>\"Country X,\" your maths are wrong. There are estimated to be somewhere<br>between 270 million and 310 million guns in the US, and the population<br>of the US is roughly 319 million. So there are likely fewer guns in the<br>US than there are people. Even though they are close, your portrayal is<br>inaccurate.\<br>\<br>With all those guns in the United States, I would expect to see every<br>single person carrying one, and yet I don\'t. I hardly see anyone<br>carrying them openly. Is that because they\'re all concealing firearms<br>on their person? Not so, as only 4.8% of the population holds a<br>concealed carry permit.\<br>\<br>So all these numbers say is that people in \"Country X\" like to own<br>guns.\<br>\<br>If I told you that the number of hamburgers consumed in \"Country X\"<br>was 166 times greater than its population, what would that say about<br>\"Country X?\" In the United States, we consume roughly 50 billion<br>hamburgers annually. All that really says is the residents of \"Country<br>X\" like to buy hamburgers. And presumably eat them, but we don\'t<br>really know that for sure.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
