<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>When an HOA dissolves, it is gone.<br><br>In order to create a new *mandatory* HOA (one in which everyone is<br>automatically a part of), there must be 100% approval from all<br>homeowners. If there is even one homeowner who does not approve, the<br>neighborhood cannot create a mandatory HOA.<br><br>Some states do allow this to happen, and we have seen examples of<br>neighborhoods which have done this --- created mandatory HOAs which<br>excluded a house or two, because they refused to join. This is a recipe<br>for disaster. It does nothing but create enmity between those who are a<br>part of the HOA and those who are not, because those who are not<br>*passively benefit* from those who are.<br><br>But to your question, when an HOA dissolves, it is gone. The "old rules"<br>are gone. The HOA cannot be "restarted" in the future and insist that<br>homeowners are still covered under the "old rules." Once the HOA<br>dissolves, everyone's deeds are rewritten, excluding the HOA. Therefore,<br>you can't "restart" the HOA and assert that the "old rules" still apply,<br>because the deeds for the individual homes no longer have the HOA as an<br>entity with property interests.<br><br>The HOA can indeed restart, but it has to follow the rules for "starting<br>an HOA in an already-sold community."<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>In the USA if an HOA has voted to disband and close up, can if restart,<br>for example 2 years later, insisting the previous members are part of it<br>or does it have to solicit them to join the new HOA?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
