<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>This is one of those times where the Mark Twain quote is absolutely<br>true: "There are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies, and<br>statistics."<br><br>"Record low unemployment"<br><br>We don't have "record low unemployment." We have a "record low<br>unemployment rate." There is indeed a difference.<br><br>The unemployment rate is the percentage of people in the labor force who<br>are not working but are actively looking for work. The current<br>unemployment rate in the United States is 3.5%, which is not much<br>different from the rate in 2022. This is the lowest rate in the last 50<br>years. The number of unemployed people in July was 5.8 million.<br><br>The rate has varied from as low as 1% during World War I to as high as<br>25% during the Great Depression. The highest rate was 24.7% in 1933. The<br>rate reached 10.8% in November 1982 and 14.7% in April 2020. The current<br>rate is not dramatically different from the rates in 2022.<br><br>But "having a low unemployment rate" does not mean that all those people<br>who are not looking for jobs have found them or are employed. It means<br>that many people have stopped looking for work, for one reason or<br>another. It does not mean that they are working.<br><br>"Increasing labor force participation"<br><br>This is not only a misunderstanding (like the first one), but it's also<br>wrong. The labor force participation rate is the percentage of the<br>population that is either working or actively looking for work, and it<br>goes hand in hand with the unemployment rate. It is calculated by<br>dividing the number of people ages 16 and older who are employed or<br>actively seeking employment by the total non-institutionalized, civilian<br>working-age population.<br><br>The US labor force participation rate is currently 62.60%, which is<br>lower than the long term average of 62.84%. The rate increased to 63.1%<br>in July 2023, compared to 62.9% in the previous month. So *at best,* if<br>we are going to be generous, we'd say that the labor force participation<br>rate is roughly holding steady, but in actual analysis, we see that the<br>rate is declining.<br><br>The decline in the labor force participation rate is primarily due to<br>the aging population and other structural factors. It could also signify<br>that fewer people of working age are looking for employment, **which we<br>mentioned when we discussed the unemployment rate.** The matching<br>statistic lends credence to the fact that the numbers are the way they<br>are because fewer working age people are actively looking for work.<br>Remember that none of this tells us why fewer people are actively<br>looking for work. It could be that they have found jobs, and it could be<br>because they have given up on finding gainful employment. It could also<br>be that they are satisfied receiving government subsidies, but that's a<br>discussion for another day. Also telling that the labor force<br>participation rate for the subset of people ages 25 to 54 (the largest<br>group of employed persons) has returned to its pre-pandemic level. So<br>*at best*, it's no better than it was in 2020, and the numbers before<br>then were all Trump.<br><br>"Sustained wage growth"<br><br>From the Bureau of Labor Statistics:<br><br>> Compensation costs for private industry workers increased 4.5 percent<br>> over the year. In June 2022, the increase was 5.5 percent. Wages and<br>> salaries increased 4.6 percent for the 12-month period ending in June<br>> 2023 and increased 5.7 percent in June 2022. The cost of benefits<br>> increased 3.9 percent for the 12-month period ending in June 2023 and<br>> increased 5.3 percent in June 2022. Inflation-adjusted (constant<br>> dollar) compensation costs for private industry increased 1.5 percent<br>> for the 12- month period ending in June 2023. Inflation-adjusted wages<br>> and salaries increased 1.7 percent for the 12 months ending June 2023.<br>> Inflation-adjusted benefit costs in the private sector increased 0.9<br>> percent over that same period. \[1\](#AxUTW){#cite-AxUTW<br>> .citation_link}<br><br>If the increase last year was 5.5%, but the increase this year is only<br>4.5%, then wages are not growing as fast as they were last year. They<br>are growing (so saying "sustained wage growth" is not technically a<br>lie), but certainly not at the same rate. In fact, wage growth has<br>significantly cooled since last year:<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-0587c26fca5ef6ab3b63bdcd7f3bece7){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-0587c26fca5ef6ab3b63bdcd7f3bece7" master_w="295"<br>master_h="209"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>More importantly, if we have an increasing rate of inflation, we should<br>have an increasing compensation rate to match. But while the rate of<br>inflation is increasing, the rate of wage and salary increase is<br>decreasing. In other words, salaries are not increasing at the same rate<br>or close to what day to day costs are.<br><br>\<br><br>So with all of our numbers disambiguated, you answer the question. Does<br>Biden need to fulfill his campaign promise that he's going to give<br>everyone who signed up for a student loan a free pass to renege on their<br>obligation?<br><br>You bet he does.<br><br>Because if he can't do that, if he can't rely on those three numbers,<br>the only other numbers he really has to face are:<br><br>- a stagnating economy (GDP growth of less than 2--3% is considered<br>  stagnating, currently at 2.1%, the U.S. GDP growth rate for 2021 was<br>  5.95%),<br>- rising interest rates and even faster rising inflation (APR increased<br>  from 2.96% in 2021 to 5.34% in 2022, currently 7.55%)<br>- real prices for real goods and services skyrocketing, affecting<br>  everyday citizens (read: voters) daily, coupled with wages that are<br>  not growing as fast as prices, and<br>- post-pandemic paused student loan payments restarting,<br><br>all while he's trying to run a presidential re-election campaign.<br><br>He needs something to hang his campaign on, and bashing Republicans only<br>goes so far when the buck stops with you.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-AxUTW){.citation_index}<br>[https://www.bls.gov/news.release\...(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=6f21eb&url=https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/eci.pdf){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="bls.gov"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
