<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>This very question has been in the news recently. The Secretary of<br>State, Janet Yellen, made a statement about it in a Senate Banking<br>Committee hearing in May. Yellen spoke of the negative economic impacts<br>of limiting abortion rights in the US, saying it would set women\'s<br>progress back in the economy. In the hearing, she said:<br><br>> I believe that eliminating the rights of women to make decisions about<br>> when and whether to have children would have very damaging effects on<br>> the economy and would set women back<br>> decades.\[1\](#rBALn){#cite-rBALn .citation_link}<br><br>What she was probably referring to was women\'s labor force<br>participation rates, wages, and levels of poverty.<br><br>She's right about the fact that having a child at the wrong time can<br>have a deleterious effect on whether or not you end up poor, or in the<br>middle class. Where her logic failed is in the fact that she claims that<br>eliminating the right to elective abortion is akin to "removing the<br>choice of a woman to make decisions about when and whether to have<br>children."<br><br>It's well known that if you are in an unstable monetary situation and<br>you choose to have children, you're not setting yourself up for success.<br>The Brookings Institute published a study which basically said, in part,<br>that if you wait to have children until you're over 21, married and have<br>finished high school with a full time job, you have a nearly 75% chance<br>of joining the solidly middle class. You'll have only a 2% chance of<br>ending up in poverty.<br><br>They went on to say the following:<br><br>> Consider an example. Today, more than 40 percent of American children,<br>> including more than 70 percent of black children and 50 percent of<br>> Hispanic children, are born outside marriage. This unprecedented rate<br>> of nonmarital births, combined with the nation's high divorce rate,<br>> means that around half of children will spend part of their<br>> childhood---and for a considerable number of these all of their<br>> childhood --- in a single-parent family. As hard as single parents try<br>> to give their children a healthy home environment, children in<br>> female-headed families are four or more times as likely as children<br>> from married-couple families to live in poverty. In turn, poverty is<br>> associated with a wide range of negative outcomes in children,<br>> including school dropout and out-of-wedlock<br>> births.\[2\](#fDJTh){#cite-fDJTh .citation_link}<br><br>The problem is well known and the solution is well known. Neither the<br>problem, nor the solution, have anything to do with killing babies.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>How could overturning Roe v. Wade have any effect on the US economy?<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-rBALn){.citation_index} [[Treasury Secretary Yellen says<br>abortion restrictions will hurt the US economy --- there\'s significant<br>research that proves<br>this](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=cb9800&url=https://www.businessinsider.com/overturn-roe-wade-economic-economy-implications-banning-abortions-severe-2022-5){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="businessinsider.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>\[2\](#cite-fDJTh){.citation_index} [[Three Simple Rules Poor Teens<br>Should Follow to Join the Middle<br>Class](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=8e75a4&url=https://www.brookings.edu/opinions/three-simple-rules-poor-teens-should-follow-to-join-the-middle-class/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="brookings.edu"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
