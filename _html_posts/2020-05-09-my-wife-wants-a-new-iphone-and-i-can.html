<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>My wife wants a new iPhone and I can't afford it. What should I do?<br><br>You actually do have a few options.<br><br>1.  Don't get it. There are plenty of things I want that I can't get<br>    simply because I can't afford them. While researching, don't forget<br>    that this is an option.<br>2.  Buy it somewhere else other than your carrier's site. Use a site<br>    like<br>    [Gazelle(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=8b2894&url=https://buy.gazelle.com/){.external_link<br>    rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>    onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>    qt-tooltip="gazelle.com"}]{.qlink_container} and you may be able to<br>    buy an iPhone that is "new" (i.e. the latest generation) and "new to<br>    her" but is otherwise pre-owned.<br>3.  Get an iPhone that will still be "new to her" but is not the<br>    absolute latest generation. For example, the iPhone 11 series is<br>    currently (as of May 2020) the latest generation, but the carriers<br>    all still sell the iPhone X series. The iPhone X series is still a<br>    very capable device.<br>4.  If you must have the newest generation iPhone, don't get the "top of<br>    the line" model. Instead of getting the 11 Pro Max, get the 11, or<br>    the 11 SE. The SE will give you a traditional design but will still<br>    contain the latest processor, so it will run better than a<br>    similar-looking iPhone. And the 11 SE is still the "latest<br>    generation" iPhone at a much more budget-friendly price.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
