For instance, are you legally required to close your<br>curtains (Oregon, USA specifically)?**<br><br>This sounds like some confusion between drinking alcohol and public<br>indecency laws.<br><br>Drinking alcohol is legal if you're over 21. It's not indecent. There's<br>no requirement to squirrel away your alcohol drinking inside your house.<br>There are "open container" laws in Oregon, which means that you can't<br>have open containers of alcohol in your car. You can drink alcohol<br>outside if you're of legal age.<br><br>It seems like you're thinking of public indecency laws regarding closing<br>your curtains. Basically, you can't have sex in front of an open window.<br>You can't expose your genitals *with the intent of sexual arousal*.<br>Simply being naked is not public indecency in Oregon.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
