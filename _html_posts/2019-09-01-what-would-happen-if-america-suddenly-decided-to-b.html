<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What would an America with no guns be like, beyond making them illegal<br>but actually having no guns in America?**<br><br>Look at London. That will give you the perfect example of what American<br>cities will look like if guns actually didn't exist.<br><br>Knife attacks. Acid attacks.<br><br>But most importantly, *tyranny.* The tyranny of the strong over the<br>weak. The tyranny of the many over the few. And the tyranny of the young<br>over the old.<br><br>A world without guns means a world where the strong, the young, and the<br>many have power.<br><br>Guns *equalize that force calculation.*<br><br>When good people have guns, they can't be bullied. They can't be<br>intimidated. They can't be threatened. They can only be reasoned with.<br><br>In short, America without guns will become *far less civilized.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
