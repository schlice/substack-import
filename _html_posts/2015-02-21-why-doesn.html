<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [The military is a brotherhood steeped in tradition. You\'d<br>be hard pressed to find anyone willing to change that.\<br>\<br>Marching music simply provides a rhythm (at 120 beats per minute) that<br>everyone can march to. It can be done without the music too; all you<br>need is a bass drum and a snare drum and you can march to it.\<br>\<br>The music describes patriotism and love of country. You should look up<br>some of the words to those old songs. They are very moving, and they<br>help to remind the soldier of the heritage of sacrifice that came before<br>them.\<br>\<br>So I don\'t think it\'s going to change anytime soon.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
