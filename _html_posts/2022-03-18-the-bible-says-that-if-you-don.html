<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>So most "intelligent" people are confident that the Bible is "just a<br>fairy tale."<br><br>I doubt this statement.<br><br>The Bible isn't *one book.* It's 66 books, written over the course of<br>1500 years, by about 40 different authors, in three languages, on three<br>separate continents.<br><br>But there is *unity* in the message of the Bible.<br><br>Even more astoundingly, the Bible *never contradicts itself*, and it is<br>historically and archaeologically accurate. It relays one unified<br>message, with no errors or omissions.<br><br>If you believe that such a feat is a fairy tale, invented by man, if you<br>do not believe that the Bible is the inspired word of God, I pose the<br>following challenge to you:<br><br>Go into any library. Choose any 66 books you like which match the<br>characteristics of the books in the Bible, but it must be 66. They can<br>be written in no fewer than three languages. They must have been written<br>by no fewer than 40 different authors, and they must have been written<br>over the course of 1500 years. Those 66 books must all share a common<br>storyline, a common theme, and a common message, with no historical<br>errors or contradictions.<br><br>If you can do this, I will concede that the Bible may have been invented<br>by man. But no one has been able to accomplish such a feat, because it<br>is impossible.<br><br>More accurately, it is impossible to accomplish with any collection of<br>human writing. But the Bible passes this test, because the authors were<br>inspired by God to write what they did.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>The Bible says that if you don\'t believe in Jesus as your Savior you<br>would not be saved but perished, which means you will go to the hell.<br>But most intelligent people are confident that the Bible is just like a<br>fairy tale. What thought comes to you?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
