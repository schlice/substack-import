<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**The ACLU lawyers report they\'re unable to locate parents to 545<br>children, who are the reminder of the Trump border policy. Could the US<br>incur sanctions from other countries for this practice?**<br><br>Other countries could sanction the United States for whatever reason<br>they choose, or for no reason at all.<br><br>*But why would they?*<br><br>The rest of the world wants to trade with us. We get far less benefit<br>from trading with other countries than they get from trading with us.<br>Any limitations those countries place on us hurts *them* more than it<br>hurts *us*.<br><br>And in other news that everyone knows but no one acknowledges, people<br>will *buy* or *steal* children in other countries because they believe<br>it will get them preferential treatment in the US immigration system.<br>News flash: it doesn't. So the "parent" gets deported, and you've got a<br>"Dreamer" left in the country.\[1\](#lvcXN){#cite-lvcXN<br>.citation_link}<br><br>Other news flash that's not really news: *that's exactly what those<br>actual parents wanted.* If you believe with all your heart that your<br>child will have a better life in the United States than they will in<br>their home country, you'll do anything to get them in, including paying<br>child mules.<br><br>So for many of those 545 children, their biological parents don't care<br>that there is no parent there for them. They want the foster care system<br>to take them in, because it will still be a better life for them than<br>anything they could have had at home. We can't deport them because we<br>don't know where to send them. Without a parent to claim them, no<br>country will accept them. And yes, it's true, some of those 545 were<br>just misplaced. In any system run by humans, human error is bound to<br>occur. But those children are all taken care of. They're not left by<br>the side of the road or "abandoned" or locked in cages or anything else<br>that nonsensical Trump haters will tell you. They join the approximately<br>500,000 children across the nation in our foster care system.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-lvcXN){.citation_index} [[Border Crisis: CBP Fights Child<br>Exploitation](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=58b803&url=https://www.cbp.gov/frontline/border-crisis-cbp-fights-child-exploitation){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="cbp.gov"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
