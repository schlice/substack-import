<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I will take the unpopular position and say no.<br><br>Rape is certainly difficult enough to deal with, regardless of who was<br>the rapist and who was the victim. It's infinitely harder to deal with<br>when a child is involved.<br><br>*But the simple fact is: there is a child involved.*<br><br>And the undeniable truth about the whole situation:<br><br>***Child support is not about the rape victim, or the rapist. Child<br>support is about the CHILD.***<br><br>Child support is awarded by the state in order to provide for a child.<br>The circumstances surrounding how the child was brought into this world<br>are irrelevant when determining child support. Child support is<br>given to the custodial parent by the non-custodial parent to support the<br>raising of the child.<br><br>It's very challenging to divest your feelings about how the child came<br>into the world when it comes to the awarding of child support. It's<br>almost unthinkable to consider the male victim of rape now having to pay<br>child support for the child that he unwillingly fathered. But the bottom<br>line is *you have a child, even if you didn't want to have a child. Even<br>if you didn't want to participate in the sex act that produced a child.<br>You now have a child for whom you are the biological father. No amount<br>of legal gyrations divests you of the physical reality that is the fact<br>that you are the biological father of that child.*<br><br>*Should that child suffer because you didn't want that child in the<br>first place?*<br><br>*Should that child suffer because that child was produced against your<br>will?*<br><br>*Should that child suffer because you were a rape victim?*<br><br>I will repeat my statement from above:<br><br>***Child support is not about the rape victim, or the rapist. Child<br>support is about the CHILD.***<br><br>Punish the rapist. Don't punish the child. Until such time as the state<br>develops a fund to raise children who are unintended consequences of<br>rapes, and raises taxes on all state citizens to cover that cost, the<br>first place you go to get money to raise a child is to the biological<br>parents of that child. Yes, it's unfair. But life isn't fair. And who is<br>responsible to raise that child that you made (albeit unwillingly)?<br><br>If you want to pass a law that makes it illegal to sue for child support<br>after a rape, you also have to pass a law that raises taxes on all state<br>residents to cover the child support costs of the child of a rape, and<br>it has to be unisex. Doesn't matter if a man raped a woman or a woman<br>raped a man. The custodial parent (or the guardian *ad litem*) can<br>receive child support from that fund to raise that child if the child is<br>a product of a rape.<br><br>Until that happens, then the non-custodial parent should pay child<br>support, even if he was the victim or perpetrator of a rape.<br><br>(EDIT) I want to add something. The article talks about statutory rape<br>where the male was underage (as in the scenario where a female teacher<br>has sex with one of her male students). In that scenario, the "victim"<br>was indeed a willing participant. I know in our discussions we're<br>talking about an unwilling male participant, and I believe that is a<br>corner case that should be addressed separately. In such a scenario,<br>forcing the male victim to pay child support for a child produced during<br>an unwilling and unwanted sexual assault isn't right, and state law<br>fails if it does not address this issue. However, my feelings are<br>different (and mirror my original answer) when the "victim" was willing,<br>but was unable to legally consent because of his age. The "victim" in<br>the article should absolutely pay child support.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
