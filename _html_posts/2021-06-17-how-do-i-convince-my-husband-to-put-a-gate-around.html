<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I know most of the answers already said this, but I really feel like I<br>need to add my voice to this discussion.<br><br>There are several big (really big) reasons why you need to have either a<br>fenced-in yard or a protective pool cover, and none of them have<br>anything to do with your kids. They help your kids incidentally, but<br>primarily those things are there for your legal protection.<br><br>A pool is known as an "attractive nuisance." In other words, pools, like<br>trampolines and big piles of dirt, attract kids. Like moths to a flame,<br>kids are naturally drawn to "attractive nuisances." And some of those<br>things can really hurt them, or even kill them if they're not careful.<br><br>When you have an attractive nuisance on your property, **the onus is on<br>you** to protect that nuisance from the kids (primarily, but others too)<br>who may seek to take advantage of that thing without your consent and<br>without adult supervision. Without this, you could be liable if someone<br>hurts themselves or dies when you were not watching your pool.<br><br>In fact, most states won't even certify your pool for use unless you<br>either have a fence or a locking gate around your pool. You should check<br>with your city or county's building permit department to see what the<br>laws are where you live. Also, you should check your homeowner's<br>insurance policy. Most will recommend you expand your homeowner's<br>insurance to include what is known as an "umbrella policy" to protect<br>you against lawsuits from people who may injure themselves while using<br>your pool, and of course, you can't get any homeowner's insurance (in<br>most cases) unless your pool is protected.<br><br>As far as your own toddler is concerned, Florida has that covered. Here,<br>you have one of two choices: a floating tip sensor in the water (with<br>interior signal), or audible sensors on every door and window which open<br>toward the pool, so that you can always be aware of a toddler opening a<br>door or window towards the pool.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>How do I convince my husband to put a gate around our in-ground pool?
