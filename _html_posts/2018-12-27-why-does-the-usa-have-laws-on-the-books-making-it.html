<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Why does the USA have laws on the books making it an offence to drive<br>without your driving license in your physical possession? In the UK you<br>merely have to produce your license within 7 days at a Police station if<br>you are not carrying it.**<br><br>In most states in the US, there are two different laws that govern this.<br><br>The more severe law says that in order to operate a motor vehicle, you<br>must be in possession of a valid driver's license. This is the one that<br>can get you into the big trouble, and it means that you must have a<br>valid license before you can drive, not that you need to have it on you.<br>The UK is the same as the US in this regard, and while the text of the<br>laws differ, the intent is the same: you must have a license before you<br>can drive.<br><br>The less severe law says that the operator of a motor vehicle must be in<br>possession of his or her license at all times while they are driving,<br>and must surrender that license to law enforcement when it is demanded.<br>The reason why they do this is because it simply makes it easier on the<br>officer effecting the traffic stop. With the quantity of stops they must<br>make, having to research the license status of every driver they stop<br>unnecessarily extends the time of the stop and taxes the already thin<br>resources of the department. If you are interested in extending your<br>traffic stop because you just love being stopped by the police, don't<br>bother carrying your license with you when you drive. That said,<br>violating this law is, in most states, a petty offense; however, the law<br>specifically says a driver can't be *convicted* if they produce in court<br>satisfactory evidence that a drivers license was actually issued and was<br>valid at the time of the offense. So you can be ticketed for this<br>offense but it can be dismissed by the court if you produce your license<br>and show that it was valid on the day you were stopped. This is called a<br>*dismissible offense*. It's still a hassle, so if you like longer<br>traffic stops *and* you like going to the courthouse to visit the clerk<br>of the court just to get your ticket dismissed (minus fees), then you<br>also don't have to carry your license with you when you drive.<br><br>Again, this varies by state, but is relatively standard across the US.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
