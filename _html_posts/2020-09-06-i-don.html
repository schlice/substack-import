<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**I don't live with my mother anymore, but my dad still has to pay child<br>support for me. Is there a way I can get that child support? I'm 18 and<br>live in NY.**<br><br>Sure. Talk to your dad.<br><br>In New York, if you are living on your own, you can be legally<br>considered "emancipated" and he would no longer have to pay money to<br>your mom.<br><br>And maybe, if he doesn\'t have to pay her anymore, he can help you out<br>instead. But if you are declared emancipated, no one is *owed* anything.<br><br>Remember, child support is to help the lower income parent with your<br>support. When you no longer need support, the obligation ends. So your<br>dad would have to help you because he wants to, not because he has to.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
