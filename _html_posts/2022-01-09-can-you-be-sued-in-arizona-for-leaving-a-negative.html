<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>In general, you cannot be sued for leaving a negative review. But as<br>always, with legal questions, there are certain scenarios in which a<br>lawsuit might be the appropriate remediation.<br><br>- Libel. If you print something in your review which is **demonstrably<br>  false, you are aware that it is false, and it does quantifiable<br>  monetary damage** to the person you lied about, you can be sued for<br>  libel.<br>- You said "they have a form with your signature saying that you won't."<br>  That almost sounds like a "contract" or an "agreement" wherein you get<br>  something from them, and they get your guarantee that you won't leave<br>  a negative review. In theory, the same form would detail what each<br>  side would get out of this agreement, and what a "negative review"<br>  looks like (i.e. how many stars qualifies as "negative?" Can you say<br>  that anything at all was bad, like if you commented that the restroom<br>  was dirty, would that qualify as a negative review, etc), otherwise it<br>  would be up to a court to decide.\<br>  \<br>  And what did this "form" specify as the consequence for violating the<br>  agreement? Did it say that you can be sued? Or did it specify some<br>  other remediation?<br><br>As always, it depends.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Can you be sued in Arizona for leaving a negative review? Even if they<br>have a form with your signature saying that you won't<br><br>\<br><br>*This answer is not professional legal advice**, nor is it a<br>substitute for professional legal advice, or a solicitation to offer<br>professional legal advice.
