<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Not even close.<br><br>First, in order to understand the Bible, we use the Bible to interpret<br>the Bible in a process called *exegesis*. We do this first by using<br>*context* of the verse, then of the chapter, then of the book, then the<br>whole Bible. For text, without context, is just pretext.<br><br>So let's broaden our scope to the immediate context:<br><br>> On the evening of that first day of the week, when the disciples were<br>> together, with the doors locked for fear of the Jewish leaders, Jesus<br>> came and stood among them and said, "Peace be with you!" After he said<br>> this, he showed them his hands and side. The disciples were overjoyed<br>> when they saw the Lord.<br>><br>> Again Jesus said, "Peace be with you! As the Father has sent me, I am<br>> sending you." And with that he breathed on them and said, "Receive the<br>> Holy Spirit. If you forgive anyone's sins, their sins are forgiven; if<br>> you do not forgive them, they are not forgiven." --- John 20:19--23<br>> NIV<br><br>So what's the context here? Jesus has risen and He appears to the<br>disciples in the locked upper room. He tells them in verse 21, "**As the<br>Father sends me, I am sending you.**" *This context is important. We'll<br>get to why in just a minute.*<br><br>Then, He breathed on them, giving them the Holy Spirit. He tells them<br>(in the verse you are asking about), "If you forgive anyone's sins,<br>their sins are forgiven; if you do not forgive them, they are not<br>forgiven."<br><br>So what did He mean by that? Did He mean that the disciples could judge<br>what was sin and what was not sin? Did He mean that, by extension, you<br>can judge for yourself what is sin and what is not sin? Did it mean that<br>the disciples could run out into the street tagging people like playing<br>Duck Duck Goose saying, "Forgiven, forgiven, forgiven, UNFORGIVEN!,<br>forgiven..."<br><br>NO! Verse 21 interprets verse 23. Remember that Jesus says, "As the<br>Father sends me, I am sending you." The disciples will forgive *just as*<br>Christ has forgiven. How has Christ forgiven? On the basis of His death<br>and resurrection, and to be received by faith. How should the disciples<br>forgive? On the basis of Christ\'s death and resurrection, and to be<br>received by faith. So as the disciples declare Christ and His<br>forgiveness in the power of the Spirit, the world\'s response to their<br>message will be its response to Christ (which, in turn, is its response<br>to the Father).<br><br>So no, the disciples didn't have the power to forgive sins. Only God<br>forgives sins. The disciples have the power to declare Christ and His<br>forgiveness in the power of the Spirit, *as all Christians are<br>commissioned to do*. The person hearing the disciples can respond in<br>faith and God can forgive their sins.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
