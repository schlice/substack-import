<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: [I think what you feel is what I like to call<br>\"depression\" in myself. I completely agree; there is no one else who<br>knows what we are feeling inside, beyond other people with MS. That\'s<br>why I think connection between MSers is so important. Your analogy about<br>the baby is almost correct, except that nearly every woman can actually<br>have a baby, where not quite as many will have MS.\<br>\<br>My \"fear\" is that I will not be able to do the things I want to do in<br>life before I\'m no longer able to do them. I want to cram them all in<br>now, while I have the ability. I don\'t know how to shake that. I don\'t<br>even know if I \"should\" shake that. I\'ve never actually admitted that<br>before. I\'m told that I should leave it in God\'s hands, but what does<br>that mean? Does that mean I should throw my hands up and say \"Qué será<br>será\"? Don\'t try to make anything happen, just let the chips fall<br>where they may and assume that it\'s God\'s hand that determines whether<br>or not things will happen?\<br>\<br>For example, let\'s say I want to learn to SCUBA dive while I can still<br>swim. Shouldn\'t I try to plan to learn to dive sooner rather than<br>later, knowing that I may not be able to do it if I leave it to \"divine<br>providence\"? I don\'t think that God gives us free will and then wants<br>us to leave all the decision making up to Him.\<br>\<br>So that\'s my struggle.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/How-does-someone-with-multiple-sclerosis-describe-MS/answer/Bill-Stein<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
