<br/><br/>Answer<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content: [It depends on the organization against which you have a<br/>complaint. Most organizations have contact information available on<br/>their website that you can write to and get your complaint addressed.<br/>Check the bottom of their main company webpage for links like \"Contact<br/>Us\" or similar.\<br/>\<br/>In the US, if the organization is a service company and you received<br/>less-than-stellar service, you can write a review at a company like<br/>[[Angie\'s<br/>List](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=50ddcd&amp;url=http://www.angieslist.com){.external_link<br/>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br/>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br/>qt-tooltip="angieslist.com"}]{.qlink_container} and other people looking<br/>for organizations can reference the database and see your review.<br/>Angie\'s List is a great one to belong to; they only accept reviews from<br/>their members, so you pay to review companies. Once you do pay though,<br/>you get access to their entire database of reviews. Companies very<br/>carefully pay attention to sites like Angie\'s List because negative<br/>reviews can cost them revenue.\<br/>\<br/>If the organization is one that you purchased from through an online<br/>store like<br/>[Amazon.com(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=035057&amp;url=http://www.amazon.com){.external_link<br/>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br/>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br/>qt-tooltip="amazon.com"}]{.qlink_container}, you can leave a review at<br/>that site and it will influence the purchasing decisions that other<br/>consumers make.]<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content language: English<br/><br/><br/>
