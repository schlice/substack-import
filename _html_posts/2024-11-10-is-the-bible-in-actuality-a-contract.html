<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>A contract is an agreement between two parties. In a contract, there are<br>three basic parts: an offer, an acceptance, and consideration.<br>Basically, what that means is that a contract is a mutually beneficial<br>arrangement. Both parties get something out of it.<br><br>The story of the Bible is not a contract. God is omnipotent. He is<br>complete in Himself. He needs nothing; he wants nothing. He doesn't<br>*need* us to do anything for Him. So the Bible can never be a contract,<br>because God doesn't get anything out of the deal; He already has<br>Everything.<br><br>The central theme of the Bible is God redeeming His people. The Bible is<br>broken down like this:<br><br>1.  Paradise<br>2.  Paradise lost<br>3.  Paradise regained<br><br>Bullet 1 is the first part of Genesis. Bullet 2 is depicted through the<br>remainder of the 66 books of the Bible, and Bullet 3 is found in<br>Revelation.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
