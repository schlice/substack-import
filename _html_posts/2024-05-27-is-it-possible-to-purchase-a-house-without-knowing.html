<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Yes, it is possible, but it is unlikely.<br><br>In order for the sale of the house to be legally binding, all required<br>local government documents must be properly recorded. That's why you<br>complete the purchase at a "title company," where they collate and<br>properly record all of the legal documentation to buy a house.<br><br>The HOA's CC&R (Covenants, Conditions, and Restrictions) is the legal<br>document which must be signed during the purchase of a home. You<br>acknowledge that a CC&R exists on the property, and you agree to be<br>bound by it.<br><br>If you don't sign the CC&R during the purchase of the home, and the CC&R<br>actually is in force against the property, the sale is invalid.<br><br>You purchase title insurance during the sale of the home, which would<br>cover this eventuality. The main purpose of title insurance is to<br>eliminate risks of unlawful filings (such as a CC&R being present on the<br>property but you didn't sign one).<br><br>So while it is technically possible, it is highly unlikely these days,<br>and the cost of correcting the error (and any other legal fees) would be<br>covered by your title insurance.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
