<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>People keep asking this question, but the answer does not change.<br><br>You are looking to prove an immaterial God through the use of the<br>material sciences, and that simply does not make sense. You cannot prove<br>the existence of an immaterial God through the use of the material<br>sciences.<br><br>That does not mean that we cannot prove the existence of God; we can. We<br>simply do not use the material sciences. We use other sciences, like<br>forensic science, which allows us to understand causes in the past<br>by examining the effects today. Forensic science is as valuable an<br>investigation technique as material science and peer-reviewed journals<br>are, and it is no less valuable or meaningful. Science, at its very<br>root, is a search for causes. This is the basis for the Law of<br>Causality, which is the fundamental principle of science. Without the<br>Law of Causality, science is impossible. In fact, Francis Bacon (the<br>father of modern science) said, "True knowledge is knowledge by causes."<br>In other words, science is a search for causes. That's what scientists<br>do---they try to discover what caused what.<br><br>The problem that you're probably running into is that because we cannot<br>use the material, empirical sciences to prove an immaterial God,<br>materialists reject God out-of-hand.<br><br>But that's illogical, because there are plenty of things which we can<br>correctly say exist even though they cannot be explained directly by<br>material science. Materialists assert that only materials exist, but<br>materials don't have morality. How much does hate weigh? Is there an<br>atom for love? What's the chemical composition of the murder molecule?<br>These questions are meaningless because physical particles are not<br>responsible for morality. If materials are solely responsible for<br>morality, then Hitler had no real moral responsibility for what he<br>did---he just had bad molecules. This is nonsense, and everyone knows<br>it. Human thoughts and transcendent moral laws are not material things<br>any more than the laws of logic and mathematics are material things.<br>They are immaterial entities that cannot be weighed or physically<br>measured. As a result, they can't be explained in material terms by<br>natural selection or any other atheistic means, and they can't be<br>analyzed using the empirical sciences. But they exist nonetheless.<br><br>Reliance on the material sciences while excluding all else is the folly<br>of the naturalists. That's why this hyper-focus on "show me<br>peer-reviewed studies which prove God's existence" are nonsense; they<br>are literally illogical.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
