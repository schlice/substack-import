<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [To what are you going to compare the services offered by<br>the police?\<br>\<br>In order to perform cost-benefit analysis, you have to put the cost of a<br>police force, and the benefits you receive from it, against other forms<br>of law enforcement. Currently, police are the only law enforcement<br>agents authorized to perform police activities.\<br>\<br>Since the police is the only game in town, you cannot put the police up<br>against any other alternatives, so CBA is not<br>warranted.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
