<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If someone tries to steal my dog from within my fenced yard, can I<br>legally shoot the attempting thief?**<br><br>I get the snark from the other answerers, but I can see a way in which<br>you could misunderstand when to use deadly force.<br><br>There is one circumstance in which you can use deadly force to stop<br>someone fleeing: *kidnapping*. In many jurisdictions, you can use<br>any force, up to and including deadly force, to stop a kidnapping. But<br>all states are different; be sure you review your state laws before you<br>shoot at a kidnapper. If you own a gun, you should have already printed<br>off and practically memorized the laws related to using your gun where<br>you live.<br><br>That said, your dog is not a person. Legally speaking, your dog is<br>property, not people. Therefore, the person is committing a *theft*,<br>not a *kidnapping*. You cannot use deadly force to stop a theft.<br><br>\<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*Note that "answer" here applies to this answer* ***and its associated<br>comments.***<br><br>*This answer is not a substitute for professional legal advice or a<br>solicitation to offer legal advice regarding specific facts.
