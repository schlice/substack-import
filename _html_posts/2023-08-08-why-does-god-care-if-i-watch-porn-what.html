<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Interesting answers you've gotten so far. Maybe next time you should ask<br>your question in a Christian Space instead of out into the global Quora<br>landscape. I'd recommend [[Christians and<br>Christianity](https://christianschristianity.quora.com/)]{.qlink_container}<br><br>[[Christians &<br>Christianity](https://christianschristianity.quora.com)]{.qlink_container}<br><br>Nevertheless, you've asked here, and I found it, so I can provide you<br>with a real answer.<br><br>There's nothing specifically about pornography in the Bible, so you're<br>probably thinking that some porn isn't all that bad. In fact, **70% of<br>Christian men admit to watching porn**, so you're not alone.<br><br>Clearly, watching *violent* porn would be bad, but what about pictures<br>or video of *consenting adults*? Don't men, especially men who have<br>higher libidos than their wives, have a natural need to alleviate that<br>urge in a healthy way?<br><br>So let me re-phrase your question into one that a Christian could<br>understand a little better:<br><br>Is watching porn a sin?<br><br>In order to answer that question, we need to understand what *sin* is.<br>Basically, sin is anything which takes us off-course from the life that<br>God has created us to live. In other words, sin is any choice or<br>behavior that takes us away from God's good plan for us.<br><br>If we're honest with ourselves, we can probably identify a few ways in<br>which pornography is objectively wrong:<br><br>- Objectifying people as sex objects<br>- Promoting and encouraging forms of violence and sex trafficking<br>  associated with the porn industry<br><br>But the true danger of porn is more fundamental, and it is the<br>explanation for why porn is sinful: **porn leads us away from God's good<br>plan for us.**<br><br>While the Bible doesn't specifically mention pornography, it definitely<br>mentions looking lustfully at a woman.<br><br>King David was one of the first documented to "watch porn" in the Bible.<br>He had an affair with a woman named Bathsheeba, and then to cover up his<br>crime, he had her husband Uriah killed. But for this context, the first<br>part of this story is the one we want to highlight:<br><br>> One evening, David got up from his bed and walked around on the roof<br>> of the palace. From the roof, he saw a woman bathing. The woman was<br>> very beautiful. --- 2 Samuel 11:2<br><br>The whole sordid tale of adultery and murder started with David, for all<br>intents and purposes, "watching porn." He saw Bathsheeba taking a bath,<br>and instead of looking away immediately, he kept looking, and *lusting*<br>after her. Everything that happened to him after this began with David<br>willingly starting down that pathway of sin.<br><br>Jesus talked about it when He said:<br><br>> "You have heard that it was said, 'YOU SHALL NOT COMMIT ADULTERY'; but<br>> I say to you that everyone who looks at a woman with lust for her has<br>> already committed adultery with her in his heart."--- Matthew 5:27--28<br>> NIV<br><br>We see here that looking lustfully at a woman is sinful, and you have<br>"already committed adultery with her in your heart." But Jesus is<br>describing something that still affects us, even today: **an affair of<br>the body always begins with an affair of the mind.** He taught that the<br>plan wasn't to only keep us from using our body in a sinful way. Jesus<br>was calling His followers to use their whole self --- heart, soul, and<br>mind --- to glorify God. If we *choose* to walk the pathway of mental<br>adultery, we are already off-course from what God has planned for us.<br><br>\<br><br>You're probably telling yourself at this point, *Yeah, but I'd never let<br>sin control me like that; I'd never let it go that far.* You may be<br>surprised to hear that for people in recovery from sexual addiction,<br>**not a single one had ever intentionally planned to ruin a marriage, a<br>career, or a family.** Every single person believed that they would<br>never let sin control them like that, and that they'd never let it get<br>that far. But it did. Because like David, porn is the first step on a<br>path that takes us away from God.<br><br>Have you ever heard of an athlete visualizing themselves winning? It's a<br>common practice for elite athletes to visualize all of the right moves<br>they need to make in order to win: running backs visualize their runs,<br>baseball players visualize themselves watching the ball all the way to<br>the bat and their perfect swing. Even pilots in pilot training practice<br>"chair flying" where they visualize themselves making a perfect landing<br>or executing a particularly difficult flight maneuver (can confirm<br>personally). These techniques are actually based on modern brain<br>science. Turns out, there is a part of our brain which can't distinguish<br>between fantasy and reality. Our brain then copies the behavior as if it<br>were actually happening, and reacts<br>accordingly.\[1\](#XlNJv){#cite-XlNJv .citation_link}<br><br>It also turns out, that's why porn works. When we watch porn, even<br>though we know it's fake, there's another part of our brain which is<br>processing it as if it is reality. That false reality will create a<br>chemical response which will induce a stronger desire to repeat the<br>experience. It's a function of our brain's "pleasure center." In other<br>words, *viewing the activity makes us more strongly want to do the<br>activity.*<br><br>Turns out that Jesus was right: what begins in the mind will eventually<br>be expressed in the body and the choices we make.<br><br>This is why watching porn is so sinful: it sends us down a wrong path<br>for our lives, a path that God did not intend for us. Watching porn<br>misses the mark for what God desires. Watching porn threatens the bond<br>to one spouse for a lifetime that God gave us, because it causes our<br>brain to unintentionally desire sex with another.<br><br>But there is hope.<br><br>The brain can change. The heart can be transformed. But it takes time<br>and effort to break the grip of porn on our lives. It usually requires<br>the help of a supportive recovery group to mentor you through the<br>process.
