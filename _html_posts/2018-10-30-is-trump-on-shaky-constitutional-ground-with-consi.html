<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Is Trump on shaky constitutional ground with considering to interpret<br>the 14th Amendment to allow him to end giving citizenship to illegal<br>aliens children born in the US?**<br><br>There are cogent arguments on both sides as to whether or not a<br>Constitutional amendment is actually needed.<br><br>Looking at the text of the 14th Amendment, it says:<br><br>> All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to<br>> the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the<br>> State wherein they reside.<br><br>The sticking point here is the phrase "and subject to the jurisdiction<br>thereof." Illegal immigrants are not subject to the jurisdiction of the<br>United States; they are subject to the jurisdiction of their home<br>country. That seems like a valid Constitutional argument, certainly not<br>"shaky" ground.<br><br>Additionally, the 14th Amendment was never intended to grant citizenship<br>to the children of illegal immigrants. For context, we return, as the<br>Supreme Court does, to the words of the original authors of the<br>Amendment in question. Senator Jacob Howard worked closely with Abraham<br>Lincoln in drafting and passing the 13th Amendment (which abolished<br>slavery). He also served on the Senate Joint Committee on<br>Reconstruction, which drafted the 14th Amendment. In 1866, Senator<br>Howard clearly spelled out the intent of the 14th Amendment by writing<br>(emphasis mine):<br><br>> Every person born within the limits of the United States, and subject<br>> to their jurisdiction, is by virtue of natural law and national law a<br>> citizen of the United States. **This will not, of course, include<br>> persons born in the United States who are foreigners, aliens, who<br>> belong to the families of ambassadors or foreign ministers accredited<br>> to the Government of the United States**, but will include every other<br>> class of persons. It settles the great question of citizenship and<br>> removes all doubt as to what persons are or are not citizens of the<br>> United States. This has long been a great desideratum in the<br>> jurisprudence and legislation of this country.<br><br>Clearly, from the plain wording of the writers of the 14th Amendment, it<br>was never intended to grant citizenship to children of illegals. Doesn't<br>seem very "shaky" to me.<br><br>In actuality, [[according to Ilya Shapiro of the CATO<br>Institute](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=0372f5&url=https://www.cato.org/blog/birthright-citizenship-constitutionally-required){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="cato.org"}]{.qlink_container}, that phrase was originally<br>written to exclude the children of Native American tribes from American<br>citizenship, since those children were subject to the jurisdiction of<br>Native American tribal government, and were citizens of their tribe, not<br>of the United States. The amendment was also written to guarantee the<br>citizenship of freed slaves and their children, in opposition to the<br>*Dred Scott* ruling.<br><br>Trump knows that if he does this as an EO, it will immediately be<br>challenged in one of the circuits (it's always a safe bet to bet on the<br>9th Circus to challenge Trump's EOs), and it will end up at the Supreme<br>Court.<br><br>Which is exactly what Trump wants.<br><br>Even if Congress passed a law banning birthright citizenship, it would<br>still be challenged. Regardless, it's going to end up with SCOTUS one<br>way or another.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
