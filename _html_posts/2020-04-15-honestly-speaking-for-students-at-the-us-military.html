<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Honestly speaking, for students at the US military academies (West<br>Point, USNA, USAFA, USCGA) how much do your academy grades truly matter<br>for your military career (as long as you pass)? Does having top grades<br>increase your chances to make flag rank?**<br><br>Your grades do not matter for your military career. Having top grades<br>did not increase your chances to become a general officer.<br><br>Some useful catch-phrases we used to have:<br><br>- 2.0 and go! (Pronounced "two-oh and go") Meaning: if you were pilot<br>  qualified, all you had to do was pass and you'd go to pilot training.<br>- What do you call the last graduate in the Order of Merit? Lieutenant.<br>  Meaning: just like you call the first graduate in the Order of Merit.<br><br>We also used to say that you were "maxin' the min" if you did the<br>minimum required to "fill the squares" and pass.<br><br>Now, all of that said, grades can be an indicator of someone with solid<br>career potential. If someone has the ability to achieve academically at<br>the Academy, there's a good chance that they will be able to do<br>everything needed in order to achieve during their career as well.<br><br>So while high grades are *usually* an indication of someone who has high<br>potential (HiPo), high grades are not required in order to be HiPo.<br>Remember, Patton struggled academically during his first year at West<br>Point and had to repeat it after failing math. He got a tutor and<br>eventually graduated 46th out of 103 cadets in his class.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
