<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Short answer: no.<br><br>Longer answer: The "gun show loophole" does not exist. First of all,<br>private party sales usually do not take place at a "gun show." And a<br>"loophole" would be a way to follow the law but get an outcome the law<br>was trying to prevent. Allowing private party sales without a background<br>check was a specifically-authorized provision in the Gun Control Act.<br>They did not want to make it so onerous on private party transactions,<br>since only gun dealers can perform background checks. You can force all<br>transactions, commercial or private, to go through a dealer with a<br>Federal Firearms License (and indeed, some states have already done<br>this), but the Federal law says that private party transactions do not<br>require a background check. That's the "loophole" that the anti-gun<br>crowd is erroneously pointing out. It's not a loophole, it was<br>intentional.<br><br>If I'm a gun dealer at a gun show, I will perform a background check on<br>any person buying a gun. But what if I were to see that buyer (and I'm<br>another visitor, not a dealer), and I tell that guy that I have a gun in<br>my car that I'd like to sell him, and we walk out to my car and I sell<br>him that gun, I don't need to perform a background check. It's a private<br>party sale. Did that take place at a gun show? Well, in the parking lot,<br>not necessarily within the show itself. Since this sometimes happens (I<br>mean, where better to find people who want to buy guns?), the anti-gun<br>crowd hoisted the erroneous mantle of "gun shows are where you can buy<br>guns without a background check."<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
