<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If the police bang on your door and you let them in but they don\'t<br>have a warrant do they then have the right to search because you<br>voluntarily let them in?**<br><br>The answer, as with all legal answers, is "it depends."<br><br>Without a search warrant, if you simply allow them in the front door<br>without granting them permission to search, the police cannot "touch" or<br>"move" anything inside of your house in order to find evidence. They can<br>only look with their eyes at the interior spaces of your house. That<br>said, if you left your crack pipe on the coffee table (in "plain sight,"<br>the basis for the "plain sight" exception to the warrant requirement),<br>the police can take the pipe into evidence. Additionally, the presence<br>of the pipe provides probable cause to apply for a full search warrant<br>to find the crack cocaine which goes in the pipe. Police can call that<br>evidence in pretty quickly and use it as the basis for a search warrant.<br><br>Now, if the police come and bang on your door and you let them in and<br>they ask you if they can search your house *and you grant them<br>permission to search*, this obviates the need for a warrant, because you<br>granted permission to search. Note that the homeowner does not need to<br>be the grantor; anyone in the house over 18 years old can grant<br>permission to search the house. There are some specific rules<br>surrounding locked spaces inside the house and whether or not the person<br>granting permission has authority to access those spaces, but in<br>general, the police do not need a warrant if you grant them permission<br>to search.<br><br>\<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*This answer is not a substitute for professional legal advice or a<br>solicitation to offer legal advice regarding specific facts.
