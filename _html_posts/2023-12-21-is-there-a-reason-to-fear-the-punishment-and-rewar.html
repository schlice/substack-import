<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>No! None whatsoever!<br><br>I think the best way to look at it is this:<br><br>If you believe that, at the end of your life, you will simply blink out<br>of existence, and you will just be gone, like what happens to you when<br>you are unconscious, **then that is what will happen to you when you<br>die.**ยน You will simply blink out of existence. You're not *actively<br>sinning for the sake of rejecting God* (because then there may be some<br>issue of punishment). You just don't believe that any of it is real.<br>You're not actively rejecting God because you don't believe that God<br>exists. You just live your life, and you die.<br><br>For those of us who believe in a creator God, and who believe in His<br>salvific work on our lives, we will be saved, and we will not simply<br>blink out of existence. We will get to spend *eternity* with Him.<br><br>BUT, I will say this:<br><br>If you at all are curious or worried or wondering about a punishment,<br>you are experiencing *conviction*. Your conscience is telling you that<br>there might be something out there that you ought to think about. If you<br>are at all convicted, you owe it to yourself to investigate whether<br>or not there is anything to this religion thing. Ignore the religious<br>nuts. They'll be screaming about "fire and brimstone," and while there<br>are some nuggets of truth to what they say, their "method of delivery"<br>of that message is a little harsh. But there are some logical, rational<br>reasons to believe that a creator God exists and we should learn more<br>about Him.<br><br>If you want to learn more about that possibility, literally take fifteen<br>minutes out of your life and [[watch this<br>video](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=bb66d4&url=https://youtu.be/NnnSS0_-xoA?si%3DO9TM4OgvGCNzCuYH){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="youtu.be"}]{.qlink_container}. It costs you nothing to<br>watch.<br><br>\<br><br>ยน I'm fully aware that this view is unbiblical. I'm also fully aware<br>that atheists do not care one whit for what is biblical.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
