Is it not<br>like any side would budge?**<br><br>You are correct. But Congress takes the opportunity to debate to try and<br>influence you, the voting public.<br><br>In fact, this entire impeachment sham is solely for your benefit, to<br>try to change your vote in November, 2020. That's all this is: a<br>televised, fully-government-funded, campaign ad on how bad of an Orange<br>Man Trump is, to try to get you to change your vote.<br><br>The writing's on the wall. It's easy to see why this is all happening,<br>if you take the time to look at it objectively.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
