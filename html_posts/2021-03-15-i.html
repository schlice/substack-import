**I'm worried that I have blasphemed the HS because I still have desire
of sin but I force myself not to, and if anyone has the HS they have no
desires of sin and I thought, is this the D-vil?**

I had to read through this a few times to find the issue, and I finally
found it:

***if anyone has the HS they have no desires of sin***

Wow, really? I had no idea that when the Holy Spirit indwells a person
that they magically are no longer human! Man, I have no idea what's
wrong with me, because sadly I'm still human. My human body still wants
to do what it wants to do. It is still flawed.

But here's the good news: *the blood of Jesus has cleansed us of our
sin.*

Does this mean that the *desire* to sin has disappeared? Not at all. We
are still human, and we still desire to sin. Even Jesus, who was without
sin, was not without human desire. He felt everything that we feel. He
knows exactly what it's like to be human, because he humbled himself to
take on human form.

***His death and resurrection paid for our sins; past, present, and
future.***

Yes, we will sin again. We are human. We will desire to sin. But in our
sanctification, that desire to sin will be lessened, over time, as God
works to perfect us. It is a gradual process which *improves* our human
nature; it does not *supplant* it.

Keep working at it. It pleases God to see you trying your best. Even if
you fail sometimes, he understands. Keep talking to him about it (some
people call it "praying"). He wants to know all about you (even though
he already knows everything you know before you even think it). It's not
that he doesn't know it; he just wants to hear it from you. He wants you
to admit it to yourself and he wants you to turn it over to him.
