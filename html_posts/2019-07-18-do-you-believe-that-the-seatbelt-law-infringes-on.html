**Do you believe that the seatbelt law infringes on your individual
rights?**

If you do, then you don't realize in what areas of your life you have
"individual rights" and what areas you do not.

You don't have the right to demand the freedom to exercise your
individual rights when you are participating in a state-controlled
activity.

- You have to have a driver's license and you have to meet all the
  requirements of having one.
- You have to have a registered car, and you must pay the state for the
  privilege of driving your car on public roads.

So the seat belt law certainly does not "infringe on my individual
rights."

It may be a stupid law, especially for passengers (but even this is
debatable), but it does not infringe on individual rights.
