**An order from the president through the Sec of Def to shoot down a
commercial airliner would next be given to what officer (name, rank,
service branch)?**

Actually, it's anyone in the [[National Command
Authority](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=b33986&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Command_Authority){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container} who can issue that order,
and it would not go through the SecDef. The President, the Vice
Presient, the SecDef, or any other member of the NCA can issue the
order.

The order goes right back to the person reporting that a commercial
airliner needs to be shot down, and that person is **the Command
Director of the currently on-staff NORAD crew.** It's not a person we
can name; each crew has its own Command Director (the guy in charge),
and he or she is always an O-6 or higher (yes, we do have some 1-stars
who still sit CD). But since NORAD is a *combined command*, this could
be an officer from either the US or Canadian military.

Ccommercial airliners would only be targeted if

- They crossed the ADIZ into North America (this has changed somewhat
  since 9/11)
- They did not have a valid flight plan

or

- They deviated significantly from their flight plan
- They were acting in a threatening manner, or they were threatening a
  civilian population
- They refused to respond to radio calls and shots across the bow.

I've answered a very similar question in the past, but I can't seem to
find it at the moment. When I do, I'll link it here. Basically, NORAD
would identify the aberrant aircraft (along with assistance from the
regional aircraft control authority at the FAA), and if they determined
that a threat was a potential, they would scramble alert fighters to
intercept the aircraft. If the aircraft refused to respond to radio
calls and shots across the bow (fighter aircraft crossing the aircraft's
flight path at a visually close range), the NCA would be contacted for
direction. The NCA representative would make a command decision on how
to treat the aircraft, and NORAD would direct its fighters to respond
appropriately.
