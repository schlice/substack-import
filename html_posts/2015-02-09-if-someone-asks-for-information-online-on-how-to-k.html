**Content:** [Legally, assisted suicide is a suicide committed with the
aid of another person. Physician assisted suicide is where a doctor
assists by providing the knowledge and the means for a person to end
their own life.\
\
Euthanasia is slightly different from physician assisted suicide. In
euthanasia, the physician actually administers the drugs themselves to
end the person\'s life. In physician assisted suicide, the physician
provides the drugs and the information on how to use them, but the
patient administers the drugs himself.\
\
If you provide someone with the information they need for the express
purpose for them to use to commit suicide, knowing that they want to
commit suicide, you could be charged with assisting a suicide if it is
illegal in your jurisdiction. I think that I would avoid providing
anyone information on how to take their own life as this is a
questionable legal area.]{.rendered_qtext}
