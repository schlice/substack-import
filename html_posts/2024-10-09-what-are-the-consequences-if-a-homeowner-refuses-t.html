When a lien is placed on a house and then that lien is foreclosed on,
the home is sold without the homeowner's agreement. Basically, when a
lien is foreclosed, the homeowner no longer has a say in what happens to
it.

When the sale is completed, the homeowner is advised to vacate the home
and is given an appropriate amount of time to do so. The Notice to
Vacate will specify a date by which the home must be vacated. If the
home is still occupied on the date that the home transfers to the
possession of the lender, the Sheriff's Office will remove the residents
from the home, and any remaining items within the home will be moved
into storage at the resident's expense.

All outstanding liens against the home will be paid, and any remaining
balance will be returned to the former owner, or any amount owed will be
assessed against the former owner. Usually, the proceeds from the sale
are sufficient to satisfy any and all liens against the property.
