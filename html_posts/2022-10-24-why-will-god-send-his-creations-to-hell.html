God doesn't send anyone to hell. **Those who go actively choose to go
there.**

God didn't create hell for us. God created hell for Satan and his
minions, since He needed someplace that was not going to be His, a place
completely devoid of His presence. A wasteland. Some places in the Bible
call it "a lake of fire."

However, man's disobedience and betrayal of God caused sin to enter into
the human condition, and caused Satan to become the (current) ruler of
the world. Thanks to Adam's sin, we inherited a fallen world, and we
live in sinful, fallen bodies. We know pain, we know disease, we know
suffering, and we know death, because of that one action.

But there is hope, and it is God who gives us that hope. In fact, the
entire theme of all 66 books of the Bible is the story of God's
creation, the fall of man, and God's work to redeem mankind to himself.
