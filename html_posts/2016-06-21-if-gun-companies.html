The logical fallacy you have committed is called a **false
equivalency**, believing that somehow the two facts you stated are
related. Let me explain where you went wrong.

Gun company stock reacts positively to tragedies because Democrats
always, without fail, immediately call for the banning of guns. When
Democrats claim that guns are the problem in mass killings, people fear
that some way, somehow, they will succeed in restricting the most
popular rifle in America (the AR-15), and if they were contemplating
buying one anyway, this pushes them over the edge. So gun company stock
reacts positively to Democrats threatening to shutting down their sales.

The NRA does not want to block the sale of guns because there is no
reason to do so. The gun is not the culprit; the killer is. The killer
passed every background check he was given, so adding more background
checks wouldn't have stopped him. Banning guns from law-abiding citizens
wouldn't have stopped him either; as a contractor for the government, he
would still have had access to guns, just as the police would after a
complete gun ban as well. The NRA is, rightly, opposed to punishing gun
manufacturers because the gun is not the problem.

So since the two facts you quoted are unrelated, your equivalency is
also invalid.
