**Content:** [I agree with [[Robert J.
Kolker](https://www.quora.com/profile/Robert-J-Kolker)]{.qlink_container}
that social services would decline.\
\
But from a purely Libertarian perspective, they should. The government
should not be redistributing people\'s wealth. Supporting the poor is
something that individuals and charitable organizations do for each
other. Government should get out of the welfare game; it was never
designed to be a welfare supplier, and shouldn\'t be one now.\
\
The Declaration of Independence said that people have the right, and the
government should protect, the \"pursuit\" of happiness. Government was
never designed to \"supply\" happiness.]{.rendered_qtext}
