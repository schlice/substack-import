**Content:** [*[In General:]{.underline}*\
\
People are tried and convicted following the law in place at the time.
If the law changes, the conviction still stands.\
\
For example, let\'s say that you\'re tried and convicted under a certain
law, and then while you\'re incarcerated, they change the law and make
that act legal. Should your conviction be thrown out? Since you were
convicted under the law that was in place at the time, your conviction
stands. You might fight with your lawyer to be re-tried, but double
jeopardy applies, and you can\'t be tried again for a crime for which
you\'ve already been convicted, even if the law changes.\
\
The relevant law is the *ex post facto* rule, and it is in the
Constitution (Article 1, Section 9, Clause 3). It basically states that
the Federal (or State) governemnt cannot retroactively change the legal
consequences of actions that were committed before the enactment of the
law.\
\
However, this is the opposite of an *ex post facto* law because it
**decriminalizes** certain behavior. This is more a form of an amnesty
law, and is an exception to the *ex post facto* law, and is generally
called ***in mitius*** (literally: to make mild). This is technically
legal, but it frowned upon in general. Under the principle of the
amnesty law, the new punishment would now apply, and the convict should
now be convicted to life in prison with no parole.\
\
*[The NE Case In Specific:]{.underline}*\
\
In the Nebraska case, there are a few things going on.\
\
]{.rendered_qtext}

- The law was passed with a 90-day implementation period to allow for
  legal challenges to it, which are pending. Executions can proceed
  during that 90-days. Nebraska\'s referendum process allows for
  citizens to suspend the implementation of a law if they can gather
  enough signatures (10% of the voting population) within 90 days of the
  law\'s passage.\
- The supplies for the 10 executions have already been purchased and are
  being shipped, and the governor said he wasn\'t going to cancel that
  order.\
- Opponents of the change note that the Nebraska constitution requires
  that the Board of Pardons has the sole authority to change final
  sentences, therefore the law is unconstitutional. The AG\'s office
  cites a portion of the law which reads, \"It is the intent of the
  Legislature that in any criminal proceeding in which the death penalty
  has been imposed but not carried out prior to the effective date of
  this act, such penalty shall be changed to life imprisonment.\" The
  AG\'s office says that this wording is unconstitutional.\
- Supporters say that the law isn\'t changing the sentences. It\'s
  simply removing the death penalty as a punishment, so the state will
  have no way to carry out the sentences of the 10 people on death row.
  Legislators note that \"intent language\" is not law, and doesn\'t
  carry the force of law.
