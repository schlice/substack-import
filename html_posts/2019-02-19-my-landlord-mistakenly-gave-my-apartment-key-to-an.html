**My landlord mistakenly gave my apartment key to an unauthorized person
who stole from me? What kind of attorney should I talk to?**

First, you should start with the theft. If you haven't filed a police
report, you should.

Once the thief is captured, the stolen property will be returned
(whatever property they still have possession of). The District
Attorney's office will represent the state in that action. They will
prosecute the thief, but that won't get you any money back for the items
which he/she stole.

You will have to then personally file suit against the thief for the
monetary value of the stolen items which you didn't get back, and the
landlord for granting access to your apartment to an unauthorized person
in violation of your lease agreement. You will need to hire a real
estate attorney in your area who specializes in landlord/tenant law to
help you with that.
