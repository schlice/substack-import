Asking why God does anything is a challenging thing to do from the
get-go.

If there is an all-knowing, all-powerful God of the Universe (and we can
prove that such a creator God exists), then we would rightly expect that
His motivations for His actions would be, largely, unknown to us. Since
there would be so many things that He would know and we would not, it
would be virtually impossible for us to understand His reasons for
certain actions unless He deigned to explain them to us. And Scripture
tells us that He does not frequently do that. Solomon wrote in Proverbs
25:2, "It is the glory of God to conceal a matter\[.\]" Isaiah 45:15
states, "Truly You are a God who hides Himself." 1 Corinthians 2:11
says, "No one knows the thoughts of God except the Spirit of God."
Deuteronomy 29:29 reads, "The secret things belong to the Lord our God"
(NKJV). Ecclesiastes 11:5 proclaims, "As you do not know the path of the
wind, or how the body is formed in a mother's womb, so you cannot
understand the work of God, the Maker of all things." Isaiah 55:8-9
teaches, "'For My thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways
My ways,' declares the Lord. 'As the heavens are higher than the earth,
so are My ways higher than your ways and My thoughts than your
thoughts.'"

Clearly, Scripture tells us we lack the capacity to grasp God's infinite
mind or the way He intervenes in our lives. How arrogant of us to think
otherwise. Trying to analyze His omnipotence is like an amoeba
attempting to comprehend the behavior of man. Romans 11:33 (NKJV)
indicates that God's judgments are "unsearchable" and His ways "past
finding out". Similar language is found in 1 Corinthians 2:16: "Who has
known the mind of the Lord that he may instruct Him?" Unless the Lord
chooses to explain Himself to us, which He does not often do, His
motivation and purposes are beyond the reach of mortal man.

Revelation 4:11 declares (emphasis mine): "You are worthy, O Lord, to
receive glory and honor and power; for you created all things, and by
**Your will** they exist and were created." The takeaway from this verse
is that God freely chose to create and was not constrained by any
outside force or by some need to fill a deficiency. Psalm 115:3 says:
"But our God is in heaven; He does whatever He pleases." The simple
answer to the question, therefore, is that God **wanted** to create
humans, so He did.

But just because God didn't create us because He needed to doesn't mean
He doesn't care about His creation, or that people are somehow
unimportant to God. Among all of His creation, only humans were created
in the image of God. As theologian Wayne Grudem rightly commented:

> Someone might wonder, if God does not need us for anything, then are
> we important at all? Is there any significance to our existence or to

> that we are in fact very meaningful because God has created us and
> determined that we would be *meaningful to him*. That is the final
> definition of genuine significance (Grudem, 1994, p. 162, italics in
> original).

In other words, God created us of His free will. The fact that He
created us in His image implies our meaning and our importance.

It is also said that God created us "for His glory." But what does that
mean?

> Everyone who is called by My name, Whom I have created for My glory, I
> have formed him, yes, I have made him --- Isaiah 43:7

What does *that* mean? Some people (some of whom I have had the pleasure
of interacting with on this forum) have suggested that if the God of the
Bible made humans simply "for His glory," then this would imply that God
is an egotistical dictator who simply wanted more "subjects" to grovel
at His feet and tell Him how great He is.

But if God is omnipotent (fully complete, lacking nothing), then He
doesn't *need* praise. So that can't be it. It must be, then, that not
only are we designed to bring glory to God, but we are also designed to
enjoy God's glory *and find our own completeness in it.* It is a perfect
feedback loop of humans receiving God's glory, responding with obedience
and praise, and being complete and fulfilled by their reception of God's
glory as well as by their proper response to it. We can say, then, that
God created humans to live blissfully perfect lives receiving and
reciprocating His glory.

\

That said, does that always happen? No. In fact, it hardly ever happens.
The fact remains that sin has infected this world. We experience
hardships and suffering. We experience both joy and pain.

But we know how we were designed. We know that God's plans for us are
always for our good, never for harm. And we can trust that He loves us,
knows us, and cares for us. So if you're ever feeling like no one cares
whether or not you're alive, you're wrong. At least One does.
