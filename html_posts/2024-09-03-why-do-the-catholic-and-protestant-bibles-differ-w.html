Let's do a quick and dirty history of the Bible. There are many details
which are left out of this brief history, but it is sufficient to
understand why some books were left out of the Protestant Bible.

Starting from thousands of years before Christ was born, the Jewish Holy
Scriptures were written in Hebrew. But by about the third century B.C.,
the language of the common man was Greek. Hebrew was limited to those
who worked routinely with the original Holy Scriptures. It was mostly
scholars and Rabbis who read Hebrew. So the people wanted a common
translation of the Holy Scriptures into their common language. This
Greek translation of the Holy Scriptures is known as the *Septuagint*.

When the Roman Catholic Church canonized its Bible, it accepted the
Septuagint, since that is what the Jews of the day accepted as *their*
Holy Scripture. The Septuagint, however, had a few additions made to it
during the time of its creation, a few books which were never written in
the original Hebrew. Nevertheless, the Catholic Church, in creating
their Bible, accepted the Septuagint as it was. They created a Latin
translation of the Greek Septuagint, adding the New Testament volumes,
and created what they called the *Vulgate*.

This pretty much stood this way for the first several hundred years of
the Catholic Church, until the Protestant Reformation. The reformers
rejected everything that was centered on Rome, including their Bible.
The Vulgate was therefore summarily rejected by the Protestant
reformers, but now they needed a translation of the Jewish Holy
Scriptures that they could use.

Fortunately, the Jews had gone through sort of a "rediscovery" period of
their own during this time. Jewish scholars produced a new version of
the original Hebrew texts (not translated, also in Hebrew) called the
*Masoretic Texts*. Not surprisingly, this re-write did not include any
of the books that were *only* written in Koine Greek, because *they*
believe that those books were not part of the original Holy Scriptures
and were thus summarily rejected.

The Protestant reformers, like the Catholic Church before them, simply
accepted the Masoretic Texts as they stood, and incorporated them into
their own Bible translations, without the additional books which could
be found in the Septuagint. The Protestant Bible does not include those
additional seven books because they do not appear in the Masoretic
Texts.
