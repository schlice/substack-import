**Content:** [It depends on your definition of \"held accountable.\"\
\
If \"held accountable\" means \"retribution,\" you may not be satisfied.
The court may not rule against the criminal, in which case you won\'t
get your \"pound of flesh.\"\
\
If \"held accountable\" means \"judged fairly by the court,\" then the
adjudication the criminal receives should be enough to see that the
person is \"held accountable.\"]{.rendered_qtext}
