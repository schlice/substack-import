No.

**God the Father is God. Jesus is God. The Holy Spirit is God.**

But

**God the Father is not Jesus. Jesus is not the Holy Spirit. God the
Father is not the Holy Spirit.**

The Trinity is a challenging concept, and trying to conceptualize in a
human fashion something that is beyond our comprehension is always going
to be a daunting task.

Any time you ask yourself a "Can God..." question, the answer is ***yes,
God can***. So can Jesus fulfill a prophecy through someone today using
the Holy Spirit? Yes, God can.

But whether or not He *will* is dependent on Him and the prophecy. Most
of the remaining prophecies will be fulfilled at the end of the age.
