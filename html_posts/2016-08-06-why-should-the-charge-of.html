The 4th Amendment does not protect you against "arbitrary" arrest, which
is not a legal term. All arrests are, in one way or another, arbitrary.
It's the officer's word against the suspect, who always claim they did
nothing wrong. The 4th Amendment specifically says "\[t\]he right of the
people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects,
against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and
no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or
affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and
the persons or things to be seized.\" This means that you are protected
against **unreasonable** searches and seizures by the government. It
says nothing at all about being charged with a crime or arrested.

The police can arrest you for a violation of any law. The District
Attorney is left with the task of proving what you did in court.
Generally, the police provide enough evidence that you did what you were
arrested for doing. That's how the system works: the police arrest you,
the police provide the evidence to the DA, and the DA takes you to
court. The DA and the police wouldn't get very far if they arrested
people who didn't do what they were accused of doing.

White was arrested for refusing to follow orders, refusing to provide
identification, and resisting arrest. The officer in question was
investigated by the department (as is every use of force) and was found
to have committed "no wrongdoing." The department reviewed the video,
and found that the officer did not use excessive force or violate the
law. Chief Vera Bumpers said, "He explained what was going on, what the
violation was and that he was focused on her safety, as well as his."

If White feels that her rights were violated, she is free to file a
lawsuit against the department. Her case got the attention of the local
NAACP chapter, so maybe they can hire an attorney for her.
