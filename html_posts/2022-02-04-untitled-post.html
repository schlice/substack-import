The municipal judge did what he was supposed to do, in cases where
children want abortions without parental consent, and appeal to the
court. Florida makes them prove they are intelligent enough to
understand their choice. The judge evaluated everything the law told him
to evaluate, and that included intelligence.

She claimed she was a B student but her grades showed she had a 2.0 GPA
(which, in case you don't know letter grades, is not a B). The judge
said because of that, she was either lying, or stupid. Or, in
judge-speak, "she either has a lack of intelligence, or a lack of
credibility."

She won on appeal, because the local court judge did not allow her to
clarify her statement. Yes, she had a 2.0 GPA, but she was now making
B's and was hoping to pull up her GPA. She acknowledged she was not
ready to be a mother. She also researched, and found she did not want to
carry the baby to term to give it up for adoption, and she also stated
she wanted to consult with her doctor (which also requires parental
consent, or a court order).

Hope that helps to clear it up a little.

Original question:

\"either a lack of intelligence or credibility\", is why a judge denied
a 17 yr old an abortion without parental consent. This is in Florida.
Would a lack of those attributes be a good reason to become a parent at
any age? She did appeal and won.
