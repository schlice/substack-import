In nearly all states, if you have a pre-existing rental agreement, the
landlord cannot *force* you to move. He can sell the house with you
still in it. But that's a downside for him, because, well, *you live
there*. If he wanted to sell the house to a family who wants to move in
right away, he can't because you're still there. Selling the house with
you still in it limits his potential buyer pool.

He is still allowed to *sell* the house, and he is still allowed to
*show* the house. He should work with you so that you can prepare the
house for showing (i.e. providing 24 hours notice before a showing), but
these details are part of your lease agreement. It specifies the
timeframe that he has to give you before he can enter the house.

Unless you have violated your lease agreement, the landlord can't force
you to leave. He can *negotiate* with you to leave early (usually by
offering you money to do so). But beware, if you enter into an agreement
to leave early, and then you don't, you would be violating your
agreement and you could be *evicted*, which no one wants.

Ultimately, though, he could just wait you out until the end of your
lease agreement and then simply not renew your lease, in which case you
would be forced to move out.

You are better off negotiating an early departure from your lease.

**And on a second note,**

You said that you have a disability and you need repairs. Your landlord
must make these repairs, or he must allow you to do so. Quoting from an

Your landlord must still treat you as his tenant while you live there,
even though he wants you to leave.

This part is important: **if you feel like your landlord is holding your
repairs over your head, or he won't repair the property and instead
wants you to leave, contact an attorney in your area who handles
disability rights cases. Your landlord may be in violation of the law.**

While your landlord does not have to renew your lease at the end of your
lease term, he still must treat you appropriately while you live there.

Usually, getting a certified letter from an attorney is enough to get
the landlord back on track with his responsibilities under the law.

Good luck!

Original question:

Can my landlord give me a verbal notice to move? I am disabled and ask
for some repairs to aid in my disability, then he calls me and tells me
I need to move as he\'s selling the house. I\'ve lived here for 12
years.
