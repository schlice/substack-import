**Why do Trump fans care so much about whether Hillary broke the law but
not seem to want to find out if Russia helped Trump steal the
election?**

*We know that Hillary broke the law, and no one seems to care.* We know
that Hillary met all the elements of crimes under the Espionage Act by
sending classified email using an unclassified email system. We know
that the contents of those emails was leaked. There does not need to be
intent in order to violate the Espionage Act. Comey inserted intent
where the law does not require intent.

In contrast, *we have yet to see any proof that anything at all illegal
took place between Trump and the Russians, and yet we seem to be
scrambling to look under every rock to try to find something*. We know
that Trump's transition team spoke with many foreign countries, but that
was after the election was won. There is, as of yet, not a single shred
of proof that anyone from Trump's team asked the Russians to do anything
at all to swing the election in Trump's favor. There's no proof that the
Russians did anything that actually *could* have swung the election in
Trump's favor. There was no vote tampering. There was no voter
suppression; this much has been confirmed by the states. Everyone was
able to vote, and everyone voted their consciences. So the only thing
the Russians could have "hacked" is the mind of the American voter, and
that's not illegal (yet). In theory, if Trump used campaign money to
finance Russian efforts to swing the election in his favor, this may
have violated campaign finance rules.

Kinda like the way the DNC used campaign money to finance the anti-Trump
dossier fabricated by Fusion GPS, but again, we're talking about Trump
here, not Hillary's crimes...sorry, I keep getting off track.

**At this point, it's clear that the election was not "stolen."** The
fact that we have not yet gotten past this point is beginning to show a
desperation on the part of Democrats to steadfastly refuse to believe
the fact that they had a terrible candidate that a soppy dish sponge
could have beaten by a wider margin than Trump took. The election was
not stolen. Period. Did Trump do something illegal? Highly doubtful, as
*he didn't need to*.
