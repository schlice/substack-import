**What can you do if your HOA is corrupt and incompetent?**

"Corrupt" means they are violating laws. Get together with your
neighbors, retain a real estate attorney, and file a lawsuit.

"Incompetent" means they don't know how to manage money, or they don't
know how to properly discharge their duties. While not illegal, it's not
a great situation to find yourself in. In this scenario, you can either

- move, or
- run for the Board and fix the problems yourself.

I did the latter. I served six years on our Board, three as President.
I'd like to say I fixed many of the problems. Some remain unfixed, but
at least it was the choice of all the homeowners to leave it that way.

Then I moved.
