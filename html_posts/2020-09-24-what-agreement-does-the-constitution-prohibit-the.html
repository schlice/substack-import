**What agreement does the Constitution prohibit the states from
making?**

The Constitution prohibits the states from entering into *compacts* with
each other without Congressional approval.

Article I, Section 10, Clause 3:

> No state shall, without the consent of Congress...enter into any
> Agreement or Compact with another State, or with a foreign Power\...\"

This doesn't mean that states can't enter into interstate compacts. It
simply means that they can't do so *without Congressional approval*.
Congress is specifically looking for compacts which make the new group
of states *more politically powerful* than it was before, because they
are *required to approve those*.

There are over 200 active compacts in the United States. 22 of them are
national, several of them with over 35 member states. More than 30 are
regional, each of them with 8 or more member
states.[\[1\]](#BYYzp){#cite-BYYzp .citation_link}
