The most complete list of side effects of Zoloft I've seen so far:

- sleepiness
- drowsiness
- tired feeling
- nervousness
- **sleep problems (insomnia)**
- dizziness
- nausea
- skin rash
- headache
- **diarrhea**
- **constipation**
- upset stomach
- stomach pain
- dry mouth
- changes in appetite
- **abnormal ejaculation**
- **impotence**
- **decreased sex drive**
- **difficulty having an orgasm**
- weight loss

MS can cause bowel/bladder problems, as well as causing sexual
dysfunction, so I've highlighted some symptoms in the above list which
are also common in MS. Some of the other side effects may be associated
with the MS medications, but those are dependent on which MS medication
you are taking.
