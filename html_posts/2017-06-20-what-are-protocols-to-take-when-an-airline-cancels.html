There aren't any protocols to follow. There are simply a few things to
know.

The most important thing to find out is ***why*** the flight was
cancelled. There is only one distinction you need to worry about:
whether or not the cancellation was within the control of the airline.

If your flight was cancelled because of weather, natural disaster,
unnatural disaster, crew delayed because of weather, or *any other
reason outside of the control of the airline*, you're at the mercy of
the airline when it comes to getting to your destination. They will get
you there, but it will be on their terms, on their schedule. And in such
a case, if the next available flight is the next day, don't expect the
airline to put you up in a hotel or pay for your meals.

If your flight was cancelled because a scheduled crew didn't show up, or
because of a crew mix-up, or because of a mechanical failure, or *any
other reason within the control of the airline*, you are covered. The
airline will try to get you on the next available flight which still has
seats available. If the next available flight is the next day, they will
pay for a hotel room and pay for your meals while you wait.
Alternatively, under "Rule 240," you can have your ticket switched to an
airline which *does* have flights with available seats which will reach
your destination before your carrier can get you there.
