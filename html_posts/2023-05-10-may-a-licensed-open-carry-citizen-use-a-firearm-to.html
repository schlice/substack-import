**Content:** []{.rendered_qtext}

First, we must start with this: **If you carry a firearm, you**
***must*** **know the laws in your area surrounding when you may use
your firearm.** This is an absolute must. Do not pass GO, do not collect
\$200, until you know the law in your area. Full stop.

That said, in general, your personal carry firearm is for your personal
protection. You use it when you feel you are in danger of ***losing your
life*** or **suffering** ***grave bodily harm***. This includes
**kidnapping** and **rape** as those imply a risk of death or grave
bodily harm. Defense of others falls under the heading of self-defense,
so you can defend someone from a kidnapping, a rape, or a murder
attempt.

In about half of US states, you can use deadly force to prevent
**robbery** (forcible theft from your person). And in some states, you
can use it to prevent **arson** (even arson that doesn\'t threaten death
or serious bodily injury, such as arson of some outbuilding) or
**burglary** of your home or possibly even your business or workplace.

\

***BEYOND THAT***, you may not use your firearm. You're not a police
officer. Your gun is to protect you from death, not to prevent crime. If
you draw your firearm when you see a law infraction or a misdemeanor,
you will be arrested and charged with any number of crimes: brandishing
a firearm, assault with a deadly weapon, false arrest, kidnapping, and
more.
