**Should it be allowable for apartment complexes, HOAs, condo
associations etc to ban the ownership of specific breeds and sizes of
dogs?**

Absolutely. HOAs have broad control over how they run the areas within
their purview.

If there is a valid reason which furthers the goal of an HOA (to
safeguard all residents and keep home values as high as possible), then
they should absolutely be allowed to control the breeds and sizes of
dogs which live in the community, along with total numbers of dogs you
should be allowed to keep on your property.
