**Why can\'t Americans compromise and have a minimal public healthcare
system which can be optionally expanded with private insurance?**

I really feel like that's going to be the compromise system we get to.
It will be a hybrid system combining some level of basic care for all,
along with private insurance beyond that.

It will essentially be some form of Medicare Part B for all, as a
function of being an American citizen. It will be automatic enrollment
in Medicare Part B. It will cover all basic healthcare. Any basic care
for which you see the doctor, from annual well visits to colds, flu,
broken bones and other injuries, allergies, upper respiratory
infections, pink eye, etc, would be covered and paid for by Medicare.

Any care beyond that (specialist care, more intensive care, etc) would
be covered by health insurance, which would be more akin to *actual*
insurance. It would indemnify you against charges above a deductible. It
would require you to coordinate your care through the insurance
provider, in the same way your auto insurance will reimburse you for an
auto repair once you've paid your deductible.
