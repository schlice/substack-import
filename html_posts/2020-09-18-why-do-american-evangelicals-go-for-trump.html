**Why do American evangelicals go for Trump?**

Oh, that's easy, which is why I can speak for Evangelicals even though I
am not one.

We live under a president who has more aggressively defended religious
freedom than any US president in modern history. And we want to keep
that.

President Trump's record on defending religious freedom in America is
impressive, and it is growing. There is no sign that it is a shrinking
fad. We can expect a White House occupied by Joe Biden and Kamala Harris
to not just drop the Trump administration\'s defense of religious
freedom, but reverse course to start working aggressively against it.

History is our teacher. Joe Biden worked in an Obama White House which
did just this. His administration *aggressively* argued to the Supreme
Court that religious institutions should not have the freedom to
determine who teaches their faith. Thankfully, they were rejected by the
court, in a stunning 9--0 vote. But that didn't stop the administration
from attempting to tear down the First Amendment freedom of expressive
association, the doctrine of church autonomy, and the ministerial
exception. The latter was decided in the case of *Our Lady of Guadalupe
School v. Morrissey-Berru* just a few months prior. In that case, the
court held that the "ministerial exception" protects the right of
religious institutions to choose who teaches and passes down religious
doctrine when the teachers perform religious functions at the school.
When the Obama administration argued against that doctrine again in
[[*Hosanna Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church & School v.
EEOC,*](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=9ce71f&url=https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/hosanna-tabor-evangelical-lutheran-church-and-school-v-eeoc/){.external_link

aforementioned 9--0 vote.

And this is just one example. There are many examples of how the Trump
administration is upholding religious freedom, and it is only one of his
many other policy accomplishments. To us, it's a pretty important one.
And it is also clear that allowing anyone else in the White House in
November means that it probably won't last long, either.

Some people like to comment. Some people like to engage with me in a

Put anything vaguely harassing in there, and your deletion will be
