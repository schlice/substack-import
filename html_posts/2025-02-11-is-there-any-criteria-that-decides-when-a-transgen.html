No.

Because if you're born male, you'll always be male. No amount of surgery
or hormone injections will ever make you female. You'll never be a
"female-enough male" to participate in female sports.

Trans females are *unquestionably* biologically male and will never,
ever be female, regardless of the plastic surgery or the amount or
duration of hormone therapy they do.

People who are unquestionably one biological gender should not be
permitted to engage in sporting events which are exclusive to another
biological gender.

\

That said, we have a much bigger problem with how to handle *intersex*
people, which are an ocean's difference from *transgender* people.
Intersex people have an extremely rare condition that results in
apparent sex ambiguity. Their bodies are ambiguous, and biologically it
takes much more effort to determine an appropriate sporting category.
Transgender people, however, **aren't biologically sexually ambiguous at
all** but merely claim to identify as something other than their
biological sex, *regardless of what plastic surgery or hormone therapy
you have done*.

**But the existence of a tiny handful of intersex cases is completely
irrelevant to the issue of allowing unambiguous biological males in
female sports.**

\

Any "transgender policy" designed to protect female spaces and female
sporting events need only specify that participants must have been
recorded female at birth on their original birth certificates. If the
birth certificate was never issued (or someone wants to question their
birth certificate), then biology determines what your gender is for the
purpose of participating in sporting competition, not personal feelings
about your gender.

Crafting effective intersex policies is more complicated, but a much
less pressing issue for protecting the integrity of women's sports.
