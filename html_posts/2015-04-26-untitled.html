**Content:** [The fuel also burns under high pressure, which is why it
needed an accelerant on the ground or in order to start the engine. The
stuff just does not burn otherwise. There was one incident while I was
Active Duty where a KC-135 had both JP-4 and JP-7 in its wing tanks, and
it hit a ground obstruction. The JP-4 caught on fire, and the JP-7 put
it out.\
\
They only gave the plane enough fuel to get off the ground and get up to
the fueling orbit. It would tank, then go on its way. Starting the
engines was a hazardous job.]{.rendered_qtext}
