**I'm 13 and my nude that I was coerced into sending was leaked on
Discord. A lot of people have them and I visibly have my necklace,
house, and hair in it. What do I do?**

I'm sorry this has happened to you. The problem, of course, is that once
that information makes it to the Internet, it's forever. While it pains
me to say this, if it makes it out there uncontrolled like it has, there
is a very good chance that you will never be able to completely get rid
of it.

You have the option of using a data deletion service like
[[DeleteMe](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=3a6c18&url=https://joindeleteme.com){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="joindeleteme.com"}]{.qlink_container} (not a sponsor), but
it's not free. They have a pretty impressive record of removing
information you don't want out there anymore, and after a year or so,
they will probably have gotten most copies of the picture removed, but
again, this is the Internet we're talking about; you will probably not
be able to get all copies gone from everywhere.
