**Why is free speech the hill most conservatives want to die on when
nearly everyone is granted this? Is the issue more so on consequences or
criticism from free speech?**

You said that nearly everyone is granted this. Less than half of the
country does not believe this.

[[40% of the country believes that "hate speech" should be
regulated.](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=76975d&url=https://www.cato.org/survey-reports/state-free-speech-tolerance-america){.external_link

The problem: *"hate speech" is free speech.*

The First Amendment exists to protect speech you don't like. If everyone
spoke only things you like to hear, there would be no need for the First
Amendment in the first place. The fact that speech exists which you
don't like is an indication that it needs to be protected if we're going
to protect freedom of speech at all.

The issue is indeed about consequences or criticism from free speech.

- There should not be limits on what words you can say (unless we're
  talking about causing imminent harm or inciting a riot or speaking
  falsehoods).
- Similarly, **there should not be limits on** ***consequences*** **from
  your speech.**

For example, you can say whatever you believe about whatever topic you
like. However, if your employer finds that your words are incongruent
with their corporate philosophy, your free speech may cause you to lose
your job. This is all acceptable, and is a natural consequence of free
speech.

Putting limits on what words you can say *before you say it*, or trying
to divine what someone was *thinking* when interpreting the words they
spoke, is the exact opposite of free speech.
