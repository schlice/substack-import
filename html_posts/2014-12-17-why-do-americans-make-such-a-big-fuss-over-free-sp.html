so ingrained in the consciences of all men, that there was never any
thought that it would be violated. Even the King gave some modicum of
human dignity.\
\

thought needed to be protected in writing. Ones that the King routinely
violated. Ones that they believed would become the cornerstone for a new
type of free society.\
