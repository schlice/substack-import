Turn off iCloud Backup. Go to Settings \> *\<your name\>* \> iCloud \>
iCloud Backup. Uncheck iCloud Backup.

I recommend you then back up your iPhone using iTunes instead.

1.  Connect your iPhone to the computer running iTunes. Make sure you
    have already disabled iCloud Backup.
2.  Right-click (or Ctrl-Click) on your device
3.  Select *Back up*.
