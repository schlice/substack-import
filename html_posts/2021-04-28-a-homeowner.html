An HOA cannot operate on expired covenants. If the covenants have truly
expired (which I highly question), then the HOA no longer exists. The
covenants are what gives the HOA authority.

However, laws are time-dependent. If you violated the rules while the
rules existed, the violation is still valid and can still be collected
against. The HOA still has to settle its debts and perform closeout
operations (like disposing of community property and transferring
control of insurance policies), and it has budgeted for those funds to
do that. So yes, if you incurred the debt while the HOA was still
active, there is a better than average chance that you have to pay the
debt.

I highly doubt that a covenants would simply expire. Perhaps the HOA was
designed to run for a fixed period of time and then dissolution
processes would begin, but it's not like the HOA magically disappears.
As I mentioned, there are still closeout operations which would need to
take place. Without seeing your governing documents, we can't say
specifically.

Original question:

A homeowner\'s association operating on expired covenants has sent me a
bill for past due dues. To repeat, the covenants are expired. What do I
do with the bill?
