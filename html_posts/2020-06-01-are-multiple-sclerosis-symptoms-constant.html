**Are multiple sclerosis symptoms constant?**

It depends on what "flavor" of MS you have.

In *relapsing* forms of the disease such as **Relapsing-Remitting MS
(RRMS)**, the symptoms worsen during periods of *relapse*, and they last
for a period of time (usually from days to weeks) and then they lessen
or *remit* for a period of weeks to months.

In *progressive* forms of the disease such as **Secondary Progressive MS
(SPMS)**, the symptoms slowly get worse over time, sometimes with
periods of worsening or relapse. SPMS can be further characterized at
different points in time as either *active* (with relapses and/or
evidence of new MRI activity) or *not active*, as well as with
*progression* (evidence of disease worsening on an objective measure of
change over time, with or without relapses) or *without progression.*
