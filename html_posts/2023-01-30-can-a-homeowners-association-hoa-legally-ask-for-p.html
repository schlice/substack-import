The answer is yes they can, so long as there is a valid reason for them
to do so.

For example, Governing Documents may require that the owner use their
home in the HOA as a primary residence, especially if that HOA disallows
rentals, or only allows rentals with Board approval. In that case, it
would be appropriate, if questions were to arise, that the HOA ask for
proof that the owner actually lives at the residence.

How the HOA plans on validating that the owner actually lives at the
residence, I cannot say, nor can I say what evidence the HOA would find
acceptable.

So while I think the rule is problematic to enforce, there is nothing
inherently wrong with an association having a rule which says that
owners must use their homes as their own primary residence, and thus
demanding some form of proof validating the same.
