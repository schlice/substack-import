Without knowing exactly what the discharge code was, we will never know
why the person was discharged before their period of enlistment was
completed.

But think about it: You sign up for three years, and the military
agrees, because they want to keep you around for three years. Then, they
let you go after two years.

**WHY IN GOD'S NAME WOULD THEY DO THAT?**

Perhaps because *they realized they didn't want to keep you?* The
military has to agree to release you, and it has to be for a valid
reason. Whatever that valid reason is, they let you go without requiring
you to serve your entire contracted period of enlistment. If they wanted
to keep you, you think they would let you go without completing your
term so easily?

Just to show you how many possible reasons for discharge exist, here is
a more or less complete list of [[Military Separation
Codes](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=52404c&url=https://www.thebalance.com/military-separation-codes-3356946){.external_link
