**SCOTUS isn't the last word because they're always right. SCOTUS is
always right because they're the last word.**

- When SCOTUS originally ruled on *Roe* 50 years ago, they were right.
- And when SCOTUS overturned *Roe*, they were also right.
- When SCOTUS originally ruled on *Plessy v. Ferguson*, they were right.
- And when SCOTUS functionally overturned *Plessy* with cases like
  *Brown v. Board* (among others), they were also right.

Are you getting it now? *Heller* is right, and so was *US v. Miller*
before it. Every time they make a ruling, it is right, ***because the
Supreme Court is the last word***. There's no one else to appeal to.
It's over.

That makes it right.

(EDIT) My commenters have pointed out something to me. I understand that
there is a distinction people are drawing between what is *legally*
right and what is *morally* right. Yes, it is true that something can be
legal while still being immoral, and vice versa.

When SCOTUS makes a decision, it's always the *legally right* decision
because they are the last word, even if you consider the outcome of the
law to be *wrong*. That's why we're seeing this confusion over whether
or not a decision they made is "right." It can be legally right, and you
can still consider the outcome to be wrong.
