**Would it be possible to change the American constitution to allow
foreign born citizens to become President?**

A *foreign-born US citizen* (i.e. a child born to US citizens abroad) is
a US citizen by birth, and can become President.

A *naturalized* US citizen cannot become President.

It is possible to change the Constitution to allow naturalized citizens
to become President. It would require a Constitutional amendment, in
accordance with Article V of the Constitution.
