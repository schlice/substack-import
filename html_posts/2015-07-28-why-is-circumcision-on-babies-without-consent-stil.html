**Content:** [Until the minor turns 18, everything that happens to that
minor is the responsibility of the parent or legal guardian. Minors
cannot legally consent (or decline to consent) to any medical
procedure.\
\
This is because a minor is almost universally considered to be unable to
make well-reasoned decisions for himself/herself before age 18. Some may
be able to, most can\'t.\
\
Therefore, since a baby can\'t make a reasoned decision about what
happens to its own body, it\'s up to the parent/guardian to make that
decision for him.]{.rendered_qtext}
