**Content:** [If there is no current registration, then the compiance
numbers cited are just guesstimates. It\'s because it is estimated that
there are about 1 million assault weapons in New York state, and only
about 44,000 registrations took place.\
\
I think the state is going to have a very hard time enforcing such a
provision, and it will only be used as a hammer when weapons are found
(i.e. this weapon is not properly registered under state law). How can
you enforce such a provision? Go door-to-door? Search every home in the
state? Not without probable cause and a warrant.\
\
So yes, this sounds like a clear case of civil disobedience, and I think
the state is going to be hard-pressed to get a provision like this
strengthened.]{.rendered_qtext}
