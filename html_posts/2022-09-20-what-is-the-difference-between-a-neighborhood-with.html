Nothing.

An HOA with no CC&Rs is not a useful HOA as it can't really accomplish
anything. It has no authority and no real vision or mission. In order to
be a non-profit corporation, it needs Bylaws and Articles of
Incorporation, but what is its purpose? If it has no CC&Rs, it has
nothing to do.

The CC&Rs are what gives the HOA its authority, its purpose, its ability
to collect dues, and its ability to spend that money.

In other words, the CC&R is the *raison d'Ãªtre* of the HOA. Without
them, they are useless.
