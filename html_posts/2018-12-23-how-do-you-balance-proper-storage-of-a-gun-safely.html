**How do you balance proper storage of a gun safely with having it ready
for immediate use in case of an emergency?**

Store it in a semi ready condition, and get a quality safe with some
method of rapid unlock.

I store my firearms in the safe with fully loaded magazines but empty
chambers. My gun safes have rapid biometric entry (but keyed backups). I
can nearly instantly get in to my safes.
