**Can police arrest a suspicious looking man carrying two knives openly
in a public place? What would happen to the man?**

Let's break this down:

*Can police arrest a suspicious looking man?* Arrest requires **probable
cause**. This is a *reasonable belief* that a crime was committed or is
about to be committed. So long as the police have a reasonable belief
that this man committed a crime, they can arrest him and charge him with
that crime. But "looking suspicious" isn't a crime. So only because he
looks suspicious, he can't be arrested.

*Carrying two knives openly in a public place*: Describe "openly." Does
this mean openly on his belt in scabbards, or openly in his hands? The
difference is huge, as most places that allow people to carry knives
require that they be in sheaths. There are also blade length
restrictions. Assuming he meets all of those, he would be perfectly
fine. If, however, the knife blades were too long to carry, or if by
"carrying openly" you meant "in his hands," there would probably be a
bigger problem as the man would clearly be perceived as a threat and
could be arrested.
