**What legal actions can my friend who sexually assaulted me take if I
expose him online?**

If someone sexually assaulted you, he's not your friend.

Instead of "exposing him online" and risking the defamation lawsuits, go
to the police. Sexual assault is a crime.

Then, after the police charge him, feel free to dish on social media.
Just make sure everything you say is 100% true and verifiable. But
remember: everything you say can be used against you in court, even if
you haven't been Mirandized.
