While not quite as harsh as you make it out to be, the basic answer is
**yes**, Basic Training manipulates you.

Allow me to explain.

You come into the military as an *individual*. You have your own style,
you have your own philosophies on life and everything around it, you
have your own social and moral standards. You leave Basic Training as a
*team member*, part of an organization that is greater than yourself.
The way to think of it is ***the whole is greater than the sum of its
parts***.

The military **tears down** the parts of you that made you an
individual. You had a hair style? They shave off your hair. You had a
clothing style? They put you all in the same clothes. You had individual
freedom? You don\'t do anything unless your DI (drill instructor) tells
you to. Famously, you don\'t \"eat, sleep, move, shit, or breathe\"
unless the DI tells you to. You learn very quickly that someone else is
in charge, and you do exactly what you are told or you face
consequences. The military then **builds you back up** into the soldier
and the team that they need you to be. This is the greater purpose.

Patton said it best: \"If you can\'t get them to salute when they should
salute, or wear the clothes you tell them to wear, how are you going to
get them to die for their country?\" The soldier must be able to receive
an order that will bring him to *almost certain death* and still be able
to do his job and accomplish that mission because he is obeying orders.
This is not normal human behavior, and takes a special sort of training
to accomplish.

You lose a good portion of your freedoms, because losing freedom is
important to understanding what it is that you\'re doing in the
military. \"You haven\'t lived \'till you\'ve almost died. And for those
who have tasted it, freedom has a flavor the protected will never
know.\" In order to really understand freedom, you have to lose it. You
understand that freedom is precious, and freedom must be protected, and
for those of us in the United States who have grown up knowing nothing
but freedom, it\'s hard to understand what it\'s like to *not* be free,
or that our hold on freedom is so tenuous.

Reagan said, \"**Freedom is never more than one generation away from
extinction.** We didn't pass it on to our children in the bloodstream.
It must be fought for, protected, and handed on for them to do the same,
or one day we will spend our sunset years telling our children and our
children\'s children what it was once like in the United States where
men were free.\" Basic Training shows you this.
