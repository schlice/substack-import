Please expound on "safer." Safer for whom?

If you're referring to the intended target, a gun is designed to kill.
Are you trying to make the gun do something it's not designed to do?
Make it less death-y? I don't see that happening any time soon.

Are you asking about making the gun safer for the user? The gun is
already very safe to use. Almost anyone can successfully deploy a gun
with almost no risk of physical injury to themselves. They do have to be
careful to wear eye and ear protection, but beyond that, it's very safe
to use.

If the guns captured its spent casings, or were built with suppressors,
it would be a great thing, because they would indeed make guns safer,
but suppressors are restricted under the National Firearms Act (thanks,
Hollywood).

(EDIT) Details were added, so I'll address those now.

This question has also been asked and answered a million times on Quora.

A gun is a simple mechanical device. The thing that makes a gun an ideal
tool in a life-or-death scenario is its simplicity. You're proposing to
take a simple mechanical device and convert it into an electromechanical
device that is now four times more complex, and ten times more
expensive, as well as multiple times less reliable. Now I have to worry
about batteries, and the system recognizing my fingerprint. What if the
battery is dead? What if the fingerprint reader fails? How easy would it
be to disable the fingerprint reader system and revert the gun to a
simple mechanical device? And as we've said over and over, who will own
these guns? Law-abiding citizens. Who will own traditional guns?
Criminals. Will traditional guns fail to exist once this "smart gun" is
introduced? Hardly. Did the Australian gun buy-back get them 100% of the
guns in Australia? Not even close. And most of the guns that were turned
in were rusty old pieces of junk from the back of someone's basement.

I glossed over the cost, but there are 300 million guns in America. So
considering you're making the gun ten times more expensive, where
exactly are we going to come up with the **30 BILLION** dollars to fund
this initiative? And the technology doesn't even exist yet! We can't
even figure out how to do healthcare; you think you're going to get a
majority of Americans to agree to swap out their trustworthy handguns
and rifles for this untested, unproven, unreliable electromechanical
crap that anyone with a mechanical degree of any kind can retrofit in
minutes?

In short, I think not.
