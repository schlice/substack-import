No.

You are certainly free to think of it this way, but Christianity is not
"evolving." The whole point of Christianity is that it is the *bulwark*,
the "steady foundation" that resists the swirling storms and rapid
change of society. The whole point of Christianity is that it espouses
the Word of God, and God's Word is unchanging, just as God is
unchanging.

So no, Christianity is not evolving. Some sects which call themselves
Christian are *actively choosing* to ignore some facets of the Bible
because they want to be "accepted" by society. It is exactly this choice
which has almost completely destroyed what used to be the United
Methodist Church. The UMC is now a shell of what it once was, because it
allowed society to dictate doctrine.

TL;DR: Christianity is unchanging. Churches which are "evolving" are
actually abandoning Christianity.

And that point is the answer to your second question:

> **why are they still followers of Jesus though they don't follow his
> teachings?**

Because anyone can call themselves Christian. But calling yourself
Christian does not make you Christian. A favorite argument I get from
Mormons is that they believe in Jesus, so they can call themselves
Christian. It's even in their name: "The Church of Jesus Christ of
Latter-Day Saints." But they reject *some* truths about Christ, and they
reject *some* truths about the Bible. Roman Catholicism is exactly the
same way, but not necessarily by rejecting the Bible. Instead, they
misinterpret the Bible and add extra-Biblical "sources" of God's Word
which are not explicitly declared in the Bible. They all call themselves
"Christian," but it is clear that while they have taken on the name of
Christ, they do not fully respect the One whose name they have chosen
for themselves, so they *take the name of the Lord in vain.*

TL;DR: You can call yourself Christian, but that does not make you
Christian.

(also, I realize that in one answer, I have called out the UMC, LDS, and
the RCC as being not Christian. But if they are free to believe that the
church is evolving and if they are free to believe things which are not
explicitly called out in the Bible, I am free to believe that they have
"evolved" themselves out of Christianity.)
