**Content:** [You can create a website for anyone you want in the United
States. You probably won\'t be able to prevent men from accessing it,
though. Even if you set up your policies so that only women could become
members and access certain content, you know, people *lie* online.\
\
You can certainly create content specifically tailored for women and
things that are of importance to women more than men. There are several
such websites currently in operation today.]{.rendered_qtext}
