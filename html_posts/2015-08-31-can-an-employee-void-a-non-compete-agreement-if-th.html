**Content:** [I\'m a little late to the party, but since I got the A2A,
I don\'t see how you can justify breaking your non-compete.\
\
First of all, the company just got acquired.\
\
Second, just because the company was hired by a company with a Colorado
headquarters says absolutely nothing about their legal ability to
maintain a drug-free workforce. Since the statute says that an
interstate company must be compliant with both Federal and state laws,
companies that do business in Colorado can still legally enforce a
drug-free workplace. Whether or not they do is also their business.\
\
However, whether or not they do has no bearing on the enforceability of
a non-compete clause. The two are completely separate provisions of
employment.]{.rendered_qtext}
