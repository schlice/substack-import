This kind of thing happens all the time. You had insurance when you
registered your car, but for some reason, your car no longer appears on
your insurance. Maybe it's because you changed insurance carriers. Maybe
it's because you updated your policy and the car fell off for some
reason. It happens.

In most states, if you're caught without insurance on your car, you can
expect some or all of the following consequences:

**Penalties**

- **Fines**: You may face a fine of up to \$5,000, depending on the
  state and how many times you\'ve been caught.
- **License suspension**: Your driver\'s license may be suspended.
- **Vehicle impoundment**: Your vehicle may be impounded.
- **Jail time**: Driving without insurance can be a misdemeanor or
  felony (depending on your state), and you may face jail time.
- **SR-22**: Your insurance company may require you to file an SR-22,
  which can make it harder to get car insurance in the future.

**Liability**

- If you\'re at fault in an accident, you may be required to pay for the
  other party\'s medical expenses and vehicle damage.
- If your car is totaled, you may be responsible for the remaining
  balance on the loan.

**Future insurance rates**

- Your future car insurance rates may be higher if you\'ve been caught
  driving without insurance.
