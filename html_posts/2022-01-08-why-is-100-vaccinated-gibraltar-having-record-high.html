Because vaccines don't prevent COVID cases.

There really isn't much more to say than that. But if I don't put more,
my answer will simply be collapsed because it isn't long enough.

Vaccines help protect you against the worst outcomes from COVID
infection. They keep you out of the hospital. You're still going to get
COVID, but you're not likely to die from it. You'll end up home in bed
for a few days.

Vaccines do not prevent you from catching COVID. They also don't prevent
you from passing COVID on to other people. That's why you can have a
100% vaccination rate in a population yet people will still catch COVID
and will still pass it on to others.
