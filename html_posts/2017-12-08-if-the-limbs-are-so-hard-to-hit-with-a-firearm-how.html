It appears that you are misinterpreting the statistics you provided.

It appears that you are looking at "injuries" and assuming that police
*intended* to only injure.

In the United States, when police use a firearm, they have already
reached the legal threshold above which they are authorized to use
**deadly force**. Deadly force is force that is reasonably assumed will
cause death or grave bodily injury.

Therefore, when police use a firearm, they have made the calculation
that they have the justification to use deadly force to stop an act.
Firearms in the United States are not employed when there is no
justification to use deadly force. When the police have reached the
highest level on the force continuum, then deadly force is authorized.

Additionally, police do not "shoot to kill" or "shoot to wound." Police
shoot to "stop the act." The most effective location to stop the act is
shooting in the center of mass of the body, which is in the center of
the torso.

In general, this also applies to other countries. They simply keep track
of scenarios in which shots were fired and the suspect was injured (i.e.
not killed). This, in general, indicates shots intended for the center
of mass, but missed. However, it could also indicate shots which hit the
center of mass but did not cause death. The statistics are unclear about
this point. Other countries, however, do authorize things like "warning
shots," which in general in the US, are not authorized.
