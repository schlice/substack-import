Various answerers here are telling you that the Justices, in their
nomination hearings, talked a lot about "precent" and "*stare decisis.*"
And yes, they all did this.

But what do "precent" and *stare decisis* mean? Can you believe in case
law and *stare decisis* and still overturn a bad decision?

In this particular case, the Court was asked to look at *Roe*, because
the state was making the case that *Roe* was wrongly decided. This
particular case *required* that the Court very specifically review *Roe*
to see if it had a strong Constitutional foundation. In other words, to
find for the state in question (Mississippi) would be to find that *Roe*
was not decided Constitutionally. And it appears that the Court is going
to do just that.

This is not the first time in history this has happened. Lest we forget,
*Plessey v. Ferguson* was "precedent" and *stare decisis* for nearly 60
years before *Brown v. Board* decided that it was indeed
unconstitutional. Should the court in *Brown* have said, "Well,
*Plessey* has stood for nearly 60 years as 'settled law,' so we should
allow the school to keep kids segregated, because the *Plessey* court
said that racial segregation was Constitutional as long as the
facilities offered to each race were of equal quality"? Thankfully, the
Court in *Brown* found that racial segregation in schools was, in fact,
unconstitutional, which was the first in a series of decisions which
ultimately, together, overturned *Plessey*.

Even after all that time, and all that "precedent," and all that "*stare
decisis*" and all that "settled law," the Court was able to go back and
figure out that a past ruling was, in fact, unconstitutional.

Yes, courts can rely on past rulings to influence future decisions in
order to maintain some precedent and some consistency of outcome. But
courts can, in fact, review past cases (when the question of the case
turns on the Constitutionality of a previous ruling) and decide if they
were judged rightly.

\

The Justices did not lie in their nomination hearings. They didn't even
lie by omission. They were simply not asked whether or not they would
ever overturn *Roe*. Even if they were, they would not answer such a
question, because it could bias future decisions. They were asked about
tangential legal principles like "precedent" and *stare decisis*.
Neither of those two concepts impede the Court when deciding if a
previous decision is Constitutional. *Stare decisis* does not prevent a
Court from reviewing past decisions for errors, when the case calls for
it.

\

TL;DR: *Precedent* and *stare decisis* do not invalidate or preclude
judicial review.
