The McCloskeys know that there is never a "slam dunk" case in court. In
fact, there's lots of things that they did very wrong during the
incident, and most of them involve *how* they were handling their
weapons. Mrs. McCloskey pointed her weapon at people, with her finger on
the trigger. This alone is a criminal assault. Mr. McCloskey, while
maintaining good trigger discipline, also failed to keep his muzzle
pointed in a safe direction until such time that he needed to bring his
weapon to bear against a threat.

The prosecutor, Mark said, "dropped all the felony charges, all the gun
charges, and charged me with a crime that said I purposely placed other
people in apprehension of imminent fear of physical injury." He was
charged with a a Class C misdemeanor of fourth-degree assault. His wife
pleaded guilty to a Class A misdemeanor of second-degree harassment.
They will pay fines of \$2000 and \$750 for those offenses, and will
avoid jail time. And in a political stunt that surprises no one (but was
done to placate the fomenting masses who want the McCloskey's heads on
pikes), they were also forced to relinquish the two firearms used in the
assault.

Mr. McCloskey called the fine the equivalent of "a parking ticket." When
talking about his actions, he said, "\[I\]f that's a crime in Missouri,
I did it, and I'll do it again\[.\]"[\[1\]](#kUxIW){#cite-kUxIW

*For the time being, I have re-enabled comments on selected answers.
Some people like to comment. Some people like to engage with me in a
civil manner, and I did kinda miss that\...a little. But do not
misunderstand, I take this step very cautiously, and I have no tolerance
for harassing or inane behavior. If you don\'t like what I wrote, tough
shit. If my answer is grammatically low-quality or is un-cited opinion
masquerading as fact, downvote it. If you think I\'m wrong, write your
own answer. But Quora is a question-and-answer site, not a debate site.
If you are simply commenting to tell me \"ackshually, you\'re wrong,\"
don\'t be surprised if I quietly delete your comment. Put anything
vaguely harassing in there, and your deletion will be followed by a
block/mute, and a BNBR report. I will do this immediately and with no
compunction. You have been warned. Be nice.*

Original question:

Why were the McCloskeys even charged? How is it illegal to hold your
weapon on your own property to deter rioters? Why are they being hassled
for exercising their second amendment right?
