**How many prophecies were fulfilled from the time Jesus was born till
His ascension?**

The best estimate I've seen is somewhere between 61 and 108, depending
on what you count as a prophecy in the Old Testament. And that's
certainly something. The probability of that happening at all is
astounding.

But what makes it a statistical impossibility (unless it is true) is
that all of them were fulfilled ***in the life of one person***. For
someone doubting Jesus being the fulfillment of the prophecies, they
would have to show that it is at least statistically possible that all
of those prophecies could at least accidentally be fulfilled in one
person's lifetime.

Statistics shows us that this is a statistical impossibility.

Here's a list of Stoner's eight:

> 1.  The Messiah will be born in Bethlehem (Micah 5:2).\

>     present (1958) divided by the average population of the earth
>     during the same period = 7,150/2,000,000,000 or [\[math\]2.8 x

> 2.  A messenger will prepare the way for the Messiah (Malachi 3:1).\
>     One man in how many, the world over, has had a forerunner (in this
>     case, John the Baptist) to prepare his way?\
>     Estimate: 1 in 1,000 or [\[math\]1 ×

> 3.  The Messiah will enter Jerusalem as a king riding on a donkey
>     (Zechariah 9:9).\
>     One man in how many, who has entered Jerusalem as a ruler, has
>     entered riding on a donkey?\
>     Estimate: 1 in 100 or [\[math\]1 × 10\^2\[/math\]]{.render_latex}.
> 4.  The Messiah will be betrayed by a friend and suffer wounds in His
>     hands (Zechariah 13:6).\
>     One man in how many, the world over, has been betrayed by a
>     friend, resulting in wounds in his hands?\
>     Estimate: 1 in 1,000 or [\[math\]1 ×
>     10\^3\[/math\]]{.render_latex}.
> 5.  The Messiah will be betrayed for 30 pieces of silver (Zechariah
>     11:12).\
>     Of the people who have been betrayed, one in how many has been
>     betrayed for exactly 30 pieces of silver?\
>     Estimate: 1 in 1,000 or [\[math\]1 ×
>     10\^3\[/math\]]{.render_latex}.
> 6.  The betrayal money will be used to purchase a potter's field
>     (Zechariah 11:13).\
>     One man in how many, after receiving a bribe for the betrayal of a
>     friend, has returned the money, had it refused, and then
>     experienced it being used to buy a potter's field?\
>     Estimate: 1 in 100,000 or [\[math\]1 ×
>     10\^5\[/math\]]{.render_latex}.
> 7.  The Messiah will remain silent while He is afflicted (Isaiah
>     53:7).\
>     One man in how many, when he is oppressed and afflicted, though
>     innocent, will make no defense of himself?\
>     Estimate: 1 in 1,000 or [\[math\]1 ×
>     10\^3\[/math\]]{.render_latex}.
> 8.  The Messiah will die by having His hands and feet pierced (Psalm
>     22:16).\
>     One man in how many, since the time of David, has been crucified?\
>     Estimate: 1 in 10,000 or [\[math\]1 ×
>     10\^4\[/math\]]{.render_latex}.

And those "virtually impossible odds?" The odds of *all of those
prophecies being accidentally fulfilled in the life of one person* is so
astronomically high, that it is improbable to believe that it could
actually happen. Once you hit 48 prophecies being accidentally fulfilled
in one person's life, the odds are one in 10¹⁴⁷. Lee Strobel, the famous
former atheist turned pastor, estimated in his book *The Case For Faith*
that the probability of all 108 being fulfilled in the life of one
person is "one chance in a trillion, trillion, trillion, trillion,
trillion, trillion, trillion, trillion, trillion, trillion, trillion,
trillion, trillion."

The number is so large that it effectively approaches infinity. This
means that it is a functionally statistical impossibility to be an
accident. To that end, if it did happen as the Bible said it did, it
must be true.
