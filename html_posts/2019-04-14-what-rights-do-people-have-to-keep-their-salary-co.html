**What rights do people have to keep their salary confidential or
private?**

What responsibility does anyone have to *disclose* their salary? As far
as I know, with some exceptions for government employees, employees of
private companies are under no obligation to disclose their salaries to
anyone.

So what right does a person have to keep his salary confidential? The
same right to not do something that is not required by law. Just as I
have a right to not cross the street if I don't want to, I have a right
to not disclose my salary if I don't want to.

It's true, sometimes when you apply for a new job, they want to know
your old salary. The truth: *they don't have to have it!* They don't
need your current salary to determine whether or not they are going to
hire you.
