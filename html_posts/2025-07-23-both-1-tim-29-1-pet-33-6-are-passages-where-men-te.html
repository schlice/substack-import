Actually, these verses are specific to women, but the *broader passages*
around them are not.

These two letters were written for different audiences and different
purposes.

**1 Tim 2:9.** Paul's first letter to Timothy was to encourage him in
leading his church. A large portion of the letter is taken up with
Paul\'s comments on the role of women in worship services. Rather than
focusing on flashy clothes and dramatic behavior, women are to be modest
and godly. In addition, women should not take on specific spiritual
leadership roles reserved for men.

Specifically, this passage (more specifically, 1 Tim 2:9--15, is one of
the most controversial passages in the New Testament. And while there
are some passages which are slightly unclear, the overall theme of the
passage is not: women are not to focus on dramatic appearance or
behavior, but to put their efforts into godliness and good works.

Verse 9 begins with the word *hōsautōs,* which means "likewise." That's
a follow-on from verse 8, which applies to men. Paul was talking to the
men about prayer and its importance. So when he says "likewise" to the
women, prayer and its importance applies to them as well. What he does
in verse 9 is to add a *specific* item which caused concern to the
community regarding women. Specifically, he addressed how women dress
and style their hair for church. Just as it is today, church is not the
appropriate venue to wear skimpy attire or to spend an inordinate amount
of time and effort on "braiding their hair," which could be costly both
in time and money in those days. The idea wasn't to control women. The
idea was to suggest that all of that effort put emphasis on the self
rather than on worshipping God, which was the whole purpose of church.
You don't "dress to impress" for church. Not only does it distract
others from the point of gathering together, it distracts the woman
herself.

**1 Peter 3:3--9.** Peter, in this letter, is teaching about Christian
submission to human authorities. He was talking about a Christian wife
trying to influence an unbelieving husband. Women of the time felt
enormous societal pressure to *compete* for the attention of their
husbands, and they would often use jewelry, clothing and hairstyles to
attempt to do so. Peter\'s instruction from God urged women to
understand, in part, that their husbands would not be won to Christ by
their efforts to beautify themselves externally.

It's not that ***we*** put emphasis on how women dress. It's that at
that time, ***they*** put emphasis on it, and sometimes it interfered
with what they were really trying to accomplish.
