So no, it wasn't Paul's idea, and the name wasn't given by Paul. In
Antioch, believers were first identified as "Christians" or
"Christ-ones" by those *outside* the Christ community. Within the
community of believers, they most commonly called themselves "the Way,"
referring to their group as "the followers of The Way" or "the people of
The Way."
