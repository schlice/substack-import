**Is it illegal to run around nude?**

As with all legal things, the answer is "it depends."

Primarily, it depends on two things:

- Where you are running around nude
- The nature and intent of the exposure.

The first bullet is the most important, as it varies wildly by state.

The largest majority of states simply ban exposure of male or female
genitalia in public. These states allow nudity in private areas which
are reasonably expected to be protected from public view. Some states
are even restrictive of nudity *inside your home* if it can at all be
seen from outside, and it's up to you to know whether or not you can be
seen. For example, if you are nude in your back yard, and you have a
privacy fence around your yard, but the potential exists for your
neighbor to see you from their second story window, you would be in
violation of the public nudity law.

Other states allow public nudity, and in those states (Colorado is one
of them), the nature of the exposure determines whether or not you can
be charged with public indecency. Exposure *with the goal* *of sexual
arousal* is prohibited, but other exposure is not. So for example, if
you are touching yourself in an attempt to elicit sexual arousal, that
would be a prohibited exposure.
