**Did a group of marines rescue babies from Pentogon on 9/11?**

I dunno. I wasn't there. I was at home on 9/11, watching aircraft hit
the towers on live TV.

But I do know how to use Google. And as it turns out, Snopes (the always
reliable, always fair, never politically leaning fact-checkers that they
are) actually had an accurate accounting of what might have been
misinterpreted as "marines rescuing babies:"

Don't believe everything you read on the Internet. Don't take anything
at face value. Do your own research. Make your own decisions.
