A contract is an agreement between two parties. In a contract, there are
three basic parts: an offer, an acceptance, and consideration.
Basically, what that means is that a contract is a mutually beneficial
arrangement. Both parties get something out of it.

The story of the Bible is not a contract. God is omnipotent. He is
complete in Himself. He needs nothing; he wants nothing. He doesn't
*need* us to do anything for Him. So the Bible can never be a contract,
because God doesn't get anything out of the deal; He already has
Everything.

The central theme of the Bible is God redeeming His people. The Bible is
broken down like this:

1.  Paradise
2.  Paradise lost
3.  Paradise regained

Bullet 1 is the first part of Genesis. Bullet 2 is depicted through the
remainder of the 66 books of the Bible, and Bullet 3 is found in
Revelation.
