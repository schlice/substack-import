**What would happen to healthcare if everyone was on the
\'Medicare-for-all\' plan and we eliminated private insurance for
good?**

It's an interesting "what-if" analysis, if you want to go down that
rabbit hole, but if so, we'd have to label this question *Hypothetical
Scenarios* because this will never happen. [[Jennifer

hit the nail on the head. Private insurance will never go away. It's too
far entrenched in our lives to ever be completely eliminated.
Additionally, it's not really insurance. It's an expensive prepayment
plan where all of your needs are paid for, from the smallest band-aid to
the most expensive open-heart surgery. That's not insurance, it's
prepayment. We need to get away from that before we can ever hope to
reform the system.

The best we can hope for is a "dual-tier" system, at least initially.
Many writers on Quora have come to the same conclusion (many doctors and
attorneys themselves), and it's definitely worth looking into because if
we ever have any hope of providing basic healthcare for everyone in this
country, that's going to be the way we do it.

Basically, we would provide some modified form of Medicare Part B for
everyone who is a citizen. We have to draw a line somewhere, and that
line is "people who pay into the system can use the system." And unless
we get rid of the national income tax and move to a national consumption
tax that even foreigners and illegals pay, we will never be able to have
universal basic healthcare which includes foreigners and illegals. But
that's a discussion for another question. All basic care will be covered
under this plan. All routine doctor visits for everything from the flu
to a broken leg will be covered. 100% of children's healthcare will be
covered until age 18, so we can eliminate CHIP and SCHIP as well. EMTALA
will still exist for everyone, so any emergency situations will still be
triaged and stabilized by any emergency room, regardless of ability to
pay.

Above the basic health tier, private health insurance (usually provided
by your employer but you can purchase individually) will cover
everything else: hospital stays, major surgeries, non-routine
procedures, specialists, as well as catastrophic costs (e.g. the
resulting medical care from a car accident).

There will be a line between the two systems. That line can move over
time (i.e. some care can be moved down to the universal tier, or some
care can be moved up to the private tier.

Doctors can be compelled to provide Medicare care, because we can
provide low-cost government-subsidized medical school student loans for
them (or depending on the government's ability to pay, perhaps
completely fund their medical school), in exchange for X number of years
providing Medicare service exclusively, or even change that X depending
on how much time the doctor chooses to give back to the
Medicare-exclusive system in exchange for better loan rates or more
money loaned for medical school. After that time, they can expand their
practice if they choose and start accepting private insurance as well,
and if they no longer need that sweet, sweet government money, they can
then gradually phase out Medicare service and become a specialist.

This *can* be done. We *can* create this system, and everyone *can* have
universal basic healthcare provided by the government. But there will be
detractors. Those who want to see universal single-payor healthcare will
complain that this creates a "haves vs. have-nots" system, when it does
nothing of the sort. First, you can buy your own health insurance, and
these prices will be about as much as you spend on a cell phone or a new
TV, so if you can afford those luxuries, you can afford health insurance
if you choose. Secondly, *everyone* participates in the Medicare plan;
private insurance **will not** cover anything that Medicare covers. If
the doctor has both a Medicare and a private practice, that doctor will
bill the appropriate entity for repayment depending on the service, not
the person.
