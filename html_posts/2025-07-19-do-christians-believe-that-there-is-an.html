I understand what you are asking. You're asking if there is an "age"
beyond which you are responsible for your sins.

So it's important to note that the majority of commenters here are
correct; there is no "age of accountability" listed in the Bible, but at
the same time, ask yourself this: when a baby dies, do they go to
heaven? What about the mentally handicapped? They often don't know the
spiritual ramifications of their actions. Do they go to heaven?

So there's two parts to this answer, and the first part pertains to what
causes us to need salvation. We know that we are sinful by nature. We
call that "original sin." But does original sin alone condemn us? No, it
does not, because original sin is the stain of Adam, which is passed on
to us. More specifically, while God created Adam and Eve in His own
likeness (Genesis 5:1), the Bible says that, once Adam and Eve fell and
became sinful, Adam fathered children "in *his* own likeness" (Genesis
5:3, emphasis added; cf. Romans 5:12). All of us inherited a sinful
nature through Adam's original sin. Adam sinned and thus created for
himself a sinful nature, and he passed that sinful nature along to all
his descendants.

However, while we have inherited Adam's original sin, are we *convicted*
simply because of it? The answer is **no**, we are not. Original sin
means we have inherited a sinful nature which makes sin the inclination
of every human heart (Genesis 6:5). Therefore, we sin because original
sin made our natural response sinful. In short, we sin because we are
sinners. It is that sin which convicts us, not the stain of our original
sin. We are only responsible for our own sin (which we all freely do).

So now that we've discussed original sin vs our own sin, we come to the
second part of the answer. Everything we just discussed leads us to
another question: couldn't it be possible that someone *isn't*
responsible for their own sin? Would you say that a baby has enough
inclination to sin without being cognizant of his or her actions? What
about the mentally handicapped? In other words, *is there any level of*
***mens rea*** *required along with the* ***actus reus*** *of sin?*
***Must you have the ability to know that what you are doing is sinful,
along with actually doing the sinful thing?***

The answer is **yes**, you must. My friends at

following Biblical explanation:

> In John 9, Jesus heals a man born blind. After the physical healing,
> the man goes through a process of receiving his spiritual sight. At
> first, the man is ignorant; he knows Jesus' name but not where to find
> Him (John 9:11--12). Later, he arrives at the truth that Jesus is a
> prophet (verse 17) and that He is from God (verse 33). Then, in
> speaking to Jesus, the man admits his ignorance and his need for the
> Savior. Jesus asks him, "Do you believe in the Son of Man?" and the
> man replies, "Who is he, sir? . . . Tell me so that I may believe in
> him" (verses 35--36). Finally, having seen the light spiritually, he
> says, "Lord, I believe," and worships Jesus (verse 38).
>
> Following the expression of faith from the man born blind, Jesus
> encounters some spiritually blind Pharisees: "Jesus said, 'For
> judgment I have come into this world, so that the blind will see and
> those who see will become blind.' Some Pharisees who were with him
> heard him say this and asked, 'What? Are we blind too?' Jesus said,
> 'If you were blind, you would not be guilty of sin; but now that you
> claim you can see, your guilt remains'" (John 9:39--41). In other
> words, Jesus says, "If you were *truly* ignorant \[blind\], you would
> have no guilt. It's because you are *not* ignorant---you are willfully
> unbelieving---that you stand guilty before
> God."[\[1\]](#ZAsnR){#cite-ZAsnR .citation_link}

The principle that Jesus is outlining here is very clear: **God does not
judge people for things they are unable to do.**

> *Sin is measured by the capacities or ability of people, and by their
> opportunities of knowing the truth. If people had no ability to do the
> will of God, they could incur no blame. If they have all proper
> ability, and no disposition, God holds them to be
> guilty.*[\[2\]](#pzstd){#cite-pzstd .citation_link}

Therefore, if we follow this principle to its natural end, babies, the
mentally handicapped, and those who are unable to actually accept Jesus
are not accountable for their unbelief.

So while there may not be an "age" of accountability, there is a
"disposition" of accountability: the ability to accept Jesus. If a
person is physically or, by age, unable to accept Jesus, they cannot be
held accountable for the fact that they have not accepted Jesus, and
thus cannot be held accountable for their sin.
