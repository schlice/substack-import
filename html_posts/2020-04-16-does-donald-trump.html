**Does Donald Trump\'s interpretation of his limitless authority and
ability to remain outside the rule of law that apply to all of us, but
not to him, serve as a model for all to follow?**

As long as you follow the model precisely:

Tweet whatever the hell you want, make wild claims, etc, but once you're
ready to do something, listen to your advisers and don't do it.

Trump likes to talk big. He likes to tweet big. But you haven't seen him
deploy the military to take over the states yet and implement Trumpland
yet, have you? That's because when he's done bloviating all over
Twitter, he talks to people and listens to them, and then does the right
thing.
