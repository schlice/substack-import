**What does a home owners association fee go towards?**

It is different in every association.

For example, in our neighborhood, the HOA does not own the roads, so we
don't pay for road repair. We do pay for common area maintenance
(mowing, re-planting, snow removal, etc). We pay to water our common
areas (one of our largest expenses). We pay for general liability
insurance on those common areas.

We also negotiated trash service in our neighborhood. This allows the
trash trucks to come on only one day, keeping the streets freer from
truck traffic, and making the neighborhood neater. We rolled those fees
into our HOA dues.
