**Samsung's Galaxy Fold may be premature, but I still see a foldable
iPhone in our future. Do you think so?**

It depends on how well the Galaxy Fold does.

Since Samsung released their foldable first, Apple will wait to see what
happens. Unfortunately with the Galaxy Fold, it's not ready for
consumers.

First, its release price is \$1980. This is not a consumer device. It's
a device for people who are either die-hard Samsung fans, or people who
buy things like Supreme or \$600 sneakers with a rapper's name on them.

Second, the device is intended to be a foldable tablet, not a device
that you use primarily as a phone and then occasionally pop open to use
as a tablet. Consumers aren't really interested in foldable tablets just
yet.

It does do some things surprisingly well, but its high price tag and its
lack of appeal to the broader consumer market are things that will make
this release of the Galaxy Fold something that is not yet ready for
broad consumer adoption. And Apple isn't going to go anywhere near a
foldable device until they know that there's a solid market for it.

What Samsung ***did*** do right was to release a trio of Galaxy S10
devices that exceed Apple in both price and quality. The Galaxy S10e
starts at \$749.99, the Galaxy S10 starts at \$899.99, and the Galaxy
S10+ starts at \$999.99, and you get 128 GB of storage on each of those.
Compared to Apple's lineup, the iPhone XR is also \$749.99, but only
comes with 64GB of storage. The iPhone XS and XS Max start at \$999 and
\$1,099 respectively, but also only come with 64GB of storage. So just
based on price alone, Samsung's offerings appear to win on price.

But that would only remain true if Samsung's hardware was at least on
par, if not better, than Apple's. And from an objective comparison,
Samsung's hardware beats Apple's hardware, hands down.

The Snapdragon 855 is faster and more efficient than the A12 Bionic chip
Apple is running. Now arguably, as Apple's iOS is custom-designed to run
on Apple's A12 chip, iOS still runs more efficiently than Android on a
Snapdragon. But it still suffers from thermal throttling that the
Snapdragon does not. The Snapdragon hardware is simply a better mobile
processor.

Samsung's displays beat Apple's displays, hands down. Why would I say
that? Apple displays are sourced from --- Samsung. So of course, Samsung
is going to produce better display technology for themselves than they
are going to provide to Apple.

They have other features as well. The new Samsung devices are also
sporting under-glass ultrasonic fingerprint readers. This makes them
quicker, they don't require visible bright lights to read, and they are
more secure, when compared to any other security technology. The new
Samsung devices have larger batteries than any other flagship device.
Finally, they also sport a feature called Wireless PowerShare, which is
essentially Qi charging in reverse. This allows them to charge small
Qi-enabled devices, like the Samsung Galaxy Buds, which sport wireless
charging in the case.
