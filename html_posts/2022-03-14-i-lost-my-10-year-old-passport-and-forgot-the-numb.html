Maybe I don't understand what "the whole bureaucratic goose chase" is,
but if your passport was 10 years old, it's expired by now. Adult
passports are only valid for 10 years; youth passports are only valid
for 5 years.

The best you can do is apply for another one. At best, you could have
used your old, expired passport as proof of citizenship and proof of
identity but now you'll have to do that process all over again, and
provide that documentation again.

You can tell them that you previously had a passport but you lost it.
