**Content:** [It\'s not excuses. Watch the video. Garner was still
gasping and choking after officers \*completely\* released him. It\'s
called a \"pre-existing condition\" and it\'s not something that an
officer can train for.\
\
What would you have preferred they do? Use the TASER against him? With
his health issues, he probably would have died anyway.\
\
NONE of that means anything because, as
[[Christopher](https://www.quora.com/profile/Christopher-Hawk)]{.qlink_container}
and I already said, if he simply would have complied, no one would have
had to physically restrain him, and he would most likely still be alive
today.]{.rendered_qtext}
