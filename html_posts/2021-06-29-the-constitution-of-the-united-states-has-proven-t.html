You literally cannot re-make the United States into something else
without the Constitution. The Constitution is what makes the US. The US
is nothing without the Constitution. Therefore, you are advocating for
the destruction of the US.

You have only one of two options:

1.  Emigrate to a country that more closely matches your ideas of
    democracy
2.  Overthrow the US government, throw out the founding documents, and
    install your own.

There are no third options. There is nothing simpler. You cannot
"restructure society." It simply does not exist.

Original question:

The constitution of the United States has proven time and again to be an
obstacle to democracy and much needed change. It's obvious that is has
outlived its usefulness. How should Americans restructure its society to
fit this new norm?
