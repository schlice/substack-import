**Content:** [This country has a terrible track record with helping the
mentally ill.\
\
Since deinstitutionalization, psychiatrists have become \"pill
pushers,\" rarely having time for real counseling, which they contend
should be handled by counselors.\
\
Counselors do the best they can, but there are people that need
medication, and they can\'t provide it.\
\
And ne\'er the twain shall meet.\
\
Counselors and psychiatrists have mutual disdain for each other. They
don\'t work well together, and the people out there who desperately need
***both*** silently suffer.\
\
Or go on shooting sprees.\
