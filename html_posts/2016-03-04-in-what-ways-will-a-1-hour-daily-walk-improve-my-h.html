The answer is, of course, \"it depends,\" or (actually very
appropriately), \"YMMV\" (your mileage may vary). And these comparisons
are to doing nothing (i.e. walking fewer than 6,000 steps per day which
is technically considered \"sedentary\").

If you take a ***brisk*** walk for one hour a day, you will likely
exceed 10,000 steps. This is the goal to shoot for: a brisk walk,
breaking the 10,000 step mark.

What will 10,000 steps a day do for me?

You may have to work up to 10,000 steps. For example, if you walk at
about 3 miles per hour, this means that walking for 20 minutes will take
you one mile. 10,000 steps is about 5 miles. So at 3 miles per hour,
you\'d have to walk for 1 hour and 40 minutes to achieve that goal. So
start small, and increase your speed gradually so that you\'re walking
faster, closer to 4 miles per hour. Combined with the general walking we
do during the day, you can easily achieve 10,000 steps a day.

Pedometers that track your step count for the day can be more expensive
(like a Fitbit) or really really cheap (like a small step-counting
pedometer you clip to your waistband, usually for between \$1 and \$3),
but clipping it on or putting it on in the morning and wearing it all
day will help you achieve that 10,000 step goal.
