Something that men have a very difficult time doing, and something that
cops appreciate:

**Admit when you were wrong.**

Instead of being confrontational (or weepy), perhaps you can own up to
your mistakes.

"Yeah, I was trying to make that light, but it changed color a lot
faster than I thought it was going to. I know that was dangerous and
could have caused an accident; I'm glad no one was hurt and I'm sorry
for driving like an idiot."

Nothing more, nothing less. If you make a mistake, be a man and own up
to it.

Worked for me. Every time.
