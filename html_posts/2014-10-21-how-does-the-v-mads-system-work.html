**Content:** [V-MADS is an Active Denial non-lethal system which was
developed when field commanders requested a non-lethal system to turn
back advancing adversaries. It is a system that fires a 95 GHz frequency
transmitter beam directly at advancing personnel. The waves penetrate
normal clothing and approximately 1/64th of an inch into the outer layer
of the skin and produces an extremely quick, extremely hot sensation.
Two seconds in the beam raises skin temperature from normal to 130
degrees. It induces the individual\'s natural reaction to withdraw from
pain. The pain will stop when the beam is switched off or the target
steps out of the beam. You would need to be present in the beam for over
200 seconds before you were burned by the beam. The system has a range
of approximately 700 yards.\
\
It can be countered by a variety of methods: thick clothes, trash can
lids, even sprayed water that can absorb some of the beam before
striking the troops.]{.rendered_qtext}
