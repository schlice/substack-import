**My wife wants a new iPhone and I can't afford it. What should I do?**

You actually do have a few options.

1.  Don't get it. There are plenty of things I want that I can't get
    simply because I can't afford them. While researching, don't forget
    that this is an option.
2.  Buy it somewhere else other than your carrier's site. Use a site
    like
    [[Gazelle](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=8b2894&url=https://buy.gazelle.com/){.external_link
    rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
    onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
    qt-tooltip="gazelle.com"}]{.qlink_container} and you may be able to
    buy an iPhone that is "new" (i.e. the latest generation) and "new to
    her" but is otherwise pre-owned.
3.  Get an iPhone that will still be "new to her" but is not the
    absolute latest generation. For example, the iPhone 11 series is
    currently (as of May 2020) the latest generation, but the carriers
    all still sell the iPhone X series. The iPhone X series is still a
    very capable device.
4.  If you must have the newest generation iPhone, don't get the "top of
    the line" model. Instead of getting the 11 Pro Max, get the 11, or
    the 11 SE. The SE will give you a traditional design but will still
    contain the latest processor, so it will run better than a
    similar-looking iPhone. And the 11 SE is still the "latest
    generation" iPhone at a much more budget-friendly price.
