**Will a new car keep me from killing myself while texting and
driving?**

Not even close.

Not paying attention will kill you just as quickly regardless of how new
your car is.

Some technologies may help to mitigate some accident cases. Automatic
braking may help you avoid a rear-end collision if you are not paying
attention, but that's about it. Every other kind of accident will still
happen. You can still blindly roll through a stop sign and get T-boned
(the most common and most deadly accident type caused by distracted
driving). You can still roll into oncoming traffic.

Even Tesla's "autopilot" system requires an attentive driver, as the car
doesn't understand things like red lights yet. It still requires you to
watch the road. It makes you apply input to the steering wheel on a
regular basis or it shuts off.
