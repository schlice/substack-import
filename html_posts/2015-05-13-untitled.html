<h2>Answer Comment</h2>

**Content:** [That\'s the point: the Constitution neither supports nor
precludes states establishing same-sex marriage laws. [[Cliff
G.](https://www.quora.com/profile/Cliff-G-13)]{.qlink_container} said
that denying the right to marry based on sexual orientation is no
different than denying it based on race. About that point, he is wrong
(and, I might add, he\'s not often wrong, but on this point, he most
certainly is).\
\
Race is, indeed, a protected class in this country (race, color,
religion, sex, or national origin). These things (with the exception of
religion, but that is protected separately) are immutable. Sexual
orientation is a preference. It has yet to be conclusively proven to be
immutable. Indeed, most scientists believe that there are genetic
factors involved, but sexual preference develops over the course of the
human maturation process, from adolescence, through puberty, and into
early adulthood. It develops sooner in some than in others, but most
scientists agree that it not immutable; you are not \"born gay.\" You
may be born with a proclivity to become gay, but most scientists do
agree that sexual preference is a developed preference. Until it is
proven that sexual orientation is an immutable characteristic of a human
being, I don\'t suspect that it will be added to the list of protected
classes.\
\
The arguments about what equal rights for citizens are when it comes to
marriage turns on what marriage laws are, and why we have them. We do
not have them to recognize an emotional union between consenting adults,
with only an incidental relationship to child rearing. They certainly do
that, but the State has no compelling interest in recognizing emotional
unions, or we\'d be recognizing all sorts of emotional unions that
people believe are important. We do have them to deal with children that
may arise following sex between men and women. Since sex between
same-sex couples does not similarly produce children, marriage laws do
not discriminate against them because marriage laws do not apply to
them.\
\
Said in another way, because the real reason we have marriage laws in
this country is to deal with the children that sex between men and women
may produce, sexual complementarity is a legitimate condition of
marriage. Laws against interracial marriage were unconstitutional
because race was not a valid precondition to marriage, as sex between
colors still produces children. Interracial marriage prohibitions
existed not because marriage didn\'t make sense for them, but they
existed to discourage them from happening, in the interest of white
supremacy. Therefore, they were rightly found to be unconstitutional.\
\
So in order to accommodate same-sex couples in an institution which
makes no sense for them to join, we have to redefine marriage.\
\
That\'s the question before the courts: is it Constitutionally
appropriate to redefine marriage? Is it necessary? Is it right?\
\
Since nearly all of the \"benefits\" of marriage can be extended to
unmarried couples \-- including same-sex couples \-- without redefining
marriage law, I fail to see, from a purely legal view, how redefining
the institution of marriage to include people for whom it makes no sense
serves the greatest good.\
\
Once you redefine marriage to include same-sex couples, you then create
a new, less-justifiable distinction in the law. You exclude groups of
people who qualify for marriage in every way except for their lack of a
sexual relationship. Prime example: two same-sex friends who share a
house and a mortgage and bills. They may even raise a child together
after one of their wives dies. They are closer to each other than
brothers; they love each other like brothers. Why shouldn\'t the state
recognize their relationship as well? Because they aren\'t gay? There\'s
no \"inclusion\" there. How can gays possibly explain that
discrimination simply because that couple doesn\'t have sex?\
\
Because it doesn\'t make sense for them, and because it will create
more, less-justifiable distinctions in the law, I don\'t see the court
ruling that all states must redefine marriage to include same-sex
couples.]{.rendered_qtext}
