Not at all. But *how* you question is important.

The other thing to understand is that Christians *should* be prepared to
defend their faith, but most are not. Most do not understand enough to
be able to articulate what they believe and why. So many Christians will
become defensive and fall back on illogical statements like "I believe
the Bible is the word of God because the Bible says so." Christians
should be prepared to explain why they believe as they do, but many are
not.

This is on them, not on you. Their response indicates their level of
understanding of their own faith, and their illogical and sometimes
emotional responses exist because your question *convicts them*. They
should know how to answer those questions, but they do not.

Why should they know? Jesus told them they should know:

> All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking,
> correcting and training in righteousness, so that the servant of God
> may be thoroughly equipped for every good work. --- 2 Tim 3:16--17 NIV
>
> He answered, "'Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all
> your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind'; and,
> 'Love your neighbor as yourself.'" --- Luke 10:27 NIV

Paul says in his letter to Timothy that the Bible is useful for
teaching, training, correcting and rebuking, so that the servant of God
may be thoroughly equipped for every good work. Jesus said to love the
Lord with all your mind. How do you do that? By learning everything you
can, and being prepared to defend your faith, which only increases your
own understanding of your faith.

\

Accordingly, it would be wrong to denigrate the entire belief system
because some adherents are not fully prepared to explain and defend
their faith. Every religion has adherents who exercise blind faith, even
atheists. I would say *especially* atheists, but that's a question for
another answer.

So back to my opening statement. How you ask is important. If you are
asking because you're just trying to find a Christian who is unprepared
to answer, that's an issue. But if you are truly questioning, find
someone who at least has a modicum of training in apologetics who can
attempt to answer your question. It may still be insufficient for you,
but at least you'll get *an* answer and it won't be illogical.
