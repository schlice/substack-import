**Content:** [If the police have a warrant, whether or not your roommate
gives permission is irrelevant. The search covers what the warrant lists
as covered. If it covers your room, then no amount of locked doors will
prevent anything.\
\
I will assume that the police do not have a warrant, and they can only
search what they are given permission to search. In that instance, in
most jurisdictions, **your roommate is allowed to consent to a search of
your room**. Your lease does not define \"areas\" within your apartment
or home that exclusively belong to one person or another. You both are
listed on the lease, so you both have full access to the full facility.\
\
You may have defined areas in your apartment or home that \"belong\" to
one of you or to the other of you, but that\'s an \"agreement\" between
the two of you and is not legally binding in most jurisdictions. Your
roommate can grant access to search a room, and if he can get in, so can
the police. If your roommate can\'t get in, the police can enter the
room with your roommate\'s permission. So hopefully your roommate
doesn\'t give them permission to search your room. Doesn\'t matter what
you have posted on your door. Doesn\'t matter that your door is locked.
If your roommate is on the lease, he can give permission for any part of
the home to be searched. Legally, this is allowed because the roommate
is on the lease. Again, this is variable dependent on jurisdiction. In
practice, though, it is unlikely that this would happen because you\'re
crossing into legal gray area, and police want whatever they find to be
admissible in court, so they are going to make sure they cover their
bases.\
\
Ultimately, what would happen in that circumstance is that if the police
encounter a locked door, even if the roommate gives permission, but the
person who exclusively uses that space is not home to grant access, the
police will get a telephonic warrant to search that location if they
have probable cause to believe that something they want is in there.
Then they will break the door and enter. Should only take them about 20
minutes to secure a telephonic warrant, and then they will enter your
room anyway.\
\
It\'s likely that if the police don\'t know or can\'t articulate what
they are looking for, even if they have the roommate\'s permission, they
won\'t enter your locked room without a warrant.\
\
The only exception to this would be exigent circumstances. If they
believe you are holding a prisoner in there against their will or if
they believe that evidence is in there in the process of being destroyed
(i.e. you stareted a wipe of a hard drive and then locked your door and
left), then they can enter without a warrant.]{.rendered_qtext}
