I read this piece a few years ago when it was published in our local
newspaper. It was written by a guy named Lewis Napper, who ran for the
Senate in Mississippi as a Libertarian. Anyway, it's a great piece, so I
will reproduce it for you here. Enjoy!

> riots, keep our nation safe, promote positive behavior and secure the
> blessings of debt free liberty to ourselves and our great great-great
> grandchildren, hereby try one more time to ordain and establish some

> delusional, and other liberal bedwetters.

> Bill of No Rights.
>
> - ARTICLE I \-- You do not have the right to a new car, big screen TV
>   or any form of wealth. More power to you if you can legally acquire
>   them, but no one is guaranteeing anything.
> - ARTICLE II \-- You do not have the right to never be offended. This
>   country is based on freedom, and that means the freedom for
>   everyone, not just you! You may leave the room, turn the channel,
>   express a different opinion, etc., but the world is full of idiots
>   and probably always will be.
> - ARTICLE III \-- You do not have the right to be free from harm. If
>   you stick a screwdriver in your eye, learn to be more careful. Do
>   not expect the tool manufacturer to make you and all your relatives
>   independently wealthy.
> - ARTICLE IV \-- You do not have the right to free food and housing.
>   Americans are the most charitable people to be found, and will
>   gladly help anyone in need but we are quickly growing weary of
>   subsidizing generations of professional couch potatoes who achieve
>   nothing more than the creation of another generation of professional
>   couch potatoes.
> - ARTICLE V \-- You do not have the right to free health care. That
>   would be nice but, from the looks of public housing, we\'re just not
>   interested in government run health care.
> - ARTICLE VI \-- You do not have the right to physically harm other
>   people. If you kidnap, rape, intentionally maim or kill someone,
>   don\'t be surprised if the rest of us want to see you fry in the
>   electric chair.
> - ARTICLE VII \-- You do not have the right to the possessions of
>   others. If you rob, cheat or coerce away the goods or services of
>   other citizens, don\'t be surprised if the rest of us get together
>   and lock you away in a place where you still won\'t have the right
>   to a big screen TV or a life of leisure.
> - ARTICLE VIII \-- You don\'t have the right to demand that our
>   children risk their lives in foreign wars to soothe your aching
>   conscience. We hate oppressive governments and won\'t lift a finger
>   to stop you from going to fight, if you\'d like. However, we do not
>   enjoy parenting the entire world and do not want to spend so much of
>   our time battling each and every little tyrant with a military
>   uniform and a funny hat.
> - ARTICLE IX \-- You don\'t have the right to a job. All of us sure
>   want all of you to have one, and will gladly help you in hard times,
>   but we expect you to take advantage of the opportunities of
>   education and vocational training laid before you to make yourself
>   useful.
> - ARTICLE X \-- You do not have the right to happiness. Being an
>   American means that you have the right to pursue happiness \-- which
>   by the way, is a lot easier if you are unencumbered by an over
>   abundance of idiotic laws created by those of you who were confused
>   by the Bill of Rights.
