**Content:** [So clearly, wading through all the answers here we
established that the largest driver in healthcare costs is the insurance
companies that are supposed to be paying for our care. We have a
healthcare system controlled by insurance instead of by doctors.\
\
Why can insurance demand such high prices? There are many reasons why
insurers charge such high dollar premiums:\
\
1. Lack of competition. Since insurance companies can\'t compete across
state lines, they essentially hold mini-monopolies within their states,
driving up costs. We need to fight for opening up insurance markets
interstate to ensure competition, better access, and better coverage.\
\
2. Pharmaceutical costs. Regulations have hamstringed the pharmaceutical
industry in such a way that competition has effectively been eliminated
and costs have been allowed to artificially increase. We need to get
back onto Big Pharma and get those drug costs back under control. The
advent of generics was a good start, but cost controls must continue.
Since insurance pays for drugs, the high cost of drugs contributes to
the high cost of insurance and the high cost of healthcare.\
\
And I understand that R&D is expensive, but when your R&D is so
expensive that my drug retails for more than \$10,000 for a 3-month
supply (MS drugs, I\'m looking at you), something is not right. Without
insurance, who could afford that?\
\
3. Liability insurance for doctors is very very expensive. We must do
better at tort reform to control the exorbitant cost of what doctors
have to pay to practice.\
\
There are many things that could be done without having to take 25% of
the US economy and creating a massive new government bureaucracy to
administer it.]{.rendered_qtext}
