You will need to boot into recovery mode and wipe your phone. Please
follow [[this
guide](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=62d288&url=https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/use-recovery-mode-android/){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="digitaltrends.com"}]{.qlink_container} to boot your device
into recovery mode. You will then select the **Wipe Data/Factory Reset**
option from the recovery menu. Use the volume up/volume down buttons to
move to the option, and press the power button to select.

***PLEASE NOTE: Doing this will wipe all of your programs and data, and
will return the device to factory new settings. You will have to restore
your settings from your last Google backup and your apps will need to be
re-installed (this will happen when you log back in to your Google
account). The third-party app will NOT be re-installed.***

***AGAIN: THIS IS A DATA DESTRUCTIVE OPERATION! YOUR DEVICE WILL BE
WIPED WHEN YOU DO THIS!***

Okay, now that the big warnings are done, understand that this will wipe
and re-install your device from the recovery partition. You will need to
log back in to your Google account when you re-start the initialization
process because of FRP (Factory Reset Protection), so be aware of that.
When you re-initialize the phone, it will ask you to restore from a
recent Google backup, so your apps and settings will be restored. Any
personal data you had on the device *may not* have been backed up in
either your Google or Samsung accounts, so be prepared for that.

Good luck!
