Most laws about child porn include not only possession but consumption.
The reason that they do this, and the reason that consumption of child
porn is illegal, is because the government is trying to shape the
marketplace for child porn through the law. If we make it illegal to
watch, some people might not do it. If they don't do it, they won't buy
it, thereby shrinking the market for such material. There are indeed
some people who don't do things simply because it's illegal to do.

Original question:

Why is it illegal to watch child pornography, but it isn\'t illegal to
watch videos of people getting murdered?
