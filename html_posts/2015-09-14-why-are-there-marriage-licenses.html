**Content:** [There\'s a long history that goes behind marriage
licenses. It has a lot to do with old marriage laws, along with the idea
that it was governments responsibility to take care of the children that
are produced by sex between men and women.\
\
In the United States, it used to be law that sex outside of marriage was
illegal. Laws against adultery has been removed from US law, but that
didn\'t change the fact that states felt as if it was their obligation
to take care of the children that resulted from sex between men and
women. Thus, marriage licenses were issued to ensure that genealogy was
upheld legally, and parental support for children was codified.\
\
In today\'s society, there is a de-emphasis on the tie between marriage
and children, the common view clearly indicating that such a tie is
outdated and unnecessary.\
\
Also, since religion is not regulated, any religion can marry any people
they choose. In order to maintain some order over who reaps the legal
benefits of marriage (such as they are), the state issues licenses to
ensure that all of the legal requirements for marriage are met. This is
the current use of the marriage license.\
\
When all governmental benefits of marriage are removed from federal and
state law, there will be no legal benefit to marriage, and licensing
will not be required any longer. But if there are any federal or state
benefits at all to marriage, licensing to ensure that state requirements
are met will still be required.]{.rendered_qtext}
