**Can a police department fire an officer if he has to leave for a
deployment?**

*Technically*, they can. However, under most circumstances, they must
re-hire the officer upon his return into a position of equal grade as
the position he left, and he cannot lose any senority (i.e. he will
re-start in the organization as if he had never left).

The law (the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act,
or USERRA) protects both the interests of the Guardsman/Reservist as
well as the employer. It states that certain extenuating circumstances
will relieve the employer from re-hiring the Guardsman/Reservist (when
the employer's circumstances have changed so radically that reemployment
would be unreasonable, or if the person worked at highly irregular or
seasonal employment). However, employment at a police department (which
is also considered a local government agency and follows stricter rules
than civilian employment) should not fall under those categories.

Most employers hold the position open while the Guardsman/Reservist is
deployed. If they are gone on a full deployment (6 months or more), the
employer can backfill the slot, but again, according to the law, the
employer must re-hire the Guardsman/Reservist at the same grade he was
at before he left, with no loss of tenure or senority.

Employers are only required to pay a deployed reservist the difference
between their military pay and what they were making when not deployed.
My employer did not do this, and they voluntarily chose to continue to
pay me at my normal salaried rate.
