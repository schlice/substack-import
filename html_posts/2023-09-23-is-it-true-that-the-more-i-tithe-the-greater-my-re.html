In the *vast* majority of cases, no.

You cannot *buy* favor with God. And you only need to read Mark
12:41--44 in order to recognize this.

Jesus was watching not only their offerings, but their *hearts*. He
could see not only what they gave, but *why* they gave it. The text says
"Many rich people threw in large amounts." Today, we often see
celebrities donate large sums of money to charities in an effort to
*virtue signal* to people; to telegraph their supposed kindness or
benevolence. Do we "clang our coins" while we donate, so that others may
notice? Do we donate for the praise of man, or for the glory of God?

The poor woman was praised for donating her two coins not because of the
amount, but because she gave out of *faith.*

Our challenge is the same. We are challenged to not only to give from
what we have in abundance, but to give what we have out of *faith*.

The other thing to note is that Jesus is not saying it's bad to have
wealth. But in this story, as well as with the story of the rich young
man who was told to give away his money (Matthew 19:16--30), our wealth
can "get in the way" of our discipleship and our walk with Christ. We
must also be cautious of this, and not allow money to get in our way of
our faith walk, as it can very easily become the "god" in our lives.
