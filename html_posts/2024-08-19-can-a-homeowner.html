As always with legal questions, the answer is "it depends."

If the Governing Documents have rules regarding appropriate sitting
attire for sitting in your own backyard, and they can enforce that rule
without violating your rights as a homeowner, then yes, they can. But
most do not.

Perhaps in your neighborhood, you can't have privacy fences (my
neighborhood in Colorado did not permit privacy fences other than in
very limited circumstances, and even where they were allowed, it was not
at the yard boundaries). In that case, you are visible from your
neighbor's properties, and it might be considered reasonable for the HOA
to create rules dictating appropriate attire for your backyard, so that
everyone can enjoy their yards.

In some cases, the HOA cannot regulate anything in the back yard that is
not visible from the street or from a neighbor's yard. With some
exceptions, Florida state statute does not allow HOAs to regulate what
you do in your backyard if it is not visible from the street or from a
neighbor's yard.

So any time you have a question about a particular HOA, check that HOA's
Governing Documents, because it says very clearly what the HOA can and
cannot regulate.
