**Does being impeached really mean nothing?**

Thanks to the current House of Representatives, impeachment means much
less than it did before.

Previously, the bar for impeachment was the commission of a crime.

Today, any presidential conduct we don't like can be considered an
"abuse of power" and can be impeachable.

Comparing all previous presidents to the current standard, ***every
previous president we have ever had in the United States, including
George Washington, could have been impeached under this standard.***

So this House has cheapened impeachment and turned it into exactly the
partisan political weapon that Hamilton warned us against in Fed 75. He
warned us that impeachment should never turn on solely the party in
political power; it should have broad, bipartisan consent before moving
forward.

This House ignored Hamilton's warning, and now, any president can be
impeached for maladministration that we call abuse of power.

Democrats forgot to apply the "other foot test" to this impeachment.
When the shoe is on the other foot, will they complain? In other words,
when we have a Democrat president and a Republican-controlled House, and
we impeach the president for abuse of power, purely along party lines,
will they complain?

I bet they will.
