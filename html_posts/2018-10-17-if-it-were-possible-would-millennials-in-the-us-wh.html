**If it were possible, would millennials in the US who can\'t find
employment volunteer to serve on juries for compensation?**

It's not possible.

Jury duty is not employment. Serving on a jury is one of those civic
duties you have as part of being a citizen of a state.

Creating a class of "professional jurors" removes that civic
responsibility from jury duty, and makes it "just a job."
