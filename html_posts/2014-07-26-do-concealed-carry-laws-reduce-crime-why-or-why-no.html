If you were a criminal, which one of these signs would deter you more?
In other words, if you were a criminal, and you approached a property
showing one of these two signs, which one would you hit?\
\
If you were a patron, within which establishment would you feel safer?\
\
Why do criminals not go on shooting sprees in police stations? Why do
they choose schools? Movie theaters? Because while they are insane, they
are not stupid. They want the biggest \"bang for their buck\" (no pun
intended) with the least possibility of dying before they kill as many
people as possible. So they go to the places that are most likely to
meet the least armed resistance and kill the most people.\
\
So again: if you were going to go commit a mass murder, which one of
those two establishments would you commit your crime at?
