**If someone is doing a drive by at my house in Mississippi, am I
allowed to shoot back or am I only allowed to take cover?**

While it may be *legal* to return fire (which is debatable), it is
extremely *unwise*.

Yes, you are being threatened with deadly force (i.e. you are being
fired upon) so it is most likely legal to return fire. But firing on a
moving vehicle in a densely-populated neighborhood is immensely stupid.
One of the RULES of firearms (which you should know if you have one) is
KNOW YOUR TARGET AND WHAT'S BEHIND IT. What's behind your target?
Houses? With people in them? It's probably not a good idea to fire when
you could potentially be throwing lead into your neighbor's house.

Now, if your drive-by turns into a firefight into a ***stationary*** car
(i.e. they stop in front of your house), now it's a different story. Now
you're not shooting at a moving car. Now you're shooting at a stationary
target. Hope you have one of those evil AR-15s. You could use a little
bit of that evil at that point.

But a moving vehicle will just keep on moving. Get the information from
the vehicle (license, occupants, etc) and let it go. Take cover and wait
for it to pass.
