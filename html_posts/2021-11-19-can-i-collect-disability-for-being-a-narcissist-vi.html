The government defines a person with a disability as "a person who has a
physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more
major life activity. This includes people who have a record of such an
impairment, even if they do not currently have a disability. It also
includes individuals who do not have a disability but are regarded as
having a disability."[\[1\]](#UnYPP){#cite-UnYPP .citation_link}

Being a victim of a narcissist is exactly that. It's something you seek
therapy for, not claim disability for. You can recover. You are not a
"forever victim."

HOWEVER, *the narcissist* may actually be disabled! Narcissistic
Personality Disorder (NPD) is a form of mental illness. Mental illness
can be a disability if it is significantly impairing, such that it
substantially limits one or more major life activities. The degree and
extent to which a person\'s functioning is impaired is an important
factor in determining mental health disability.

But for you, as a victim of a narcissist, if you're feeling disabled by
your victimhood, it's high time to seek some counseling assistance.
They'll help you feel better. If you don't know where to start,

Original question:

Can I collect disability for being a narcissist victim? I feel almost
like I\'m disabled.
