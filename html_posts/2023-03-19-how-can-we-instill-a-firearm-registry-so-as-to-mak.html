You\'ll have better luck deleting the Constitution and installing a
monarchy. But let\'s review anyway.

To implement a firearms registry, you\'ll need to first repeal federal
law: the Firearm Owner's Protection Act of 1986, which prohibits the
Federal government from maintaining a national firearms registry.

But before you repeal the law, you\'ll need to explain the benefit of
such a registry. You\'ll need to show how such a registry would prevent
crime.

Finally, you\'ll have to identify all the current gun owners without
violating their rights. Good luck getting them all to come forward
voluntarily. There are some records of some gun purchases from FFLs who
went out of business and turned their Form 4473s over to the ATF, but
that only shows the first registered owner of record. If the gun was
sold privately since then, there would be no record of where it went.
Similarly, if the gun was lost or stolen, those records would also be
useless.

The truth of the matter is that very few criminals who use guns bought
them legally. The vast majority of criminals bought their guns from
unscrupulous FFLs who "conveniently lose paperwork," or guns illegally
transported and sold with no paperwork at all. Some crimes are committed
with legally purchased firearms which have been stolen, and a registry
still does no good in this case. Finally, nearly all of the mass
shooters who were mentally unstable passed all background checks.

And what sort of \"monitoring\" would you find acceptable? A drone that
follows a gun owner around 24x7? That doesn\'t seem a little intrusive
to you?

And that doesn\'t even address why you think conservatives are
overwhelmingly criminals. I\'d love to see your statistics on that. I
think that says more about you than about criminals.
