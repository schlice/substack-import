There are many obstacles to home ownership these days (mid-2022). But
today, the biggest obstacle that most new home buyers face is **price**.
Homes are just too expensive because of a current housing shortage. The
median price for a previously owned home sold in April hit a record
\$391,000, up 15% from a year ago. As of today, there are only about 1
million homes for sale in the US, and that is exceedingly low.

And loans are more expensive because interest rates have gone up because
the economy is in recession. The rate on a 30-year mortgage has jumped
from 3.7% in February to nearly 5.5%, the highest level since 2009. Some
homebuilders may be starting to worry that new prospective homeowners
will pass on buying a house because of this.

In response, we are seeing the rise of **fractional real estate,** where
you own a percentage of a property and essentially "lease" the property.

\$100." Startups like

real estate more accessible through co-ownership and provide new
pathways for investing in the fractional real estate market. Indeed,
some pension funds are including real estate investment trusts (REITs)
in their portfolios, which shows that they have confidence in the future
of this industry.

Therefore, people won't *completely* own their own homes any more. You
may own a fraction of a home, but you won't own your own home if you
can't afford to buy it yourself. You'll probably rent the home from a
real estate investment trust.
