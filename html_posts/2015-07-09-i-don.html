**Content:** [First, answer this question: *What would you do
differently if you knew that today was your last day?*\
\
Next, answer this question: *Why do you have to wait until your last day
to do those things?*\
\
Live your life to the fullest, every day. Make today the best day you
can, because you never know what may happen tomorrow. Be the best you
that you can be. And then, if you are blessed enough to get another day
to do it all over again, do it!\
\
Live for today. Don\'t put off until tomorrow. Tomorrow never comes.
There will always be another tomorrow (until there\'s not, of course,
and then you\'ve missed your chance). You only get one go in this life;
make it count!]{.rendered_qtext}
