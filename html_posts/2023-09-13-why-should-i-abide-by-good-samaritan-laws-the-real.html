I think you may be confused about what a "Good Samaritan" law does.

"Good Samaritan" laws are laws which protect you, legally, from
liability, **if you choose to stop and help someone**. The laws do not
*compel* you to help.

In fact, there are very few "duty to assist" laws in the United States
at all, and if they do exist, they are for very specific groups of
people, like doctors.

There are three other conditions, in common law, under which you have a
duty to help:

- You caused the peril
- You started assisting
- You have a special relationship with the person needing assistance
  (i.e. parent/child)

Beyond these three, generally speaking, there is no duty to assist.

There are a few state exceptions:
