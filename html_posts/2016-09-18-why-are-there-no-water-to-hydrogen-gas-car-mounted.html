The name for the real system which uses hydrogen and oxygen in the air,
and incites an exothermic reaction resulting in heat and water is called
a "fuel cell." [[Fuel cell

produced and sold.

Some of the problems with fuel cell vehicles:

- Hydrogen infrastructure. As of March, 2016, there were only 23
  publicly-accessible hydrogen refueling stations in the United States,
  and 20 of them were in California.
- Sustainability. While hydrogen is definitely clean to use, it is not
  necessarily clean to produce. Sometimes, hydrogen is the by-product of
  natural gas production, and if it is bottled and distributed, its
  actual production impact is negligible. And even better, hydrogen can
  be produced and bottled right at the fueling station using
  electrolysis or other methods to split water atoms and produce
  hydrogen. Currently, the challenge is getting the cost of such
  equipment low enough that the cost of selling hydrogen offsets the
  cost of producing it and makes it a competitive alternative to fossil
  fuels.
- Energy loss. Volkswagen\'s Rudolf Krebs said in 2013 that \"no matter
  how excellent you make the cars themselves, the laws of physics hinder
  their overall efficiency. The most efficient way to convert energy to
  mobility is electricity.\" He elaborated: \"Hydrogen mobility only
  makes sense if you use green energy\", but you need to convert it
  first into hydrogen \"with low efficiencies\" where \"you lose about
  40 percent of the initial energy\". You then must compress the
  hydrogen and store it under high pressure in tanks, which uses more
  energy. \"And then you have to convert the hydrogen back to
  electricity in a fuel cell with another efficiency loss\". Krebs
  continued: \"in the end, from your original 100 percent of electric
  energy, you end up with 30 to 40 percent. This is not the same sort of
  efficiency you get from fossil fuels.[\[1\]](#BsGmq){#cite-BsGmq
