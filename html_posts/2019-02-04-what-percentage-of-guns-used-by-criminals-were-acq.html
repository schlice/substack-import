**What percentage of guns used by criminals were acquired from an
acquaintance or family member who themselves were "legal owners"?**

This data is very difficult to come by. First of all, not all transfers
from legal owners would have been illegal at the time of the transfer.
This means that this data only tells us where the weapon came from. It
says nothing about whether or not the transfer was legal at the time it
took place.

That said, it's a very low percentage of crimes committed with firearms
acquired legally (i.e. through legal purchases). Experts say that it's
somewhere between 3 and 11%. This data is acquired through interviews
with prison inmates who used a gun during the commission of their crime.
11% of these inmates said they legally purchased their guns. 37%
acquired their guns from a friend or family member, and about 40% of
these inmates said they bought the gun on the black market or stole
it.[\[1\]](#gHdjF){#cite-gHdjF .citation_link}

Again, this only tells us where the gun came from. It doesn't tell us
whether or not the acquisition was legal when it happened.
