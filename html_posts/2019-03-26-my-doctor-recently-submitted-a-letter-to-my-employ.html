**My doctor recently submitted a letter to my employer for some minimal
ADA accommodations, however my general manager became angry and has been
very mean to me and not acknowledge them what do I do?**

Since you mentioned ADA, I'll assume you're in the United States.

First of all, an employer *is* allowed to ask for medical documentation
when a disability is not apparent. For example, if you use a wheelchair
and you ask your employer to raise the height of a desk to accommodate
your chair, they probably don't need to ask for medical documentation
before making that accommodation.

However, if you have a hidden disability, an employer may ask for
medical documentation before making an accommodation. For example, if
you have rheumatoid arthritis which is made worse by below average
indoor temperatures in the office and you request a space heater, your
employer may ask for medical documentation before purchasing and
installing that heater.

Now, on to the next part of your question.

It sounds like you submitted a request for an accommodation, your
employer asked for documentation, you provided it, and the employer
granted the accommodation. Now, the employer has changed his attitude
towards you, and treats you differently in the workplace because you
requested an accommodation.

If this is the case, **it is illegal.**

This behavior is called **reprisal**, and it is a negative action taken
in response to you exercising a protected legal right.

The EEOC defines three elements in order to identify reprisal:

1.  **protected activity**: \"participation\" in an EEO process or
    \"opposition\" to discrimination;
2.  **materially adverse action** taken by the employer; and
3.  a requisite level of **causal connection** between the protected
    activity and the materially adverse action**.**

This means:

- You participated in a "protected activity" (i.e. you requested
  ADA-compliant accommodations for a disability)
- Your employer engaged in "materially adverse action" after you engaged
  in the protected activity. This provision covers any employer action
  that \"might well deter a reasonable employee from complaining about
  discrimination.\"[\[1\]](#JEtVd){#cite-JEtVd .citation_link} If the
  employer's behavior towards you might deter a reasonable employee from
  complaining about discrimination, it counts as a materially adverse
  action.
- A connection has to be made between the exercise of your protected
  activity and the materially adverse action taken by the employer. In
  other words, if you can connect, even casually, the exercise of your
  rights with the change in the employer's treatment of you, they have
  satisfied the causal connection component.

It seems to me, from a casual reading of your question, that you may
have a claim under the ADA.

The question, of course, is what to do about it.

Your first stop should be your HR department. You must advise them that
the behavior you see could potentially be in violation of the EEOC's
guidelines surrounding reprisals, and tell them everything we have
documented here. Let them make the first move. They may discuss the
matter with the general manager, and that may be the end of it.

If it is not, your only other option is to seek professional legal
advice. You'll want to visit your local ACLU office or your local EEOC
office and ask to speak to an attorney about a possible ADA claim.

Good luck.
