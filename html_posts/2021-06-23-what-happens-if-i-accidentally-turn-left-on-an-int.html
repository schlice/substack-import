If the camera was there to enforce the left turn rule, and you violated
the rule, the registered owner of the vehicle (based on the license
plate) will get a ticket in the mail.

Depending on the laws in your state, but true in most places, the ticket
is not a moving violation, so you won't incur points or lose your
license if you don't pay. But if you don't pay, they'll turn the ticket
over to collections and it will ding your credit score, and you'll have
a collection agency hounding you to pay.

If the registered owner of the vehicle was not driving the vehicle at
the time of the incident, he/she can have the ticket thrown out, as
he/she was not driving the vehicle at the time.

Original question:

What happens if I accidentally turn left on an intersection but it's
prohibited to turn left from Monday-Friday from 3-7pm and there was a
surveillance camera?
