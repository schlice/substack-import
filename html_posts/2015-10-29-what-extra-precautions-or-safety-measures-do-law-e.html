**Content:** [Your best bet is situational awareness. Knowing what\'s
going on around you at all times. It\'s great in the car, too. If I have
to change lanes in a hurry, I know what way to go, because I know who is
around me.\
\
And since video recording is such a big deal these days, I got a video
surveillance system for my home. It doesn\'t hook into the alarm system,
but it doesn\'t have to. It records any time there\'s motion, and it
will preserve video for over a month. It\'s on a UPS, so don\'t bother
trying to cut the power. The alarm system uses cellular primarily, so
don\'t bother trying to cut the coax for the Internet. My cameras will
still record you, and my alarm system will call the police. They may not
respond any time soon, but there will be a record that we notified the
police. I want the evidence of who did it. I know that my locked doors,
as secure as they are, won\'t keep a truly determined bad guy out. So
the best thing I can do is to get some evidence I can hand over to the
police.\
\
As far as when I\'m home, I have a dog. She would absolutely love any
intruder to death. But you can\'t tell from outside the door, because
all you hear is a very loud, very scary-sounding bark. Good thing
burglars can\'t speak dog, because they will hear, \"Hey, come on in!
Let me get my ball and we\'ll play!\"\
\
And as [[Al
Saibini](https://www.quora.com/profile/Al-Saibini)]{.qlink_container}
mentioned, you don\'t have to make your home a fortress. A story which
illustrates this point: Two hunters are out on safari when a cheetah
spots them first and starts heading their direction. On seeing this one
hunter stops, takes off his backpack, and retrieves a pair of running
shoes. The other hunter says, \"Man, what are you doing? Why are you
bothering with those? You can\'t outrun a *cheetah!*\" The first hunter
replies, \"I don\'t need to outrun a cheetah. I just need to outrun
*you.*\"\
\
You don\'t need to turn your house into a fortress. You just have to
make it look like less of a target than your neighbor\'s
house.]{.rendered_qtext}
