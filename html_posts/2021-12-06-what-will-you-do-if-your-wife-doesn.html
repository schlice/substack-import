Well, you'll have a lot more time on your hands!

Anyway, maybe talk to her? Find out why. Maybe there is a physical
problem (and if there is, you need to determine if she's really
interested in working on fixing it or not). Maybe it's the fact that she
pushed three kids out of that hole and she really doesn't want anything
else going in there. Or maybe she just doesn't love you anymore. Until
you sit down and have an honest conversation with her about this, you'll
never know. Talking about things together would solve like 90% of
marital problems.

As for the sex, I can think of at least...*\<counting on
fingers\>...*six other things off the top of my head that she can do
that don't involve intercourse but still satisfy my needs. Perhaps she
could find one of those that she could do instead. Until you find out
what the problem is, you won't be able to determine what to do to fix
it.

What will you do if your wife doesn\'t want to make love with you
