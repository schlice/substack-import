**Would the suspension of the second amendment prevent a determined
psychopath from obtaining a gun?**

HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA

When has a ***law*** ever stopped a criminal (let alone a mentally
unstable criminal) from doing ***anything???***

Even if you could magically take every gun away from every law abiding
person in the United States, there will still be criminals who get their
guns from the black market. Guns are routinely smuggled in across the
border (which is wide open and works very well allowing guns across).

Odd how the same people who want to remove the Second Amendment don't
care about plugging the holes where actual, illegal guns are smuggled
in.

And what if a determined psychopath snuck up on a cop, stabbed him in
the neck with a knife and stole his gun?

Wait! I have a great idea! Let's take the guns away from the **cops** so
the psychopaths can't steal those guns, either!

It's like the bully in Kindergarten who steals all the other kids toys,
and your solution is to take the toys away from everyone so the bully
has nothing to steal. Except now he uses crayons as toys. Are you going
to take everyone's crayons away?

And in all actuality, *who cares about guns?* Determined psychopaths
used a ***pressure cooker*** to make a bomb in Boston, and because they
were morons, they didn't kill a lot of people, but they could have
killed a lot more than they did. Shall we ban pressure cookers? And what
happens when a determined psychopath uses a liquid propane tank to
fashion a bomb? Shall we ban liquid propane tanks? And what happens when
a psychopath decides to kill a building full of people by padlocking the
door and lighting it on fire with gasoline? Are we going to start
regulating padlocks and registering purchasers of gasoline? How will
this affect that kid in gym class? Will he need a Federal permit to open
his gym locker?

***When do we stop focusing on the objects used to commit crime, and
start focusing on the people committing crime?***
