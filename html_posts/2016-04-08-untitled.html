So you\'re saying that the Executive branch could force its workers to
be of a particular religion, and could potentially punish them for
failing to do so.

In the United States, this is true. It could happen. It legally can
happen. Just as many states do not regulate how the businesses in their
state run, the government is left to regulate itself as far as how it
runs.

The question then becomes: will it ever happen?

Take a look at this: [[GUIDELINES ON RELIGIOUS EXERCISE AND RELIGIOUS
EXPRESSION IN THE FEDERAL
WORKPLACE](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=d6035b&url=http://clinton2.nara.gov/WH/New/html/19970819-3275.html){.external_link

This was written during the Clinton era, and applies to all Federal
agencies. Could it be re-written by another President? Yes, it could.

It\'s hard to imagine it being done without becoming a huge black eye
for that administration, since most people in the US take their
religious freedom very seriously.
