Because they don't want to.

There is a difference between *proving* a proposition and *accepting* a
proposition. I may be able to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that
Christianity is true, but only the atheist can choose to accept it.

If I ever meet an atheist that I could have a reasonable conversation
with (and I have yet to do so), I would ask him the following: if I
could provide reasonable answers to all of the questions and objections
he may have about Christianity, *would he become a Christian?* If the
answer is no, then the problem is **not** one of a lack of facts. The
problem is volitional, not intellectual. No amount of evidence would
convince such an atheist, because evidence is not what is in the
atheist's way. The atheist is in the atheist's way.

In the end, only the atheist knows if he is truly open to accept the
evidence for Christianity.

Original question:

Why don\'t atheists just start believing in God so they can go to
heaven?
