**Can I legally have a ring doorbell installed outside of my apartment
door if I have other neighbors?**

Yes you can! If you can look out of your peephole and see your
neighbors, you can install a Ring cam and see them, too.

But I wouldn't install a standard Ring cam, because it risks damaging
the door or siding. You'd have to get permission for that, and there's
no guarantee they'd let you.

However, Ring to the rescue!

This device is a Ring Peephole Camera. It replaces the existing peephole
in your apartment door. No drilling required, no damage to the door.
Instructions and tools are included which assist you with removing your
existing peephole and replacing it with the Ring peephole cam.

The Ring Video Doorbell for Peepholes has the following features:

- Upgrade your door's peephole with a 1080p HD video doorbell that
  enables you to see, hear, and speak to visitors from anywhere.
- Get alerts on your phone, tablet, and PC when anyone knocks on your
  door, presses the doorbell button, or triggers the motion sensors.
- Peephole Cam is easy to install and comes with all the tools you need
  to replace your peephole in under 5 minutes; no wiring or drilling
  required.
- Connect your Ring camera with Alexa then enable announcements to be
  alerted when motion is detected. Talk to visitors through compatible
  Echo devices by saying "Alexa, talk to the front door".
- Adjustable Motion Detection lets you easily adjust the built-in motion
  sensors to focus on and detect what's important to you.
- Always know when you have a delivery and tell the courier to place
  your packages in an ideal location.
- Includes Theft Protection: if your Peephole Cam gets stolen, we'll
  replace it for free.
- Oh, and it still functions as a standard peephole.

Two great things to point out: Door Knock detection, and Theft
Protection. Door knock detection means that if someone ignores the
camera and just knocks on your door (no one has ever used the knocker on
my peephole in my apartment), the Ring cam will still notify you that
someone is knocking on your door. Additionally, you still have motion
alerts for the Amazon drivers who just drop a package on your doorstep
without knocking (happens all too frequently).

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** As always, check your lease agreement to see what is
allowed and what is not. Most lease agreements allow you to make
modifications as long as you can revert the changes when you leave, and
the modification does not damage the facility or you will be liable for
the repair cost. In my last complex, we could change out our deadbolt
and replace it with a smart deadbolt if we chose, but we'd have to put
it back when we were done, and the landlord would still need a key. We
could also change out our peephole if we wanted to, with the same
caveats. Our maintenance guys were cool too; when I changed out my
peephole, the door paint was off underneath. They gave me a small
container (less than a pint) of door-colored paint to touch up the spots
around the original door knocker/peephole that I removed. No damage,
door looked great, happy happy.
