**If I accepted Jesus Christ into my heart does that mean I will go to
heaven but what if I continue to sin. And do we have to be baptized to
go to heaven?**

Let's take these one at a time.

**If I accepted Jesus Christ into my heart does that mean I will go to
heaven**

Not necessarily. If by "accepting Jesus Christ into your heart" you mean
that you agree that you are sinful and have fallen short of the grace of
God, you accept that Jesus died for your sins, and you accept this gift
and you choose to live your life as he wants you to live (presumably by
accepting Jesus into your heart), then yes, you are saved.

**but what if I continue to sin.**

Then you are human.

We are all sinful by our very nature. We even started this process by
admitting that we are all sinners and have fallen short of God's grace.
We can do nothing to achieve salvation by ourselves. It is only through
God's grace that we are saved.

But ask yourself this question: *if you have truly accepted Christ as
your personal savior and you are actively trying to pattern your life
after his, shouldn't your daily conduct* ***change****? Shouldn't your
sinfulness* ***improve****?*

The answer is that it should.

We may keep committing new sins. I amaze myself at all the ways I manage
to sin, despite my best efforts.

But being a sinful person, and being sinful *and then continuing to
commit the same sins over and over again* are two totally different
things.

If you truly have Jesus in your heart and you commit your life to his
direction, you should see your sinful state improve.

**And do we have to be baptized to go to heaven?**

No. Accepting Jesus as your lord and savior in the way we already
described is what saves you. God's grace saves you, not baptism.
However, baptism is an outward sign of our commitment to be "buried" to
our sinfulness and to be "raised up" to live in glory with him. The
Bible commands that we be baptized, but baptism doesn't save us from
sin. Grace does.
