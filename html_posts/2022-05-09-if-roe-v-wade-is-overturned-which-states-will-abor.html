The blue states on the map represent states where abortion is currently
protected by law. In those states, you can still legally get an
abortion.

If *Roe* is overturned, 23 states have enacted laws banning abortion. 10
of those states banned abortion since before *Roe*, but their laws were
unenforceable. 13 states have "trigger laws" which will automatically go
into effect if *Roe* is overturned. Florida just passed a 15 week
abortion ban which will go into effect in July.

This is the immediate effect after *Roe*, but this map can and will
change over time. Justice Ginsburg predicted this would happen. She
predicted that *Roe* would be overturned, and from the way things look
today, she was right.
