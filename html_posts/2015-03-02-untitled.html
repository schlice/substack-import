answered a similar question with a story that I am about to butcher
horribly; Cliff, please forgive me up front, but I\'m trying to make a
point.\
\
Cliff was at his girlfriend\'s apartment when he walked out to his car
to retrieve something. As he did so, he noticed a police car by the
mailbox, and at least one officer there. As he left his car and started
walking back towards his girlfriend\'s apartment, he was hit with a
spotlight and asked to approach the car. They asked him his name and
what he was doing at the apartments.\
\
At this point, did he have to answer that question? No, of course he did
not. He could have said \"I want a lawyer, I know my rights.\" But he
did answer (as he had nothing to hide), and he explained that he was at
his girlfriend\'s apartment. While he spoke with an officer outside, a
female officer went to his girlfriend\'s apartment to make sure she was
okay and to verify his story. Once the female officer returned, he was
free to leave.\
\
As it turns out, the officers were there on a DV (domestic violence)
call, and Cliff fit the description of the suspect (as I suspect about
75% of the residents and guests there did too). Had he not answered
their questions, had he chosen to say that he had the right to remain
silent and he wanted a lawyer, he likely would have been \"detained\"
and potentially arrested until his story could be verified or they
caught the actual assailant. But the fact that (up to a point) he was
cordial and answered their questions ensured his speedy return to his
life. Had they started asking prying questions, leading questions, or
questions pertaining to a specific incident, Cliff said that he would
have stopped being quite so cordial and would have asked for a truly
custodial interrogation.\
\
Cliff\'s approach to dealing with the officers was the right way to go.
Officers want nothing more than to do their jobs and to limit their
interaction with you. They know it\'s uncomfortable. *But they\'re not
all out to get you*. They\'re not trying to pin some bogus charge on
you. Believe me, they have **way** better things to do than to waste
time making up stories about you. And chances are, if they\'re talking
to you, it\'s because you\'re a suspect, or you fit the description of a
suspect. So it\'s best to say what you\'ve been up to so you can clear
yourself of suspicion. If you refuse to answer questions and make
yourself look ***more*** suspicious than you have to, you will be
arrested until they can determine whether or not you are actually
involved. You will be cleared eventually, but at great personal expense
(both time and money) to everyone involved.\
\
If you cooperate, you can be eliminated as a suspect immediately and
sent on your way.\
\
I suppose it\'s your choice; you can be adversarial, or you can be
cordial. You can say nothing at all beyond \"Hello,\" or you can answer
some basic questions that have no bearing on anything at all, like your
name. You can be cleared much more quickly if you are cooperative than
if you are adversarial.]{.rendered_qtext}
