**Can you sue for wrongful accusation of theft, slander, and public
embarrassment?**

In the United States, you can sue anyone for anything.

The question is: what is your chance of winning?

In this case, it's not great.

Generally, you have to show that you were *harmed* by the action, and
emotional harm is not enough to substantiate a slander charge. For
example, if the wrongful accusation cost you your job, you can sue for
slander. Wrongful accusation is not a cause of action, but would be part
of a slander charge. Public embarrassment is not a cause of action, but
it can be used to show the personal effect the slander had on you. It
could go to show the emotional distress the slander placed on you.

Also remember: truth is always a defense of a slander charge. If the
defendant can show proof of his allegation in any way, he will not be
found liable for slander.
