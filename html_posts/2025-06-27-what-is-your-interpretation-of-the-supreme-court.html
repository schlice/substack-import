The Court did a great job of breaking down the concept of "equity
jurisprudence." They basically said that, in essence, only the person
who sues can seek equity. Equity cannot be extended to people who did
not sue, even if they may be harmed by the action in question.

This puts to rest the practice of district courts granting nationwide
injunctions against Executive action. Crucially, it does not mean that
people cannot sue if they believe that the way the Executive action
affects **them** is unconstitutional. It also does not prevent **class
action** lawsuits from proceeding, to the extent that they can. The
order merely prevents district courts from overstepping their bounds and
imposing nationwide injunctions, as the court found that such power
likely oversteps the authority granted to district courts by Congress.

To the next part of your question, this decision is separate from the
question about birthright citizenship. This decision actually had
nothing to do with the question of birthright citizenship. It only
addressed the issue of nationwide injunctions. The Constitutionality of
Trump's Executive Order is still undecided.
