**Content:** [*This is a winning issue in 2016, and will be in 2020.*\
\
In what universe is this a \"winning issue\"? Obama didn\'t run on a gun
control platform; if he did, his presidency would be characterized as an
unmitigated failure. States have become more lax in their gun laws over
the past 6 years, not more stringent. Obama\'s record on gun control has
been abysmal.\
\
Gun control is political *suicide*, that\'s why no one touches it. Even
in the wake of Sandy Hook, the Colorado Planned Parenthood shooting
(which is probably as politically-motivated as you can get, although we
don\'t know for sure) and the San Bernardino terrorist action, we have
nothing. No significant gun control measures at all. Even when Colorado
legislators enacted a 10-round magazine limit, they were ***recalled***.
This would be the time to act, and politicians have done **squat**. Why?
Because gun control is political suicide.\
\
We have the most left-leaning president we have had since FDR (or
Carter) in the White House and he won\'t touch it with a ten-foot pole.
I ask again: in what universe is this a \"winning
issue\"?]{.rendered_qtext}
