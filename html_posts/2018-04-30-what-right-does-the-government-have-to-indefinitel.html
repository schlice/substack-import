**What right does the government have to indefinitely discriminate the
firearm privileges of non violent felons? You tell us its illegal to
discriminate, yet you do it? How can you make a law, turn around and
break it?**

Remember there is not one "government." There are 52 governments, and
only one of them is a Federal government.

I mention this because the rules are different in every state. In some
states, gun rights are never denied to felons (example: Alaska.
Convicted felons cannot *conceal* firearms). In some states, non-violent
felons can get their rights reinstated after a period of time following
their release. Depending on what rights are reinstated will determine
whether or not the Federal rights are reinstated as well. If, in your
state, *all* rights are reinstated, then the Federal prohibition on guns
is also lifted. However, if only your *gun rights* are reinstated at the
state level, but not your other citizen's rights (such as the right to
vote and the right to serve on a jury), then the Federal ban is still
intact and possession of a gun would still be a Federal crime.

Denying guns to any class of people (mentally defective, violent felons,
etc) would be a *Constitutional* violation, if it was a violation at
all. However, you must know that there are competing interests in the
Constitution. Yes, there is a Second Amendment which says that the right
to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed. But there is also the
admonition that the State provide for the common defense and promote the
general welfare. States have decided that violent felons and people who
are mentally defective should not own guns, in furtherance of the
"general welfare." Is that an *infringement* in the words of the Second
Amendment? You may think so, but the Supreme Court has said that it is
not.

In general, a Constitutional right can be *restricted* so long as it
furthers a compelling state interest, and it is done in the least
restrictive way to the holders of that right. Doing so does not
constitute *infringement* as far as the Constitution is concerned.
