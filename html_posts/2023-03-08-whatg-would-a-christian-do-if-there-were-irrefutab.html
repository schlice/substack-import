So the other major religions where there is a creator but not part of
the Abrahamic religions are pantheistic religions. And logically, we
know that pantheistic religions are false. Here's how we know this.

In order to know this, you must first ask the correct question. And that
question is the most fundamental question of life: *why am I here?* *Why
is there something, rather than nothing at all?* The search for the
truth about why something exists rather than nothing at all leads us to
understand the truth about God. The argument for God can be expressed
very simply:

1.  We exist (we are not an illusion).
2.  You can't get something from nothing.
3.  Therefore, a necessary and eternal entity exists which created us.

Even atheists do not deny this logic. They simply claim that the
universe is that eternal entity. However, to date, all scientific and
philosophical inquiry has proven and re-proven that the universe had a
beginning, and the body of evidence proving this fact is continually
growing. If something had a beginning, it is not eternal. Therefore,
being that the only two sources of eternality are an eternal universe or
an eternal Creator, and we have proven that the universe is not eternal,
an eternal Creator must exist.

*Therefore, the only logical conclusion is that a creator God exists.*

Now, this conclusion says nothing about what kind of God exists, but it
does rule out all pantheistic religions. All pantheistic worldviews say
that the universe is God and is eternal. And this assertion is false,
because we know that the universe is not eternal. So, Hinduism,
Buddhism, Jainism, and all other pantheistic religions are ruled out as
valid belief systems.

Therefore, we know that it is the Abrahamic God who created the
universe, as belief in an Abrahamic God is the only belief system which
fits the evidence in our universe.
