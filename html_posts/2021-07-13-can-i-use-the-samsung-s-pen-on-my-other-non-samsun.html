Just as we already answered regarding using the S pen on any tablet...

[[Bill Stein\'s answer to Is the Samsung S Pen compatible with any
tablet?](/Is-the-Samsung-S-Pen-compatible-with-any-tablet/answer/Bill-Stein)]{.qlink_container}

The Samsung S Pen is an *inductive* stylus. It communicates with the
Samsung Note phone when the device is brought close to the screen. The
Note series (and the S21 series of phones) contain an extra Wacom layer
which supports the inductive stylus. The electromagnetic Wacom layer in
the screen *induces* a current in the S Pen, and they begin to
communicate. This is why the stylus works without it touching the
screen. It knows where the tip of the stylus is, even when you hover it
over the screen and don't touch it.

Other non-Samsung Android phones use *capacitive touch* screens only
(Note phones also use capacitive touch, but the stylus uses inductive
communications). In a capacitive touch setup, the screen is given an
electrostatic charge. Your finger (or the stylus) changes the
electrostatic field in the screen when you touch it, and the device
registers that change as a touch, or a swipe.

**TL:DR:** No. The S Pen only works on S Pen-enabled devices. You need a
capacitive stylus to work on capacitive touch screens.
