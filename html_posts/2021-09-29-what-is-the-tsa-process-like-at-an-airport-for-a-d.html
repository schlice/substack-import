As long as you have one of the other approved forms of identification,
you can still get through TSA and the process basically remains
unchanged.

Acceptable forms of ID (besides your license):

- U.S. passport
- U.S. passport card
- DHS trusted traveler cards (Global Entry, NEXUS, SENTRI, FAST)
- U.S. Department of Defense ID, including IDs issued to dependents
- Permanent resident card
- Border crossing card
- State-issued Enhanced Driver's License
- An acceptable photo ID issued by a [[federally

- HSPD-12 PIV card

  Canada card
- Transportation worker identification credential

  Card (I-766)
- U.S. Merchant Mariner Credential
- Veteran Health Identification Card (VHIC)[\[1\]](#bdhaT){#cite-bdhaT

If you don't have one of these, you won't even make it into the
screening area.
