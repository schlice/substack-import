Let's talk first about why you shouldn't worship God.

- You shouldn't worship God because you think it will buy you entrance
  into heaven.
- You shouldn't worship God because you think He demands it.
- You shouldn't worship God because you think He needs worship.
- You shouldn't worship God because you feel like you're being forced to
  do so.

If you believe any of those things, you have deeper issues than just
"should I worship God."

**We worship God because He is worthy of worship.**

That's it. Nothing more, nothing less. We worship God because we love
Him and we actively choose to give Him the worship He deserves.

So if you read that last sentence and asked yourself, "what has God done
that gives Him the right to be worshipped," then *that's where the
problem lies*. You don't know what God has done for you. So the problem
isn't one of understanding why you should worship God. That's just a
symptom of your underlying problem, which is understanding what God has
done for you which is deserving of worship.
