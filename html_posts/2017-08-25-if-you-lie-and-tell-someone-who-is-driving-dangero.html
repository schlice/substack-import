You're treading on thin ice.

There is no law against lying. You can tell someone you're a cop if
you're not.

Where you start to run afoul of the law is if you attempt to perform
police duties while not actually being a police officer. This is called
"impersonating a peace officer" or "impersonating a law enforcement
officer" (depending on jurisdiction, your law may have a different name,
but every jurisdiction has one) and it is most generally a felony.

So if you lie to someone and tell them you're a cop (not a crime), but
then you tell them to do something under your "authority" as a peace
officer, you have just performed a duty reserved to police officers, and
you have crossed from lying into impersonating a police officer.

If you see something dangerous happening, be a good witness while you
call the police. Don't lie, and don't try to be a cop when you're not.
If you find that you really want to be able to exercise police powers,
join the police department.

(EDIT) The OP edited his question, I guess because he wasn\'t getting
his point across. New question:

Ah, I get it now. Except now it\'s *worse.*

So you stopped someone driving on the road (not a crime) and you lied to
them (not a crime) and you told them not to leave (oops! Crime!)

What you have done is committed two crimes. First, you assumed the
duties of a police officer, so you can be charged with impersonating a
police officer. Then, without authority, you detained a person\'s free
movement. This is called unlawful detention, or false arrest. Since you
have no authority to detain someone, doing so is a crime. Loss
prevention sometimes runs afoul of this one, depending on circumstances.

Next, you asked about video proof. I assume you recorded the erratic
behavior and want to show it as proof that waiting for police to arrive
would have been more dangerous than stopping the driver and lying to him
and detaining him without authority. *Can* you do that? Of course you
can. You can mount whatever defense you want to the charges. *Will you
be successful?* Perhaps, perhaps not. You would have to convince a judge
that the driving was so dangerous (we\'re talking reckless endangerment
dangerous) that there was no time to call police, you had to act to save
lives which were in imminent danger. To be honest, I don\'t know if this
has ever happened, or ever worked. But hey, you do you. There are no
guarantees in life, and certainly none here. You have the choice to take
the riskier road (to you). I wouldn\'t, but you certainly can. And in
case you're thinking of doing this, remember that this is an
*affirmative defense*, which means you are admitting that you committed
the crime in question, presenting your mitigating evidence, and hope
that the judge (or jury) believes that a reasonable man in your
situation would have done the same thing.
