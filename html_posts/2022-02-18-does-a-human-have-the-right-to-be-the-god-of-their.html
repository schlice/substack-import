The answer is yes.

God gives you free will. He allows you to accept or reject him freely.
He does not demand that you believe in him.

He has given us ample evidence in this world of his existence, but he
has avoided giving us his *direct presence*, which would be so powerful
and overwhelming that we would be unable to doubt his existence, and
thus would be unable to reject him. God has provided enough evidence to
convince anyone who chooses to believe, but has left enough doubt so as
to not compel the unwilling.

So if you *choose*, you have the right to be the god of your own life.
You have the ability to determine whether or not this is the correct
choice, however.
