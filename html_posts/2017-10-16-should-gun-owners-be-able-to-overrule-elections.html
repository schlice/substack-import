No, gun owners should not be able to overrule elections, and if that's
what you got after you read that article, you should think about some
critical reasoning classes at your local community college. There are
plenty, generally offered by the philosophy department. Check them out.

The ultimate purpose of the Second Amendment is to ensure that no
government ever disarms the populace. The first step towards
dictatorship is for a government to disarm the people. A disarmed
populace can be controlled by force. The framers were worried that a
disarmed populace in combination with a standing army which could be
used against them would be two of the three legs of the chair upon which
sat the next dictator of the United States.

The framers allowed the standing army they were so worried about, but
ensured that as a compromise, that the people could never be disarmed.
In this way, government could never overrule an election by force.

Consequently, we have had peaceful transitions of government for over
200 years.
