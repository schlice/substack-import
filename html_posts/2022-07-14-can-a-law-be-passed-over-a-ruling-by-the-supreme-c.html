A law cannot be passed in *controversion* to a ruling by the Supreme
Court. So if the court says that a particular law is unconstitutional,
Congress cannot write another law which does the same thing in the same
way. It would immediately be stayed until the courts can determine if it
violates the Constitution in the same way they already ruled that it
does.

But if the Court says that a particular law is unconstitutional, but
there is another way to accomplish the same thing without violating the
Constitution, then Congress can absolutely re-write the law so that it
doesn't violate the Constitution.
