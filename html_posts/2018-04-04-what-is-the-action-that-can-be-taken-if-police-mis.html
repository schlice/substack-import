**What is the action that can be taken, if police misuse their powers to
get things for their use from street vendors, without paying any
money?**

There are only two ways in the United States that police officers in
uniform can get something without paying:

1.  They steal it
2.  The vendor gives it to them for free.

For #1, the vendor should call *other* police officers and report the
theft. The vendor should be careful not to identify the thief as a
police officer until *after* they arrive and begin their investigation.

For #2, if the vendor chooses to give the item to the police officer at
no charge, this is not a violation of law. The vendor is free to do as
he pleases with his business. However, it may be a violation of
department policy. For example, our department strictly forbids
uniformed officers from accepting anything for free. Even if it's as
simple and cheap (for the vendor) as a cup of coffee, the officer must
pay for it. That said, the vendor is free to charge any amount he
chooses to that officer. So if he wanted to give me a \$1 cup of coffee
for \$0.01, that's his choice, and as long as I pay the penny out of my
own pocket (and paying out of the "Have a penny, take a penny" plate
doesn't count), I have met the department's requirement of paying for
anything and everything I get.

If the vendor in this case believes that an officer coerced or
threatened him into giving away an item for free, the vendor should file
a complaint with the officer's department.

(EDIT) [[Mark

brought up another scenario (and this is actually the one I had to
discuss during oral boards), so we'll call it #3:

3\. Someone else pays for the item anonymously.

In this case, in my department, we would still pay the vendor and tell
him to pay for someone else's item with the money, or pay it forward,
etc. But even having someone else voluntarily and without our knowledge
pay for our item does not alleviate us of the responsibility for paying
for everything we get while in uniform.
