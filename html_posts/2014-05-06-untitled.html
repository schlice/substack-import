**Content:** [This is correct; while state of registry is first in line,
it\'s not always paramount in every case. In some cases, it is the
nationality of the citizen in question which takes precedence. In some
cases, national publicity by one nation or the other will determine
which country has the greater interest in pursuing primary state
prosecutorial ownership of the case. In every case in which nationality
differences between the actors and the aircraft are different, the
departments with valid standing will determine who is to take primary
jurisdiction for any incident in question, because these are common law
practices, especially in cases of international travel. They are always
subject to interpretation and they are always subject to
change.]{.rendered_qtext}
