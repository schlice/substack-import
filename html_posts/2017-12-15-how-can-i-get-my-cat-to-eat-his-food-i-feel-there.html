Cats are either very private eaters, or they will only eat with you
around.

*Wait, what?*

Cats, on the whole, will eat on their own schedule. They don't eat like
dogs normally do (drop the bowl of food and before you have the chance
to look away, it's gone and she's licking the bowl). Cats are usually
very self-regulating when it comes to food. Put their food down, and it
may take them a day to eat it, especially if it's dry food. Cats will
routinely *graze* on their dry food throughout the day (and night ---
don't ever leave your cat with no food at night or they tend to wake you
up in the absolute middle of the night to refill it). I have heard of
some cats who eat their food like dogs do (they'd eat the whole bag of
food in one shot if you let them), but on the whole, most cats will
self-regulate when it comes to dry food.

That said, I've never seen a cat try to self-regulate with **wet food**.
That moist stuff usually disappears pretty quickly. Although they tend
to eat somewhat slower than dogs, cats generally eat all of their wet
food right away.

Also, some cats will only eat when they are completely by themselves, or
they will only eat with you around. It was a feral cat thing to do to
have one cat eating and the others standing guard. So if the cat
considers you his (or hers), he may only eat when you're there to watch
out for him. This is usually only an issue if there are multiple animals
in the household. Usually, solo cats (when they are the only pet) don't
exhibit this trait in the home.

(By the way, if you've ever noticed that your cat only uses the litter
box while you're cleaning it, the reasoning is exactly the same. Be
proud, your cat trusts you enough to protect him while he poops!)

So if you're worried about your cat not eating, try feeding wet food
instead of dry. You can usually find a variety of wet food that is
exactly the same food you are currently feeding, so there should be
little digestive upset in introducing the wet variety of the same food.
Note I said "little," in some cats there can be some sensitivity even
when switching between the same dry and wet foods.

On the dry food, as long as the cat eats the dry food on his or her
schedule and isn't losing weight, you shouldn't need to worry.

However, if your cat stops eating altogether (even if you give wet food
or things the cat would eat right away like boiled chicken or fish, or
even cat treats), this may be a cause for concern. Contact your vet if
you believe your cat may have stopped eating. It may be as simple as a
mouth issue making it painful to eat, but it may be something more
severe. If your cat is continually losing weight, contact your vet right
away.

By the way, easy way to weigh your cat at home: pick up your cat and get
on your bathroom scale. Once you get a reading, get off the scale, drop
your cat and get right back on. Subtract the two numbers and you've got
your cat's weight.
