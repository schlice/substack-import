**Could the impeachment allow criminal proceedings against Trump to
begin after he leaves office?**

Impeachment is a political action. Criminal proceedings are a judicial
action.

One does not have any relation to the other, other than the fact that a
president really can't be indicted while in office; he would have to be
impeached *and removed from office* in order to be indicted for a crime.

Regardless of how the President leaves office (either by being impeached
*and removed*, or by leaving office at the end of his term), he can be
indicted and charged. The impeachment has no bearing on that.
