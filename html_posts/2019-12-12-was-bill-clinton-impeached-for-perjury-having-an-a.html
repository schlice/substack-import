**Was Bill Clinton impeached for perjury, having an affair with Monica
Lewinsky, or both?**

Clinton was actually impeached for several crimes, such as suborning
perjury and lying to Congress. He repeatedly lied to investigators who
were investigating, among other things, the Whitewater scandal, the
Travelgate scandal, and the alleged misuse of FBI files. The probe
extended into Monica Lewinsky when she was connected with Vernon Turner,
a subject of the Whitewater investigation. Lewinsky was preparing to
perjure herself and advised Linda Tripp to do the same.

Clinton was deposed on January 17, 1998, and he lied about having sexual
relations with Lewinsky.

Clinton was impeached with two Articles. The first was for lying to the
grand jury about his affair with Lewinsky and his attempts to tamper
with witnesses. The second was for obstructing justice in the Paula
Jones lawsuit by suborning and encouraging perjury, and various other
offenses related to Lewinsky.
