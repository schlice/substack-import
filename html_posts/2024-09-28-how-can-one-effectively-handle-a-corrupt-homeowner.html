Effectively? The most effective method to handle a corrupt HOA is by
hiring an attorney. Lawsuits, and explaining why the HOA has to pay the
legal costs to defend them, are the most effective method to bring a
corrupt HOA to receive their comeuppance.

Effective but less expensive? Run for the Board and make them less
corrupt. Fix it from the inside.
