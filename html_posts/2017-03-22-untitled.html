John, you don\'t need your recordings and photos to be
"court-admissible" in order for them to be useful. Your attorney, for
example, would benefit from seeing exactly what you see, and not just
hearing from a possibly overprotective dad.

I\'m a father as well, so I feel your pain, even if I haven\'t
experienced it first hand. It doesn\'t take great feats of mental
gymnastics to imagine it. It haunts my nightmares, albeit less
frequently than yours, I assume.

Hang in there, the truth always wins in the end.
