**Content:** [Thankfully, our rights in the United States do not require
that we justify why we want to invoke them.\
\
We have rights. We exercise our rights.\
\
Why we exercise our rights is completely irrelevant and none of your
business.\
\
(EDIT) This question was changed since I wrote my original answer, and
now introduces a \"miraculous hypothetical scenario\" where suddenly
practically no one had a gun.\
\
You really should clarify your miraculous hypothetical. Did Dr.
Doofenschmirtz create a \"Gun Vaporinator\" that instantly vaporized all
guns in the Tri-State Area, and then used in on the whole world? (If
you\'ve never seen the Disney cartoon *Phineas and Ferb*, you won\'t get
the Dr. Doofenschmirtz reference, sorry if I lost you there). Seriously,
if you\'re going to create a totally non-plausible hypothetical, you
need to define the bounds of your hypothetical.\

- Do all guns miraculously disappear from the planet with one button
  push?
- Do all guns miraculously disappear from only the citizens, but the
  police can still have them?
- Do all guns that are used illegally suddenly disappear?
- Do all guns that are purchased illegally suddenly disappear?

And if all guns miraculously disappear from the planet, do we also lose
all knowledge of how to make one?\
\
Or why?\
\
And did they disappear before or after the United States was founded,
because it was founded with guns, and its entire national identity was
built with guns, and the freedom to own guns was built into the national
ethos. If guns disappear before then, how did the United States come to
be? Did we fight the British with pitchforks and shovels?\
\
These are important questions to cover in your purely miraculous
hypothetical. We need to know the bounds of this thought exercise.
