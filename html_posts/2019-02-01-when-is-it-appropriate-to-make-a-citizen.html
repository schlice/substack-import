**When can you, as a caring citizen, make a citizen\'s arrest?**

It sounds like you might be sincere and actually want to help, which is
why you phrased it as making a citizen's arrest as a caring citizen.

Let me give you a piece of advice:

***don't.***

Don't make a citizen's arrest. They are legally perilous, physically
dangerous, and in most cases, unnecessary. They will cause you many
months of ongoing legal issues that you simply don't need to subject
yourself to.

*So what should I do instead?*

***BE A GOOD WITNESS.***

While you're sitting there watching (and recording on your phone),
answer the W questions (who/what/when/where/why) *in as much detail as
you can muster.* What was the person wearing? How did their hair look?
How did their skin look? How did they speak? What words did they say?
Did any of their mannerisms stick out to you? Which way did they leave?
Did they walk or get into a car? Did you get the plate? Were they
holding anything?

Then, while you're waiting for the police to arrive, review the video.
Answer the questions again, but don't change your answers even if you
see something funny on the screen. Be able to relate your answers to
what you see, but if you can't, just remember that and continue, don't
change your answer.

When the police get there, tell them everything, show them your video,
and make yourself available for whatever questions they want to ask you.

This puts you in a much more secure legal position than anything else
ever could. Trust me, you're much better off being a witness than being
somebody trying to effect an arrest.
