**Can I carry medicine on a plane? Is there any documentation required?
Can I carry a bottle that is already open or I need to carry a sealed
bottle of medication?**

Yes you can.

Prescription medication must be legal (i.e. no medical cannabis) and
must be prescribed to you. Please keep it in the original bottle with
the prescription label on it. Some specialty medication (like pre-filled
syringes) comes with a prescription card. In any case, keep it all
together.

Please try to keep over-the-counter medications you wish to carry on
board in its original packaging if at all possible (i.e. in its original
bottle or box). Medications in baggies could be questionable.
