**Should experts in the U.S. government be able to override a
President\'s decision when they disagree?**

I see what you're on about.

If the President does something factually illegal, he must be reported.

But when the President simply does something you don't like, and doesn't
follow the course of action you think should be followed, you don't blow
the whistle.

There's nothing blow-able here. It's all smoke and mirrors, designed for
your enjoyment.

The President gets to set policy for his administration. The people who
work for him...don't.

It's really that simple.
