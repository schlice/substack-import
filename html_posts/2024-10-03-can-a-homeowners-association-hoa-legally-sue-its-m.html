As with all legal answers, the answer is "it depends." And what it
depends on is the remedies laid out in the HOA's Governing Documents. An
HOA is, in most cases, a 501(c)(4) nonprofit corporation. As such, it
has the ability to file lawsuits against individual members.

In most cases, however, **lawsuit is not the normal course of action for
an HOA to recoup unpaid fees.**

Normally, in the vast majority of HOAs around the United States, the
unpaid fees will accumulate on the homeowner's account until they have
gone unpaid after multiple attempts to get the homeowner to explain why
they are unpaid, and then to work out a payment plan, or to just pay
them. When the requisite time has passed (either controlled by the
Governing Documents or by state law), the HOA will turn the account over
to the attorney. The attorney will attempt to get the account paid, and
will also add his or her own fees to the running total of fees plus late
fees.

Again, after the attorney has tried for several months to engage with
the homeowner and get payment or work out a payment plan, the attorney
will place a *lien* on the property. A lien is a legal claim on the
property that gives the HOA the right to adjudicate that property if the
owner doesn\'t repay a debt. Liens are a common way for creditors to
collect what they\'re owed. A lien prevents the property from being sold
until the debt is paid off. If the debt isn\'t paid, the lien will be
*foreclosed* and the house will be sold out from under the homeowner.
The proceeds from the house sale will be used to pay off the debt.

**TL;DR: if you can find an attorney who will sue someone with no
evidence, then sure, even HOAs can sue people without evidence, but in
most cases, that's not how HOAs collect unpaid fees.**
