**If God knows everything and has a plan for each of us, why do we need
to pray? Doesn\'t he know what we want?**

Yes, God knows everything. Yes, he has a plan for us. No, we don't pray
to inform God about what we need. He already knows. He know everything
about us. He knows what we need, before we even ask.

So why pray? If we don't need to ask him for things because he already
knows, then why do we pray?

***Because praying isn't about asking God to give you things.***

God is not some cosmic vending machine that only dispenses blessings
when you drop your quarter in. He wants to hear from you! He wants you
to talk to him, he wants you to confide in him, he wants you to give him
all the little updates, even though he already knows them all.

He also wants you to understand that he is in charge, and you are not.
He has a plan for you, and he will implement his plan, in his time, for
his glory. Pray, then, that you can gain understanding about his plan,
and comfort that he keeps his promises.

So instead of praying for things, pray that you'll gain wisdom and
understanding that he will keep his promises, and that you can be
comforted in that understanding. "Not my will, but yours be done." He
does want you to bring him your concerns, but he will still implement
his plan in his time.

God, **I pray to change me**."
