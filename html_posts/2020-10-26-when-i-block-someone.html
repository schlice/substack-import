**When you block someone\'s number, do you have to keep it in your
phone?**

The answer is "it depends."

Some carriers include a block list in their carrier system which
integrates with your phone, so that when you block a number in your
phone, they add it to your carrier's block list. Different software (iOS
vs Android) handles this in different ways, so it's not useful to go
through that here.

The best advice I can give you if you want to pursue this for your phone
and your carrier is to contact your carrier's technical support
department and ask them how it works. It's so different per device and
carrier combination that you will be best served by working with your
carrier.

Phone handsets do have block lists built in, so if you use that feature,
the number will stay "in your phone" but in a protected area for blocked
numbers. It's not a full-fledged contact entry, it's just a special list
off to the side of numbers that you have chosen to block.

Regardless of how it is blocked, If you get a call or a text from a
number in your blocked list, it won't ring and the text message will not
appear in your texts.
