I don't see a problem with *raising* the minimum age to **buy** a long
gun to 21, and doing this nationwide, at the Federal level.

Note that I didn't say **possess** a long gun, I just said **buy** one.
If a parent gifts a long gun to you at 18, that's a different story. The
responsibility for that young adult getting that rifle is now shared
between the parent and the adult child, very much the same way we
provide provisional driver's licenses to young adults because they have
a very high incidence of auto accidents and so we restrict their driving
in the most dangerous, most distracting ways.
