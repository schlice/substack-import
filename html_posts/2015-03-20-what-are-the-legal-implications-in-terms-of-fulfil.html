A \"lifetime subscription\" is valid for the life of the service. It
doesn\'t guarantee that you will receive the service throughout your
life, it only guarantees that you will receive the service for as long
as the service is actually operating. Lifetime subscriptions
automatically terminate when the service is terminated.

If you perhaps were paying for the service based on an estimated length
of your life and the service terminated before you did, you might be
able to recoup some of the cost of the lifetime subscription. But if you
\"paid one price\" for access to the service, and everyone who joined
paid the same price, then the cost is not dependent on the length of
your life. Therefore, it is also not dependent on the length of the
service.
