In case you haven't heard, Pete Hegseth, our new SecDef, tweeted the
following on Tuesday:

So why did no one want to serve under Biden? Instead of raising up a
warrior class, the previous commander in chief seemed preoccupied with

It's no surprise that military recruiting numbers are way up under
Trump. Now that DEI is no longer a part of the military, and commanders
are not pressuring their people to do things like take vaccinations that
they don't want or aren't proven to do anything, people are far more
willing to step up and do the one thing they want to do in the military:
**serve their country**.

It's interesting that this all comes out following the conclusion of the
latest [[Military Family Lifestyle
Survey](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=e60be4&url=https://bluestarfam.org/research/mfls-survey-release-2025/){.external_link

qt-tooltip="bluestarfam.org"}]{.qlink_container}, which as you can
imagine, was pretty unflattering for the military. While 69% of
respondents agreed that military service "added value to their family's
life," a dismal 32% said they would recommend military service to a
young family member. And while most people you might ask on the street
may believe that the military at large is appreciated in this country,
only 19% of active duty families believe Americans are *truly* grateful
for their sacrifice. What's even worse from that survey: 83% of active
duty families believe that we will be in a global war within the next 3
to 5 years.

Freshman Rep. Pete Harrigan (R-NC), a former Green Beret, agrees. It was
the poor leadership under Biden which prompted him to run in the first
place. In [[a recent
interview](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=bcfe77&url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3Dd16dKZIGtvM%26feature%3Dyoutu.be){.external_link

onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="youtube.com"}]{.qlink_container}, he said, "We had never
been weaker than \[during the Biden-led withdrawal from Afghanistan\] in
our nation's history. And so, we need real change in this country.
\[...\] We need real leadership. Thankfully, we have it. And as you were
talking about with the record-breaking January recruitment cycle that
the Army had, I think that there is a resounding consensus that that
leadership is back. And this is a military that our young men and women
want to join again."

Tony Perkins, who served in the Marine Corps, agreed. "I know there
\[are\] a lot of young men and women who are willing to serve this
country, but they don't want to serve for no reason. They want to serve,
and they're willing to make sacrifices if it's for a purpose. And I
think, as you pointed out, what happened in Afghanistan was disastrous.
And it just, I think, it turned many, many young men and women away,
thinking, 'What's the point?'"

Indeed. Harrigan replied, "I think there \[was\] a genuine question
prior to President Trump getting elected: 'What are we fighting for? Are
we fighting for those time-tested concepts of freedom, democracy, free
market economies, and the things that our fathers and forefathers have
fought and died for in order to make this country the greatest country
on the face of the earth? Or are we fighting for some sort of social
agenda that we are actually trying to project across the globe?' \[...\]
I think that was a question in many folks' minds prior to November 5th.
And so it's just great to see that America is back --- that strong,
principled America that traditionally leads the world is back. And it's
here to stay moving forward."
