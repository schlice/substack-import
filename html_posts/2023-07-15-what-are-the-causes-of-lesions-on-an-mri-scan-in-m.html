The lesions (or scars), called *scleroses,* on an MRI scan occur because
of the disease action. By the way, that's where the name "multiple
sclerosis" comes from ("many scars").

In MS, the immune system mistakes the myelin sheath surrounding nerve
fibers as a foreign invader, and sends lymphocytes to attack the myelin
in a process called *demyelination*. In its place are left *plaques* or
*scars* made primarily of cholesterol. These areas of demyelination
prevent nerve signals from traversing at their original speed, causing
the corresponding response at the muscle to be less than the brain
intended. This is what produces the variety of physical symptoms of the
disease.

This is also an *inflammatory* process, which contributes to the poor
nerve response across the areas of demyelination.

In most cases, the scars never disappear, and what results is *gliosis*
where the nerve cells die and are replaced with glial cells. The white
spots on MRI (indicating lesions) are replaced with completely black
spots (indicating gliosis).

In some cases, if the body is given enough breathing room through the
use of certain medications, the brain can heal itself and some of these
lesions can shrink. I experienced this myself while I was on Tysabri.
The disease process was so well controlled that my body had at least a
little bit of a chance to heal itself, and some of my lesions shrank.
And myelin isn't easily rebuilt; the body doesn't naturally remyelinate
nerve cells. Studies are underway to attempt to force the body to
remyelinate damaged nerve cells, but it does not do so naturally.

Unfortunately though, in the vast majority of cases, the damage caused
by MS is permanent. This is why the recommendation of most neurologists
is to take the "conservative" approach: conserve as much brain matter as
possible. Get ahead of the disease process. Treat it before it becomes
critical, because (to shamelessly steal the pull quote from stroke
awareness) time lost is brain lost.

Keep s'myelin!
