It's not evil at all. Confucianism isn't a religion, so it shouldn't be
drowned out by religious talk. Confucianism is a system of social and
ethical philosophy, not a religion.

Some of the values of Confucianism include:

- **Filial piety**: The idea that humans are indebted to their parents
  and should honor them.
- **Jen**: The idea of being internally good, empathetic, and
  compassionate toward all people.
- **Hsiao**: The idea of emphasizing family and the mutual love between
  members.
- **Yi**: The idea of virtuous character, where one would sacrifice
  themselves for their principles.
- **Xin**: The idea of being honest with oneself and others.

I think that there isn't anyone who could argue with the virtues of
these values. Any society which fully adopts these virtues would be
doing quite well for itself.

But are people *forced* to adopt these virtues? By whose authority? And
if they are *compelled* to do so, is there truly free will?

And of course, that's the ultimate issue. In order for Confucianism, or
any belief system to truly work to reform society, the entire society
needs to fully adopt it and internalize it. But free will says
otherwise. Free will says that I have the freedom to either adopt
Confucianism or to reject it for my own value system, or no value system
at all.

The only way for any belief system, religion, or value system to be
truly moral is to allow people free will to choose to either participate
or not.
