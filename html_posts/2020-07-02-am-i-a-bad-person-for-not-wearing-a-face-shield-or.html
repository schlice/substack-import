**Am I a bad person for not wearing a face shield or gas mask, but just
a regular mask that covers my mouth and nose?**

No, you are following CDC guidelines which state that even a cloth face
mask will help stop the spread of Coronavirus.

Just remember the three W's:

- **Wash** your hands.
- **Wear** a mask. Even a cloth face covering helps protect others.
- **Watch** your spacing. Stay 6 feet apart.
