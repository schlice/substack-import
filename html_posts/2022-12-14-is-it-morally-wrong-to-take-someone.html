The answer is "it depends."

Morality is subjective; each person develops their own moral code
throughout their life. Something which may be legal or ethical in
society may still be immoral to you.

In my opinion, it is immoral to take someone's land without their
consent, but it happens every day in the United States. The government
does it, and it's perfectly legal. It is taken under a concept known as
**eminent domain**.

Now, when the government does it, they are required to provide *just
compensation* for that taking. It's actually covered by the **Takings
Clause** of the 5th Amendment to the Constitution.

So this amounts to "taking someone's land without their consent" but it
is not theft, because it is legal and you are fully compensated for what
was taken.

But the question remains: *is it moral?* Is it morally wrong to take
someone's land without their consent? In this situation, the morality is
much less clear.
