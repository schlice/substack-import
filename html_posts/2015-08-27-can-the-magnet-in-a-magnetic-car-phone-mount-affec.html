It shouldn\'t, because even though the phone has a \"compass app\", it
usually just uses GPS and cell tower triangulation to tell you what
direction you are going.

Magnets have no effect on reporting battery charge (which simply uses
the output voltage of the battery to determine remaining charge) or on
navigation software, which once again relies on the phone\'s GPS
reception and a working cellular data connection to relay the
information back to the nav site for calculation, or back to the app if
it\'s an app with pre-loaded maps. There is a magnetometer in your
phone, but it works in conjunction with the GPS and cellular signals, so
interference on any one of them won't hurt the compass app.

There aren\'t any magnetic storage media inside a phone, so magnets
should not have an effect on it.

The only impact I can think of: some phones have a magnetic proximity
sensor that allows the use of \"smart covers\" which turn the display
off when they are closed, and turn it back on when the cover is open.
