**How much does an AR-15 cost, and much does its bump stock cost? How
much does an M-16 cost, and wouldn\'t it be a good idea to raise the
price of the cheaper ones to make it harder to get a full auto weapon,
and possibly lower mass shootings?**

I'm not going to address the costs, since they do change and you need
only to search for them in The Googles in order to find out how much one
costs today.

Additionally, bump stocks are in the process of being made illegal, so
even if you do buy one now, it's likely going to be made unlawful to own
in the future. Bump stocks are toys. Don't bother with them.

**\[W\]ouldn\'t it be a good idea to raise the price of the cheaper ones
to make it harder to get a full auto weapon, and possibly lower mass
shootings?**

Getting a semi-auto weapon and fitting a bump stock to it is not the
only way to make a semi-automatic firearm fire like a full automatic.

It's actually very simple to convert a semi-automatic into a full
automatic. It's highly illegal, but simple. And you don't need a bump
stock to do it.

But let's get to the root of your question.

If the problem of mass shootings in America was ***caused by*** fully
automatic weapons, I'd be all for it. Ban them all. Simple solution.

But the problem of mass shootings in America is far more complex than
"it's the full auto, stupid." So raising the cost of something simply to
prevent mass shootings just means that only rich crazy people will be
the ones doing mass shootings. It doesn't address the problem.

Oh, and news flash: rifles can be bump fired without a bump stock. Uh,
oh...
