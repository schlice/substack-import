There is only one reason to believe that you're not going to hell: **you
have been saved.**

Repentance and belief in Christ is what saves you. It's really that
simple.

It's not about being *exempt* from God's wrath. It's that God visits His
wrath on **everyone**. We're all sinners, and we must all pay for our
sin. That's not wrath, that's justice.

Except in our case, God made a way for us to have our sin paid for.
That's mercy.

In our case, Jesus paid the penalty for our sins. That's grace.

Why do we **know** we are not going to Hell? Jesus promised us that
repentance and faith pay the penalty for our sins which we deserve.
