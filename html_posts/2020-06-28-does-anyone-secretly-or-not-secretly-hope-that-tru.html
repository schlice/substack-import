**Does anyone secretly (or not secretly) hope that Trump\'s supporters
contracts the covid-19 virus due to following Trump\'s advice?**

"Objection, Your Honor. Question assumes facts not in evidence."

In other words, you have assumed that Trump's advice will actually place
people at risk of contracting COVID-19.

I know of no such advice.

So you tell me. Which advice did Trump give that puts people (any
people, whether or not they support the President) at risk of
contracting COVID-19? Links to sources would be greatly appreciated.
