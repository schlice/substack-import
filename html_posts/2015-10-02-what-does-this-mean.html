**Content:** [An \"indemnity bond\" is \"a bond that is intended to
reimburse the holder for any actual or claimed loss caused by the
issuer's conduct or another person's conduct. An indemnity bond acts as
coverage for the loss of an obligee when a principal fails to perform
according to the terms agreed upon between the obligee and the
principal. For example, in real estate, a lender may require an
indemnity bond in markets with slow growth in cases where the loan
amount is greater than 75% of the house value. During the time of
foreclosure, if the house is sold to pay off the loan and there is
negative equity, then the indemnity bond covers the difference.\" \[1\]\
\
In essence, an indemnity bond is a type of insurance policy that
guarantees payment of a debt if one party in a contract fails to
perform.\
\
\"There are usually three parties to an indemnity bond: the principal
(the person who will receive the money in the case of a breach \[of
contract\]), the obligor (the person who purchases the indemnity bond as
security for performance) and a third-party guarantor, usually a bank
that, for a premium or fee, assumes the risk to pay the face value of
the indemnity bond should the obligor fail to perform the terms of the
contract with the principal.\" \[2\]\
\
For help understanding your specific indemnity bond, please consult with
a licensed attorney in your area.\
