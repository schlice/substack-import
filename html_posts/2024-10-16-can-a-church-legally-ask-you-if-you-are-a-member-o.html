The First Amendment prohibits the government from creating laws
governing the free exercise of religion.

Therefore, there are no laws surrounding how a church may operate, or
how it may run its membership.

Additionally, some churches require *transfer of membership*, which is a
valid reason to know if you have a membership at another church. When I
was a member of the United Methodist Church (a long time before its
schism), you could become a member by *transfer of membership*. In that
case, they'd need to know where you were previously a member so they
could transfer your membership. It allowed you to skip a lot of the
formalities of becoming a member in a new church.
