**Content:** [Let\'s start with one thing first: there is a difference
between **justice** and **vengeance**.\
\
Justice means that the solution implemented was *just*, which means that
the solution appropriately follows the rule of law. If the evidence
against an officer is brought before a Grand Jury and they don\'t find
enough evidence to file an indictment, then *justice* has been served,
because the answer was *just*. The justice system worked. The guilty
were prosecuted, and the not guilty were released.\
\
However, when you see such a ruling, you frequently see people say that
if no one is prosecuted for the incident that there was no justice.\
\
What they really mean is that there was no *retribution*, there was no
\"eye for an eye,\" there was no \"pound of flesh,\" there was no
**vengeance.** These people are looking for someone to go to jail
because they believe in their hearts that there must be a crime here. I
mean, an unarmed man was shot and killed, and there is no crime? The
injustice of it all! That killer is walking free! There is no justice!\
\
In fact, these people need to recognize that they are looking for
**vengeance,** not **justice**. If they were looking for justice, they
would be looking at the Grand Jury process to justify its ruling.\
\
Finally, people must understand that \"unarmed\" does not equate to
\"not dangerous.\" An unarmed man can be very dangerous. Police shoot to
stop an act, they don\'t shoot to kill. Often, gunshots result in death.
However, death is not the goal, stopping an act which can cause bodily
harm to an officer or to the public is priority. In some cases, the
officer does not have a non-lethal form of defense to use. Darren Wilson
could not access his TASER, and he was too close to effectively use it.
The fear for his life caused him to reach for his
sidearm.]{.rendered_qtext}
