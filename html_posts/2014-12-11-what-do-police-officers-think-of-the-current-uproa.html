<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Let\'s start with one thing first: there is a difference<br>between justice and vengeance.\<br>\<br>Justice means that the solution implemented was *just*, which means that<br>the solution appropriately follows the rule of law. If the evidence<br>against an officer is brought before a Grand Jury and they don\'t find<br>enough evidence to file an indictment, then *justice* has been served,<br>because the answer was *just*. The justice system worked. The guilty<br>were prosecuted, and the not guilty were released.\<br>\<br>However, when you see such a ruling, you frequently see people say that<br>if no one is prosecuted for the incident that there was no justice.\<br>\<br>What they really mean is that there was no *retribution*, there was no<br>\"eye for an eye,\" there was no \"pound of flesh,\" there was no<br>vengeance. These people are looking for someone to go to jail<br>because they believe in their hearts that there must be a crime here. I<br>mean, an unarmed man was shot and killed, and there is no crime? The<br>injustice of it all! That killer is walking free! There is no justice!\<br>\<br>In fact, these people need to recognize that they are looking for<br>vengeance, not justice. If they were looking for justice, they<br>would be looking at the Grand Jury process to justify its ruling.\<br>\<br>Finally, people must understand that \"unarmed\" does not equate to<br>\"not dangerous.\" An unarmed man can be very dangerous. Police shoot to<br>stop an act, they don\'t shoot to kill. Often, gunshots result in death.<br>However, death is not the goal, stopping an act which can cause bodily<br>harm to an officer or to the public is priority. In some cases, the<br>officer does not have a non-lethal form of defense to use. Darren Wilson<br>could not access his TASER, and he was too close to effectively use it.<br>The fear for his life caused him to reach for his<br>sidearm.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
