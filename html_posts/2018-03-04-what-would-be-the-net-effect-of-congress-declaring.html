**What would be the net effect of congress declaring all adult citizens
to be members of the militia and mandating their firearms and physical
fitness training?**

Congress already did part of this, in the Militia Act of 1903.

The only thing they have not done is tried to "organize" the
"unorganized" militia in a way you are suggesting, such as adding
physical fitness and training requirements. That actually makes them
part of the "organized" militia, also known as the National Guard.

If you're suggesting that we change the law and remove the unorganized
militia and make all citizens part of the organized militia, I'd see
that there would be as much backlash to that as you'd get if you
reinstated the draft.
