Yes.

1.  The [[Unitarian Universalist
    Church](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=707ed0&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unitarian_Universalism){.external_link
    rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
    onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
    qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container} specifically allows
    abortion. In 1978, the Unitarian Universalist Association passed a
    resolution that declared, \"\...\[the\] right to choice on
    contraception and abortion are important aspects of the right of
    privacy, respect for human life, and freedom of conscience of women
    and their families\".[\[1\]](#EJkaR){#cite-EJkaR .citation_link}
2.  While there is no single stance on abortion in the
    [[Buddhist](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=ef4518&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism_and_abortion){.external_link
    rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
    onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
    qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container} faith, it is
    generally looked upon negatively.
3.  The
    [[Sikh](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=28a63d&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikh){.external_link
    rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
    onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
    qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container} faith is similar: no
    specific stance, but generally regarded negatively.

Nearly all other non-Christian faiths condemn abortion where the life of
the mother is not at risk.

I should also note that there are some Christian denominations which are
more accepting of abortion. Some denominations like Methodists,
Episcopals, Presbyterians, the United Church of Christ, and the
Evangelical Lutheran Church of America (among others) are "more
permissive" of abortion. Additionally, there are not-insignificant
minorities of some Christian denominations which disagree with their
denomination's position on abortion. In short, not all Christian
denominations are anti-abortion, and not all people who call themselves
Christian believe abortion is murder.
