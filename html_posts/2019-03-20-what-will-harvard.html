**What will Harvard\'s defense be in a Connecticut woman\'s lawsuit
against them for \"allegedly \'shamelessly\' turning a profit from
photos of slaves and ignoring requests to turn the photos over to the
slaves' descendants\"?**

The article states that the photos were taken in 1850. Any work
published in the US before 1923 is in the public
domain.[\[1\]](#rNrvD){#cite-rNrvD .citation_link} The plaintiff has no
copyright claim to the photos, and neither does Harvard.

Harvard may use the public domain works in any other collection (and
charge money for that collection) without paying royalties to anyone
else. They can therefore charge for a book which contains the photos.
However, the suit also alleges that Harvard charged a "licensing fee" to
reprint the photos. If Harvard charged to license this photo, and if
that fee is more than the cost of the reprint, she may have a case that
Harvard is improperly charging fees for works in the public domain.

However, she herself has no claim on the title of those photos, nor does
she have a claim for remuneration for any royalties from that photo. No
one does. That's what "public domain" means.
