**How would you know when a civil defense siren is signifying an actual
emergency on the first Saturday of the month?**

Length.

Siren tests are a single blast. They fire up once, and they shut off.

Continuous blasts, even on the first Saturday of the month (which is
apparently when they test the sirens in your area), would be an
indication that this might not be a test.
