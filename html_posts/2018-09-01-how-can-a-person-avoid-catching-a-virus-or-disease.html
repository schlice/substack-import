**How can a person avoid catching a virus or disease from using a public
restroom?**

Excellent question! Public restrooms are known for being germ factories,
but it's a reputation they don't deserve. They're not quite as dirty as
you might think. Well, some are, and you can visually see which ones are
dirty, because they're, well, dirty.

You'll especially note that Mythbusters tested several public restroom
myths, and some were actually found to be true. For example, hot air
dryers are less sanitary than paper towels. Not only do they remove less
bacteria from your hands, they leave more bacteria around the restroom.
Hot air dryers make you, and the restroom, less clean. Toilet seats, on
average, have fewer bad bacteria colonies on them than you might expect,
so it's unlikely that you would catch serious nasties from them.

So how do you stay clean in a public restroom? Here's a few tips that
might help:

- Pick a restroom (if you have a choice) that has paper towels in it
  rather than just hot air dryers. Often, venues will eschew the paper
  to cut down on the trash, but paper is demonstrably cleaner (for you
  and the bathroom) than dryers.
- Pick a stall that is relatively clean to do your business.
- Try not to touch too many surfaces. Use some toilet paper to actuate
  the flush handle. If you must touch surfaces when you're done washing
  your hands, use any body surface except the palm side of your hand.
  Use the back of your hand, your elbow, your forearm, etc. You can turn
  on the water with your hand, but don't turn it off with your hand.
- **Handwashing is the key to cutting down the spread of germs.** Wash
  your hands with warm water and soap. DON'T RE-CONTAMINATE YOUR HANDS
  BY TOUCHING THE FAUCET! Dry your hands with paper towel and THEN USE
  THE PAPER TO SHUT OFF THE FAUCET.
- Use paper towels, even the same one with which you dried your hands,
  to open the door. The dirtiest surfaces in a public restroom are the
  door handle and the faucet/toilet handle.

If there is no paper towel available (i.e. only hot air dryers),
understand that your hands are not going to be clean when you leave the
restroom; you will need to sanitize your hands somewhere else. I have a
hand sanitizer dispenser in my car; when I return to my car, I'll use
it.

Most modern updated restrooms are designed for germ awareness: the
faucets, toilets, and soap dispensers are no-touch; the doors open
outwards so you're not touching the surfaces on your way out, or there
is a paper dispenser right by the door for you to use to open the door,
etc.

Just to reiterate the salient point here: **handwashing is the key to
cutting down the spread of germs**. Wash your hands, and realize that
not everyone else does. With that in mind, you can use public restrooms
and still stay relatively clean and germ-free.
