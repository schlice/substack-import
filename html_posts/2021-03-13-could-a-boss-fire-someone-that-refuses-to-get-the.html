**How can your employer fire you for refusing to get the Covid
vaccine?**

Thanks for the A2A,
[[Judith](https://www.quora.com/profile/Judith-687)]{.qlink_container}.

**Unpopular opinion coming here,** because I see a lot of answers which
are flat-out wrong, and I'll explain why.

First, let me express my opinion. In my opinion, I believe the vaccine
is safe enough for the majority of the population to take and suffer no
ill effects. In my opinion, in this rare time in our history (it's not
unprecedented; just not common), everyone should do what they can to
slow the spread of the virus. As a person who, in the words of my
neurologist, is at "extreme risk" for contracting the virus, I have been
authorized to get it myself, and I plan on doing so.

Now that my opinion about the vaccine is out of the way, let's get down
to the legalese:

**Your employer cannot mandate you take a vaccine which has not been
fully approved by the FDA. Similarly, your employer cannot fire you for
refusing to get any of the current COVID-19 vaccines.**

The current (as of March 2021) crop of COVID-19 vaccines has been
approved under an ***Emergency Use Authorization*** (EUA). Medications
which receive an EUA have not been fully tested; they have not gone
through the FDA's full, required suite of phased pharmaceutical testing.
When the FDA grants an EUA, it does so because there exists a public
health emergency, and it *believes* (not knows) that the benefits of the
drug outweigh the risk of having a vaccine that is not completely
tested. However, when Congress chose to give the power to grant EUAs to
the FDA, they also chose to require that everyone who takes an emergency
vaccine *does so only based upon their own personal choice*. In other
words, **no one can be** ***compelled*** **to take a vaccine covered by
an EUA.** This is not my opinion. This is the Federal law surrounding
EUAs.[\[1\]](#xGYLP){#cite-xGYLP .citation_link}

Therefore, anyone who is terminated because they refused to take a
vaccine covered only by an EUA is ***unlawfully terminated***.

Employers in the US would do well to learn this fact. You can use COVID
vaccination status as a valid screening item when you hire someone,
***but you may not use vaccination status as a reason to terminate
someone's employment, and you may not require your employees to get a
vaccine covered only by an Emergency Use Authorization.***

Let's be clear. Once the FDA grants final approval for any vaccine, an
employer can then require you take it, or they can fire you.

However, while the vaccine is covered by an EUA, an employer would be at
odds with federal law if they require employees to get it.

Employers may feel free to *strongly encourage* employees to get
vaccinated, so long as

1.  their encouragement is not viewed as coercive
2.  the employer makes it crystal clear that the decision regarding
    whether to receive the vaccine is voluntary,
3.  any statements by the employer about the vaccine comply with the
    requirements in the EUAs and the related regulations for these
    products.

**TL;DR: Because the current crop of COVID-19 vaccines is only covered
by an Emergency Use Authorization and has not been fully approved by the
FDA, you take the vaccine at your own risk and by your own choice, and
employers may not force employees to be vaccinated.**
