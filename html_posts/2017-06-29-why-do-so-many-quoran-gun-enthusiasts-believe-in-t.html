Treating a gun as if it is loaded, and knowing that it is unloaded, are
two different things. "I didn't know it was loaded" means someone was
treating it as if it was unloaded when they didn't confirm for
themselves.

But there is a big difference in knowing for yourself that the gun is
unloaded so that you can perform unloaded actions on it (such as
disassembly for cleaning) and treating the gun as if it was unloaded
without *knowing.*
