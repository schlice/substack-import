Interesting question. I didn't know the answer. So I did what I always
do: I asked Google. Here's what Google told me, in an article from 2002.
First, I learned that CSST stands for Corrugated Stainless Steel Tubing,
or flexible tubing designed for natural gas delivery. I also learned
that proposed legislation in November of 2001 would have prohibited
several types of piping for natural gas, including PEX water piping, and
CSST.

Instead, they made a new proposal:

> \[G\]as piping may be wrought iron, steel, yellow brass, or types K, L
> or ACR copper tube. Approved polyethylene pipe may be used in
> underground applications. CSST may be used if it is part of a system
> listed by an approved agency, " \... except that the local
> administrative authority may disapprove use of corrugated stainless
> steel tubing based on health, safety or performance considerations."
>
> HCD noted that both copper tubing and CSST had previously been
> approved in California under the 1998 California Mechanical Code. The
> department said it could not find any corroborated reports or
> scientific evidence that the materials posed health and safety
> concerns.[\[1\]](#qcIZf){#cite-qcIZf .citation_link}

However, a quick review of current California Plumbing Code includes
using CSST:

> **1212.1 Connecting Gas Appliances**
>
> Appliances shall be connected to the building piping in accordance
> with Section 1212.5 through Section 1212.7 by one of the following:
>
> \[...\]
>
> \(5\) CSST where installed in accordance with the manufacturer\'s
> installation instructions.[\[2\]](#FFEFo){#cite-FFEFo .citation_link}

As always, when you are dealing with things like natural gas or electric
in your home, I would always consult a licensed, bonded professional
before undertaking any project where you tie in to utilities.
