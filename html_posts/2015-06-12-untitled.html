<h2>Answer Comment</h2>
<div>

**Content:** [What I was getting at is that there are no protections in
the law to allow for the rest of us to determine whether or not someone
is actually disabled, or whether or not a service dog is actually a
trained service dog.\
\
I am a disabled person, I don\'t need a service dog, and I still think
that we should have some sort of documentation process that proves that
a service dog is a trained service dog. I personally think we should
also have some sort of documentation process that shows that a person
has a disability that is recognized by ADA. I think it would make it
much easier for businesses to offer reasonable accommodations if people
had the ability to prove they had a disability that required a specific
accommodation.]{.rendered_qtext}
