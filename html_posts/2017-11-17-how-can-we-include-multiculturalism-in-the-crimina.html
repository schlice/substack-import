You must be more specific. You can't just make a statement like this and
expect that it will be taken seriously unless you identify a specific
lacking. It's like saying, "How can we include ice cream in the public
transportation system?"

You must first show that the criminal justice system is failing because
of a lack of multiculturalism. Is it a failing of the law, or a failing
of the court system and the judge/jury system?

In my opinion, *the US justice system does not need multiculturalism.*
It addresses the only group of people it is required to address:
American citizens. National heritage is not a factor in the justice
system, nor should it be. It treats all American citizens equal,
regardless of heritage.
