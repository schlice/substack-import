**Content:** [Police are not above the law. If a police officer kills
someone by mistake it can be considered manslaughter. Murder requires
intent, so killing someone accidentally is never murder. Manslaughter
charges can definitely result from unlawful use of force, even for a
police officer. This is why Darren Wilson was investigated by the grand
jury to see if murder charges were warranted when he shot and killed
Michael Brown. If the grand jury had decided that Wilson acted by
mistake, or acted intentionally and incorrectly, charges could have been
brought. As it was, the grand jury (and a subsequent DOJ investigation)
found that Wilson\'s actions were justified.\
\
Search Google, there are plenty of police officers who (even recently)
have been convicted of murder when they have unlawfully killed someone.
