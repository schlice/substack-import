**What will happen if the House comes to a different opinion on the
Mueller reports, evidence?**

Once the (majority of the) report is released, the House is free to do
whatever it feels is necessary, including re-investigating everything
that was already investigated.

It would be unwise for them to do so.

As reported by the Attorney General, the Special Counsel's office
"...employed 19 lawyers who were assisted by a team of approximately 40
FBI agents, intelligence analysts, forensic accountants, and other
professional staff. The Special Counsel issued more than 2,800
subpoenas, executed nearly 500 search warrants, obtained more than 230
orders for communication records, issued almost 50 orders authorizing
use of pen registers, made 13 requests to foreign governments for
evidence, and interviewed approximately 500
witnesses."[\[1\]](#JEnKT){#cite-JEnKT .citation_link} And after all of
that evidence, the Special Counsel found that there was no Russian
collusion.

The Special Counsel did not render a decision on the question of
obstruction of justice, and instead forwarded all of the information
they gathered to the Attorney General. After his careful review, AG
William Barr determined that there was not enough evidence that proved
beyond a reasonable doubt that the President had obstructed justice, and
so has decided not to impanel a grand jury. He made this decision
without consideration as to the Constitutional question of whether or
not you can even indict a sitting president.

If the House proceeds with investigating again what was already
investigated, those (including the President) who called the Special
Counsel's investigation a "witch hunt" and "sour grapes" for his 2016
election victory will certainly conclude nothing better about this, and
they would be justified in doing so.

Nevertheless, the House is certainly free to do this (and Rep. Schiff
has repeatedly asserted that he will be doing so, this information
notwithstanding).

*If they do*, and *if they come to a different conclusion*, they are
free to file Articles of Impeachment for a vote of the full House. If
the Articles of Impeachment pass the House, the Senate will hold a trial
to determine whether or not the President should be removed from office.
