**Does the United States need a new (somewhat green), New Deal after
CoVid-19 gets under control?**

Even if the government plunges us into the next Great Depression, the
New Deal (or a program just like it) is not the answer.

The New Deal was great for enacting a new social agenda, but a new New
Deal is not the answer because, for all the good that it did do (and it
did do some good), it did not end the Great Depression. In fact, it
*extended* it.

And no, World War II did not end the Great Depression, either. It only
provided a short-term fix to the economy, and not without great cost.

It was the foresight of the Republican-southern Democrat coalition that
ended the Great Depression. In 1945 and 1946, with their support,
Congress repealed the excess-profits tax, cut the corporate tax to a
maximum 38 percent, and cut the top income tax rate to 86 percent. In
1948 Congress cut the top marginal rate again, down to 82 percent. While
that was still high, it was enough to signal to businesses that they
would be able to keep much of their profits, and they could start
investing in jobs again. By 1946, the jobless rate fell to 3.9% and
stayed that way for much of the next decade.
