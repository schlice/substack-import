In the eyes of the court, a child needs a family. The rapist (for better
or worse) is the father of the child. Regardless of how he came to be
the father, he is. Since he is the biological father, he retains his
right to visitation with his child, because ultimately, it's not the
"sensibilities" of the adults which are at issue, it is the needs of a
child which are at issue.

The father can request visitation and it can be granted. Conditions can
be applied, and the mother would likely demand such conditions (such as
supervision during visitation, etc).
