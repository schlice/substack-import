**What happens to your body when you have multiple sclerosis?**

The answer is, a lot.

MS is an autoimmune disease which causes the immune system to attack the
CNS. White blood cells cross the blood-brain barrier and attack the
myelin sheath surrounding nerve fibers, leaving scars (or scleroses).
This is where the name comes from: multiple sclerosis, or "many scars."
Signals from the brain to the peripheral nervous system (the autonomic
nervous system remains unaffected) are degraded as they pass through the
areas of *demyelination* and arrive altered at their destination. This
is what causes the various symptoms of the disease.

As far as the symptoms, there are many and they are varied. No two
people experience MS in the same way. Even people who experience the
same symptom experience it in different ways. Also, the timing of
relapses (for Relapsing-Remitting MS), the duration of relapses, and the
amount of time between relapses varies between patients. So saying
exactly what will happen to any one person diagnosed with MS is
impossible. What we can do is say what the most common symptoms of the
disease are, and what are less common symptoms.

> **More common symptoms**
>
> - Fatigue
>
> Occurs in about 80% of people, can significantly interfere with the
> ability to function at home and work, and may be the most prominent
> symptom in a person who otherwise has minimal activity limitations.
>
> - Walking (Gait) Difficulties
>
> Related to several factors including weakness, spasticity, loss of
> balance, sensory deficit and fatigue, and can be helped by physical
> therapy, assistive therapy and medications.
>
> - Numbness or Tingling
>
> Numbness of the face, body, or extremities (arms and legs) is often
> the first symptom experienced by those eventually diagnosed as having
> MS.
>
> - Spasticity
>
> Refers to feelings of stiffness and a wide range of involuntary muscle
> spasms; can occur in any limb, but it is much more common in the legs.
>
> - Weakness
>
> Weakness in MS, which results from deconditioning of unused muscles or
> damage to nerves that stimulate muscles, can be managed with
> rehabilitation strategies and the use of mobility aids and other
> assistive devices.
>
> - Vision Problems
>
> The first symptom of MS for many people. Onset of blurred vision, poor
> contrast or color vision, and pain on eye movement can be frightening
> --- and should be evaluated promptly.
>
> - Dizziness and Vertigo
>
> People with MS may feel off balance or lightheaded, or --- much less
> often --- have the sensation that they or their surroundings are
> spinning (vertigo).
>
> - Bladder Problems
>
> Bladder dysfunction, which occurs in at least 80% of people with MS,
> can usually be managed quite successfully with medications, fluid
> management, and intermittent self-catheterization.
>
> - Sexual Problems
>
> Very common in the general population including people with MS. Sexual
> responses can be affected by damage in the central nervous system, as
> well by symptoms such as fatigue and spasticity, and by psychological
> factors.
>
> - Bowel Problems
>
> Constipation is a particular concern among people with MS, as is loss
> of control of the bowels. Bowel issues can typically be managed
> through diet, adequate fluid intake, physical activity and medication.
>
> - Pain & Itching
>
> Pain syndromes are common in MS. In one study, 55% of people with MS
> had \"clinically significant pain\" at some time, and almost half had
> chronic pain.
>
> - Cognitive Changes
>
> Refers to a range of high-level brain functions affected in more than
> 50% of people with MS, including the ability to process incoming
> information, learn and remember new information, organize and
> problem-solve, focus attention and accurately perceive the
> environment.
>
> - Emotional Changes
>
> Can be a reaction to the stresses of living with MS as well as the
> result of neurologic and immune changes. Significant depression, mood
> swings, irritability, and episodes of uncontrollable laughing and
> crying pose significant challenges for people with MS and their
> families.
>
> - Depression
>
> Studies have suggested that clinical depression --- the severest form
> of depression --- is among the most common symptoms of MS. It is more
> common among people with MS than it is in the general population or in
> persons with many other chronic, disabling conditions.
>
> **Less common symptoms**
>
> - Speech Problems
>
> Speech problems, including slurring (dysarthria) and loss of volume
> (dysphonia) occur in approximately 25-40% of people with MS,
> particularly later in the disease course and during periods of extreme
> fatigue. Stuttering is occasionally reported as well.
>
> - Swallowing Problems
>
> Swallowing problems --- referred to as dysphagia --- result from
> damage to the nerves controlling the many small muscles in the mouth
> and throat.
>
> - Tremor
>
> Tremor, or uncontrollable shaking, can occur in various parts of the
> body because of damaged areas along the complex nerve pathways that
> are responsible for coordination of movements.
>
> - Seizures
>
> Seizures --- which are the result of abnormal electrical discharges in
> an injured or scarred area of the brain --- have been estimated to
> occur in 2-5% people with MS, compared to the estimated 3% of the
> general population.
>
> - Breathing Problems
>
> Respiration problems occur in people whose chest muscles have been
> severely weakened by damage to the nerves that control those muscles.
>
> - Hearing Loss
>
> About 6% of people who have MS complain of impaired hearing. In very
> rare cases, hearing loss has been reported as the first symptom of the
> disease.
>
> **Secondary and tertiary symptoms**
>
> While the primary symptoms described above (more and less common) are
> the direct result of damage to the myelin and nerve fibers in the
> central nervous system (CNS), the *secondary symptoms* are the
> complications that can arise as a result of these primary symptoms.
> For example:
>
> - Bladder dysfunction can cause repeated urinary tract infections.
> - Inactivity can cause loss of muscle tone, weakness (not related to
>   demyelination), poor posture, decreased bone density (increased risk
>   of fracture) and shallow, inefficient breathing.
> - Immobility can cause pressure sores.
>
> While secondary symptoms can be treated, the optimal goal is to avoid
> them by treating the primary symptoms.
>
> *Tertiary symptoms* result from the impact of the disease on your
> life. These symptoms include social, vocational and psychological
> complications. For example, if you are no longer able to drive or
> walk, you may not be able to hold down your usual job. The stress and
> strain of dealing with MS often alters social networks and sometimes
> fractures relationships. Problems with bladder control, tremor or
> swallowing may cause people to withdraw from social interactions and
> become isolated.
>
> *Depression* is very common in people with MS. Depression may be both
> a primary and a tertiary symptom as it can be caused by the disease
> process itself and/or triggered by the challenges discussed
> above.[\[1\]](#EDKyr){#cite-EDKyr .citation_link}

As you can see, what happens to your body in MS is quite extensive.
