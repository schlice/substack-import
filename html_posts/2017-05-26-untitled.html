In MS, more so than other diseases, you are in a partnership with your
care team. You don't "take direction" from your doctor.

One of the most important things I advise new MS patients is that you
must "work with" your neurologist; you don't "work for" your
neurologist. If you don't like what your neurologist is telling you, get
a second opinion, or find another neurologist. If you don't feel like
you "click" with your neurologist, please find another one with whom you
do! I know some people don't have lots of options when it comes to the
number and quality of neurologists in their area. I'm fortunate that I
live in Colorado Springs and we have the Rocky Mountain MS Center in
Denver at the University of Colorado. It is an incredible research
facility with top-notch doctors who continue to work on the forefront of
MS research, and they are able to pass that directly on to me.

You can live well with MS, but you have to start by working well with
your neuro. I hope he takes our advice and discusses this with his
doctor. The cure should not be worse than the disease. And there are
enough options out there that you don't need to feel like you are forced
to compromise your health in order to get MS meds. There **are** other
options.
