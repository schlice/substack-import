<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [The combination of vertical and horizontal stabilizers on<br>the airplane tail keep the plane tracking straight and keep it from<br>twisting up and down. The vertical stabilizer has a control surface<br>called the \"rudder,\" reminiscent of the rudders of sailing ships, and<br>it controls the left-right twist of the plane in the sky, called yaw.<br>The horizontal stabilizer contains a control surface called the<br>\"elevator,\" which controls the up/down motion of the aircraft called<br>\"pitch.\" The \"ailerons\" are small control surfaces on the trailing<br>edges of the wings. They control the plane\'s twisting along its forward<br>axis, called roll.\<br>\<br>The combination of stabilizers, plus the proper input provided to the<br>control surfaces, keeps an aircraft tracking straight and upright while<br>it flies through the air.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
