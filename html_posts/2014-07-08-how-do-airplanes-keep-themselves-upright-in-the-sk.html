**Content:** [The combination of vertical and horizontal stabilizers on
the airplane tail keep the plane tracking straight and keep it from
twisting up and down. The vertical stabilizer has a control surface
called the \"rudder,\" reminiscent of the rudders of sailing ships, and
it controls the left-right twist of the plane in the sky, called yaw.
The horizontal stabilizer contains a control surface called the
\"elevator,\" which controls the up/down motion of the aircraft called
\"pitch.\" The \"ailerons\" are small control surfaces on the trailing
edges of the wings. They control the plane\'s twisting along its forward
axis, called roll.\
\
The combination of stabilizers, plus the proper input provided to the
control surfaces, keeps an aircraft tracking straight and upright while
it flies through the air.]{.rendered_qtext}
