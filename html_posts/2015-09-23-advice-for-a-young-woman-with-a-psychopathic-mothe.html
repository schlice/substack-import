**Content:** [There is no escaping the fact that Jane is definitely
fighting an uphill battle here. Jane already has a divorce and child
abuse allegations under her belt, so she\'s starting the game from
behind.\
\
I would suggest Jane move to a more parent-friendly state. Researching
which states have parent-friendly laws (i.e. Colorado) and which states
have grandparent-friendly laws (i.e. California) will help her to find a
place to take her child.\
\
While Joan\'s actions may have gotten her standing to appear before a
judge to petition for court-ordered visitation, some states still
require that Joan show that she was previously an integral part of that
child\'s life, and that Jane\'s refusal to allow Joan to participate in
that child\'s life will do irreparable harm to the child. If Joan is
found to have been a \"psychological parent,\" one who has played a
significant role in a child\'s life, the court may grant visitation,
even when she has no other standing.\
\
Sadly, the divorce and abuse allegations will play into Joan\'s hand, as
Jane will be fighting an uphill battle when abuse is present. Joan now
has two reasons to have standing: the divorce, and the alleged abuse.
The divorce was the first thing that gave Joan standing, but the divorce
alone wasn\'t enough. Joan would have to have proven she was a
psychological parent in order to get court-ordered visitation. The abuse
allegations not only gave her nearly guaranteed court-ordered
visitation, but opened the door for her to have Jane ruled as an unfit
parent.\
\
Jane should also seek counsel from a family practice attorney in her
area. Jane doesn\'t have a lot of resources, so contacting her local bar
association is her best bet at finding low-cost (and sometimes pro bono
or no-cost) legal representation.]{.rendered_qtext}
