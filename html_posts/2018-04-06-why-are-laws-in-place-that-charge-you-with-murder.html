**Why are laws in place that charge you with murder just because one of
you accomplices in another crime is killed by someone else not you?**

Ah, the infamous [[felony murder
rule](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=ce010e&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony_murder_rule){.external_link

This is a very old rule and dates back to the 12th century in common
law. And the Wiki page explains it best. Basically, "the malicious
intent inherent in the commission of any crime, however trivial, was
considered to apply to any consequences of that crime, however
unintended."

In order to deter dangerous crimes, they use the intent while committing
a dangerous crime to apply to any consequences of the crime, even if you
didn't intend on that consequence.

So if you're robbing a bank, and one of your cohorts kills a security
guard, even if you didn't plan on killing anyone, you can still be found
guilty of murder because a murder was committed during the course of a
felony.

This is an example of **strict liability** where a person who chooses to
commit a crime is considered absolutely responsible for any possible
consequences of that crime. The rule acts as a deterrent to dangerous
crimes.
