**As an experienced homeowner, do you regret joining a HOA (Homeowners
Association)?**

First of all, you don't "join" an HOA. You buy a house in a community
which is controlled by an HOA. If you buy that house, you have no choice
but to join. You can't "opt out" of he HOA.

No one likes being told that they did something wrong. And no one enjoys
violating the rules. HOAs get a bad reputation because it seems that
most of the time, you don't hear from them unless you've done something
wrong.

But if you know the rules and you live by them, HOAs serve a valuable
purpose. They keep home values high. They do this by making sure that
your neighbors don't trash their houses, and they charge them money when
they do.

Everyone buying a house in a covenant controlled community should be
fully aware of what they're getting into. You have to sign the covenants
when you buy your house, and you get a paper copy of the R&R (Rules and
Regulations) and the P&P (Policies and Procedures) for your
neighborhood. In Colorado, we separated those documents. In most states,
it's one document: the PPR&R (Policies, Procedures, Rules &
Regulations). You also get the covenants, which are on file with the
city or county.
