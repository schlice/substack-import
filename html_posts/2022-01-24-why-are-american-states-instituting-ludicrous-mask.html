Because the government has given them the idea that you can mask and
vaccinate your way out the pandemic.

You cannot.

Masks do not prevent infection. One CNN commentator said masks are just
"facial decoration," with which I totally agree.

Vaccines only help *you* avoid the worst outcomes of the virus, but
vaccinated people can still catch the virus, and can still spread the
virus. Vaccines don't slow the spread of the virus, especially today
with far more transmissible strains out there.

But in an effort to "do" something, some states believe that you can
lockdown your way out of the pandemic. They believe you can mask and
vaccinate your way out of the pandemic. So they do what their
population, in general, thinks will be best.
