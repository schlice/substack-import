**What are the best enlisted jobs in the United States Air Force?**

No one can tell you what the best job is, because that's a matter of
opinion. Your opinion about what a "good" job and what a "bad" job are
depend mostly on you.

So instead of telling you what the "best" job (or what the "worst" job)
is, I'll instead tell you how to look for the "best" job **for you.**

Ask yourself some questions:

- Do you want a job where the skills you learn will transfer well to a
  civilian job? If so, then "fixing the turret on a tank" probably isn't
  the best job for you, but "fixing a jet engine" might be.
- Do you want a job that will be exciting and action-packed? All jobs
  have exciting aspects to them, but not all jobs will be constantly
  adrenaline-filled all the time. No one can live like that.

In short, it's up to you to decide what makes a good job and what makes
a bad job. And the simple existence of the phrase, "When life gives you
lemons, make lemonade" means that even if you get a "bad" job, you can
turn it into an opportunity for something useful and meaningful.

The Air Force is lots of people playing small parts to achieve a big
result; it's not these larger-than-life heroes doing Herculean things
all the time saving the world. It's the very essence of teamwork. Going
into it with the right attitude will also help you a lot.

Good luck!
