Characteristics? Besides a few different devices on their uniforms, you
can't tell them apart. So characteristically, there is no difference
whatsoever. When they are working, they have exactly the same authority
as their full-time counterparts, so you can't tell them apart that way.

The big difference? The full time cops deploy. The Augmentees stay
behind and fill in as police while the full time guys are out of
country.

The only other time you'll see them around is when they are doing normal
duty rotations to maintain proficiency, and as I said, aside from a few
devices on their uniforms, you would hardly notice the difference
between them.
