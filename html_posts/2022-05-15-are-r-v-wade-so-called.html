No, nothing like that.

13 states composed "trigger laws," which are laws that would only go
into effect if *Roe* was overturned (that\'s the *trigger*). That\'s
literally the only unique thing about the laws. The laws vary in their
implementation. Some of the laws allow exceptions for rape and incest,
and some do not. Some of these trigger laws have been on the books for
years, simply waiting for the day that *Roe* would be overturned. Some
have just very recently been passed.

But make no mistake, **there is no law that would prevent a doctor from
saving a mother\'s life by taking the baby if it was medically
necessary.** None. Even if the law has no explicit exception for
abortion to save the life of the mother, a doctor can still do it. This
was never a question, even before *Roe* was decided. Abortion activists
try to muddy the water and claim that banning elective abortions would
somehow prevent a doctor from saving a woman\'s life. This has never
been the case in the United States. Yes, there are some obscure examples
from history in other countries where this may have happened, but not
here.

Original question:

Are R v Wade so-called "trigger laws" outright bans on abortion, bans
that don't include exemptions for things like rape, incest, or even to
save the mother\'s life?
