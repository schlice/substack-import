No.

Jesus will forever be the God-man, fully God and fully human. His two
natures are inseparable. But His dual natures don't influence each
other; He isn't some ultra-human, and He isn't a nerf'd god, either.

But even though He was fully God, He sometimes operated within the
confines of His humanity:

> Jacob's well was there; so Jesus, wearied as he was from his journey,
> was sitting beside the well. It was about the sixth hour. --- John 4:6
> ESV

And even though He was fully human, He sometimes operated with divine
power and authority:

> When he had said these things, he cried out with a loud voice,
> "Lazarus, come out." --- John 11:43 ESV
>
> "Bring them here to me," he said. And he directed the people to sit
> down on the grass. Taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking
> up to heaven, he gave thanks and broke the loaves. Then he gave them
> to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the people. They all
> ate and were satisfied, and the disciples picked up twelve basketfuls
> of broken pieces that were left over. The number of those who ate was
> about five thousand men, besides women and children. --- Matthew
> 14:18--21 NIV

We understand that this is a discussion about the **hypostatic union**
--- the two natures of Jesus which exist simultaneously in the form of
one man, but which do not influence one another. This is really just
humans, trying to understand a concept that we simply don't have the
capacity to understand. With the limitations of the finite human mind,
we should not expect to be able to understand the details and
intricacies of an infinite God.

Jesus was always God. He always existed. He existed as God before He
existed as a man. When He was born into this world, he became man, **in
addition** to being God.
