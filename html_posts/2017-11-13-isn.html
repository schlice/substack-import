According to today's society, it is **not** important to give *anyone*
the benefit of the doubt.

**In today's society, you are guilty if you have been accused.**

It doesn't matter if you're innocent.

It doesn't matter if you're gay and not attracted to the person.

If you have been accused, you are guilty. Or you must be, because
consequences immediately befall you, before a trial of your peers has
had an opportunity to weigh in on the matter.

We have reached a critical tipping point in political correctness, a
point at which the mere accusation of wrongdoing is enough to warrant
consequences. I suspect that eventually, someone will be ruined and it
will then be discovered that the accuser was lying just to ruin the
person. But will that be enough to overcome the current tide of
political correctness we currently see? Only time will tell.
