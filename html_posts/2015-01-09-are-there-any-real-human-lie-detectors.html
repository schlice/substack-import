**Content:** [Short answer: no.\
\
Longer answer: detection of deception is as much art as it is science.
People deceive for many reasons, and the reasons span the emotional and
rational gamut. Whether or not there are physical ramifications (change
in sweating, tightening of the sphincter muscle, change in blood
pressure, change in heartbeat) to whether or not we actually tell a lie
is not a medical certainty. Polygraphers say they can accurately detect
lying, but under actual scientific scrutiny, the percentage of detection
of deception isn\'t much better than a coin toss.\
\
Because the odds aren\'t wonderful at actually being able to detect
deception, such tools are used to add to the body of evidence and to aid
investigators. They do not provide the final, definitive, and/or only
answer as to whether or not a person is truthful.]{.rendered_qtext}
