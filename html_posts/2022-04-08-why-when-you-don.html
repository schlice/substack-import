It's not "all" Christians. It's "some" Christians. Particularly, it's
Christians who like to make assumptions about people.

This trait isn't limited to Christians, either. All kinds of people like
to make assumptions about others. It's not any better when they do it
than when Christians do it. It's a poor method of human interaction. It
indicates shallow thought and a lack of reason.

Original question:

Why, when you don\'t become a Christian, do all Christians automatically
assume you are an evil, God hating, atheist pagan?
