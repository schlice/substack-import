This is a quick and dirty history of the Bible. There are many details
which are left out of this brief history, but it is sufficient to
understand why some books were left out of the Bible.

Starting from thousands of years before Christ was born, the Jewish Holy
Scriptures were written in Hebrew. But by about the third century B.C.,
the language of the common man was Greek. Hebrew was limited to those
who worked routinely with the original Holy Scriptures. It was mostly
scholars and Rabbis who read Hebrew. So the people wanted a common
translation of the Holy Scriptures into their common language. This
translation is known as the *Septuagint*.

When the Catholic Church canonized its Bible, it accepted the
Septuagint, since that is what the Jews of the day accepted as their
Holy Scripture. The Septuagint, however, had a few additions made to it
during the time of its creation, a few books which were never written in
the original Hebrew. Nevertheless, the Catholic Church, in creating
their Bible, accepted the Septuagint as it was.

This pretty much stood this way for the first several hundred years of
the Catholic Church, until the Protestant Reformation. The reformers
rejected everything that was centered on Rome (which is why we call it
the Roman Catholic Church), including their Bible, which included the
Septuagint as well as the New Testament, all written in Latin, called
the Vulgate. The Vulgate was summarily rejected by the Protestant
reformers. But now they needed a translation of the Jewish Holy
Scriptures that they could use.

Fortunately, the Jews had gone through sort of a "rediscovery" period of
their own during this time. Jewish scholars produced a new version of
the original Hebrew texts called the "Masoretic Texts" which was
actually written in Hebrew. Not surprisingly, this re-write did not
include any of the books that were *only* written in Koine Greek,
because those books were not part of the original Holy Scriptures.

The Protestant reformers, like the Catholic Church before them, simply
accepted the Masoretic Texts as they stood, and incorporated them into
their own Bible translations, without the additional books which could
be found in the Septuagint.
