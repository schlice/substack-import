The legal restrictions on police officers detaining people without
probable cause are the same in California as they are in the rest of the
country, because these are Constitutional principles not limited by
state law.

All police officers can detain people without probable cause. No police
officer can detain people without **reasonable suspicion.**

That standard is lower than probable cause. Probable cause is required
for *arrest*, which is different than *detention*. When you are
detained, you are not under arrest.

Investigative detentions were named so after the landmark Supreme Court
case *Terry v. Ohio*, which is why they are often called "Terry stops."
During an investigative detention, the suspect is not free to leave, may
be handcuffed for officer safety, and may be frisked (briefly searched)
for weapons.

An officer may find evidence during the investigative detention which
provides him with the requisite *probable cause* to effect an arrest.
But an officer cannot *arrest* you without probable cause, and an
officer cannot *detain* you without reasonable suspicion.

Terry stops can last anywhere from a few seconds to a few hours. There
really is no absolute limit on how long a Terry stop can take, but the
stop "must be temporary and last no longer than is necessary to
effectuate the purpose of the stop..." (*US v. Segoviano,* ND III,
2019). In other words, the length of the detention must be reasonably
related to the reason for the investigation.

Everyone has a 4th Amendment right against unreasonable searches and
seizures. An arrest without probable cause would be a violation of that
right. A detention without reasonable suspicion of criminal activity
would be a violation of the civil right against unlawful detention. If
you feel that your rights have been violated, contact a lawyer in your
jurisdiction ASAP.
