The good news is that you get to determine who is on your MS treatment
team. You'll want a *holistic* team, but how you structure your team is
totally up to you.

Your team begins with your **primary care physician**. They may not be a
specialist, but they need to be fully up to speed on the fact that you
are dealing with a lifelong chronic illness, for which you will be
taking possibly dangerous medication, and for which you will be
experiencing lovely side effects, which they may see reflected in your
blood work and your physical signs and symptoms.

Next on your team is your **neurologist.** At a bare minimum, your care
team should consist of these two doctors. Your neurologist focuses on
your MS. They monitor your disease progression using diagnostic testing
and tools (MRI, neurological physical exams, other diagnostic tools) and
prescribe **disease modifying therapies** (DMTs) to slow down the
progression of your MS and lessen the severity of your relapses. By the
way, all of the DMTs do this. They also help you manage any side effects
using medication-based and other therapies to lessen their effects.

Also, it'd be really great if your PCP and your neuro get in touch with
each other and maintain open communications about your care. While it's
not technically required, it can definitely benefit you.

The remainder of your care team is really dependent on your specific
circumstances, as everyone's MS is different.

- You may have **specialist doctors** who can help you with specific MS
  symptoms. I, for example, have a **urologist** and a
  **neuro-ophthalmologist** on my care team as I have both urinary and
  vision issues related to my MS. You may also have a **psychiatrist**
  on your care team to deal with cognitive issues, and possibly
  depression (I did).
- You may have **other healthcare providers who are not MDs** to assist
  you further, depending on your specific needs. You may have a
  **nutritionist** on your team to help you with dietary needs. You may
  have a **physical therapist** to help you with strengthening exercises
  if you experience weakness. You may have **holistic** providers and
  Eastern medicine providers if you choose. You may have providers who
  specialize in **complementary and alternative medicine** (CAM) if you
  so choose. I used acupuncture, deep tissue massage, neuromuscular
  therapy (NMT), and hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) as part of my
  therapy.

Ultimately, the size and membership of your care team is entirely up to
you.
