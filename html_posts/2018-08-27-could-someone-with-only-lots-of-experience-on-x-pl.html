**Could someone with only lots of experience on X-Plane reasonably land
a commercial jet with guidance from the tower if the crew were
incapacitated?**

In many cases, you won't even have to. We've had
[[Autoland](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=e932c9&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoland){.external_link

60s. You have probably been on a plane which has been landed by the
Autoland system and you didn't even know it. The crew will use it
occasionally to maintain proficiency on the system. It is primarily used
to land in adverse weather conditions, when you must land but you have
poor to no visibility. However, it can be used in clear skies to land a
plane without input from a crew member.

Even without Autoland, people with no flight experience whatsoever have
been talked down.
