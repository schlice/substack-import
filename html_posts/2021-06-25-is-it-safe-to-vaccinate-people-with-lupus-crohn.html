If you saw my [[pinned
post](https://multiplesclerosisforum.quora.com/MS-and-COVID-19)]{.qlink_container}
in the space, you'd know that MS doesn't mean anything when it comes to
COVID-19. People with MS aren't more or less likely to contract
COVID-19.

Where MS patients *can* run into difficulty with COVID is the particular
disease-modifying drug (DMD) we are taking. The vaccine may be hindered
by our particular DMD and may not be effective. Or there could be other
negative interactions between the vaccine and our particular DMD. So
whether or not it is safe to get vaccinated is dependent on the
particular DMD you are on.

MS patients in particular should work directly with their neurologists
to discuss the benefits and possible side effects of getting the
COVID-19 vaccine.
