In general, an officer cannot "get in trouble" for failing to make an
arrest or write a ticket, so long as he believes that no arrestable or
ticketable offense took place, and he can articulate that belief.

His basis is probably in his report. You can get his report from the
department, as the complainant. Feel free to contact the department and
speak to the officer's supervisor if you are dissatisfied with the
outcome of the incident.
