**Do you think that Pence could win the presidency in 2024 with Trump as
VP?**

I think that historically, once a president has served two terms, the
American people feel that he is done.

It's not that Trump couldn't be a VP, or even a good one (if he could
lay off the Twitter just a little bit). It's just that once the
president is done, he's expected to step away from politics.

We talk a lot about expectations. Presidential candidates are expected
to provide full access to their tax returns. Presidents are expected to
act *presidential*, or in a way which honors the legacy of the office
that they temporarily occupy. And once a president has concluded his
service, he is expected to step aside and let others take over. Those
aren't hard and fast rules. They're simply expectations shaped by
precedent.

This includes returning to politics in any other facet.

This is one of the reasons that Obama setting up an office inside the
Beltway was seen as distasteful.

To that end, a Pence/Trump ticket would likely be a *detriment* instead
of a *benefit*.

Besides, there are **far better running mates that Pence could choose.**
Can you say Nikki Haley? Even as I write that, I'd still rather see a
Haley/Gabbard ticket. But a Pence/Haley ticket would come in close
second.
