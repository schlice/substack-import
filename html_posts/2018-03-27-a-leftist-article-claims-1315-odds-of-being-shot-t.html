**A leftist article claims 1:315 odds of being shot to death by a
criminal in the USA. With more than 315 million people in USA, that
requires more than 1 M gunshot victims to be killed to make that 1 in
315 number truthful. Is this propaganda?**

Clearly, the author didn't expect you to use *logic* while reading their
article. They just wanted a sensational number to throw at you.

> *A leftist article claims 1:315 odds of being shot to death by a
> criminal in the USA*

This is a bald-faced lie. There aren't even a million people a year who
die from gunshot wounds. At best, you have roughly 33,000 people a year
who die from gunshot wounds, and two thirds of those are suicides.

Of the remaining 11,000, roughly 8000 are *criminals* killing other
*criminals* while doing *criminal things*. The largest percentage of
deaths in this category is gang violence and violence related to illegal
drugs or other illegal activities.

Within the remaining 3,000 is where you (an honest, law-abiding citizen)
could be killed by a criminal. Roughly one third of that 3000 are killed
by police (so that's not you). Roughly another 1000 are killed in
domestic disputes (while still criminal activity, I'd not count it as
part of the figure unless you're trying to scare people). That means
that you're lumped in with the remaining 1000 deaths a year which
includes accidental shootings and random crimes where one party is an
innocent victim.

That's 1000 deaths out of 330 million people. So instead of the 1 in 315
odds (which is just so out of left field it's not even funny), your odds
as a law abiding citizen of being killed by a criminal are around 1 in
330,000.

**TL;DR: Engage in unlawful activity and your odds of being killed by a
gun go up substantially. But for a law abiding citizen, you're more
likely to be struck by lightning twice in your life (odds are 1 in
161,856) than to be shot by a criminal.**

(EDIT) A lot of people are pointing out that the author said these are
*lifetime* statistics, so therefore the numbers are right.

Wrong.

Even if they are lifetime statistics, does the risk go up over time? If
you didn\'t get hit by a car today, are you therefore *more* likely to
be hit by a car tomorrow?

Anyone who has taken high school Algebra has seen at one time a formula
for *rates over time.* In this case, the probability of X over Y years
is expressed as (P(x))\^y. So the probability of being shot in one year,
1 in 330,000, is 0.0000030303. Assuming an average of a 70 year
lifespan, that would be (0.0000030303)\^70, which is a number so
infinitesimally small that it approaches zero.

Therefore, as you go on through the years, the risk over time
*decreases*. This makes sense, since the time we are measuring is
increasing while the actual risk stays the same.
