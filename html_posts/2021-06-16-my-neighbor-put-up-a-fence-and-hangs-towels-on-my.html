The correct answer, as with the answer to all legal questions, is "it
depends."

If the fence is precisely on the property line, straddling both
properties, then when your neighbor hangs things on the fence and in to
your yard, this is technically a tort trespass (not criminal
trespassing). If the fence actually is located within the neighbor's
property, then hanging things on the fence technically is not a
trespass, as the action takes place completely within the neighbor's
property.

Therefore, your first step is to call your city or county and request a
survey to determine the actual location of the property line. If the
fence actually is on the property line, and if this trespass truly
bothers you, you should start by asking your neighbor to not do that any
more. Let them know that your side of the fence is actually your
property and you don't want items hanging into your yard.

Your next step should be to retain the services of a tort attorney in
your area. Let the attorney send them an official cease-and-desist
letter, citing the trespass, and what may happen if they don't stop,
which will be you suing them for trespass.

Applying treatments to your side of the fence which will damage their
towels is probably not advisable.

Instead of focusing on the problem, perhaps you could assist with some
solutions. Perhaps you can help by offering your neighbor some
suggestions on hanging towel racks which they could hang on their side
of the fence. If you were really motivated to end this practice, you
might consider chipping in to help them purchase these racks, or assist
them with putting them up. It benefits you as well as them. Win-win!
