The short answer is "whatever Congress thinks it is."

Remember, impeachment is not a legal process, but a political one.
Therefore, there must be sufficient political will (and a majority of
the House) to impeach the President.

Following impeachment, the Senate must then believe the offense is
serious enough that the President can no longer discharge his duties
under the Constitution and vote to convict him in order to remove him
from office.
