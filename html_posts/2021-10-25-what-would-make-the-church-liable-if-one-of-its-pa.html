*Criminal liability* would mean that the church was an *accessory* to
the crime.

Someone can be charged as an accessory if they were aiding in or
contributing to the commission or concealment of the crime.

They can also be charged with being an **accessory before the fact** by
assisting in planning or encouraging the pastor to commit a crime.

They could also be charged with being an **accessory after the fact** by
helping the pastor escape arrest or punishment.

\

*Civil liability* (if they are shown to be a civil accessory) could be
established if the plaintiff can establish

- The pastor breached a duty to the plaintiff, the result of which
  injured the plaintiff;
- The church knowingly and substantially assisted the pastor in
  breaching the duty; and
- The church was aware of its role in promoting the breach of duty at
  the time it provided assistance

This would make the church fiscally responsible for punitive, as well as
compensatory, damages.
