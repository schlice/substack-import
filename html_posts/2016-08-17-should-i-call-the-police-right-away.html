I spend most days, at some point, feeling useless and stupid.
Psychologists tell us that your attitude is a better indicator of
success than your intelligence. So it's a good bet that you just "feel"
useless and you just "feel" stupid. With work, you can improve.

How? The first step: take a look at the top of this thread, up near your
question. There is a box labeled "There is help" there with some phone
numbers and email addresses for you. Please call one of them and talk to
those folks. They are very good at what they do.

Ignore the pills and the beer, it's only going to make you ill. Pick up
the phone instead.
