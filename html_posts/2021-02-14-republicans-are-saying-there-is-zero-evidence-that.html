**Republicans are saying there is zero evidence that Trump incited the
Capitol Hill insurrection and Democrats say that there is overwhelming
evidence he did. Who is right or is the truth in the middle?**

It depends on the standard you follow.

If you're looking at this from a ***judicial*** standpoint, Trump is
100% legally protected in his speech. Any lawyer trying to charge Trump
with inciting a riot would be laughed out of court because his speech
was ***nowhere near*** legally sufficient to warrant criminal charges.

If you're looking at this from a ***political*** standpoint, while it
doesn't merit impeachment (the Democrats have, indeed, lowered the
impeachment bar unconstitutionally low), Trump should have quit while he
was ahead. He didn't really need to rile up a crowd of self-proclaimed
patriots and Trump supporters into following him along in his tortured
logic regarding theft of the election.

Not to rehash this all, but a quick summation of how we got here: Yes,
there was vote tampering. No, there was not *enough* vote tampering to
have affected the outcome of any one state election, and even if there
was, there wasn't enough vote tampering to affect the entire outcome of
the election, and absolutely none of those facts make for a valid, or
even a good, reason to storm the Capitol building and attempt to disrupt
a Constitutional process. He lost (even if by the narrowest of margins),
and he should have admitted that fact. He should have admitted to
himself that the bulk of Trump supporters liked his policies (by and
large), but they didn't like Trump *the man*. He made a very poor choice
in giving *that particular speech* to *that particular crowd* at *that
particular time*. Was it impeachable? Of course not. Was it a **really
bad idea**? Yes, indeed it was. He should have known that doing so might
result in some potentially bad outcomes.

So if you're thinking **legally**, his speech was 100% First Amendment
protected. If you're thinking **politically**, as always, there are
three sides to the story: the Republican side, the Democrat side, and
the truth, which usually lies somewhere in the middle. So probably, some
people are allowing the legal side to bleed into their opinion about the
political side, and the waters are just muddy again.

Some people like to comment. Some people like to engage with me in a

shit. If my answer is grammatically low-quality or is un-cited opinion
masquerading as fact, downvote it. If you think I\'m wrong, write your

If you are simply commenting to tell me \"ackshually, you\'re wrong,\"
don\'t be surprised if I quietly delete your comment. Put anything
vaguely harassing in there, and your deletion will be followed by a

compunction. You have been warned. Be nice.*
