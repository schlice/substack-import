**What can the public do to prevent Trump from stopping the lockdowns on
Easter if the rate of COVID-19 cases continues to rise?**

You can't stop Trump from doing anything Trump wants to do. You can,
however, urge your state governor to ignore Trump's recommendations and
keep your state on lockdown. Remember, there is no "national lockdown."
They are all implemented at the state level.

But if you're personally worried that it's too soon: stay home. You're
guaranteed to not get sick if you don't come in contact with others. If
you feel unsafe going outside when the government says you can,
shelter-in-place until such time that you do feel safe again.

If you do have to go out, practice good social distancing, wash your
hands, don't touch your face, etc.
