**How does America reconcile "Give me your tired, your poor, your
huddled masses yearning to breathe free" with their treatment of
foreigners wanting to emigrate to that once great nation?**

Let's discuss the entire section of the poem you mentioned, shall we?

> *Give me your tired, your poor\
> Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,\
> The wretched refuse of your teeming shore\
> Send these, the homeless, tempest-tossed to me,\
> I lift my lamp beside the Golden Door.*
>
> *- Excerpt from "The New Colossus" by Emma Lazarus, on the base of the
> Statue of Liberty*

Note the last line of the poem: "I lift my lamp beside the Golden Door."
Note the imagery there. The United States has a Golden Door. This
signifies two things:

1.  You can come in
2.  The door can close.

As a nation, we have a "door" because *we* get to control who comes in
and who does not. We are quite thrilled with foreigners who wish to
emigrate to this nation. We are, shall we say, slightly less thrilled
when foreigners attempt to *scale the wall* rather than enter through
the Golden Door.

If your *first act* as a member of a new society is to break that
society's laws, then it is questionable whether or not you wish to
follow *any* laws while a member of that society, and we are right to
question.
