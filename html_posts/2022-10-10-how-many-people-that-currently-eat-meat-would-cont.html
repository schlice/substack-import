Have you ever been hungry?

And I don't mean "I skipped breakfast" hungry. I mean "go a week without
really eating anything" hungry. You're not just hungry, you're
*huuuuuungry.*

If not, you can't realistically answer this question, especially if the
thought of cleaning an animal squicks you out.

Because even if you're squicky about cleaning an animal, that
squickiness goes away *really, really fast* when you're huuuuuungry.

We got to experience this in the military. It's part of survival
training. Part of the training is, literally, becoming huuuuuungry.

I had always wondered whether or not I'd be squicky about cleaning an
animal. But when I was *huuuuuungry,* I killed, skinned, gutted, and
cooked a whole rabbit, and I ate the eyeball (apparently it's a cool
thing in the military).

Did you ever eat a worm as a kid? Did you ever think to eat a worm as an
adult? When you're *huuuuuungry,* you slurp them down like spaghetti
(hint: don't bother chewing them).

Did you ever eat a grasshopper? if you happen to have a fire, they come
out crispy and actually tasty (but I was *huuuuuungry*, so everything
was tasty).

TL;DR: **A lot of your food aversions go away really quickly when you
are hungry.**

How many people that currently eat meat would continue to do so if they
