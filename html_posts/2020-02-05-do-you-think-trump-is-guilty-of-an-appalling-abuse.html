**Do you think Trump is guilty of an appalling abuse of public trust?**

Maybe.

But even if that were true, this literally begs the next question:

*Is "abuse of the public trust" an impeachable offense?*

The answer to **that** question is **definitely not.** That's why we
have elections. Period. If you think the President is abusing the public
trust, don't re-elect him. Simple as that.
