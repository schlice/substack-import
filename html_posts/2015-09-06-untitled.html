<h2>Answer Comment</h2>

**Content:** [I think you misunderstood.\
\
Pre-employment drug screening (as a condition of employment), and random
drug tests while employed, as a condition of employment, are valid and
are supported under the \"drug-free workplace\" standards which have
been successfully used in this country for decades.\
\
On the contrary, healthcare decisions and healthcare costs are as much
borne by the employee as they are by the company. Yes the company pays
more, but the company pays into a \"risk pool.\" That means that the
risks provided by any one patient are spread across the entire pool of
payors. That\'s why when I am diagnosed with a lifelong disease while I
am employed (as happened to me), my insurance didn\'t drop me based on
the long term costs that my disease will incur. They spread the cost of
my disease across the entire risk pool. The more people in the risk
pool, the lower the amount that any one disease will affect the rates of
the entire pool.\
\
Does this give the employer the right to demand blood samples from
employees to test for medical conditions? What if the employer found
genetic markers for Parkinson\'s (I know you can\'t adequately test for
Parkinson\'s, but I\'m using it as an example). Could the employer fire
you because they know your healthcare costs will become too expensive
down the road?\
\
The answer is no, because first of all, personal health information is
private between the health insurance company and the individual.
Employers do not have access to that information. Unless you tell your
employer, he will have no idea what health conditions you have.\
\
What most companies do these days is work with insurance companies to
take \"health risk assessment\" surveys which are not mandatory, but if
you choose to \"opt-out\" of the survey, you will not get the benefits
of the lower rates that you would get if you did take the survey. The
health insurance company will then use the results from the survey,
calculate your risk factors (stress, diet, exercise, etc), and will
assign a \"health coach\" to keep in contact with you to ensure you are
maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Again, this is between the insurance
company and the employee. The employer only knows if you completed the
HRA in order to charge you the correct rates. You can also opt out of
the \"health coach\" calls as well. Opting out of the health coach calls
will not affect your insurance rate.\
\
There is a sense of voluntary participation, as you can choose to opt
out of the HRA and pay the higher rates, or you can take the HRA and pay
the lower rates. You can choose to opt out of the health coach calls.
Perhaps in the future, companies will give you even further discounted
rates if you participated in the health coach calls, but the insurance
companies would have to show that the health coach calls reduced patient
payouts for health-related issues by X% before companies will start
offering incentives for using those programs.\
\
Companies also provide other self-help health-related programs as well.
My company provides free biometric screenings, free smoking-cessation
classes, free blood pressure monitoring with Internet-enabled blood
pressure cuffs, etc, all done through health insurance.\
\
The goal should be a \"partnership\" between the employer and the
employee, using their shared relationship with insurance to further that
partnership. The goal should not be \"adversarial\" with \"punitive\"
consequences should you fail to participate voluntarily.\
\
Additionally, blood is a tricky subject, because while blood can be used
to tell you about diseases you may have, this blood is being used to
determine if you are a smoker. Blood is too fraught with privacy issues
that I wouldn\'t want it used in this way. Perhaps a urinalysis, which
can also show nicotine, would be a better idea, but again, what do you
do about false positives? How will you (as a company) handle them?\
\
\"Opt-in\" benefits is much better than \"opt-out\"
punishments.]{.rendered_qtext}
