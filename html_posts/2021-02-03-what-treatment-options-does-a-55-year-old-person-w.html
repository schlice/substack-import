There are medications available which work with progressive forms of the
disease.

But these medicines are more useful in controlling progression of the
disease. They don't restore functionality. For people with SPMS who are
still having relapses, medication may help. But if your SPMS just gets
progressively worse, the approved medications probably won't help.

For someone like you who is immobile (assuming you don't have relapses),
you might think about trying something that's not yet approved in the
US: HSCT.

Let's start with the disclaimer: **HSCT is NOT APPROVED by the FDA** to
treat MS, but the drugs and the procedures used in HSCT are already
approved for other diseases. You must be aware that HSCT a DANGEROUS
treatment, and it is EXPENSIVE. The reason why it is not yet approved is
because we don't yet have the results from well-controlled clinical
studies. However, some are ongoing.

Essentially, HSCT (Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant) attempts to
"reboot" the immune system by destroying it and then rebuilding it from
scratch. In HSCT, hematopoietic (blood cell-producing) stem cells are
collected and stored prior to treatment. Then, chemotherapy drugs are
used to destroy nearly all of the bone marrow in your bones, essentially
depleting the entire immune system. Then the stem cells are
re-introduced into the body and make their way into the bone marrow and,
over time, rebuild the immune system.

As I mentioned, trials are ongoing. They are happening now across the
US, Canada, Europe, and elsewhere. As an example:

You may be able to get yourself enrolled in a trial, or find HSCT
treatment outside of the US. Just Google "hsct secondary progressive ms"
and you'll get some good results.
