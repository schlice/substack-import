**Content:** [You fundamentally don\'t understand why men rape women.
I\'ve said this in other answers, but I\'ll say it again:\
\
Rape isn\'t about sex.\
\
Rape is about **CONTROL.**\
\
Rapists want complete and utter control over another person. The rapist
wants control so completely that they determine whether or not you have
sex with them, the most private, intimate and guarded act a person can
commit with another person. This is the ultimate in control for the
rapist.\
\
The sex is the tool for the control. The sex is not the
end-game.]{.rendered_qtext}
