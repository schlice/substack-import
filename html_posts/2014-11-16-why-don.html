<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [You fundamentally don\'t understand why men rape women.<br>I\'ve said this in other answers, but I\'ll say it again:\<br>\<br>Rape isn\'t about sex.\<br>\<br>Rape is about CONTROL.\<br>\<br>Rapists want complete and utter control over another person. The rapist<br>wants control so completely that they determine whether or not you have<br>sex with them, the most private, intimate and guarded act a person can<br>commit with another person. This is the ultimate in control for the<br>rapist.\<br>\<br>The sex is the tool for the control. The sex is not the<br>end-game.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
