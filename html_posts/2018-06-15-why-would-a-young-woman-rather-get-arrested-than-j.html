When I was in school taking my Criminal Justice class, we visited the
local medium security prison. I got to talk to some of the prisoners.

They told me that prison was their retirement plan.

They knew exactly what crime they would commit, at what age, to get them
sent right back to medium security, to be incarcerated for the rest of
their natural lives. They were perfectly happy living the rest of their
lives in orange jumpsuits because they were living on the taxpayer's
dime. Free room and board. No responsibilities other than doing what the
guards tell you. To them, it was paradise.

Being free meant fending for yourself. Getting and keeping a job.
Meeting obligations such as paying your rent, and paying your cable
bill.

These men didn't want that. They were perfectly content to have the
State care for them for the rest of their lives.

I am certain that there were more prisoners there who felt the same way.
