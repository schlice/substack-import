**The Senate has voted 49 51 against calling for additional witnesses in
President Trump\'s impeachment hearing. Is this good for the
Republicans?**

Republicans, by and large, believe that this impeachment has gone on
long enough. Most Republicans, even if they individually believe that
the President's actions with respect to Ukraine may have contained a
personal motive, they also believe that the actions had a national
interest motive as well.

Finally, most Republicans believe that none of that rises to the level
of an impeachable offense.

So is the vote against additional witnesses good for Republicans? I
can't say what is "good" for anyone. I can say that wrapping up this
impeachment trial based on the strength of the case presented by the
House is Constitutionally appropriate. There is no need for additional
witnesses, since the House voted to pass these articles of impeachment
with the evidence contained in them. The Senate's job is to judge the
articles as they are written, not to re-investigate everything the House
already investigated. This vote signals that the Senate wishes to do
just that.
