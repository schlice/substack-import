Our HOA has a rule that says that informational/celebratory/seasonal
signs can be up for 7 days without approval, longer if you seek
approval.

We also have a rule that says that you can't have signage in your
windows facing the street without approval.

There is nothing unconstitutional about an HOA enacting rules in
accordance with their Governing Documents which they can use to control
how the neighborhood looks. You voluntarily entered that agreement when
you bought a house in an HOA-controlled neighborhood. And that's where
you are being confused. You voluntarily allowed the HOA to control how
your house looks from the outside when you bought a house in a mandatory
HOA neighborhood.

We have a house right now that has a MAGA-leaning sign in their window,
and we're fighting against that one, too.

Remember, it's not the content of the sign that the HOA is concerned
about, it's the overall look of the neighborhood and the potential hit
to resale value for neighbors.

Original question:

Has the Supreme Court upheld the right for people to put a sign in their
windows inside their own houses that can be seen from the street. A link
to such a case? My HOA doesn't want BLM signs inside our houses that can
be seen from the street.
