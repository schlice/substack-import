**Can I be arrested for drugs in my home that don\'t belong to me?**

Laws vary by state, but in general, if no one fesses up to owning the
drugs, then yes, you can be arrested for illegal drugs in your home,
even if they don't belong to you.

You might find this surprising, but even people who are caught with
their own drugs in their own home will claim that the drugs do not
belong to them. As you can then imagine, most arresting officers are
unmoved by this claim. They will let the evidence stand as it is.
