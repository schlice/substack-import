**If school teachers were armed in the United States, what kind of
training would they need to stop a shooter in a school?**

First, they would need the required training by the county or city to
obtain a concealed carry permit. This includes background checks,
fingerprinting, and specialized concealed carry training. There are many
private institutions which offer concealed carry training, and each
state and county has different requirements for training. My county
accepted my DD-214 as proof of weapons training (discharge from military
service). Your DD-214 must have been from within five years. My county
also accepts your military ID card if you're active. Our county also
requires knowledge of liability laws, the "Make My Day" law, and others.

So depending on where you live, your concealed carry permit requirements
may cover most of the things you would need to know.

answer for more details about which specific things you should know as a
teacher getting a permit. If your concealed carry training doesn't cover
all of those items, you should separately seek those trainings.
