She won't have to, because Trump should have been corrected by now.

Trump was supposed to highlight the difference between himself and her,
that he is a political outsider and she has been part of the
"establishment" for 30 years. Instead, he jumbled the words up in his
head and said that she's been in power for 30 years and hasn't made any
improvements.

As usual, they need to work on Trump's delivery. He knows the basic
idea, but the way he phrases things leaves you with the wrong
impression. He's got to work on his delivery. He's got to work on the
***accuracy*** of his statements. What he says, and how he phrases it,
matters. If he can't get that down, he's done. He needs to deliver a
consistent message, and he doesn't.
