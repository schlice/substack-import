**Given the opioid crisis, would you support the death penalty for major
drug dealers? If yes or no, why?**

What a person does for a living does not determine the punishment they
get for a crime.

Punishment is based on the *crime*, not the *person*.

The difference is akin to your child doing something wrong and you
telling him, "You're bad!" as opposed to telling him, "That was bad" or
"that was a bad thing to do."

The size and scope of the opioid crisis doesn't make me handle **drug
dealers** differently. The size and scope of the opioid crisis may make
me rethink penalties for the distribution of opioids.

There is a difference.
