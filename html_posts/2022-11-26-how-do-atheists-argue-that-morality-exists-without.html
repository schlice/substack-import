Oh, that's easy. They're simply on the other side of the *nature vs.
nurture* argument.

Christians argue that morality is programmed in to our DNA by God,
because the Moral Law is one of the proofs of God's existence (along
with the Cosmological and the Teleological Arguments). It goes like
this:

1.  Every law has a law giver.
2.  Moral Law exists.
3.  Therefore, there is a Moral Law Giver.

Atheists believe that there is a moral law. There is really no denying
the fact that a moral law exists, and there are many ways to prove it.
They simply claim, in a variety of ways, that the "Moral Law Giver" is
the universe, and the moral law "evolved because morality is good for
community" or is simply something we learn as youth in our homes.

Their arguments, as usual, confuse the *knowledge* of the moral law and
how we gain that knowledge, to the *existence* of an absolute Moral Law.
Just because we may gain knowledge of the moral law through social norms
and upbringing does not mean that there is no objective Moral Law
outside of ourselves.

They claim that these "cooperative" moral laws helped us to survive. But
this claim makes some basic assumptions, such as the fact that
"survival" is an end of evolution, which by their own definition, is
incorrect because evolution has no end because it is a non-intelligent
process. And even if we grant that survival is the end goal of
evolution, atheists still can't explain why people willingly engage in
self-destructive behavior (smoking, drinking, drugs, suicide, etc). Nor
can they explain why people sometimes override their own survival
instincts to save others, even to the point of their own deaths. We all
know that there are nobler ends than mere survival. Parents sacrifice
for their children. Soldiers sacrifice for the nation. And if
Christianity is true, Christ sacrificed His life for us; God sacrificed
His son for us.

The big problem the atheists have in explaining this: they can't explain
why people *should* follow some biologically-derived "morality." If
humans sometimes override their "survival instinct" and place themselves
in harms way to save others, why shouldn't they override their
"cooperative" instinct to benefit themselves or elongate their life? If
there is nothing beyond this world, why *shouldn't* I murder, rape, rob
and steal to get what I want to benefit my own survival? If I can
survive longer without "cooperating," then why wouldn't I? Why would I
harm the means to my own survival by helping others, when the powerful
survive longer by exploiting the weaker? History is littered with
examples of people who have done just this, and have survived longer. In
fact, it's the very definition of "survival of the fittest."

But the biggest problem for the atheists is that if morality is evolved,
then there is no higher standard beyond ourselves. We are
self-referential, because there is nothing beyond us to instill us with
objective morality. By the way, Hitler used this justification for the
Holocaust. From his book, *Mein Kampf*:

> If Nature does not wish that weaker individuals should mate with the
> stronger, she wishes even less that a superior race should intermingle
> with an inferior one; because in such a case all her efforts,
> throughout hundreds of thousands of years, to establish an
> evolutionary higher stage of being, may thus be rendered futile.
>
> But such a preservation goes hand in hand with the inexorable law that
> it is the strongest and the best who must triumph and that they have
> the right to endure. He who would live must fight. He who does not
> wish to fight in this world, where permanent struggle is the law of
> life, has not the right to exist.

Ideas have consequences.

So if there truly is a higher moral law that is imprinted on our very
being, it must have been given by a higher authority than ourselves.
Therefore, the only logical conclusion is that there exists a Moral Law
Giver.

I don't have enough faith to believe that somehow morals evolved, and we
are somehow bound to moral law that is somehow higher than ourselves.
