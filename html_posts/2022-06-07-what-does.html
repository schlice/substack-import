When a job is advertised as "including health care benefits," it means
that the employer has purchased a group health insurance plan for its
employees. The employer will share the cost of the plan with the
employees, and then at the point of service, you will either have to pay
a "copay" or a "coinsurance" amount.

Specifically, under the Affordable Care Act, insurance must be, well,
*affordable*. But what does that mean? Companies with more than 50
full-time workers must provide group health insurance that meets the
federal standards for

1.  Minimum Value
2.  Minimum Essential Coverage, and
3.  Affordability.

For 2021, the premium cost of the lowest-level employee-only coverage
(i.e. not "employee + 1" or "family" coverage) *must be less than 9.83%
of an employee's household income* to be considered *affordable*. This
is an increase from the 2019 affordability percentage of 9.78%. The ACA
originally set the affordability threshold at 9.5% of an employee's
household income.

For many employers, it is difficult to determine an employee's household
income. Accordingly, the IRS provided three safe harbors for employers
to determine if they have offered affordable coverage. An employer may
choose any safe harbor, but must apply the safe harbor on a reasonable
and consistent basis. The three safe harbors are:

> 1.  **Rate of Pay Safe Harbor**: Under this safe harbor, an employer's
>     offer of coverage will be deemed affordable if the cost for the
>     lowest-level self-only coverage is no more than the IRS issued
>     affordability percentage (9.78% for 2020 or 9.83% for 2021) of an
>     amount equal to 130 hours multiplied by the lower of the
>     employee's hourly rate of pay during the calendar month (or the
>     start of the plan year).
> 2.  **Form W-2 Safe Harbor**: Under this safe harbor, an employer's
>     offer of coverage will be deemed affordable if the employer's
>     share of the cost for the lowest-level self-only coverage is no
>     more than the IRS issued affordability percentage (9.78% for 2020
>     or 9.83% for 2021) of the employee's wages as reported in Box 1 of
>     Form W-2.
> 3.  **Federal Poverty Line Safe Harbor**: Under this safe harbor, an
>     employer's offer of coverage under a calendar year plan is
>     affordable if an employee pays no more for the lowest-level
>     self-only coverage than the IRS issued affordability percentage
>     (9.78% for 2020 or 9.83% for 2021) of the published annual
>     individual U.S. mainland federal poverty level divided by
>     12.[\[1\]](#VdIbn){#cite-VdIbn .citation_link}

If you elect "Employee + 1" or "Family" coverage, your costs may be
higher, but those options are not used to determine if a plan is
"affordable."

However, your total healthcare cost is more than just the paycheck
deduction. In determining health care costs, you must look at several
things:

- How much money is being deducted from your paycheck during each pay
  period, or the aforementioned paycheck deduction. This is your share
  of the "premium" for the health insurance. You should also examine how
  much your employer is paying for the insurance, so that you can see
  the total cost of your plan.
- Whether or not your plan has a *deductible*, which is an amount you
  will pay out of pocket for covered services, usually at a group
  discounted rate, before insurance starts paying.
- What your "copay" or "coinsurance" amounts will be at the point of
  service for each covered service once any deductibles are paid.

If you are able to find a better overall deal on the marketplace than
you can get through your employer-sponsored health plan, you should be
able to decline the group health plan, and the money your employer was
deducted from your paycheck for your health plan will simply be paid to
you. It's part of your salary anyway. If the employer has more than 200
eligible employees, they are required to opt you in to health coverage
unless you opt out.

Original question:

What does \"including health care benefits\" mean when a job offer is
extended in Colorado? I took a lower paying position because it
\"included health care benefits\" and then I found out they were twice
the cost of benefits offered on the marketplace?
