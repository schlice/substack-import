Since senators are not appointed under the Appointments Clause, they
cannot be impeached. However, if the state of Texas feels that Ted Cruz
needs to leave his position, the state of Texas may hold a recall vote
to remove him from office.

If they otherwise do not remove him, or if they do not have a mechanism
for recall of effected officials under Texas law, the next best bet for
Texas voters is to vote him out at the next election.

And as others have pointed out, the individual chamber can expel a
member with a 2/3 vote.
