**If you're going to defund law enforcement, who's going to confiscate
all the guns when you vote to ban them?**

It doesn't make logical sense to both defund the police and disarm the
population. You have to pick one.

You can't say, "You don't need guns, the police will protect you" and
then say "The police are the most corrupt, institutionally racist
organization in government and must be disbanded" and expect to be taken
seriously. Either the police can protect me, or they can't. And if they
can't, then it's up to me to protect myself.

The truth is, it's *always* been up to me to protect myself. The fact
that my taxpayer dollars fund a government organization which can take
the first crack at defending me doesn't alleviate me of my
responsibility to protect myself. You can't subrogate my self-protection
responsibility to the police and then defund the police. Again, pick
one.
