Why veto the bill? His name is Andy Bershear (D). See that D right
there? That's why he vetoed the bill.

He, like the Democrats he represents, believes that banning students
from playing on teams which correspond to their gender identity rather
than their biological sex is harmful to them.

He simultaneously minimizes the harm caused to women's sports by
biological males completely dominating those sports because of their
physiological advantages.

Original question:

Kentucky Governor Andy Bershear just vetoed a bill that would only allow
students of grade six and up to play on sports teams of their birth sex.
No-one is \"assigned\" a sex/gender at birth, it is determined at
conception, but why veto the bill?
