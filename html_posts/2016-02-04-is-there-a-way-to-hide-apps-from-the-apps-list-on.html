You can delete apps from the home screen, but they will always show up
in the \"Apps Drawer\" or the \"Apps List,\" depending on what launcher
you use. Additionally, they will always be visible in your \"Installed
Applications\" list in your Settings.

If you have a ***rooted*** phone, you can use an app called **AppHider**
which is available in the Google Play store. Again, this app only works
when you have a rooted phone. You dial a sequence into the Phone dialer
and your apps become unhidden. AppHider can even be set to notify you to
re-hide your apps once you\'re done using them. They will be gone from
both the apps list and the \"Installed Applications\" list in your
Settings.
