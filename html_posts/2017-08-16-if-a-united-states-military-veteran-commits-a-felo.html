It depends on the benefit they are getting, and the particular felony
for which the Veteran is incarcerated.

> **Disability Compensation**
>
> VA disability compensation payments are reduced if a Veteran is
> convicted of a felony and imprisoned for more than 60 days. Veterans
> rated 20 percent or more are limited to the 10 percent disability
> rate. For a Veteran whose disability rating is 10 percent, the payment
> is reduced by one-half. Once a Veteran is released from prison,
> compensation payments may be reinstated based upon the severity of the
> service connected disability(ies) at that time. Payments are not
> reduced for recipients participating in work release programs,
> residing in halfway houses (also known as \"residential re-entry
> centers\"), or under community control. The amount of any increased
> compensation awarded to an incarcerated Veteran that results from
> other than a statutory rate increase may be subject to reduction due
> to incarceration.
>
> **Pension**
>
> Veterans in receipt of VA pension will have payments terminated
> effective the 61st day after imprisonment in a Federal, State, or
> local penal institution for conviction of a felony or misdemeanor.
> Payments may be resumed upon release from prison if the Veteran meets
> VA eligibility requirements. Failure to notify VA of a Veteran\'s
> incarceration could result in the loss of all financial benefits until
> the overpayment is recovered.
>
> **Apportionment to Spouse or Children**
>
> All or part of the compensation not paid to an incarcerated Veteran
> may be apportioned to the Veteran\'s spouse, child or children, and
> dependent parents on the basis of individual need. In determining
> individual need, consideration shall be given to such factors as the
> claimant\'s income and living expenses, the amount of compensation
> available to be apportioned, the needs and living expenses of other
> claimants as well as any special needs, if any, of all claimants.
>
> Additional Information:
>
> - VA will inform a Veteran whose benefits are subject to reduction of
>   the right of the Veteran\'s dependents to an apportionment while the
>   Veteran is incarcerated, and the conditions under which payments to
>   the Veteran may be resumed upon release from incarceration.
> - VA will also notify the dependents of their right to an
>   apportionment if the VA is aware of their existence and can obtain
>   their addresses.
> - No apportionment may be made to or on behalf of any person who is
>   incarcerated in a Federal, State, or local penal institution for
>   conviction of a felony.
> - An apportionment of an incarcerated Veteran\'s VA benefits is not
>   granted automatically to the Veteran\'s dependents. The dependent(s)
>   must file a claim for an apportionment.
>
> **Education Benefits**
>
> Beneficiaries incarcerated for other than a felony can receive full
> monthly benefits, if otherwise entitled. Convicted felons residing in
> halfway houses (also known as \"residential re-entry centers\"), or
> participating in work-release programs also can receive full monthly
> benefits.
>
> Claimants incarcerated for a felony conviction can be paid only the
> costs of tuition, fees, and necessary books, equipment, and supplies.
> VA cannot make payments for tuition, fees, books, equipment, or
> supplies if another Federal State or local program pays these costs in
> full.
>
> If another government program pays only a part of the cost of tuition,
> fees, books, equipment, or supplies, VA can authorize the incarcerated
> claimant payment for the remaining part of the
> costs.[\[1\]](#cFehU){#cite-cFehU .citation_link}
