Article II Section 2 Clause 2 does a few things.

- It defines the Office of the President as the office responsible for
  foreign relations, as it gives the President the power to make
  treaties.
- It defines the President's appointment authority. He can appoint
  "officers" of the United States, including the Supreme Court.
- It lays out the fact that the Senate is responsible to give "advice
  and consent" to such appointments and treaties. It's important to note
  that it does not dictate *how* the Senate gives that advice and
  consent, or whether or not they must give that advice and consent at
  all (thus disallowing the appointment by not providing "consent"). The
  Senate is free to work according to their rules. This became a major
  point of contention when Merrick Garland was being considered for a
  Supreme Court seat to fill the vacancy left by the death of Justice
  Antonin Scalia. The Senate chose not to hear arguments or testimony
  from Judge Garland, and chose to not vote on his appointment. Many
  thought that the Senate "abdicated its duties" by refusing to vote,
  and thought that the judge was due an "up or down vote," not a tacit
  denial of appointment. Garland's appointment situation, and the
  subsequently vacant seat, became an election issue, as the incoming
  president would decide who should fill that seat. This became a
  driving factor for many to consider Trump over Clinton, as the public
  voted to shape the courts with the Presidential election.
