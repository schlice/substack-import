**Is it illegal for ICE or other law enforcement to go inside a
religious building and arrest someone?**

No, there is no special protection for anyone inside of a church. If the
church is open to the public, it is open to law enforcement. There is
literally nothing special about a church that would prevent law
enforcement (including ICE) from doing their jobs there.
