**Yes.**

Manslaughter (in the US) is *the unlawful taking of a life*. The
definition of the crime says nothing of forethought (planning to, or
thinking about, harming someone), and it says nothing of malice
(intention to take a life, otherwise called *mens rea,* or the guilty
mind*).* It is simply the *actus reus* (or the guilty act) of unlawfully
taking a life. Whether or not the act that caused the death was illegal
or dangerous is also not considered. Taking a life unlawfully is
manslaughter. Manslaughter is the physical element of the crime without
the mental knowledge that what one was doing was a crime. Manslaughter
is a **strict liability** crime, one in which only the actus reus is
required. The only thing required is that the act was voluntary, since
involuntary acts are not criminal unless they stem from recklessness or
criminal negligence.

Hopefully, the state of mind and the fact that what the killer did was
not illegal or dangerous will be factored in when sentencing takes
place.
