It depends on what you mean by "qualified."

The Constitution lists qualification criteria to be President (or VP,
who can become President upon the incapacitation of the President). You
have to be a natural-born citizen who is at least 35 years old, and who
has been a resident in the US for at least 14 years.

So from that respect, yes she is qualified.

But I suspect you are asking about the "other" qualification, the one
where you are fully capable of doing the job. And this one is not a
simple yes/no, but is a matter of opinion.

In that respect, we really don't fully know. She was a Senator from
California, and was the Attorney General for California as well. Does
that provide you with the requisite leadership training to be President?
Does it provide you with enough understanding to successfully execute
the duties of the office of the President?

I think that most would argue that it does not. I would say that a
governor of a state would have the most closely applicable experience to
be President. Or, perhaps, a CEO of a major corporation (but that is
questionable and depends very much on the person). We have elected
Senators and Congressional representatives to the Presidency, so it
seems that people believe that serving in Congress is appropriate
qualification. We have also frequently elected military veterans, so
clearly the people believe that military leadership is a good quality to
have.

*Could* she be a good president? Tough to say. But in my opinion, based
on her actions as a Senator and as AG, I'd say that she would govern
from the *far* left, probably about as far left as Biden himself. And I
don't think that *any* President whose governing philosophy includes
*far* anything makes a good President.
