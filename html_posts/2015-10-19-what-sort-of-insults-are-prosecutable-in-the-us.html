Speaking like an asshat is absolutely protected by the First Amendment.
You have the right to make as big a fool of yourself as you like.
Calling names, cursing, and generally being a foul human being is
Constitutionally protected in the United States.

Once you cross the line into threatening speech, or speech that incites
a riot, or speech that incites others to illegal or dangerous action,
you start crossing into territory which can be prosecuted simply for
speaking.

\"Son of a bitch\" is an opinion, but simply stating your opinion about
someone does not rise to an actionable level unless the speech causes
some harm. In order to be sued for slander, your speech must cause
demonstrable harm to someone else. For example, if you called Donald
Trump a philanderer and it cost him the election, he could sue you for
slander and defamation of character, because the lie had a demonstrable
harm that can be proved.
