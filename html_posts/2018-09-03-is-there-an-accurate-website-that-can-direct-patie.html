**Is there an accurate website that can direct patients to the newsest
and best treatment for any medical condition?**

No, nor should there be.

The reason: ***you don't get treatment advice for medical conditions
from the Internet. You get treatment advice for medical conditions from
a doctor.***

I saw this at my doctor's office and it made me laugh:

Just as the fact that you don't get treatment advice from television,
you don't get treatment advice from the Internet. See your doctor so you
can be properly diagnosed and given treatment advice that won't kill
you.
