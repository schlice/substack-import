**When Donald Trump commits an impeachable offence again, would Congress
restart the impeachment proceedings or will they just resend the
articles of impeachment to the Senate for a new trial?**

You have several errors of fact in your question, which I presume are
caused by your own biases.

"**When** Donald Trump commits an impeachable offence again" is an
inaccurate forward-looking statement. It should be "If," not "When." No
one can see the future.

You also said "When Donald Trump **commits an impeachable offence
again**" which is inaccurate because no one is convinced that he already
committed impeachable offenses. The Senate's party-line acquittal and
the party-line House vote for impeachment proved this. Never has an
impeachment taken place on a party-line vote. The Framers warned of
this: impeachment becoming a party-line weapon. Democrats decided to
jump the shark on impeachment anyway. This is where the uncertainty
about actual impeachable offenses comes into play.

Now that we've thoroughly dissected the bias inherent in your question,
to answer the actual meat of your question, the Articles of Impeachment
have been voted on and passed; the President has already been impeached.
The Articles were sent to the Senate, and they voted to acquit the
President and not remove him from office. In other words, while the
House has the sole power to impeach, the Senate has the sole power to
remove from office if they think the offenses sent by the House were
severe enough to warrant removal.

If new offenses are alleged by the House, they will have to start over
from square one: new allegations, new investigations, new evidence, and
a new vote for new Articles of Impeachment based on these new
allegations. These new Articles will lead to a new Senate trial.

And if it goes just as partisan as the first impeachment attempt, it
will fail in exactly the same partisan way that this one did.

And eventually, the people will grow weary of endless impeachments and
will vote the rabble-rousers out of the House to allow for more
level-headed persons to take over.
