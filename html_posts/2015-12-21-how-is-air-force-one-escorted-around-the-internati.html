Air Force One is not routinely escorted by fighter jets while it is
flying. Yes, it is closely monitored by Air Traffic Control and by the
US military (through NORAD) during its flight, but it does not routinely
receive fighter escort, especially over the continental United States.

It has happened in the past, however. When President Nixon was on his
way to Syria for a scheduled appearance in 1974, Syrian fighter jets
intercepted Air Force One, which took evasive action.

As far as I am aware, Air Force One does not have any offensive
capabilities. It does have both ECM and flare/chaff packages which can
be deployed, but it would likely call for fighter assistance should it
run into trouble. This happened on 9/11, when President George W. Bush
left Sarasota, Florida. A credible threat was received and AF1 called
for fighter escort.
