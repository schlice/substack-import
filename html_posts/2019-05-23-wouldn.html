**Wouldn't Trump have a stronger case if he didn't ignore congress and
obstruct justice while they probed him, then investigations unveiled
Democratic wrongdoing?**

You might think so, but you'd be forgetting that little thing called
*separation of powers* and *checks and balances.*

Congress does not lord over the President. In fact, the founders were
extremely worried that the legislature would turn the Presidency into
nothing more than its puppet, and would just rubber-stamp everything
that came across his desk. To that end, they set up a system of checks
and balances between the three *co-equal* branches of government. To
counter their fears about the legislature running the Presidency, they
made a unitary Executive, and endowed him with the full authority of law
enforcement. The Congress, for its part, can check the Executive with
two powers: the power to defund Federal agencies, and the power of
impeachment.

Now, on to the charges in your "question."

First of all, he's not "ignoring Congress." He's responding directly to
Congress. Whether or not that response can be Constitutionally justified
remains to be seen, but he's most definitely not ignoring them. He is
asserting his position that the Executive is a co-equal branch of
government and cannot be bullied by an overreaching legislature, which
is what he believes is going on.

Secondly, "obstruction of justice" is a crime. If the President were
committing a crime, it's up to Congress to file Articles of Impeachment,
as that is their remedy when the President commits a crime. The fact
that they have not yet impeached the President means that either they
don't believe strongly enough that he actually committed a crime, or
there is no political will to impeach the President. Either way, they
can wring their hands and whine about "cover-ups" and "a fleecing of
America" all they want, but they have the power to impeach the President
at any time they want. Clearly, Congress' complaints are just "sound and
fury, signifying nothing."

Finally, I have no doubt that investigations into the beginnings of the
Russia collusion hoax will indeed reveal that the FBI and our
intelligence apparatus unlawfully opened counterintelligence
investigations into the President and his campaign by knowingly using
opposition research in a deceptive way as "evidence" that such an
investigation needed to be opened, in order to extract political gain.
The Attorney General and the Inspector General at the FBI and the DOJ
are all already conducting those investigations, because the whole thing
stinks, and it's their job to find the source of the odor.
