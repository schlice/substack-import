Yes, it is true that all life is sacred. All life is created and known
by God.

> **If it is, why do we still have capital punishment?**

*We have capital punishment* ***because*** *all life is sacred.*

Because all life is sacred, those who murder (or who dishonor the
sanctity of life) must be held to account for that, and they are held to
that account by blood (see Genesis 9:6).

There is disagreement in the church about whether or not Christ's death
and resurrection abolished the need for a blood-for-blood punishment for
murderers. But as it stands today, the Bible at least contains
justification for why murderers can be killed.

The Bible also contains several other requirements for capital
punishment, which we incorporate in our system of capital punishment
today:

- proportionality (Exodus 21:23--25)
- certainty of guilt (Deuteronomy 17:6, Numbers 35:30)
- intent (Numbers 35:22-24)
- due process (Deuteronomy 17, Numbers 35)
- reluctance (not refusal) (Ezekiel 33)

The church should continue to have a healthy dialogue about whether or
not capital punishment is both biblical and necessary. We should always
seek to refine our understanding of important issues like this.
