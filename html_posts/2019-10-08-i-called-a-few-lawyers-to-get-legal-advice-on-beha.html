**I called a few lawyers to get legal advice on behalf of a friend. Are
the conversations protected by attorney client privilege?**

The question asks about what lawyers often call "free consultations."
You haven't paid or retained the attorney, is the free consultation
still protected?

As with any legal question, the answer depends on where you are and what
exactly was discussed. However, in general, as long as the prospective
client is seeking legal advice or representation and reasonably believes
the communication will be confidential, the consultation is privileged.
This remains true even if the would-be client never hires the attorney.

The situation is different if the attorney declines to represent a
potential client who nevertheless continues to communicate with the
attorney. There is no privilege in such a case, because there is no
potential attorney-client relationship, and therefore no reasonable
belief that the communications would have to be kept confidential.

(EDIT) The question was asked regarding the presence of a third party.
In general, if an attorney and client are communicating and a third
party is present, the client waives privilege. However, if the third
party is present to aid the cause, the conversation remains privileged.
In this case, the third party was acting in an advisory role, passing on
the protected information to the attorney, expecting it to remain
protected. So long as the client and the third party all continue to
intend the communications to remain privileged, the privilege will still
attach.
