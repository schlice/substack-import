**How does a Trump voter reasonably and logically evidence that they
made the right choice?**

How does *any* voter reasonably and logically evidence that they made
the right choice?

- Voter has criteria he uses when making a choice
- Voter makes a choice
- Voter watches to see if criteria were met.

So whether or not a Trump voter knows they made the "right" choice is
whether or not the criteria they had in place when they made that choice
are being fulfilled.

Note that Trump is almost one year into his term; he still has three
more years to accomplish the things that might be present on any one
voter's punch card.
