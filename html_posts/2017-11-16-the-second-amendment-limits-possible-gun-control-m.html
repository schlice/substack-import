title: '"The Second Amendment limits possible gun control measures so perhaps the
  best solution to gun violence and shooting sprees is simply to stop printing and
  broadcasting news reports about those disturbing events - do you agree?"'

Your question begins with an incorrect assumption.

The compliance with the Second Amendment is not to the detriment of
"stopping crazies." It's not like we **EITHER** comply with the Second
Amendment, **OR** stop crazies.

It's more like *The US must comply with the 2nd Amendment. Also, we have
a problem of crazies we have to deal with. The crazies occasionally (but
not always) use guns. Sometimes they use box cutters, commercial
airliners, rental trucks and fertilizer, but the common denominator is
not the tool used, it's the crazies.*

We need better *crazy control*, not *gun control.*

On a separate note, we should not be broadcasting so much information
about these events. It is well known that some of these "crazies" do
what they do for the fame. There was at least one school shooter who
"idolized" Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris, the Columbine High School
shooters.

But mass media is a business, and it is in the business of keeping your
eyeballs glued to the screen so they can sell more advertising. And what
better way to do that than to print and broadcast news reports about
these events, 24x7?
