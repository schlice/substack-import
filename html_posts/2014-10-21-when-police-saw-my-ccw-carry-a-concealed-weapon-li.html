<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I believe that they were asking because they truly wanted to know your<br>logic.<br><br>In actuality, if you live in a \"shall issue\" state, you don\'t need a<br>reason. So what they are asking you is why you \"feel like\" you need to<br>carry a gun. It\'s not a trick question; they just want to know. You<br>can\'t answer wrong. It\'s not like if you say the wrong thing you\'d<br>get your license revoked.<br><br>Some people don\'t have logic when carrying. They say, \"it\'s my right,<br>so I don\'t have to have a reason.\" Some people are very principled<br>about it, and would say, \"I\'m an ex-Marine sniper sharpshooter, and I<br>can be more of a benefit to my family when I am armed than when I am<br>not.\"<br><br>You could also answer in the snarky way: "Because carrying a police<br>officer on my hip isn't feasible."<br><br>None of these would really raise any suspicion. Unless, of course, you<br>answered, \"I carry guns because it\'s easier to shoot unarmed<br>handicapped children and defenseless women.\" In which case they may<br>look a little more closely into your background and mental state before<br>returning that license to you.<br><br>But, you know, I mean, apart from *that*, you really can\'t answer<br>wrong.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
