I believe that they were asking because they truly wanted to know your
logic.

In actuality, if you live in a \"shall issue\" state, you don\'t need a
reason. So what they are asking you is why you \"feel like\" you need to
carry a gun. It\'s not a trick question; they just want to know. You
can\'t answer wrong. It\'s not like if you say the wrong thing you\'d
get your license revoked.

Some people don\'t have logic when carrying. They say, \"it\'s my right,
so I don\'t have to have a reason.\" Some people are very principled
about it, and would say, \"I\'m an ex-Marine sniper sharpshooter, and I
can be more of a benefit to my family when I am armed than when I am
not.\"

You could also answer in the snarky way: "Because carrying a police
officer on my hip isn't feasible."

None of these would really raise any suspicion. Unless, of course, you
answered, \"I carry guns because it\'s easier to shoot unarmed
handicapped children and defenseless women.\" In which case they may
look a little more closely into your background and mental state before
returning that license to you.

But, you know, I mean, apart from *that*, you really can\'t answer
wrong.
