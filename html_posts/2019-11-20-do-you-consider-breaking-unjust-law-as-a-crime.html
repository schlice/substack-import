**Do you consider breaking unjust law as a crime?**

Oh yes, breaking unjust laws is indeed a crime. Your moral judgement
about a law doesn't change the law's criminality.

However, if I find a law to be immoral (which is why it would be
unjust), I have to make the mental calculation that says that it is more
important for me to act *morally* than it is for me to act *legally*.

This means (and this is the *really* important part) that my moral code,
which *insists* that I act unlawfully, informs me that **I will accept
the consequences of my actions.**

Yes, you can be charged with a crime for breaking an unjust law. But
morally, you know that you did the right thing, even if the law says
otherwise.
