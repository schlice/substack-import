nailed this one. I just want to help clarify some of the process.

The process for the hospital to get paid happens after you are triaged,
not before. They will find out if you have insurance, and if you do not,

programs. If you are not, they will help you get enrolled if you are
eligible. If you are ineligible for any assistance, you can still be
treated, but you must agree that you are responsible for the bill.
