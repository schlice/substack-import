Impeachment is not a judicial function, but a legislative one. Even
though the Chief Justice presides over the trial in the Senate,
impeachment and its subsequent trial is not a judicial process.
Therefore, it is unclear specifically who would preside over the trial.

Congress appoints the Supreme Court, and Congress would preside over
them. The House would draft Articles of Impeachment, and the Senate
would hold a trial, which presumably would be presided over by a judge.
Normally that judge would be the Chief Justice, but if it is the Chief
Justice who was being impeached, I don't know who would preside over
that trial.

Since it is not a judicial process but instead controlled entirely by
the Senate, the Senate can vote on how to proceed, and can vote on how
the trial is conducted. In President Clinton's impeachment trial, the
Senate decided on a trial end date, whether or not to allow House
prosecutors to depose witnesses, and whether or not to hear live witness
testimony. Senators can make these decisions either through unanimous
consent or by voting on a proposal put forth by Senate leadership. So
this means then that the Senate can determine their own method of
proceeding, and it is likely that the Senate would vote on who would
preside over the trial of the Chief Justice.

Section 1 of Article 3 of the Constitution says:

> The judicial Power of the United States, shall be vested in one
> supreme Court, and in such inferior Courts as the Congress may from
> time to time ordain and establish. The Judges, both of the supreme and
> inferior Courts, shall hold their Offices during good Behavior, and
> shall, at stated Times, receive for their Services a Compensation
> which shall not be diminished during their Continuance in Office.

Only two times in US history has a Supreme Court justice been impeached.
One justice was impeached but not convicted, and one justice resigned
under the threat of impeachment. Justice Samuel Chase was impeached but
not convicted in 1804, and in 1969, Justice Abe Fortas resigned under
threat of impeachment.

*(EDIT) The question was not accurately worded, so I clarified my
answer.*
