**Should Trump sue Biden for libel? Biden referenced a sub-report which
the President was not brief on, but Biden said he was. That's libel, in
spreading lies.**

Political speech is in a special protected class all by itself. In
general, political speech is not subject to the same libel and
defamation provisions that other, non-political speech is.

In 1964, the Supreme Court heard the case of *New York Times v.
Sullivan,* which found a very large "Constitutional problem" in
subjecting speech about public officials to common law defamation
liability. The court held that Alabama common law (and thus all common
law in all states) was "constitutionally deficient for failure to
provide the safeguards for freedom of speech and of the press that are
required by the First and Fourteenth Amendments in a libel action
brought by a public official against critics of his official conduct."
These safeguards are necessary, the Court said, to protect and advance
the "profound national commitment to the principle that debate on public
issues should be uninhibited, robust, and wide-open, and that it may
well include vehement, caustic, and sometimes unpleasantly sharp attacks
on government and public officials." These safeguards were necessary in
order to protect the sometimes factually incorrect political speech
about public officials which is "inevitable in free debate." If we
don't, then we may find that politicians will self-censor for fear of
liability.

The Court held that "constitutional guarantees require . . . a federal
rule that prohibits a public official from recovering damages for a
defamatory falsehood relating to his official conduct unless he proves
that the statement was made with actual malice," or "with knowledge that
it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not."

The Court, in subsequent years, went on to expand this "actual malice
standard" for political speech and included cases brought by public
figures themselves.

**TL;DR: Trump would have to prove that Biden made that statement with
"actual malicious intent" or "with no knowledge that it was false or
with reckless disregard for the truth" which is a very high bar to clear
politically.**
