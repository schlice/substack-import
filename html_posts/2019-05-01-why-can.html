**Why can't we, as citizens of our own country, file a lawsuit to
prosecute politicians for breaking international law?**

US citizens are not bound by international law. Therefore, you cannot
prosecute politicians for violations of international law because it's
not a prosecutable offense in US courts.

**Why don't courts recognize international law so citizens could file a
lawsuit to prosecute politicians for breaking international law?**

Courts do not recognize international law because courts have no
jurisdiction over international law. US courts are only authorized to
interpret the constitutionality of US laws. International law is not
controlled, nor administered, by the United States, and therefore is not
under the purview of the United States.
