**Content:** [Suppressive fire. That\'s the only situation that makes
sense. Get lots of bullets downrange, don\'t much care where they land.
Full auto is a very poor mode in which to shoot an M-16 rifle. With a
cyclic firing rate of 700-950 rounds/min (depending on model), you can
empty a standard 30-round magazine in just a few seconds (1.89-2.57),
and accuracy is terrible.\
\
The M-16, the standard-issue rifle for the infantryman (now somewhat
being replaced by the M4, but let\'s use M-16 as an example), has not
had a \"full auto\" setting since the A2 version, when it was switched
to the more bullet-friendly \"burst\" mode, which fires in a three-round
burst instead of full-auto. So in burst mode, you pull the trigger, fire
three rounds, re-aim, and pull the trigger again. You can still get lots
of bullets downrange and you can be slightly more accurate with their
placement. In burst mode it now takes ten trigger pulls to empty a
magazine instead of one. You can still empty the magazine in almost the
same amount of time (if you choose), but you can\'t simply hold down the
trigger and \"spray and pray\" anymore.]{.rendered_qtext}
