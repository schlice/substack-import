I think
[[Bee](https://www.quora.com/profile/Bee-1625)]{.qlink_container} is
right on the money.

They probably want you near a computer because they want you to either
join an online conference, or they want you to open a website and view a
document. Perhaps they want to send you email and they want you to open
that content while you're on the phone.

So your call will clearly come in on the device they told you, they
probably want you near the computer so you can do something else during
your interview.

I recommend you do what you're asked.
