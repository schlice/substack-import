See, here's the thing.

All these women are out there campaigning for a sex strike until someone
brings *Roe* back. First, before I go any further, *Roe* is dead. That
law is now in the history books, just like *Plessy v. Ferguson* was when
*Brown v. Board* came along and overturned it. *Roe* is dead, and the
courts will never make it a right again. The people can, but the courts
cannot.

Anyway, these women and this sex strike. You see, they're out there
saying that we should have a sex strike because that'll make men relent
and re-enact *Roe*.

The subtext there is that they are implying that somehow, *men enjoy sex
more than women do. Women can hold out; men can't.*

The thing is: **they're right.** ***And feminism has been lying to them
about that for the past 50 years.***

For decades, feminists have been told that they are equal to men in all
things! Including their sex drive! Women can enjoy sex just as much as
men can! Women have been told that their sexual nature is no different
from male sexual nature---just as men can enjoy sex with no commitment
and even anonymous sex, so can women. Women, feminism insisted, have
been socialized into believing such sex does not accord with their
nature.

Ask women if their sexual natures are identical to a man's, and you'll
likely find that most of them will tell you that they are. They'll say
that their inborn sex drive is identical to a man's. In fact, the more
college-educated they are, the more they will deny that there is any
difference between the sex drive of the sexes.

But yet here they are, clamoring for a sex strike to force men to
relent, because somehow, despite what they've been told for the past 50
years, men desire sex more than women.

The implication here is huge, and the irony is so thick, you can cut it
with a knife. With regard to the sexes, **most of what women have fought
for has benefitted men and hurt women.**

Brainwashing women into believing that their sexual nature was identical
to a man's only benefitted men.

The hookup culture only benefitted men.

And abortion as a form of birth control definitely benefited men. Just
ask anyone who has worked at a Planned Parenthood or a crisis pregnancy
center how many young women showed up there *because their boyfriends
pressured them into being there*. Abortion on demand meant men could
have sex with as many women as they chose with zero consequences.
Abortion on demand meant men don't have to pay child support.

The irony is that the "right" that you've been championing benefitted
men more than it benefitted you.

And you bought the lie; hook, line and sinker.

Do you support the sex strike over Rowe v. Wade? How long do you think
it will take before the complete lack of feminist sex partners bring the
anti-abortionists to their knees (figuratively)?
