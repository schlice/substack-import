**What and when did the right allow themselves to become fully
indoctrinated by the Trump administration's rhetoric to the point
they\'ve given up science and logic?**

I suppose if you can show how "the right has given up science and logic"
then maybe this question can be answered. But without more detail, we
cannot answer this question other than to say "the right (whoever
specifically that is) has not given up science and/or logic."

In fact, I'd go so far as to say "the right is **more** invested in
science and/or logic than the left."

Now let's see who can back up those statements.

(EDIT) I have left comments open, but I'm literally not going to debate
every stupid thing Trump has ever said. Trump is not a politician. He
doesn't have a practiced vocabulary. He is not an orator like Obama.

Instead, let's focus on *policy*. What policies has Trump implemented
which have abandoned science and logic? What has he **done**, not what
has he **said**, which has abandoned science and logic? At the end of
the day, a blowhard is a blowhard, and we know Trump is bombastic, and
his brain-to-mouth filter shut off decades ago. And he was elected that
way, so retroactively criticizing him for his run-on mouth is
unjustified. So let's instead focus on what makes sense: the policies he
has implemented which abandoned science or logic.

Please don't bother telling me what Trump *said*. Show me what Trump
*did* to make your point.

(EDIT 2) And if you're going to show me what he did, then do so, but
make sure that it violates **science** or **logic**. Share your logical
syllogism for what you are stating violates logic. Violating logic
doesn't mean, "Trump is just so...illogical!" That's not a violation of
logic. Violations of logic fail logical syllogism calculations.
