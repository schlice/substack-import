Since you didn't provide any context or source links, I used The Google,
but the only thing I could find was an officer holding a black man at
gunpoint for nine minutes during the course of a traffic stop.

[[Calif. police defend officer who pointed gun at passenger for 9
minutes during traffic
stop](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=2c6e23&url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2017/08/07/video-shows-officer-point-gun-passenger-9-minutes-during-traffic-stop/544268001/){.external_link

The body cam footage backs up what the officer claimed, which was when
the female driver was asked for her license and registration, and as the
occupants were looking for the documents, the male passenger began to
reach underneath his seat.

It was at this time that the officer perceived the threat from the male
passenger reaching under his seat, and he drew his firearm. He held the
occupants of the vehicle at gunpoint for nine minutes, until backup
arrived. They were stuck in traffic, which is what led to the extended
amount of time.

The incident ended normally. The driver was released without incident.

What is my opinion of this? They should do a better job alleviating
traffic congestion in California.
