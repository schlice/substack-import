**Can the president take personal, direct operational command of the
military out in the field?**

*Can* he? Yes, he can. He is the Commander-in-Chief. If he actually
chose to do something like that, he could.

*Would* he? No way in hell.

Besides being advised by **every single aide and military
representative, including every Chief of Staff and even his own
SecDef**, to not do such a thing, it would be *political suicide* to do
it, even if he was correct.

The President knows his place. He gives orders, and his generals carry
them out. He doesn't do the generals' jobs, just as he expects the
generals to not do his job, and when they presume to do his job, he
fires them.
