**Can the government suspend the constitution & violate human rights
during wartime?**

*(US answer)*

In short, no.

The Constitution is never suspended, and the power of martial law is
actually laid out in the Constitution:

> *The Privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended,
> unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may
> require it.*

*Habeas corpus* is the right to a hearing when being lawfully
imprisoned. More broadly, it is the oversight by the judiciary of law
enforcement. The imposition of martial law suspends habeas corpus, and
allows law enforcement to imprison people without due process in order
to quell insurrections or invasions. Martial law is also governed by
several notable Supreme Court decisions, as well as the *Posse Comitatus
Act*, which prevents the military from enforcing civilian laws without
Congressional approval.

The Constitution remains in full force and effect even during periods of
martial law.

Additionally, human rights in general are not defined in the
Constitution, unless you're referring to the Bill of Rights as "human
rights." Human rights existed before the Constitution, and would still
exist even if "the Constitution was suspended."
