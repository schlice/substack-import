**If public law requires that a business have handicapped spaces near
entrances on business parking lots, does that mean the business is
giving law enforcement agencies permission to give tickets or tow
vehicles without handicap plates or tags?**

No. The business cannot grant permission, the business cannot similarly
revoke permission. Only the city has permission to enforce its laws as
it sees fit. The city requires the business to designate handicapped
spaces, and the city retains the authority to enforce that statute.
