**What\'s the best way to deter package thieves?**

While I absolutely love [[Mark

for years, and I totally love the glitter bomb, it's just not practical
for us. Plus, *we actually have to get packages and stuff.*

So there are a few ways to deter package thieves.

1.  Neighbors
2.  Sign for your packages
3.  A service which acts as a drop-off location
4.  Direct the delivery company to deliver your package when you'll be
    home
5.  A package locker on your porch.

**Neighbors.** If you have neighbors who will be home during the day,
work out an agreement with them that packages be delivered to them.
Sometimes, delivery services won't drop off packages to others,
especially if you have to sign for them, but in many cases, you can
leave specific delivery instructions on the carrier's website and they
will honor them. Alternatively, your neighbors can simply keep an eye
out for packages delivered outside your door and grab them up to deliver
to you when you're home. I work from home, so I actually have this
agreement with my neighbors.

**Sign for your packages**. In many cases, you can elect to sign for
your packages. If you're not home to sign, the carrier will hold your
package for you and attempt re-delivery. You can also go to the local
distribution center and manually retrieve your package. It's a hassle,
but you won't lose your packages to porch pirates.

**A service which acts as a drop-off location.** If you rent a PO box
from a location like [[Postal
Annex](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=64a074&url=https://www.postalannex.com/){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="postalannex.com"}]{.qlink_container}, [[The UPS
Store](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=d2b497&url=https://www.theupsstore.com/){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="theupsstore.com"}]{.qlink_container}, or a similar location
near you, they will receive any packages you send to your PO box, sign
for them, and hold them for you to pick up. It may be more convenient
than driving to the distribution center to retrieve your packages, but
there is a mailbox rental fee.

**Direct the delivery company to deliver your package when you'll be
home.** You can also pay a little extra with UPS, for example, and tell
them when during the day you want your package delivered. In that way,
you can ensure that you'll be home when your package is delivered.

**A package locker on your porch.** This one costs a little bit up
front, but it might work just as well. You'll want to buy a locking bin.
Something that looks nice but fits on your porch, such as the outdoor
storage bins you can buy from the big box home improvement stores, or on
Amazon. Something like this:

[[Keter 233705 55 Gallon Outdoor Rattan Style Storage
Cube](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=1ec654&url=https://www.amazon.com/Keter-233705-Gallon-Outdoor-Storage/dp/B06VV9LVNL){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="amazon.com"}]{.qlink_container}

This one is a little smaller and doesn't have a locking mechanism, so
you'd have to add a *hasp* and a padlock. This is an example of a hasp:

[[Alise MS99-B Padlock Hasp Door Clasp Hasp Latch
Lock](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=81aa91&url=https://www.amazon.com/Alise-MS99-B-Padlock-Clasp-Stainless/dp/B075TV4H98){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="amazon.com"}]{.qlink_container}

There are some other, larger patio storage boxes which have built-in
hasps.

To use this method:

- Place the box on your porch. Optionally, use a cable lock to secure
  the box to your house. If the box is big enough though, it will
  naturally deter porch pirates.
- Leave an open padlock inside the box, and leave the box open.
- Instruct your carrier to drop your parcel in the box and lock it. You
  can do this with a note on your door, but it is preferred that you do
  this in the carrier's system. UPS and FedEx both allow you to edit
  your delivery and add delivery instructions.

(EDIT) Amazon has some unique ways to stop porch pirates:

**Amazon Lockers**. These lockers are available in most cities around
the country. When you place your order, you can direct Amazon to deliver
it to an Amazon Locker location near you. When your item is delivered,
you will receive notification of the delivery. You then visit the
locker, use your phone to generate a code, enter the code on the keypad,
and the locker with your package pops open for you to pick up.

**Amazon Key**. This is a bit more of a high-tech solution, but it
actually works (I've used it). It requires a garage with an
Internet-connected smart hub (such as Chamberlain's MyQ system), and an
Internet-accessible camera in your garage (many brands are supported---I
use Amazon's Blink cameras in my garage). Once you've enabled the system
in your Amazon profile, you can elect to have your item delivered by Key
Delivery. When the driver arrives at your house, he clicks a button on
his phone which sends a signal to your garage hub to open the door. The
driver places your item in your garage, and then clicks another button
on his phone to close your garage door. You can watch the entire process
on your camera.
