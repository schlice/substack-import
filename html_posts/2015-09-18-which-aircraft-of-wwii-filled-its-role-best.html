**Content:** [We spend our time talking about American and British
aircraft, which were stellar, but we do forget sometimes to talk about
the German aircraft which were producing some pretty impressive numbers
themselves.\
\
The Luftwaffe was producing aces with some pretty impressive kill
numbers in planes like the Messerschmitt Me-109, the Focke-Wulf Fw-190
and the Messerschmitt Me-262. 99 different German pilots tallied over
100 kills ***each*** in these airframes. The Luftwaffe was a fighting
force to be reckoned with.\
\
The clear leader on the kill board was Major Erich Hartmann, the \"Black
Devil of the Ukraine.\" Hartmann tallied an unmatched 352 victories. All
but seven of them were Russian. Major Gerhard Barkhorn was next on the
leaderboard with 301 kills.\
\
The RAF had its work cut out for it defending against the Luftwaffe, but
Air Chief Marshal Sir Hugh Dowding did just that. His ingenious early
warning radar stations were able to detect approaching German aircraft
and pass their intel back to Fighter Command to task out Hurricanes or
Spitfires. After the Battle of Britain, Prime Minister Winston Churchill
made his famous remark, \"Never in the field of human conflict has so
much been owed by so many to so few,\" as he spoke of the RAF pilots.
And they were incredible. The one example that stands out in my mind is
the \"indestructible\" Al Deere. He was shot down ***seven times*** and
survived two mid-air collisions. He ended the war with 22
kills.]{.rendered_qtext}
