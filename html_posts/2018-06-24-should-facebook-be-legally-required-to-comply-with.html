**Should Facebook be legally required to comply with the first amendment
and stop banning people for breaking its community guidelines?**

Short answer: no, because they are not bound by the 1st Amendment.

The 1st Amendment says generally that government cannot make a law
banning speech. It says nothing about how a private business writes its
Terms and Conditions as well as its User Agreement as to how people use
the system.

Facebook is a private business, not a government agency. It is under no
obligation to allow you to say anything you like on its platform, and it
can indeed ban people for speech it doesn't like. If that weren't the
case, Quora wouldn't be allowed to have a [[BNBR
policy](https://www.quora.com/What-is-Quoras-Be-Nice-Be-Respectful-policy)]{.qlink_container},
and wouldn't be able to enforce it.

You may have a First Amendment right to speak, but that doesn't mean you
can walk into Walmart and start using racial epithets and slurs simply
because you *can*. You'd better believe that Walmart will ask you to
leave, and will call the police if you don't, and they would not be
violating your First Amendment rights for doing so.

Now, if you go out to the street corner and say the same thing, you'd
definitely have a First Amendment right to do so. You might get your ass
beat as well, but that would be the natural consequence of such
language. Not to say that violence is justified, but it might be the
natural follow-on to that kind of speech.
