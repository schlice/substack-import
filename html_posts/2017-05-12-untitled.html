*The person falsely shouting 'fire' in a crowded theater is not engaged
in a first amendment right, as he is engaged in a willful assault. He
ends up punished for it.*

This is not what the question asked. The question says "If the Second
Amendment means what it says," which implies that it is an absolute
right, not subject to any reasonable restrictions. The corollary was
designed to show that no rights are absolute. A right can be restricted
or curtailed if there is a compelling state interest to do so, and if
the restriction is implemented in the least restrictive way possible.

If the First Amendment means what it says, I can say anything I want, at
any time I want, with no restrictions, which includes shouting "Fire" in
a crowded theater, even when there is no fire, because I have a First
Amendment-protected right to free speech. I don't "intend" to start a
mad stampede in which people may get hurt; that's up to them. I'm just
exercising my rights to speak in whatever way I choose, wherever I
choose. In order to be convicted of criminal assault, there must still
be *mens rea*, and if I don't have it, I'm not guilty of criminal
assault.

Of course, this is not true, because while the right to speak is
protected, the manner in which speech is conducted is important, as well
as to whom the speech is directed, whether or not it is truthful, and
whether or not it causes harm. These things can, in fact, be criminal.
Therefore, the right to speak is not absolute.

Accordingly, the Second Amendment says that the "keeping" (owning) and
"bearing" (carrying) of arms shall not be infringed. It doesn't say
anything about pointing and using, which are normally crimes, and are
constitutional as crimes. Therefore, the right to keep and bear arms in
whatever way and in whatever location and manner you choose is also not
unlimited. Reasonable restrictions are legal, and make sense in order to
maintain an ordered society.
