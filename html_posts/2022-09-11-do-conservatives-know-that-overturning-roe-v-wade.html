Nowhere in the Constitution can you find a **standard** for
"born-alive." There is no statement in the Constitution, nor in the
Amendments, that establishes such a principle. Yes, it is true that the
14th Amendment is intended to grant citizenship to all persons "born" in
the United States. But the goal of that Amendment was to grant
citizenship to *recently freed slaves*, not to define that you have to
be "born" before you become a citizen.

And actually, case law tends to speak against "born-alive" as a legal
standard, since even before *Roe* was overturned, 38 states had **fetal
homicide** laws. Laws such as the Fetal Protection Act, the Preborn
Victims of Violence Act and the Unborn Victim of Violence Act prove that
most of the country agrees that you do not have to be a born citizen in
order to receive the rights conferred to all "citizens" under the 14th
Amendment.

Additionally, "citizenship" is not a determining factor when deciding
whether or not Constitutional protections are afforded to a person.
Indeed, mere presence in the United States affords a person the equal
protection of the law.

Also, it has been the goal of many conservatives to pass a "citizenship
amendment" that would make pre-born people "citizens" and declare that
they are also covered by all of the Constitution's protections,
including the right to not have your life taken without due process of
law. If there was some Constitutional standard (either viability or
born-alive), no such amendment would be necessary.

Finally, the *Dobbs* decision **only affected abortions and nothing
else.** Gorsuch's concurrence even stated this explicitly, because the
dissent was so vehement that other opinions like *Obergefell* were now
in the crosshairs (mostly because Clarence Thomas alluded to the fact
that other holdings were similar to *Dobbs*). *Dobbs* is about stating
that there is no Constitutional right to an abortion, full stop.
