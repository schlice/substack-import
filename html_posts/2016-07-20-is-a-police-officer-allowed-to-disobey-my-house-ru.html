It depends on a few things.

First, did you call them? If you called them and then you're refusing to
let them into your home, they will likely turn around and leave.

If you didn't call them, what they do will depend on whether or not
***exigent circumstances*** exist. Exigent circumstances allow police to
break open doors and enter spaces which would normally require a warrant
if they believe that a person's life is in danger. If exigent
circumstances exist, I'm going in. Period. We can discuss your religious
requirements later.

If I am there because I need to question you, I can either go into your
house, or we can go down to the police station to get questioned. Your
choice.

For me, for the third circumstance (I'm questioning you at your home, no
exigent circumstances exist), I happen to carry a pair of shoe covers in
my cargo pocket, the same kinds of shoe covers that most professionals
who frequently enter homes will carry and use in lieu of removing their
shoes. Some people dislike shoes in their house because of sanitary, not
religious, reasons, and sometimes this is acceptable to people. If
you're concerned about my shoes in your house, your choice is that I put
my shoe covers on and I come in your house, or I take you down to the
station to question you. Your choice.
