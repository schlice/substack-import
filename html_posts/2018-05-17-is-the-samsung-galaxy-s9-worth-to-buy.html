**Should I buy a Samsung Galaxy S9? Is it worth it to buy that phone?**

I will defer to [[Lewis
Hilsenteger](https://www.quora.com/topic/Lewis-Hilsenteger-1)]{.qlink_container}'s
opinion on that topic. Lew hosts the popular YouTube channel, "[[Unbox
Therapy](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=1f2b69&url=https://www.youtube.com/user/unboxtherapy){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="youtube.com"}]{.qlink_container}," where he discusses
technology trends and does device reviews.

Lew has been using a Pixel 2 XL for quite some time because he is
enamored with its camera. In fact, he has convinced several people I
know to get the Pixel 2 because of that outstanding camera. But as a
test, he started carrying and using the S9 (actually, the S9+, but the
comparison is similar). He then did a video comparing the S9+ to the
Pixel 2 XL. He went into the video without a preconception about which
device he was going to choose.

His observations are quite interesting. I'll let you watch for yourself.
