With MS, you don't know. Because you don't know which symptoms are
actually their own diseases, or which ones are caused by MS.

So a lot of the medical issues I had in my 20s, but especially bowel and
memory issues, either went undiagnosed (the brain fog), or misdiagnosed
(irritable bowel syndrome). There is a good chance that these symptoms
were actually being caused by MS.

The key is exactly what [[Wendy
Burnett](https://www.quora.com/profile/Wendy-Burnett)]{.qlink_container}
mentioned: early diagnosis and treatment. When I was diagnosed with MS,
the guidelines said that you couldn't be conclusively diagnosed unless
you had two symptoms disseminated by time and space; time being at least
six months, and space being separate body systems. At the time, I only
had one symptom and a positive MRI. This was not enough to conclusively
be diagnosed as MS; it was called "probable MS."

However, if you start on the MS medication when you are only "probable,"
you are essentially "admitting" to the medical world that you *do* have
MS, which also means admitting to your insurance carriers (medical,
life, etc) that you have MS, which could potentially have some financial
impact. So there may be incentive to delay the start of treatment. But,
the "conservative" approach is to "conserve" as much brain tissue as
possible, which would mean getting on medication right away, even if the
"probable" diagnosis would essentially be converted to a "definite"
diagnosis simply by ordering the medication.

My doctor wisely advised me to start on the medication right away. As it
turns out, since my diagnosis, researchers have discovered that earlier
treatment does, in fact, delay the onset of advanced courses of the
disease, such as Secondary Progressive MS. In other words, the sooner
you start on the medication, the longer that advanced courses of the
disease will take to appear. Also, the clinical guidelines for
diagnosing MS have changed since I was diagnosed. With more faith in the
accuracy of MRI readings, you can now be clinically diagnosed with MS
with one symptom and a positive MRI.
