I\'m certain we will have some input from Congress sometime soon.

But this isn\'t a matter for Congress yet. It\'s a matter for the
courts. The courts provided a lawful order, ***the same kind of lawful
order Apple has complied with in the past, and the same kind of lawful
order the court will issue tomorrow.***

Manufacturers have written all kinds of new code to aid law enforcement.
They\'ve even built completely new devices to support law enforcement.
The Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA) was
written specifically to ensure that telecommunications systems remained
open to wiretapping for law enforcement. CALEA-capable listening
equipment exists at all of the cell phone carriers\' switching centers
for law enforcement use. These devices had to be specially designed to
decrypt digital cell calls so that they could be wiretapped, and these
devices are only used by law enforcement.

Apple is attempting to appeal to a slippery slope argument, when they
have already helped law enforcement unlock locked iPhones in the past,
and they will continue to do so as long as they are able. It\'s part of
being an American company and being good corporate citizens assisting
law enforcement in the discharge of their duties. It\'s certainly
**not** without precedent.
