**Content:** [I\'ll start with MS, and move to Parkinson\'s. With MS,
the short answer is: it depends. MS affects everyone who has it
differently, so there is no easy answer about what a MS patient cannot
do. Some of the most common symptoms of MS include vision loss, muscle
weakness, and memory and cognition problems, but again, those are common
problems. MS can manifest itself differently in different people.\
\
With Parkinson\'s, the short answer is the same, but Parkinson\'s
produces gradual degradation in the patient\'s ability to perform gross
motor movements. So eventually, Parkinson\'s patients will be unable to
walk or talk.]{.rendered_qtext}
