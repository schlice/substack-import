You have a lot of people telling you "because the Bible says so!" While
that's true, it's very unhelpful, isn't it.

You also have a lot of people telling you "they're all cults, especially
those Christians. It may be the biggest cult in the world, but it's
still a cult." That's not helpful, either.

What you really asked is, "With all the religions out there, how can
Christians know that they possess the one true religion?"

While it's a really difficult question, it's not a difficult answer, but
it does require quite a bit of explanation, so I'll apologize in advance
for the length of this answer. But serious questions deserve serious,
well-reasoned answers, wouldn't you say?

outstanding job of encapsulating all of the logic surrounding how we
know a creator God exists, and that the creator God who does exist is
the God of the Bible. I'll start with their work, and I'll add to it.

So we've narrowed down the fact that a Creator God exists, and the God
of Judaism, Islam, and Christianity matches the creation, as a
reflection of the Creator. But which religion is correct?

It turns out that the Christian God of the Bible matches all of the
characteristics we just listed: He is supernatural (Genesis 1:1),
powerful (Jeremiah 32:17), eternal (Psalm 90:2), necessary (Exodus 3:14)
omnipresent (Psalm 139:7), timeless/changeless (Malachi 3:6), immaterial
(John 5:24), personal (Genesis 3:9), necessary (Colossians 1:17),
infinite/singular (Jeremiah 23:24, Deuteronomy 6:4), diverse yet with
unity (Matthew 28:19), intelligent (Psalm 147:4-5), purposeful (Jeremiah
29:11, Psalm 19:1-4), moral (Daniel 9:14), and caring (1 Peter 5:6-7).

I know this was long, but take the time to pore through it. It's
logical, and the only time I discussed the Bible was when I compared the
creator God (which we proved exists) to the remaining monotheistic
religions to find out which one describes the God who actually created
us.
