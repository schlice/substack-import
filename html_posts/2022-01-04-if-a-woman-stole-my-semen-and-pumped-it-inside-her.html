The answer is yes, you are. If it is your biological child, you are
responsible for paying child support.

Let's take this hypothetical a step further. What if you (man) are raped
(by a woman) at gunpoint and she gets pregnant --- do you still have to
pay child support? The answer to this is also yes.

Remember that child support is not about punishing anyone --- that's
what criminal and/or civil charges are for. Child support falls outside
of the realm of the courts as it is mandated by the state in order to
care for the child. Child support isn't about punishing the man or
enriching the woman --- it's about caring for the child. The state has a
compelling interest in caring for the child, so they mandate that the
two biological entities who created the child pay for that child's
upbringing.

The only time this is different is if you donated sperm to a sperm bank.
Any children created out of that sperm are not associated with you, and
you do not owe child support for those children.
