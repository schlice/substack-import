Short answer: no.

Longer answer: The "gun show loophole" does not exist. First of all,
private party sales usually do not take place at a "gun show." And a
"loophole" would be a way to follow the law but get an outcome the law
was trying to prevent. Allowing private party sales without a background
check was a specifically-authorized provision in the Gun Control Act.
They did not want to make it so onerous on private party transactions,
since only gun dealers can perform background checks. You can force all
transactions, commercial or private, to go through a dealer with a
Federal Firearms License (and indeed, some states have already done
this), but the Federal law says that private party transactions do not
require a background check. That's the "loophole" that the anti-gun
crowd is erroneously pointing out. It's not a loophole, it was
intentional.

If I'm a gun dealer at a gun show, I will perform a background check on
any person buying a gun. But what if I were to see that buyer (and I'm
another visitor, not a dealer), and I tell that guy that I have a gun in
my car that I'd like to sell him, and we walk out to my car and I sell
him that gun, I don't need to perform a background check. It's a private
party sale. Did that take place at a gun show? Well, in the parking lot,
not necessarily within the show itself. Since this sometimes happens (I
mean, where better to find people who want to buy guns?), the anti-gun
crowd hoisted the erroneous mantle of "gun shows are where you can buy
guns without a background check."
