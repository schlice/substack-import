**How will Trump keep the IRS from releasing his tax return now that
HW&M Chair has formally requested them under 6103 (audit sitting
president) as part of its program oversight responsibility? Does the IRS
need Trump\'s permission? Auditing**

First of all, IRS rule 6103(f) is not about auditing a sitting
president. It's about oversight over the IRS.

Congress can audit the IRS to ensure that they're doing their job. They
do this by collecting certain tax returns and making sure that if the
IRS did an audit, did they do it for the right reasons, and if they
didn't do an audit, that they failed to audit for the right reasons.

Contrary to what you may have heard in the mainstream media, this is all
about the IRS, and not about Trump. At least, that's what 6103(f) is
*supposed* to be about.

Congress is required to keep these tax returns confidential. However,
should another member of Congress get to see those returns, *they* could
release them because the seal of confidentiality has already been
broken.

I think the risk is too great to the President to not go down without a
fight.

So what will the President do? His personal legal team will file for an
injunction, requesting that the IRS not disclose those returns until
sufficient cause for each piece of information is given, and sufficient
proof is given that the returns can be kept confidential without being
leaked.

I say they do it just as they do with any classified documentation: no
electronic devices in the room, no paper in or out, you can come in and
view the documents, but you must leave them there, etc., any disclosure
will be severely punished, etc.
