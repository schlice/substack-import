**If you must carry a gun in the US in order to feel "safe," why would
you continue to live here, if you had the option of living in a country
where that type of armed vigilance is not only unnecessary, but a daily
waste of time and energy?**

I suppose that if the only reason you carried a gun was to "feel safe,"
you would probably want to move somewhere where you "felt more safe."
This only makes sense.

But your assertion that "vigilance is unnecessary and is a daily waste
of time" is foolhardy in any country. I can apply that statement to any
country in the world. Any. One. Name it, and I'll show you why vigilance
is not only necessary, but it is the one thing that will prevent you
from becoming a statistic.

The United States is unique in the world. People love to compare the
United States to places like Norway or even the UK, where it "seems"
like crime is less and no one needs to carry a gun. But any such
comparison is an apples and oranges comparison. Populations in those
countries are largely homogeneous, and it is a much smaller population
than the US. In the US, we have over 300 million people and the
population is an incredible mix of people from all over the world.
Additionally, the United States was created on a foundation of
*independence*, fierce independence and an attitude which states that I
can do anything I set my mind to, and I don't need anyone's help.

That attitude extends to my own defense (and the defense of others in my
care). In fact, in the United States, the Supreme Court has stated many
times that the police have no duty to protect you. The police cannot be
there to prevent all crime. They are not your personal bodyguards. Your
security is your responsibility, no one else.

Additionally, I would argue that *the gun creates a civilized society*.
Without the gun, I am at the mercy of those who are physically stronger
than me, younger than me, and who outnumber me. It is the tyranny of the
strong, the young, and the many. The gun is the only tool which can
equalize that *force inequality*. The gun is equally as effective in the
hands of an octogenarian as it is in the hands of a weightlifter. It is
the only tool which puts the old man on par with the young gangbanger.
It is the only tool which puts the young woman on par with her male
attacker. And it is the only tool which puts the gay man on par with the
car full of baseball-wielding drunk frat boys. When I carry a gun, I
cannot be forced to do anything. I can only be reasoned with.

To that end, I do not carry a gun because I am afraid. I carry a gun
because it allows me to be unafraid. I do not carry a gun because I want
confrontation. I carry a gun because I want to be left alone. Since the
gun removes force from the equation, left in its wake is only reason.
The most civilized society only employs reason, not force. Therefore,
*carrying a gun is the most civilized thing you can do.*
