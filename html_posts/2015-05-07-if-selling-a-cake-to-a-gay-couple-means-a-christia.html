**Content:** [**False equivalency**. Selling situations are completely
different. Selling something that requires skill and personal
involvement, something you craft with love and passion, is far different
than scanning a barcode and running a credit card.\
\
If I\'m a Walmart checkout clerk and I \"sell\" someone (to the extent
that a Walmart checkout clerk \"sells\" things) rat poison and they go
home and feed it to their kids and they die, did the Walmart checkout
clerk participate in the murder?\
\
I suppose it depends on your definition of \"participate.\" If you
consider \"selling someone the tools that, unbeknownst to you, they use
to commit a crime,\" then I suppose they did. Thankfully, the law
doesn\'t take your position.\
\
Most store clerks (including Christian gun shop owners) aren\'t building
custom items specifically for you. They\'re not handcrafting a special
item of significance related specifically to a special day that has
great social and political significance. They\'re just selling you
something that someone else made. They are probably leaving the box
sealed, too. Well, maybe they do a quality check before it goes out the
door, but they have no emotional involvement in that sale. There\'s no
handcrafted gun that they\'re making. But even if there was, the law
doesn\'t take the view that the person who sold it has any
responsibility for how the buyer uses it.\
\
So if I\'m a Christian baker and you come to me and want a cake for your
gay wedding, and I sell you an off-the-shelf Entenmann\'s boxed cake (I
don\'t even open the seal), I would consider myself to not have
participated in the wedding.\
\
If I sold you a cake for your kid\'s birthday, and you went home and
force-fed it to your kid and they went into a sugar coma and died, would
I be complicit in the murder? Again, assuming I didn\'t know you were
going to force-feed it to your kids in such a quantity as to cause a
sugar coma. The answer is no.\
\
Hopefully these examples help to illustrate the false
equivalency.]{.rendered_qtext}
