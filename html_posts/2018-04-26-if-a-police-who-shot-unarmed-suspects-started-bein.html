**If a police who shot unarmed suspects started being killed in
retribution by friends and family en masse, what would happen?**

It sounds like "your version" of what happened is all that matters.
However, the only person whose voice matters is the judge (and the jury
as one voice).

As we've said a bzillion times on Quora, ***unarmed does not equal not
dangerous***. Just because a person is unarmed does not mean that he
cannot cause grave bodily injury, and police are under no obligation to
incur grave bodily injury simply because a person is not in possession
of a physical weapon. If that were the case, and police were not
authorized to shoot anyone without a weapon, criminals would immediately
dump their weapons and they'd know that they could not be shot
(legally).

But that's all beside the point since that's not what you asked. You
asked what would happen if mobs of civilians started murdering police
officers because they felt that police actions (and court rulings) were
"unjust." It kills me when families get on television after a trial and
say that "justice was not served." What they really mean is that
***revenge*** *was not served.* Justice was, however, served. If a fair
trial took place and the officer was found not guilty, then justice is
served. You may not like the outcome, but that's not the basis of
justice. The family is instead looking for a *pound of flesh* to atone
for the death of their relative. They want *retribution*, not *justice*.

So to answer the question: if mobs of civilians started murdering police
officers because they felt that police actions (and court rulings) were
"unjust," martial law would follow, and you'd really get to see what a
"police state" looked like.
