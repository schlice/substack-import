You've actually listed two different things:

1.  Willing your body to stop working, or willing your heart to stop
    beating
2.  "Broken Heart Syndrome"

You can't *will* your body to stop working. Your autonomic nervous
system is impervious to shutdown. That said, the vagus nerve is
susceptible to *influence*, to wit, we can calm our minds and in turn,
slow our breathing and in turn, slow our heart rate.

But you cannot, through sheer force of will, make you heart stop
beating, or shut off your autonomic nervous system. Your body's will to
live is greater than that.

To your second point regarding the old couple, there is a phenomenon
known as "Broken Heart Syndrome" or takotsubo cardiomyopathy. It is a
reaction your heart has to a surge of stress hormones caused by an
emotionally stressful event. Broken heart syndrome causes the heart to
stop operating normally, resulting in heart failure. During these
situations, the body releases an increase of hormones, which temporarily
paralyzes your heart and limits its standard functionality.

And if this happens in an old person, who already has a weakened heart,
it is possible that they could succumb to this heart paralysis and die.

So while rare, it is possible to "die from a broken heart," but it is
not possible to stop your heart beating through sheer force of will.
