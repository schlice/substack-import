It's true that the modern Gregorian calendar was instituted in 1582 by
Pope Gregory XIII. The Gregorian calendar was a revision of the Julian
calendar, which was instituted by Julius Caesar in 46 BC. Revisions
included adding a leap year every fourth year and changing how the
holiday of Easter is determined. Today, the Gregorian calendar is used
throughout the world.

But it was the Hebrews who adopted the **lunisolar** calendar structure
before either of them. This calendar used years based on the solar year
(how long it took the earth to go around the sun), but months were based
on the phases of the moon.

Once the calendar was adopted, it was the standard used by everyone,
regardless of faith. I'm certain that atheists were taught their days of
the week songs and their months of the year songs in elementary or
primary school just like the rest of us.
