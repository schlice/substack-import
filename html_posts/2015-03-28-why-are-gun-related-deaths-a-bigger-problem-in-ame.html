Let\'s break down what you said.

*Gun laws are stricter today in America than they were during the
1950's*

This is actually ***not true****.* Gun laws have been steadily getting
more relaxed since the 50\'s. More states now have \"shall issue\" laws
for concealed carry than ever before, and unless guns are magically
disappearing, we have more guns in society than we have ever had before.

*Yet guns seem to be a bigger problem*

The key word in your sentence is \"seem\". It *appears* that guns are a
bigger problem, when in actuality, gun crime is ***down*** since its
peak in the 80\'s.

So that\'s an odd contradiction, isn\'t it? We have more lax gun laws,
we have more guns (legal and illegal) in circulation, yet gun crime has
been steadily falling since the 80\'s. So why then do you, and so many
others, believe that it\'s a bigger problem? Why does it ***appear***
bigger than it actually is?

Some of the factors that contribute to gun crime appearing to be worse
than it is:

1.  Mass media and biased reporting. We hear about every mass shooting
    incessantly until we can\'t stand it any more, but during the time
    we\'re being drilled about some mass shooting, many more murders are
    taking place which we never hear about on the national news. Why is
    that? Because we sensationalize mass shootings while we ignore
    others. This is a disturbing trend which causes us to miss the big
    picture: while guns are often the tools used to commit such crimes,
    they aren\'t always. Yet you only hear about the worst gun crimes.
    Murders are being committed every day with tools other than guns,
    but guns are the target of the discussion because they are the tool
    that is purpose-built for killing. If you take the gun away, people
    will still kill, but they will use other tools to do it. To
    illustrate that point, let me make a comparison. Let\'s say you\'re
    going to dig a hole. You could use a shovel. You could also use a
    cereal bowl or a bucket, but those things are not really designed
    for digging holes and it would probably be harder to do. You use the
    tool that is best designed for the task you are trying to
    accomplish. If you are trying to kill someone, you use a gun. You
    could also use a baseball bat, a knife, a frying pan, a chair, or a
    car, but those things aren\'t really designed for killing and it
    would probably be harder to do. The gun is just the tool. We focus
    on the gun because it\'s tangible. It\'s something we (think we) can
    regulate. But in actuality, the gun is just the scapegoat in a
    discussion about why people commit murder. The gun is not the
    problem, the person who chose it as his tool is the real. This is
    the source of that quote \"Guns don\'t kill people, people kill
    people\". Which leads me to the next factor:
2.  Downplaying of mental illness in the US. We have a mental health
    crisis in this country. We need to recognize that mental illness is
    a bigger problem in this country than it ever has been, and
    deinstitutionalization was not the way to handle it. We need more
    comprehensive mental health treatment in this country if we are ever
    going to get a handle on mass murder.
3.  Race relations. Did you know that homicide is the leading cause of
    death for young black men? And around 90% of the shooters are other
    young black men. But the narrative that the race-baiters have pushed
    (and the media happily picked up) is that young black men are dying
    because cops are shooting them. In fact, around 98% of black
    shooting deaths do not involve the police at all. Cops are around
    six times more likely to be shot by a young black man than the
    opposite. Pushing the narrative just allows the real problem to go
    unnoticed and allows the criminals to walk.

Until we start having real, candid discussions about race relations,
mental illness, and the role of mass media in our culture, people will
still believe that gun crime is a pandemic and that cops are out there
killing black kids because they\'re black.
