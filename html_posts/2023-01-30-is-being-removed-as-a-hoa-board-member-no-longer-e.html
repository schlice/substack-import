Oh gosh, no. That, to some, may be a blessing.

The worst sanctions would be if you were sued (and you were not covered
by the HOA's Director and Officer \[D&O\] insurance), or even worse, if
you had committed a crime and were arrested.

banned from attending meetings (but still allowed to keep and live in
your home) the worst sanctions you can get if you committed serious
wrongdoings against the HOA community?
