**Can a students final report card grades disappear after being entered
into the computer system, after the end of the grade reporting period?**

I'm sure that there are any number of errors that could cause a
student's grades to "disappear" from the system, but whether or not in
can happen in any given situation comes down to the individual system
that the school uses to record grades.
