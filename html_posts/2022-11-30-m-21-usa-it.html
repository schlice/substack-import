You should not join.

The simple fact of the matter is that in the military, *you are
willingly giving up your life in service to your country.*

So tell me how your logic makes sense: you're wiling to sacrifice your
life for your country, but you're not willing to sacrifice your health
for your country?

Bottom line is that when you sign up to be in the military, you are
*ceding control* of yourself to the government. Governments are
political. The military is the projection of the government's political
will. That makes the military a *political tool*.

The government in power at the time can use the military in any legal
way to project its political will. This particular government is using
the military to make gender equality statements as well as to prove to
the people that the COVID-19 vaccine is safe and effective.

They did the same to me (not with the COVID vaccine, mind you, but with
other unknown chemical substances), and as a result, I developed
multiple sclerosis.

I willingly made my choice. **And despite the risk, I'd make the same
choice again.**

*That's* what service means. If you're not ready to make that level of
commitment, you should not join.
