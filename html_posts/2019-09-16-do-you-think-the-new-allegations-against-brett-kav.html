**Do you think the new allegations against Brett Kavanaugh in the book,
\"The Education of Brett Kavanaugh\" are true?**

Do you remember Christine Blasey Ford's testimony? Did you think that
was true?

This claim has *even less* evidence to support it. In fact, there are a
few glaring problems with this "new" claim.

1.  The woman who Max Stier claims was assaulted by Kavanaugh and crew
    denies any memory of the attack. You would think that would be
    important, but the New York Times felt it was such a minor detail
    that they left it out of their paper's coverage of the book. They
    had to correct it later on. Meh, so what that she says it never
    happened. Evidence, shmevidence.
2.  Speaking of evidence shmevidence, the FBI did look at the claim
    during the time of the hearings and declined to investigate further
    because the evidence was simply too flimsy to support further
    investigation.
3.  Max Stier himself won't come out and publicly stand behind his
    claim. Not to worry though, the intrepid reporters at the New York
    Times have "confirmed the account with two officials who have
    communicated with him." Ooo, officials. Good thing they are
    officials, right? That makes it all better. So we have hearsay of
    hearsay. Super-reliable evidence-gathering there. But again, who
    needs evidence when you have a claim?
4.  Isn't that the same Max Stier who was a defense attorney for the
    Clintons? Yeah you're right, that doesn't sound fishy at all.

If you seriously believe any of this stinking pile of feces, I have a
bridge in Brooklyn to sell you.
