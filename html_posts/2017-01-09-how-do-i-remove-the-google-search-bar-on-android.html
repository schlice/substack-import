Depends on the phone and the launcher you are using.

If you're using a Samsung phone and you're using the TouchWiz launcher,
the Google Search Bar is a "widget." You can remove a widget by
long-clicking on the widget, which will select the widget. Drag it to
the top of the screen and drop it into the trash can that is labeled
"Remove."

If you are not on Samsung, or you are not using TouchWiz, consider
getting a launcher which allows you more customization options. Nova
Launcher is a very powerful and popular option.
