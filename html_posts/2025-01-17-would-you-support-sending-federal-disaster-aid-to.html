Yes, yes 1000% yes, and I'm a conservative.

Get this straight: **we should never ever condition disaster aid to
PEOPLE based on their political affiliation. NEVER.** Just like it was
wrong for FEMA to skip over Trump supporters' houses when distributing
relief for Hurricane Helene here in North Carolina, it would be equally
wrong to skip people's houses in Democratic blue areas, or even houses
with Biden or Harris stickers or lawn signs or whatever. That part is
all wrong. **We. Help. People. Full stop.**

Now if we're talking about **GOVERNMENTS**, disbursements for disasters
*in progress* should also have no conditions.

HOWEVER, I would absolutely CONDITION *future* disaster aid money on
making sure it goes to places which actually PREPARE for DISASTERS, like
making sure hydrant systems have multiple redundant pressure pumps and
sufficient water behind them.
