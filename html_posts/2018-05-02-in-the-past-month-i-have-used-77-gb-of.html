**In the past month, I have used 77 GB of "service". 74 GB of that was
the hotspot on my iPhone. Is that bad?**

The definition of "bad" is dependent on a lot of things.

- It may be bad if you were billed for all 77 GB and you can't afford
  your bill.
- It may be bad if you don't actually have any hotspot service on your
  mobile contract (i.e. you converted your phone to hotspot-capable
  without hotspot service on your contract) and they terminate your
  service for it.
- It may be bad if you don't have hotspot service on your phone or your
  contract but you're being billed for it anyway.
