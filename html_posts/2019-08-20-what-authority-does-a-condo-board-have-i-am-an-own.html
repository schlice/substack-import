**What authority does a condo Board have? I am an owner in a small condo
development in MA and the Board 'sold' our extra parking spaces to 2
owners using a Quit Claim. Is the Board allowed to do this?**

A quitcliam deed is the primary method by which property is transferred
in Massachusetts. Basically, it says that the property being transferred
has no other claim on it, and that the person accepting the property
places no other claims on it. That the property was transferred by
quitclaim deed is normal in Massachusetts.

The question is whether or not the Board has the authority to dispose of
community property.

There are two items which the Board must navigate: state law, and their
applicable Governing Documents.

Common areas and facilities are undivided (this means individual condo
owners do not have an *individual* ownership interest in them) and those
areas are managed by the Board. So long as the profits from any sale of
common areas are distributed to owners through an addition to the
operating fund, then as far as state law is concerned, the sale should
be legal.

In addition to prevailing state or local laws, a Board of Directors can
always only operate in accordance with its Governing Documents.
Disbursement of property must only take place in accordance with the
rules in that document. In nearly every case, the Board must get
approval from the members before they convey property. The Board, in
most cases, would have to arrange a vote of the membership before they
could go through the state process to transfer the land. But this
requirement may vary depending on what is stated in the relevant
Governing Documents.

If you are concerned that the sale may not have followed Massachusetts
condo law or any applicable Governing Documents, I suggest you and your
fellow condo owners who share your concern contact a real estate
attorney in your area.
