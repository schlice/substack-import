Colorado calls this their "three strike" laws, but what they actually
have are a progressive series of "habitual offender" laws, and their
penalties can be stiff. The objective of these laws is to try to punish
more harshly criminals who have a propensity to be violent offenders.

Lawyers tend to call the smallest of the penalties the "little habitual"
or the "baby habitual" statute. It's also referred more colloquially as
"little bitch." It states that if you are convicted of a Class 1, 2, 3,
4, or 5 felony, and you've been convicted of any two other felonies
within the previous ten years (even felonies in other states where the
same crime is a felony in Colorado), you get classified as a "habitual
offender," and your penalty for your most recent conviction becomes
**three times** the maximum sentence for the presumptive range for the
most recent felony. So if your crime carried a two to five year
sentence, it becomes a mandatory fifteen year sentence.

If you are subsequently released, and you are then convicted of a fourth
felony, regardless of the felony class, you will be classified a
habitual offender under what lawyers call the "big habitual" statute, or
more colorfully, "big bitch." If you are convicted under big habitual,
the penalty is increased **four times** above the presumptive maximum
for that felony. If the same two-to-five crime as above, you would get a
mandatory 20-year sentence.

Finally, if you are released after a fourth felony and are then
convicted *again* of *any violent felony*, you are classified a habitual
offender under the "biggest habitual" statute, which comes with a
mandatory **life sentence** with parole possibility after 40 years.
