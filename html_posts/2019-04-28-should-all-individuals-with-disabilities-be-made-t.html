**Should all individuals with disabilities be made to work?**

I understand the nature of your question. It could be taken as a very
offensive one, but I get it. You're probably asking about people who
receive government benefits, under a program we called "welfare to
work."

The answer is a qualified no, because **no one should be** ***made***
**to work.** That's called **slavery** and we outlawed that a few years
ago.

That said, what about people who receive government benefits? Should
*they* be made to work? Again, the answer is a qualified no.

No one should be made to work. But by the same token, no one should be
allowed to *not* work **and** continue to receive government assistance
for not working, **when one is fully able to work**.

President Obama removed the work requirement from government welfare
assistance during his presidency. This means you do not have to work,
and you do not have to look for work, if you are able-bodied and you
choose to not work.
