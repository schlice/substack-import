This is generally left to the discretion of the officer. Most
departments do not expressly forbid officers from using drive-thru
lanes. However, understand that if an officer is getting a meal, he is
on a meal break, specifically released from receiving calls, and other
officers are covering any calls received in his sector while he is away.
So being stuck in the drive-thru line isn't an issue, since the officer
will not be receiving calls during that time.

Officers have to use far more discretion these days, as fast food can
all too easily be intentionally contaminated:

This sort of behavior has become all too common for officers today. The
only fast food that the officers I know will eat is the kind where they
either know the owner of the restaurant **very** well, or they can watch
as the meal is prepared. The fresh Mexican chains (Qdoba, Chipotle) are
popular, as well as sandwich shop chains like Subway and Schlotzsky's
where your sandwich is prepared while you watch.

None of that will happen from a drive-thru, so you can expect to see far
fewer officers utilizing the drive-thru.
