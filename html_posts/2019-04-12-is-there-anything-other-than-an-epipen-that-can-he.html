**Is there anything other than an EpiPen that can help with
anaphylaxis?**

No.

It must be made clear: if you know you are prone to anaphylaxis, you
need an EpiPen. Without epinepherine, you can die.

You can, however, improve your chances until the ambulance arrives. You
should absolutely be calling 911 if you experience an anaphylaxis, even
if you do have an EpiPen. Deploying your EpiPen and calling 911 are
essential to do together. You should never deploy your EpiPen without
calling 911. Never. Deploy EpiPen, call 911. Every. Single. Time.

Your best best will be to buy some Children's Benadryl chewables.
Because of the quick dissolve strips and the Fast Melt pills being
discontinued, this is likely your best bet.

You'll want to start chewing **four** of them, and stick the resultant
mush under your tongue. Hold it there for as long as you can, then
swallow.

Of course, you must also call 911. Anaphylaxis, with an EpiPen or not,
needs immediate medical attention, or you could die.

If you know you're at risk of anaphylaxis and you either don't have (or
can't get yet) an EpiPen, buy a bottle of liquid Benadryl, or the
aforementioned quick-dissolve strips, and keep it with you at all times.
I recommend keeping the Benadryl with you, even if you do have your
EpiPen.

You may be able to find some fast-melt tabs or other dosing options at
your local drug store. Just remember that the adult dose is 50 mg every
4 hours, max 300mg per day.
