**Content:** [\"Parole Officers\" monitor inmates who have been released
on \"parole.\" Generally, this means before the completion of the
person\'s prison sentence. This is also generally done because prisons
are overcrowded, and hardly anyone stays in prison for their full term.
If they are well-behaved, and the Parole Board approves, a prisoner can
be released to serve the remainder of his sentence on \"parole.\"\
\
Parole is basically modified prison. It\'s sort of a \"halfway house\"
for criminals. Criminals released on parole are under restrictions. They
generally cannot leave the state in which they are living. They
generally must completely and totally follow the law. They generally
can\'t use drugs or alcohol. They generally must find gainful
employment, they can\'t have any contact with their victim, and finally,
they must report in to their parole officer, generally weekly. If they
are found to have violated the terms of their parole release, they go
back in to prison to complete their sentence and serve any additional
time related to the reason they violated, if any.\
\
Prisoners who serve their entire term in prison walk out the front door
and go on with their lives, no further contact needed. It does happen,
but these days it is rare.\
\
The only exception that I know of is, of course, my own state, Colorado.
Parole is an additional punishment, after the entire sentence is served.

\
There is another concept called \"mandatory supervision\" which some
states like Texas have. Mandatory supervision is a system wherein
inmates are compensated with \"good time\" which then counts towards
their term as time served. So an inmate can have a six year term, can
have served three years, and also have three years \"good time,\" after
which they must then be released unless the parole board says otherwise
in writing (usually because they are deemed a threat to society). There
is no parole board to meet before mandatory supervision releases kick
in.\
\
Hope this helps.\
