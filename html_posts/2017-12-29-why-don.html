I'll ignore the logical fallacy of "most civilized countries" and
pretend that you're just ignorant of logical fallacies and not
attempting to be intentionally inflammatory. We'll just address the rest
of the question.

So if I understand what you're asking, you want to know that if someone
wants a "suicide by cop," why would the police shoot them?

First of all, isn't it possible that the suspect is ***lying?*** Perhaps
**** he doesn't really want a suicide by cop, and perhaps he just wants
to ***kill a cop!*** There are people out there who simply want to kill
cops.

Nevertheless, if the person has a gun or a sword, and he wants to kill a
cop, or if he wants a suicide by cop, *does that make his bullets any
less lethal? Or make his sword any less lethal?*

The goal in policing is to enforce the law to the best of your ability
**and go home in your own car, not in an ambulance or (God forbid) the
coroner's van.**

If someone presents lethal force to you, the time to talk about his
motives has long since passed. You are being presented with lethal force
and you have a fraction of a second to decide what to do. At this point,
training takes over, and you respond with lethal force. Remember that in
all cases, the goal is not to kill. Similarly, the goal is also not to
*not kill*. The goal is to *stop the act.* The firearm is the most
effective way to stop someone using lethal force in an expeditious,
accurate manner while reducing the risk of collateral damage.
