Depends on a lot of things. How do you feel about this person now? Do
you want to have a relationship with this person again?

If you feel okay about this person and you want to have a relationship
with him again, welcome him back, tell him \"no hard feelings,\" and
move forward.

If you feel okay about him and you don\'t want to have a relationship
with him again, welcome him back and leave it at that.

If you don\'t feel okay about him, then ignore him. If he starts with
you, file for a restraining order and use the previous call as your
justification.
