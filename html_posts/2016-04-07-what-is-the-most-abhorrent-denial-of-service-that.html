If you are referring to H.B. 2 in North Carolina, or Mississippi\'s
related bill, the answer is that the business can choose to run its
business the same way it always has: biological men use the men\'s room,
biological women use the women\'s room. Or it can choose to change how
it runs its business, allowing people who identify as something other
than their biological sex to use whichever restroom they feel
comfortable in. Or it can say that private or public restrooms are
available for anyone, and not specify a reason to use one or the other.
And people can frequent whichever businesses meet their needs and
whichever businesses are accommodating in the way they feel a business
should accommodate, and the free market will decide which businesses
succeed and which businesses fail.

So to answer your question, the most abhorrent denial of service that
could occur due to the latest religious freedom acts is that an LGBT
customer may be forced to use the restroom of their biological sex
because a business may choose to not accommodate them, and the state
will not force them to act otherwise. The business may choose to keep
everything as is, allow people to use facilities based on gender
identity, or provide public and private facilities.

The bills simply say that government cannot tell businesses how to
operate. A business is free to operate based on its own conscience, and
the free market will determine whether or not that business remains
viable after that decision.

In North Carolina, the entire legislature, the governor, and over 70% of
the state voted for that legislation.

And despite all the threats by big businesses and sports teams, you
still manage to see businesses advertising during the NCAA Championship
in Houston, even after Houston voted in similar legislation. You didn\'t
see the NCAA Championship games moved out of Houston.

(EDIT) The other thing that I find interesting is that these businesses
which claim to be exercising their conscience rights by not doing
business in locations like North Carolina or Mississippi haven\'t
adopted ANY of the very same policies that they are boycotting in the
states. Does PayPal allow transgender people to choose restrooms based
on their perceived sex in their corporate offices? Does the NBA allow
transgender players to use whatever showers they choose? (hint: the
answer starts with n and ends with o).

And PayPal is probably the biggest hypocrite in the bunch, as it is an
international corporation which does business with **** *no fewer than
25 countries where homosexual behavior is illegal,* ***and 5 where the
penalty for such behavior is death.*** But they are objecting to North
Carolina overturning misguided legislation about letting men use
women\'s showers? North Carolina hasn't outlawed homosexuality or
discriminated against anyone. It hasn't even barred men from women's
restrooms. All it did was guarantee that businesses have the freedom to
set those policies themselves!

If Target\'s announcement that it will allow transgender people into any
restroom they choose, and the associated backlash they have received
(almost a half a million consumers signing the pledge to never shop at
Target again), you can tell that policies designed to appease 0.3% of
the population might potentially be unpopular with much of the other
99.7%.
