Oh I disagree. Let's break this down:

> in flaming fire taking vengeance on those who do not know God, and on
> those who do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ --- 2
> Thessalonians 1:8 NKJV

So now let's review, phrase by phrase:

**in flaming fire**\
Paul talks about the eternal judgement of those who are without Christ
as "in a fire of flame."

**taking vengeance\**
Vengeance in the Bible punishes people based on *what they rightly
deserve.* God delivers justice to Christians by punishing their enemies.
It's not retribution or retaliation, it's justice.

**on those who do not know God\**
God takes vengeance on two different groups. This is the first: those
who do not know Him. There is no excuse to not know Him, as He has
revealed Himself to them

**and on those who do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ\**
This is the other group: those who do not obey the gospel. This group is
arguably worse than the first group, as they have already heard the good
news and have chosen to reject it. There are many people who call
themselves Christian who have done this.

\

So what do we take from all of this?

1.  God takes vengeance through justice.
2.  For people who call themselves Christian yet don't obey the gospel,
    they won't be able to rationalize that away.

> For it is time for judgment to begin with God's household; and if it
> begins with us, what will the outcome be for those who do not obey the
> gospel of God? --- 1 Peter 4:17 NIV

But there is hope for them:

> But thanks be to God that, though you used to be slaves to sin, you
> have come to obey from your heart the pattern of teaching that has now
> claimed your allegiance. --- Romans 6:17 NIV
