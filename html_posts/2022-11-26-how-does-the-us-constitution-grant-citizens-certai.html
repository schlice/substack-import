By not doing it.

Time for **Constitution 101.**

Lesson 1: **The Constitution does not grant rights.**

Our founding documents are very clear on this. They say that we have
been endowed ***by our Creator*** with certain inalienable rights.

Our Creator granted us rights.

So why are our rights listed in the Constitution? The whole point of the
Constitution is to ***constrain government***. So our rights are listed
there so as to instruct government of the rights which they may not
violate.
