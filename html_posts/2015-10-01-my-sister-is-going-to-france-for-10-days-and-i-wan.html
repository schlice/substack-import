**Content:** [This is an inherent problem with the CDMA network. If you
want to use your Verizon phone overseas, you have no choice but to use
Verizon\'s international rate plans.\
\
Verizon is a domestic carrier which runs on the CDMA network. It is much
less available overseas than GSM, which is in use nearly worldwide
(AT&T, T-Mobile and Sprint use GSM networks). Verizon\'s phones don\'t
use SIM cards, so you can\'t just pop in a temporary SIM and use that.
Yes, it\'s true that you have to \"unlock\" your GSM phone to use
another SIM in it, as most GSM carriers \"SIM-lock\" their phones to
work only on their networks with their SIMs until you\'ve completely
paid for your phone. Don\'t worry, for a small fee any GSM phone can be
unlocked to be used on other networks at any time. Just Google \"SIM
unlock\" and you\'ll get tons of links to companies that do it for just
a small fee.\
\
Best advice: rent a phone. Don\'t pay Verizon\'s international rates.\
\
I do also suggest bringing your phone with you and using it in airplane
mode or with the cellular radio turned off. That way, you can still use
it to take pictures and surf the Internet over Wi-Fi. Therefore, when
you rent a phone, you only need a cheaper phone to make phone calls and
send texts.]{.rendered_qtext}
