No, because that's not how it works.

In reality, despite what you see on TV, you're not read your rights when
you are placed in handcuffs. You're actually read your rights before you
are questioned. But you read them together with the investigator. And
then, when you're done going through the sheet, which says exactly what
the investigator says, you indicate (with a checkbox) that you
understand your rights, and then you sign your name.

So if someone were to claim that they were never read their rights, the
investigator would produce the form that they signed showing that they
were, indeed, read their rights.

\

Second, even if you were not read your rights, that doesn't amount to
false arrest. At worst, it means that any testimony you gave is
inadmissible.

False arrest charges can happen when the police had no legal basis to
arrest you. Not that they had a legal basis and it was proven to be
incorrect, but they had *none*. If they had a valid basis on which to
make an arrest and it was proven otherwise and they let you go, this
does not amount to false arrest. Police are required to use the
information they have *at the time of the arrest*.

Now, if the police cannot articulate a valid reason for arresting you,
and they let you go, then you *may* have grounds for a false
arrest/false imprisonment charge. But not if the original basis for your
arrest was disproven, and certainly not if you were not Mirandized.
