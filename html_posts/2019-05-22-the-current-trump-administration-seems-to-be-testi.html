**The current Trump administration seems to be testing the powers of the
Executive branch, but this all seems to be precedent instead of actual
law. Why do you think these powers and their limits have not been
accurately portrayed through written laws?**

They don't need to be in written laws. They're inbuilt into the
Constitution. It's called the system of *checks and balances.*

As James Madison explained in Federalist No. 51: \"the great security
against a gradual concentration of the several powers in the same
department, consists in giving to those who administer each department
the necessary constitutional means and personal motives to resist
encroachments of the others. \[\...\] Ambition must be made to
counteract ambition.\"

The founders worried greatly that the executive would become nothing
more than a puppet for the legislature. To counter this concern, the
Executive branch was designed with a unitary Executive in whom the full
power of law enforcement and prosecution is vested. Additionally, the
Department of Justice *works for the Executive Branch*, and ultimately,
directly for the President. And this doesn't mean that the Attorney
General is the President's "lap dog." But it does mean that the DOJ
follows the President's lawful orders, as well as assisting with
implementing his policies through lawful enforcement.

The legislature is limited in what it can do if it believes that another
branch is exceeding its authority: it can defund that agency, or it can
impeach appointed Federal officers. This is its check against an
out-of-control Executive.

The legislature seems to believe that they are "FBI-lite," and they can
use their oversight power to investigate alleged criminal behavior.
Spoilers: they can't. The legislature's oversight power is directly
related to Federal agencies complying with the laws that the legislature
writes. If the legislature becomes aware of another branch of government
violating the law, they are required to immediately report that
information to a Federal Attorney (usually in the DC District) or to the
Attorney General. The FBI does not work for them, and they are not
tooled to investigate criminal activity. But they've all got it in their
heads that they're going to uncover the next Watergate, so they keep
pushing.

This is why it appears that the Executive is pushing back when it never
had to do so in the past. It only does so in response to unprecedented
pushes by the legislature.

Regardless, this "constitutional crisis" legislators incessantly whine
that we are involved in is nothing of the sort. There is no crisis. The
friction between the three co-equal branches of US government is not a
bug, but a feature.
