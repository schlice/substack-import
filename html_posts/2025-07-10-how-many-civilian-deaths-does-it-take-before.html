If your morals are so milquetoast that they only kick in at a certain
number of deaths, then you shouldn't be in charge of anything, really.

And if only your morals drive you to do something that you should have
done long ago to prevent death, then I absolutely don't want you in
charge of anything.

Either your entire life is driven by your moral code, or it is not.
