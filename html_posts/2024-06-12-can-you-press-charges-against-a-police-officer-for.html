You can't "press charges" for violating your rights, as that's not a
crime. Violating the law is a crime that an officer can be arrested for,
but that's tough to prove, and it's the District Attorney who would
charge an officer with a violation of law.

As far as "violating your rights" is concerned, you **can** hire an
attorney and file a lawsuit against the department alleging your rights
were violated. In actuality, the US Department of Justice automatically
investigates this in cases of police shootings, to ensure that the
suspect's civil rights were not violated, and if they were, they bring
lawsuits against the officer and the department. You can engage a civil
rights attorney yourself to sue the department and/or the officer for
violations of your civil rights.

Using "excessive force" is something which is very difficult for
civilians to quantify, as police arrest control techniques look very
painful and "excessive." Most people who believe they have an "excessive
force" complaint actually do not when the evidence is examined.
Mitigation for excessive force complaints are normally the suspect
resisting arrest, and the officers being required to use more force to
overcome that resistance. But again, if you feel you have an excessive
force complaint, you can engage a civil rights attorney to review your
case and possibly file a lawsuit against the department.
