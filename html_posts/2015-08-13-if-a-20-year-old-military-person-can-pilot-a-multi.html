**Content:** [Because ***piloting*** a submarine does not take the same
higher reasoning skills required to ***command*** the submarine. Air
Force aircraft are piloted by officers, and they are older than 20. Men
are not led by 20-year old enlistees; men are led by NCOs or officers
who are most assuredly older than 20, and those groups are
***commanded*** by senior officers. So yes, the driver of the sub is a
20 year old enlisted person. The driver of the tank is a 20 year old
enlisted person. But just because they are stick and wheel actuators
doesn\'t mean they have free rein as to where those vehicles go. The
***commander*** of such a vehicle is an officer; the commander of the
submarine is an O-5 or better, with 15+ years of military service, and
well into his 30s, the commander of the tank is an O-3 or better, and he
too is probably 25 or older, the age at which higher reasoning skills in
the brain are said to have fully developed.]{.rendered_qtext}
