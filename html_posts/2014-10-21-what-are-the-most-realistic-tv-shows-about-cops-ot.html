**Content:** [The most realistic shows I have watched followed
detectives, not so much squad officers.\
\
If you want to know what really happens in a police investigation, watch
*The First 48* on A&E. It follows detectives in a major metro area as
they walk through the first 48 hours of an investigation, the most
critical time of any investigation. There is an almost 50% drop in
probability of successfully closing a case if there is not a significant
break in the case within the first 48 hours of the police investigation.
Probably the most realistic view of what police investigators do.\
\
A more dramatized view into what squad detectives do can be found on
*NYPD Blue* reruns. But that show was indeed a drama, and was dramatized
away from real life. But I can tell you that the cases were real, as my
dad (a retired New York detective) called me in a flurry after one
episode and said, \"Did you watch NYPD Blue? That was my case!\" While
the names were changed to protect the identities of the real persons
involved, the subject matter of the case and many of the details were
directly out of the real case.]{.rendered_qtext}
