I grew up in an area where we had only all-volunteer fire departments.
The whole place, no paid firefighters.

In that area, we had need of a hazmat (hazardous materials) unit, as
most metropolitan areas do. However, the fire departments (who would
normally run hazmat) were not staffed nor funded to be able to support a
dedicated hazmat unit, with all of its requisite training and special
equipment.

So what do you think happened? Yep, the police did it. ESU, to be
precise.

The guys in ESU actually bought a Coke delivery truck (you know, looks
like a big box truck with lots of roll-up doors) and painted and
outfitted it as their hazmat truck. They staffed an initial crew and
sent them all to training. OSHA training in New Jersey, hazmat training
at the LSU Fire Academy, etc. It wasn't an easy job, and standing up a
new unit was extremely stressful. But they did it, and they were very
successful, literally saving the day on some very high-profile hazmat
calls.

ESUs fill the gaps where firefighters lack, and vice-versa. The two
teams work well together, which is why the model has endured for as long
as it has.
