Because the concession wasn't made to Democrats. The concession was made
to Republicans from blue states in order to gain *their* votes. Their
constituents wanted the concessions. so a compromise was made: allow the
SALT deductions *but phase them out over time*. So we get the Republican
votes, and we still get the phased-in elimination of SALT deductions.
