I have owned both dogs and cats, and my kitty had the same issue.

As a kitten, he developed FUS (feline urinary syndrome), where his urine
would crystallize and block his urethra. After a particularly
devastating episode (where he was so distraught because of his overfull
bladder), at the emergency vet, he was catheterized to allow the urine
to escape. Changing his diet solved the FUS, but he was permanently
traumatized.

Vets had a hard time examining him. There were some cases where he would
have to be sedated in order to examine him, but in others, they would
put him in the "bad kitty" box, which is literally a Plexiglass box with
holes in it so they could examine him. It pretty much form-fit to the
size of his body (think of the size of a bread box with a lid that fits
just inside the walls of the box and slides up and down to make a space
not much larger than the size of the cat). He would clearly be (vocally)
upset by being in the box, but they could at least partially examine him
if they had to.

Some vets (for a premium) will visit you at your home if your cat or dog
is inconsolable at the vet's office, which is great for general exams,
but more specialized work still requires a visit to the office and
probably some other interventions.
