**I've prayed to God for him to give me a sign or vision to show me that
he is here every night and I feel like any of my prayers aren't being
answered, what should I do?**

When I was young, I prayed to God to get laser beam eyes. No joke. You
might be surprised to learn that I, in fact, do not have laser beam
eyes.

When I was a little older, I prayed to God to reveal himself to me in
some way I could see. I never actually saw him.

Then, I learned.

I prayed to God to better understand what he had in store for my life,
and to be happy with that. He didn't answer right away (he answered in
his time), but he answered.

I prayed to God to have him take over, just do with my life whatever he
wanted, because I was so distraught and depressed that the thought of
swallowing the barrel of my gun did not immediately disgust me. I was in
such anguish, and for the first time in my life, I heard him speak. He
said, and I quote, "be patient."

I had an answer! But the answer was, "Relax, I'm here, I've got this,"
and more importantly, "I've always been here."

The point of this story is that **praying to God is not about getting
what** ***you*** **want. It's about being happy with what** ***he***
**wants**. And what he wants is for you to just talk to him. Tell him
about how you feel. Tell him about your day. Tell him everything, even
though he already knows all and sees all. He wants to hear it from you,
because it helps you to acknowledge it. He also has given all of us free
will, so he wants you to choose him. He wants you to keep choosing him
over everything else in the world.

And don't be surprised if he doesn't answer in a way that you can
immediately see or hear. He will answer, but in his time, and in his
way, *if it is his will*. When Jesus was going through the worst part of
his life, right before he was arrested and crucified, he prayed to God
and basically said if its possible, don't do this to me, **but if it's
your will, I'll do it**.

> Going a little farther, he fell with his face to the ground and
> prayed, "My Father, if it is possible, may this cup be taken from me.
> Yet not as I will, but as you will." ---Matthew 26:39 NIV

Jesus was saying, *I'm scared. I don't want to do this. But I trust you,
and if you want me to do this, I will.*

We don't pray to God to change him. We pray to God to change *us*.
