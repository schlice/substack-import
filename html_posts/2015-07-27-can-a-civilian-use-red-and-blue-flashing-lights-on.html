**Content:** [In almost all states, flashing colored lights on the front
of the vehicle are illegal. Even the \"chaser\" lights made famous by
K.I.T.T in *Knight Rider* would be illegal to fit to your car. Too bad,
I thought those were totally awesome\...\

Some state laws have provisions for \"show vehicles\" to have the lights
fitted, but there must be a \"positive disabling mechanism\" (such as a
removable fuse) that completely disables the lights while the vehicle is
being driven on a public road in order to do so legally.
