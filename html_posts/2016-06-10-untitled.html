I think you missed what I was saying, because I absolutely agree with
you. Point a), I'm not so sure that a lack of funding within law
enforcement is the issue. Perhaps a shortfall of funding within BATFE
(whose jurisdiction FFLs fall under) is indeed the issue. Point b), we
should most definitely make those arrests, and Point c), we should
actually immediately revoke that FFL from that dealer. Even in cases
where the FFL has found to be in the wrong, very rarely is the license
actually revoked. This is a travesty. And Point d) would be moot if we
could get BATFE to do their jobs and revoke FFLs from dealers who
actually do break the law. If they can no longer sell firearms because
they're not playing by the rules, we would indeed put a big dent in the
illegal arms trade. It would, of course, transition to other forms of
illegal arms trade outside of the errant illegally-operating FFLs, but
when you're faced with a dam with a million holes, you gotta start
plugging those holes somewhere.
