As [[Tom
Buczkowski](https://www.quora.com/profile/Tom-Buczkowski)]{.qlink_container}
alluded to, there are new drugs constantly in the works. They may have
different methods of action, but ultimately all the drugs do the same
thing: reduce the severity and duration of relapses, and slow down the
disease progression.\
\
Tysabri works by preventing lymphocytes from crossing the blood-brain
barrier by actively attaching to the lymphocytes. Interestingly, the
theory about \"leaky gut\" is also predicated on lymphocytes crossing
the peritoneum, and Tysabri also prevents this as well. So Tysabri is
used to treat Crohn\'s Disease as well as MS. Tysabri is delivered by
monthly infusion.\
\
Gilenya works by preventing lymphocytes from leaving the lymph nodes in
the first place. This has the added side effect of potentially
decreasing the body\'s ability to fight infections (in some patients it
does), but Gilenya has been very effective at slowing disease
progression as well. Gilenya is an oral medication.\
\
Beyond new medications, scientists continue to work on discovering the
potential causes of MS, and while that work is ongoing, there haven\'t
been any breakthroughs yet. Tom also alluded to the work being done to
restore the myelin that was damaged by MS. There is lots of promising
research being done there as well.]{.rendered_qtext}
