In Homeowner's Associations in Florida, this is what will happen. Most
other states will look similar, but the timeframes and amounts may be
different, to comply with those states' laws:

1.  The HOA will send you letters indicating that your dues are unpaid.
    You'll start accruing late fees.
2.  When the account has gone delinquent for a period of time specified
    in the Governing Documents (usually around six months, and
    especially if you're being uncooperative or non-communicative), the
    Board will transition your account over to the HOA attorney. Once
    that happens, it can't go back; you'll only deal with the attorney
    and not the Board to address that delinquency moving forward. The
    attorney, in addition to your past due dues and the late fees, will
    start adding his or her fees as well. Kind attorneys will allow you
    to establish a payment plan (which the Board would have done, had
    you communicated with them).
3.  When the amount due hits a minimum of \$1000 (as required by Florida
    law), the attorney (with the approval of the Board) can place a lien
    on the property.
4.  When the account has gone sufficiently long without payment (and
    again, if the homeowner is being uncooperative or
    non-communicative), the attorney will begin foreclosure proceedings
    on the property. This means that the HOA will sell your house out
    from under you, basically kicking you out onto the street, and they
    will use the proceeds to pay back all the dues and fees. The HOA
    will take possession of the house, clean it up, and sell it.

So how far will the HOA go? They'll *literally* sell your house out from
under you to get the money they are owed.

Look, if you don't want to cut your grass the way they want, fight them
on those stupid little things. But don't stop paying your dues, or some
very bad juju will befall you.
