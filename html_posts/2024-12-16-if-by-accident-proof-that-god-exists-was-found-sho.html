We already have proof that God exists. It's just that some people have
so narrowly defined what they will accept as "proof" that it
conveniently excludes the evidence we already have.

That's not a hallmark of the scientific method. That's allowing your
conclusions to color your scientific inquiry. This means that you are
not unbiased while analyzing your data. That's **bad science,** and it
almost never leads to the correct answer.

The "proof" that some people are looking for is *physical, testable
evidence* of the existence of God. But logically, this makes no sense.
Material evidence of an immaterial God is illogical. You're never going
to find material evidence of God. You're never going to find one of
God's hairs, or see one of God's footprints. It's like using a metal
detector to find a plastic cup.

But demanding physical evidence of God's existence is just one of the
dishonest things that religion deniers will demand so that they can
*seem* reasonable. News flash: that's not reasonable.
