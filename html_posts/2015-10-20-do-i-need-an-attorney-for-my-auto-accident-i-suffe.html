**Content:** [I recommend always consulting with a personal injury
attorney. Most of them offer free consultation and some don\'t even
require a retainer. They only get paid if they win.\
\
Therefore, they\'re very selective about cases they take. They don\'t
take every case that walks in the door.\
\
You can probably name at least three personal injury attorneys in your
area just from their TV commercials. I can name four, and one that
specializes in back injuries only (of all flavors: worker\'s comp,
negligence, accident, etc. Their tagline: \"We\'ve got your back!\").\
\
It doesn\'t hurt you to check with a personal injury attorney, and if
they take your case, there\'s a good chance they believe they will
win.]{.rendered_qtext}
