You're talking about two separate things here. Impeachments are
political and are handled by the Legislative branch. Indictment for a
crime is a legal process and is handled jointly by the Executive and the
Judicial branches.

You're probably thinking that the President could step out of his limo
on 5th Avenue in New York city, pull out a gun, shoot a man dead in the
street, climb back into his limo\*, and no one can touch him, right?
Well, not so fast. If there was such a clearly illegal act committed,
the President could be *indicted* for the crime, even though he probably
couldn't be arrested. And if that were the case, and Congress refused to
impeach him, the statute of limitations would be *tolled* (paused) until
such time as the President became eligible for prosecution, which would
be the natural end of his term. But if such crime occurred, there would
be little doubt that the President would be impeached and removed from
office.

I think the reason that you're not seeing impeachments happen is because
"very obvious illegal and corrupt conduct" is not happening. That may be
the way *you* see it, but to everyone else, it's not quite so obviously
illegal and/or corrupt.

Finally, impeachments, as noted above, are political. And if the party
in power in the House is the same party as the President, they're going
to *excuse* quite a bit of errant behavior. In other words, the House
will turn a blind eye to a lot of bad behavior simply because the
President and the House are part of the same party. Only you can fix
that, and you do so at the ballot box.

\* When Trump said that, he was making the point that he was so
well-liked that there wasn't anything he could do to lose support. He
said, "I could stand in the middle of 5th Avenue and shoot somebody and
I wouldn't lose voters." He wasn't making the claim that he could get
away with such a crime, or that the President was immune to prosecution.

Original question:

Should we repeal the impeachment clause if no one is willing to use it
for some very obvious illegal and corrupt conduct? Sould we just now
admit the president is above the law and can do anything he wants?
