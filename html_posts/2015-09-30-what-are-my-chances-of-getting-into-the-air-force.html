The \"physical stuff\" is important. This is why only 52% of cadets who
enter the Academy are in the top 10% of their respective high school
classes. I\'m assuming by your statistics that you\'re in the top 10% of
your class.

You\'ve got everything you need already, except for the \"physical
stuff.\"

Take [[Tom
Farrier](https://www.quora.com/profile/Tom-Farrier)]{.qlink_container}\'s
advice and get into the Air Force Academy recruiting site. The Academy
will be looking for athletic participation, usually in team sports. The
\"physical stuff\" is very important, as females are expected to meet
physical standards in the military as well as males. The actual numbers
vary slightly between the sexes, but the standards are there for both.
The website talks about what you will need to do to prepare for the
Academy\'s physical requirements. You should be participating in one or
more of these things:

> - Rigorous team sports (ex. Soccer or Football)
> - Strenuous individual sports (Swimming or Wrestling)
> - An individual fitness program including both distance running and
>   conditioning exercises --- upper-body strength, running speed and
>   endurance should be your objectives

You will have a [[Candidate Fitness
Assessment](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=3b86bc&url=http://www.academyadmissions.com/admissions/the-application-process/fitness-assessment/){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="academyadmissions.com"}]{.qlink_container} that you will
have to pass before you can get into the Academy. And it is very
physically demanding; don\'t forget that the Cadet Area at the Academy
is at an altitude of 7258\' above sea level. If you\'re like me, coming
from sea level, that transition is really tough. It\'s doable, but it\'s
tough.

Finally, remember that you\'re not applying for \"college\" so much as
you\'re applying to become an Air Force officer. This is a completely
different type of college: you\'re signing up to become one of the
future leaders of the finest Air Force in the entire world. It is
definitely the greatest challenge you will ever undertake: you will push
yourself beyond what you think is possible. If that sounds a little
scary, it\'s because it is. Challenges are sometimes scary. The leaders
of character we need in the military are the ones who will push
themselves beyond what they think they can achieve to learn what they
really can achieve. Remember what Mark Twain said: \"Courage is
resistance to fear, mastery of fear, not absence of fear.\"

Keep fighting, and good luck!
