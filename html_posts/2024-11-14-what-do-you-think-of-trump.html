Oh my gosh yes. Keep it coming, I'm not tired of winning yet.

Bear in mind that he has only been President-Elect for **nine days**.
And he has basically filled out most of his cabinet, at least when it
comes to national security and national defense.

And his choices have been ***brilliant***. People can squawk and blanche
at some of those choices, but he has made some excellent choices.

For example, he has selected Pete Hegseth as Secretary of Defense. The
military-industrial complex is losing its collective shit over this
choice, but if you've ever listened to Pete, he has the right ideas. He
literally [[wrote the
book](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=08be49&url=https://www.amazon.com/War-Warriors-Behind-Betrayal-Keep/dp/0063389428){.external_link

military. I personally appreciate his desire to remove woke ideology
from our service academies. It has been so disheartening to see what our
academies are teaching our supposedly preeminent military officers. Pete
will clean house.

And that's the general tenor of the appointments he has made thus far:
these are people who are going to come in, and on **day one**, start
cleaning house and draining the swamp.

Just look at his appointment of Vivek Ramaswamy and Elon Musk to the
extra-governmental Department of Government Efficiency (and no, the
acronym DOGE is not lost on me). An agency that exists outside of the
governmental chain of command, that the OMB will be taking direction
from, is a masterful move. Additionally, this department will,
*literally*, be the most transparent department we have ever had. How?
Everything they do will be posted publicly, on line.

\"All actions of the Department of Government Efficiency will be posted
online for maximum transparency,\" Musk wrote on the new DOGE X account.
\"Anytime the public thinks we are cutting something important or not
cutting something wasteful, just let us know! We will also have a
leaderboard for \[the\] most insanely dumb spending of your tax dollars.
This will be both extremely tragic and extremely entertaining.\"
