Most definitely.

Above all else, HOA\'s must apply the rules and regulations in the
neighborhood equitably amongst all of the homeowners. If your HOA is
unfairly targeting one neighbor over another, it is likely that the
court would find those HOA\'s enforcement actions to be illegitimate and
strike them down.

However, as with everything, the real answer is it depends. If, for
example, the homeowner in question has failed to pay his dues for a
certain amount of time, the HOA may, as part of its enforcement action,
stop providing one or more dues-funded services to that homeowner. If
the HOA was withholding services as a form of punishment for failing to
pay dues, that might be seen in a court as acceptable.

The particular punishment in question must also be listed in the fee
schedule in the rules and regulations. The HOA board can\'t simply make
these things up as they go along.
