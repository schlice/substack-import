If you want to be neither liberal nor legalistic, remember the
following:

It is certainly possible that all of these things had pagan origins.
Many things we do today are traditions that began hundreds or even
thousands of years ago, some even as pagan ceremonies.

**But what is important is not where a tradition came from. What is
important is the significance of the tradition to us today as believers
in Christ.**

For example, the Bible does not say that Jesus was born on December
25th. In fact, it's most likely that December 25th was chosen
specifically to replace pagan festivals on that date. The Roman Catholic
Church started celebrating Christmas on December 25th in the year 336 AD
during the reign of Emperor Constantine. Constantine was working to make
Christianity the effective religion of the empire, and the date was
chosen intentionally to cause Christmas to outshine existing pagan
Winter Solstice celebrations on that day.

So since the Bible doesn't say that December 25th is Jesus' birthday, we
cannot be completely dogmatic about it one way or the other. But even if
the date is completely wrong, there is still the opportunity for
thousands of people who wouldn't go to church any other time of the year
to go on Christmas Day and hear the good news about the baby born in a
stable and laid in a humble manger, who would go on to save the world.
There is no reason to deny that celebration when it has such powerful
evangelism as its end.

If you are fully convinced that you cannot, in good conscience, observe
one, some, or any of the things you listed because they had pagan roots,
then don't. If you are fully convinced that any of these are simply too
deeply rooted in paganism in order to honor God in any way, then don't
observe them. Personally, I'd be more concerned about Halloween than
anything you've listed here, but I digress...

But if you believe that you can honor God by participating in a
particular tradition, then by all means, participate in that tradition.
When Paul was ministering to the people in Rome (the most pagan place in
the world at that time), he gave them this advice:

> *One person considers one day more sacred than another; another
> considers every day alike. Each of them should be fully convinced in
> their own mind. --- Romans 14:5 NIV*

How you worship God is up to you. If you feel that you can honor God by
participating in a particular tradition, then do it! Honor and worship
God!
