title: "Race baiters have had it out for our police force. Namely saying all police officers are racist jerks who are out to shoot black males. In truth whites are shot more than blacks. Almost 2:1. So why the meme?"

**Content:** [In actuality, cops are six times more likely to be shot by
someone who is black than the other way around. Around 98% of black
shooting deaths do not even involve the police.\
\
The meme exists because the race baiters want to continue to push the
false anti-cop narrative because the race game makes them money. The
race business (which contain businesses such as the NAACP) is big money,
and they have done a great job of monetizing white guilt. Perpetuating
racial prejudice, real or perceived, is their job, their business, their
livelihood, and they make lots of money from doing it. If the truth
about racism were to come out, the NAACP and their ilk would stand to
lose a great deal of income.\
\
As with any of these things, it comes down to money. Follow the money,
and you\'ll find the reasoning.]{.rendered_qtext}
