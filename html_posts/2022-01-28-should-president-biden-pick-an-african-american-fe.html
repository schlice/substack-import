**Content:** []{.rendered_qtext}

He's absolutely going to do so, because it was a campaign promise, and
he's already re-iterated that he's doing it.

But what he and his supporters don't seem to grasp is that **this action
is** ***racist*.**

In other words, he is picking a Supreme Court nominee because of *her
gender* and *the color of her skin*, not because of the content of her
character or her ability to adequately do the job. Dr. King would be
appalled.

Because he is failing to consider others of other skin colors or other
genders for the same position, he is acting in an absolutely racist
manner.

That does not mean that his eventual pick will not be qualified to serve
on the High Court. Far from it, I'm certain she will be *eminently
qualified*.

It doesn't make this exercise any less *racist*.

Fighting racism with racism. Standard practice straight out of the
Progressive Playbook.

Additionally, **it violates government hiring rules**. Title VII
prohibits Federal, State and local government employers with 15 or more
employees and employment agencies from discriminating on the basis of
race, color, religion, national origin or sex (including pregnancy,
sexual orientation, and gender identity) in all aspects of an employment
relationship.
