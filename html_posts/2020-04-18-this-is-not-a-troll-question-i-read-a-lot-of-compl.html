**This is not a troll question. I read a lot of complaints and mockery
about Donald Trump, yet the opposition is offering nothing credible in
his place. Why is this?**

When you cannot compete in the arena of ideas, your only attack left is
an *ad hominem* (to the man) attack. Basically, they have nothing
quantitatively better to offer, so they attack Trump as a person.

Plus, since he literally is a caricature, it\'s really easy, so they
don\'t have to debate him on the ideas. Anything he says, and they\'re
just like, "But he\'s Trump!". He\'s not a politician. He has not spent
his life concerned with his public image or what people will think or
how his actions will play in the media. He doesn\'t care. Frankly, it\'s
refreshing, to see what a non-politician can accomplish.

And that *infuriates* the left. They hate that Trump can roll out of
bed, make a decision, and be right most of the time. They hate that he
doesn\'t have to have focus groups to decide what exactly he\'s going to
say. so they *have* to destroy him. They have to prove that you have to
be a politician in order to work in Washington. If Trump succeeds, it
will show everyone that you don\'t have to be a lifelong politician in
order to do well in government. They simply can\'t allow that, or it
spells the end of their breed: the career politician.
