I think the other answers have it nailed here. I don\'t think the people
who were walking around the aircraft were actually security police. I
have a feeling that they were there mostly for show.

Real Air Force security police officers never go on patrol without being
armed. The ones with the M9s will carry 30 rounds, and the ones with the
M-16\'s carry 120 rounds.
