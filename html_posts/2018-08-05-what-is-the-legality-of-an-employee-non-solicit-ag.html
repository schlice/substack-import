**Can you address the legality of a non-solicit agreement? How is it
constitutional for two parties (in this case a company and an
ex-employee) to collude to not hire current employees of the company, if
the employees are not a party to the contract?**

First of all, you're probably asking about a "non-compete clause," not a
"non-solicitation agreement." A "non-compete clause" basically says that
an employee cannot use the skills they gained at your workplace for a
set period of time after they leave your employ, either by working for a
competitor, or by recruiting or taking the customers from your business.

In general, this is done in highly skilled or highly technical fields,
and is done primarily to protect trade secrets or business confidential
information from being used by industry competitors if an employee
switches jobs.

Important to note here: the companies are not "colluding" to not hire
current employees. Companies know the laws, and they know that the
employees signed non-compete clauses, so they could face legal action by
hiring you. Rather than risk legal action, they choose to not hire you
so as not to run afoul of your non-compete clause.

For completeness, a "non-solicitation agreement" says that you cannot
solicit customers of your former company for a period of time after you
leave your employment. This means that you can't call your old customers
and convince them to follow you to your new place of business (except in
California, where non-solicitation agreements are generally not
enforceable, and this practice is considered fair).
