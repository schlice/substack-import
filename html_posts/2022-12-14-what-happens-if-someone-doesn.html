Not sure what you mean by "leaves the property." Are you saying that the
person sells their house and leaves without paying their dues?

Part of the disclosures during a home sale is confirmation of a clean
account in the HOA. If the previous homeowner hasn't paid their dues,
those back dues will have to be paid before the HOA will provide a
certificate of account for the sale.

In other words, if you're running a balance due with the HOA, you won't
be able to sell your house.
