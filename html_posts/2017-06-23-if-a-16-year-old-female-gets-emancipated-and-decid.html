Great question!

Emancipation only affects your minor status when it comes to parental
supervision requirements. Your parents are responsible for your
well-being until you turn 18. Emancipated minors can sign documents on
their own behalf and can make decisions on their own behalf without
needing a parent or guardian.

However, other "age-restricted" functions of the state still remain: the
drinking age, the driving age, the age of consent, etc. Emancipation
pertains to anything which might require a parent or guardian's
signature, such as entering into a rental agreement for an apartment,
getting a job, etc. It also alleviates the parents of responsibility for
your actions.

Finally, you can date anyone you like. You just can't have sex with
them. That's illegal. Even states with "close-in-age" clauses to their
statutory rape laws require you to be within only a few years. An 8-year
difference is probably too much. Check your state's statutory rape laws
to be sure.
