**If two stateless people take a ship out into the middle of the
Atlantic ocean and one murdered the other, how would he be charged with
the murder?**

The crime would be investigated and charged by the country where the
ship is registered.

The fact that the people are stateless only affects things like
extradition; the nation investigating and prosecuting the murder won't
be affected by the fact that the participants are stateless themselves.
