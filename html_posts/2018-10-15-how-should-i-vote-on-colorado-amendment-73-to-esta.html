**How should I vote on Colorado Amendment 73 to establish income tax
brackets?**

It depends on how you view government.

If you think that state government should be collecting all the revenue
for local school districts and should be doling that out to school
districts in PPOR (per-pupil operating revenue), and you think that
local governments are so incompetent as to have this responsibility
removed from them and performed by the state, and you think you can
accomplish this by increasing taxes on those who make more than
\$150,000 per year, then you should vote for it.

If you think that local school funding is best left to local
governments, then you should vote no.
