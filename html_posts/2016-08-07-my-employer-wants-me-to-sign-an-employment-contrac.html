Yes this is legal. Full time just means you get paid for at least 40
hours per week.

Most employment in the US is \"at will\" employment. This means that
either you or the employer can terminate the working relationship at any
time for any reason.

This is the opposite. It is considered \"contract employment\" in which
you cannot quit without cause for the term of the contract. They can
fire you, but it would have to be a good reason for them to lose the
money on your training. Hopefully, the contract gives the company some
liability if they fire you (like, for example, if you have received
expensive industry training, your contract may say that if you quit, you
have to pay back the training cost, but if you are fired and it is not
for cause, you do not). The point of this type of contact is that they
believe they are putting quite a bit of money into your training, and
they want to ensure that they get their money\'s worth from you.
