> Sometimes I don\'t feel the mood to pray.

Oh, I know that feeling. There are plenty of times that my mind isn\'t
in a good place to pray.

What we must remember during those times is **truth.** God\'s Word is
true. It\'s true whether we feel like it is true or not. It\'s true
whether we feel like being obedient or not.

In other words, *God\'s Word is true regardless of how we feel.*

And our response to the truth of God\'s Word is praise.

So if God\'s Word is always true, then it\'s also true that **we are to
give Him praise, even in the times we don\'t necessarily feel like it.**

He is always good, and we need Him when times are good as well as when
times are not so good, especially when we don\'t feel like it.

> **I also have a throat disease so I can\'t pray always.**

Sure, maybe you can\'t pray out loud, no big deal! Unlike the demons,
God hears your thoughts. The prayers you pray deep in your heart are
heard by God. You can rest assured that even if your throat fails you.
*God never will.*
