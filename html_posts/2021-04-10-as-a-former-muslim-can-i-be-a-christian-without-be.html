**As a former Muslim, can I be a Christian without believing in the
Trinity? I want to worship God and worship/ venerate Jesus as the Son of
God, but not as God.**

It sounds like you're asking for the definition of Christianity when you
ask whether or not you can only believe parts of it.

Christians get their beliefs from the Bible, which is believed to be the
inspired word of God. Clearly, God did not write the Bible, but we
believe that the people who did had divine inspiration to write.

The Bible tells us who Jesus is. There are various passages that tell us
that Jesus is God.

- John 8:24, "Therefore I said to you that you will die in your sins;
  for unless you believe that I AM, you will die in your sins."
- Colossians 2:9, "For in Him all the fullness of Deity dwells in bodily
  form,"
- Titus 2:13, "looking for the blessed hope and the appearing of the
  glory of our great God and Savior, Christ Jesus,"
- John 1:1-3, "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God,
  and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God. All things
  came into being through Him, and apart from Him nothing came into
  being that has come into being."
- 2 Peter 1:1, "To those who have received a faith of the same kind as
  ours, by the righteousness of our God and Savior, Jesus Christ."

But probably one of the most telling passages is Paul's letter to the
Romans:

> However, you are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if indeed the
> Spirit of God dwells in you. But if anyone does not have the Spirit of
> Christ, he does not belong to Him. If Christ is in you, though the
> body is dead because of sin, yet the spirit is alive because of
> righteousness. But if the Spirit of Him who raised Jesus from the dead
> dwells in you, He who raised Christ Jesus from the dead will also give
> life to your mortal bodies through His Spirit who dwells in you ---
> Romans 8:9--11

Paul interchangeably calls the Holy Spirit the "Spirit of Christ" and
the "Spirit of God" in just this one group of verses. This would not
make sense unless Jesus was God. We wouldn't say the "Spirit of God" and
the "Spirit of that really important human teacher." The passage equates
the Spirit of God with the Spirit of Christ.

But this passage also distinguishes the Holy Spirit from God when he
says that not only is the Holy Spirit the "Spirit of God," but he is
also the Spirit of "Him who raised Christ from the dead." Thus, the
Father and the Son are distinguished from one another. Christ and He who
raised Christ from the dead are distinct and interactive persons in this
context. Thus, we are not talking about three unique, totally separate
individuals. We're also not talking about one person who sometimes acts
as Father, sometimes as Son, and other times as Spirit. We are talking
about one God who is Father, Son, and Spirit all at once and
interactively. One God, three persons.

Christian orthodoxy is determined by who you believe Jesus to be.
Christians believe Jesus is one of three persons in the Trinity, all at
once, one God, in three distinct persons.
