**Is a rental lease contract valid if the landlord puts the wrong
address for the house he is renting?**

If it's simply a clerical error (he wrote 1400 instead of 1500) but
everything else was correct, the contract is still enforceable.

If the address is for a completely different unit, or for a unit in
another complex or in another state, the contract *may* be void.
