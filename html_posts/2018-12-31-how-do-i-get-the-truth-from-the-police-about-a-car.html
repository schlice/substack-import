**How do I get the truth from the police about a car accident I was in 6
years ago? They say I was the only driver involved & at fault but this
is completely false.**

The short answer: you don't.

If the police report says you were the only driver involved and at
fault, then that's the end of it. Unless you have a witness to refute
the police report (such as the other driver), then you're outta luck.
The police report isn't the last word because it's always right; the
police report is always right because it's the last word.

Secondly, what do you hope to gain by "getting the truth?" A moral
victory? Generally, the statute of limitations is less than five years,
so it's unlikely you'd be able to actually make a claim even after your
report was corrected.
