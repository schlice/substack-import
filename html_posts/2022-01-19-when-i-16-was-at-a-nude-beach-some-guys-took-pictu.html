When it comes to the law, you were nude in a place where public nudity
is allowed. In most cases, while it is considered quite distasteful to
take pictures at a nude beach, it is not usually illegal.

And it is not automatically child pornography, as most legal definitions
of child pornography include a clause which states that the photography
must be sexual in nature. In other words, if you were doing something
sexual and the picture was taken, then it could be considered child
porn. But simply taking pictures of a person who is nude and underage
does not automatically constitute child porn. Additionally, a child
doesn't even need to be nude in order for it to be considered child
porn. A child in her underwear in a sexual orientation can be considered
to be child porn, even though she's not naked. It's not the nudity that
makes the porn.

Original question:

When I (16) was at a nude beach some guys took pictures of me without my
consent. I told them I was underage and they said it didn\'t matter
because I was in public. What do I do?
