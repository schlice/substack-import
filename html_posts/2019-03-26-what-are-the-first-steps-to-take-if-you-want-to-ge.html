**What are the first steps to take if you want to get rid of a
neighborhood Home owners Association (HOA)?**

You will first need to find out what is necessary in your area to
dissolve an HOA. It will require a certain percentage of the community
to sign their approval of the dissolution, and you will have to meet
that minimum standard. For many communities, it's 3/4 of the homeowners;
for others, it's 100%.

You will then need to ascertain a list of everything that the HOA pays
for, and all real property that the HOA owns. Usually, the things the
HOA pays for are associated with the real property the HOA owns. Common
areas can be donated to non-profit organizations, who would then take
over the ongoing maintenance of those areas. For example, a playground
may be taken over by a non-profit organization, who would then be
responsible for paying for things like watering the grass, paying for
the general liability insurance on the area, upkeep of equipment, etc.

If the HOA owns roads, the roads would revert back to city/county
ownership, and the city would have to agree to annex that property. This
part could take some time. Your attorney can help you with all of that.

On that note, you will do all of this with the assistance of a licensed
real estate attorney in your area who specializes in HOA law. This
attorney will also need to be paid, along with the filing fees to file
the HOA dissolution documents with the city/county.

The place to start, therefore, is a comprehensive survey of all property
owners in the community, since you will need all of their help to
dissolve an HOA.

Good luck.
