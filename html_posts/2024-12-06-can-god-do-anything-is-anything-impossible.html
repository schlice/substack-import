The short answer is **God can do anything that it is possible to do.**

Some things just aren't possible. He can't violate His own nature. The
Bible tells us these things. We know He cannot lie or deny Himself
(Hebrews 6:18; 2 Timothy 2:13; Titus 1:2).

He also can't violate the laws of the universe and the laws of physics
which He created. So for example, the gotcha question that atheists love
to ask me is, "Can God create a rock so heavy that even He can't lift
it?" They think this is a gotcha because regardless of how you answer,
it proves that God is not omnipotent. Either His inability to create
such a rock, or His inability to move such a rock, would place His
omnipotence into question.

But the existence of this question is based on a flawed understanding of
omnipotence. What truly is omnipotence? It's "unlimited power," the
power to effect change, to make things happen. God (being unlimited) has
unlimited power, and the Bible affirms this (Job 11:7-11, 37:23; 2
Corinthians 6:18; Revelation 4:8; etc.). Therefore, God can do whatever
is possible to be done. God cannot, however, do that which is actually
impossible. This is because ***true impossibility is not based on the
amount of power one has, it is based on what is really possible.***
**The truly impossible is not made possible by adding more power.**

Understanding this, you can understand why He cannot create a rock that
even He cannot move. The reason is because of His nature and the nature
of reality itself. God cannot do what is not actually possible to be
done, like creating a square circle or a two-sided triangle. Just
because you can stick words together this way does not make the
impossible possible. These things are *contradictions*; they are truly
impossible in reality. And even God cannot deny reality.

To answer the theoretical rock question, in order for God to create a
rock so heavy that He cannot lift it, He would have to create a rock of
sufficient mass such that His infinite ability to exert force could not
move it. Since His input force is unlimited, the size of the rock would
have to be infinite such that His unlimited input force could not move
it. And an infinitely massive rock cannot exist within this universe.
Therefore, God cannot create such a rock because it would not fit inside
of the universe He created and where rocks and matter exist.
