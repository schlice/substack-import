says that it's the Commerce Clause, but the answer is slightly more
nuanced than just that.

Until the early 20th century, states had the legal authority to police
themselves as they saw fit, and laws typically existed at a state level,
with federal authority only extending to interstate activity. However,
after the New Deal, case law started emerging which stated that
"intrastate" commerce which "affected interstate commerce" could be
regulated by the Federal government, and by the end of the civil rights
movement of the 60s, case law emerged which basically allowed the
federal government to control social policy in the states. Today, most
state laws are subject to this new notion of federal preemption, with
the exception of some 10th Amendment exceptions which came out of the
Rehnquist SCOTUS.

The Controlled Substances Act uses this same idea of federal preemption
and the new interpretation of the Commerce Clause, stating that drug
control is a "national" problem which requires federal oversight.

Most states have enacted their own versions of the Controlled Substances
Act, basically voluntarily integrating their own drug policies into the
federal one. Whether or not a state can similarly voluntarily choose to
not integrate their state's laws into the federal statute is still a
question which has yet to be decided.

With Trump reversing the Obama-era policy directing US Attorneys to not
prosecute state-level Federal drug offenses, this question may soon come
to the fore.
