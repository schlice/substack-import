This question is an example of the logical fallacy known as a "false
equivalence."

A **false equivalence** or **false equivalency** is an informal fallacy
in which an equivalence is drawn between two subjects based on flawed or
false reasoning. This fallacy is categorized as a fallacy of
inconsistency. Colloquially, a false equivalence is often called
\"comparing apples and oranges.\"[\[1\]](#WylWS){#cite-WylWS
.citation_link}

Comparing the desire for equal rights to life for babies and mothers
with the desire to not expose elementary school children to materials
discussing sexual orientation, more so than just base biology, are two
totally separate issues. The existence of one doesn't impact the
reasoning behind the other. This is why the comparison is false.

The only comparison I can make here is "if we prohibit one degeneracy
(killing babies), then we should perhaps prohibit more degeneracies
(discussions about sexual proclivities)." But that discussion is a
stretch, because clearly the proponents of both of these degeneracies
don't believe they are degeneracies.

So yes, it is absolutely a false equivalence. The two topics are totally
unrelated.
