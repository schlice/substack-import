Despite what you may have heard, there is no \"big red button\" in the
Presiden\'ts office that launches missiles. And there\'s nothing at all
\"easy\" about launching nuclear missiles. While it\'s entirely possible
that a President could unilaterally make the decision to launch a
nuclear missile, that decision would not go unnoticed by anyone, and I
think that lots of people in the military chain of command would
question the order to launch, especially the order to launch nuclear
missiles. Remember, we prosecuted Nazi officers who were \"just
following orders.\" No one person is authorized to violate the Geneva
Convention. A viable threat must exist first, and there are several
people in that chain between the President and the missiliers in the
bunker turning their keys.

While the President does have the authority to launch missiles, it is
not unilateral. He still has to receive intelligence that indicates a
nuclear launch would be appropriate. He has to confer with the JCS
(Joint Chiefs of Staff) and review the intelligence provided. The
President, though, makes the final decision. If he decides to launch
missiles, he must use nuclear \"launch codes\" which are carried in a
locked briefcase by a military attach√© attached to the White House
staff. The briefcase containing the launch codes is colloquially known
as \"the football.\" Once the targets are confirmed, the President
verbally authorizes launch after providing the correct launch codes.

The second set of "codes" is held by the Secretary of Defense. This is
part of the "two-man rule" in place protecting unilateral launch of any
one, or all, missiles. Both the President and the SecDef must agree to
launch missiles, or they don't leave the silos.
