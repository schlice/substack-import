**Is it against the law to resist being handcuffed by a police
officer?**

Yes, it is a crime. In most jurisdictions it is called "resisting
arrest." It can be added to the list of crimes for which you were being
arrested in the first place.

It also raises the level of force authorized to the officer to bring you
into compliance (in other words, you get hurt more).

As we've said many times on Quora, if you don't feel that the arrest is
legal, or if you feel that the officer has done something wrong, the
time to argue this is when you're standing in front of the judge, not
when the officer is applying handcuffs.
