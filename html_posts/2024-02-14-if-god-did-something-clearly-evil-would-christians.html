Please explain how God can do something evil.

In order for God to do something evil, there must be a source of
morality to which God is subject.

*What source of morality is greater than God?*

Therefore, in order to answer this question, **you must ground your
morality**. From where do you get your morality? What is the source of
morality that both you and God are subject to? From where did this
morality originate?

If you cannot answer the question about where the morality came from,
then you are *self-referential*. That means that everyone can build
their own morality, and the definition of evil is individualized to the
person.

But we know intuitively that this is incorrect. Everyone, everywhere,
knows that murder is wrong and that courage is better than cowardice.
University of Texas at Austin professor J. Budziszewski writes,
"Everyone knows certain principles. There is no land where murder is
virtue and gratitude vice." C. S. Lewis, who has written profoundly on
this topic in his classic work Mere Christianity, put it this way:
"Think of a country where people were admired for running away in
battle, or where a man felt proud of double-crossing all the people who
had been kindest to him. You might just as well try to imagine a country
where two and two made five."

In other words, everyone knows there are absolute moral obligations. An
absolute moral obligation is something that is binding on all people, at
all times, in all places. And an absolute Moral Law implies an absolute
Moral Law Giver.

Now this does not mean that every moral issue has easily recognizable
answers or that some people don't deny that absolute morality exists.
There are difficult problems in morality, and people suppress and deny
the Moral Law every day. It simply means that there are basic principles
of right and wrong that everyone knows, whether they will admit them or
not. Budziszewski calls this basic knowledge of right and wrong "what we
can't not know," in his book by that title.

We can't not know, for example, that it is wrong to kill innocent human
beings for no reason. Some people may deny it and commit murder anyway,
but deep in their hearts they know murder is wrong. Even serial killers
know murder is wrong---they just may not feel remorse. And like all
absolute moral laws, murder is wrong for everyone, everywhere: in
America, India, Zimbabwe, and in every other country, now and forever.
That's what the Moral Law tells every human heart.

In fact, we know the Moral Law exists. The Moral Argument tells us that
God exists:

1.  Every law has a law giver.
2.  The Moral Law exists.
3.  Therefore, there is a Moral Law giver.

But is it really true that there is a Moral Law? Our Founding Fathers
thought so. As Thomas Jefferson wrote in the Declaration of
Independence, "Nature's Law" is "self-evident." You don't use reason to
discover it, you just know it. Perhaps that's why people know that
helping others is the right thing to do, but they can't explain *why*
without appealing to a standard outside themselves. Without an
**objective standard** of meaning and morality, then life is meaningless
and there's nothing absolutely right or wrong. Everything is merely a
matter of opinion.
