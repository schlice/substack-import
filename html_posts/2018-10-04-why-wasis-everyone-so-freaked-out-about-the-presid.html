**Why was/is everyone so freaked out about the presidential alert?**

It's a general freakout about Trump.

You know that Trump *loves* Twitter. You also know that no other
president in history has talked as plainly and as openly directly to the
American people through a social media platform as Trump has.

Therefore, some people worry that the Presidential Alert would become
"Trump's personal Twitter Line" directly to people that they can't turn
off.

Not only is this ridiculous (he does just fine with Twitter), but it's
untrue.

The Presidential Alert is one of three categories of messages which the
government can send through the Wireless Emergency Alert system, part of
the nation's Emergency Alert System (which used to be called the
Emergency Broadcast System). It preempts all other communications, and
the WEA system itself can preempt other communications on your device to
get through.

But, the system can only be actually activated as a "last-ditch"
communication method if the President can't get to the media.
Additionally, its use is controlled by three different groups: FEMA, the
FCC, and NOAA.

Therefore, so long as Trump has access to Twitter, you're not going to
be seeing the WEA become Trump's personal text message service to your
phone.
