To sum up what [[Jack
Hallows](https://www.quora.com/profile/Jack-Hallows)]{.qlink_container}
said, **be a good witness.** Learn how to see and remember details so
that you can cogently repeat them later. You will have to answer the
who/what/when/where/why/how questions when the police ask you.

You might even consider setting up cameras on your house that look out
on to the front of your property and on to your street. The more
evidence you can give the police, the better chances they will have at
reducing crime.

But in short, being a good witness is literally the best thing you can
do.
