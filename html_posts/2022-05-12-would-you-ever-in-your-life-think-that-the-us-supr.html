Absolutely. And you only need to look at history in order to understand
that this is not new.

Perhaps you may remember the landmark Supreme Court decision in the case
of *Plessy v. Ferguson*. No? You should. It was the decision that
basically said that the racial segregation laws in the south following
the civil war were constitutional. This is the case which codified
"separate but equal," so long as the separate facilities were equal in
quality.

It's hard to think about that today. The Supreme Court said that racial
segregation was constitutional. But again, this case was decided in
1896.

However, it was immediately rectified, right?

Not so much. *Plessy* stood as "settled law" and "precedent" (sound
familiar?) for almost **60 years** until 1954, when *Brown v. Board of
Education* found that racial segregation laws in schools were
unconstitutional, even if the facilities were equal in quality. This was
the beginning of the end of the road for *Plessy*, which was then
*effectively* overturned with subsequent findings of unconstitutionality
of racial segregation.

So a Supreme Court decision standing for decades before being
effectively overturned is not new.

Would you ever in your life think that the US Supreme Court decision
made almost 50 years ago in the case of Roe v. Wade would be reversed?
