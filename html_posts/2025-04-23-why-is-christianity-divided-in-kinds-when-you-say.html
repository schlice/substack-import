Think of this quote which was (supposedly) said by St. Augustine:

> *In essentials, unity; in non-essentials, liberty; in all things,
> charity*

What this means in the context in which you asked is that while all
Christian denominations agree on the essentials (the nature of God, the
nature of the Trinity, the nature of Christ, the means for salvation,
etc), the Bible allows us to disagree on the non-essentials.

And sometimes, those disagreements are severe enough that people
self-sort into groups who believe in a like-minded way. Those groups
form *denominations*.

Because the Bible allows us to have liberty on the non-essentials, we
have many denominations. We all share common beliefs about the
essentials, but we have sometimes very different views of the
non-essentials. **This is not universally bad**.

\

What *becomes* bad is when we start to deviate on the ***essentials***.
And if you're looking from the outside in, you never know if you're
looking at a disagreement on **non-essentials** or **essentials.**

For example, here's some areas of essential disagreement:

1\. Salvation and Good Works:

- Most denominations, like Protestantism, emphasize the importance of
  faith alone as the basis for salvation, with good works being a result
  of that faith.
- Some, like Catholicism, believe that salvation requires both faith and
  good works, with good works being a necessary component of living out
  a Christian life.

2\. The Trinity and the Nature of God:

- Unitarianism denies the Trinity, believing that God is a single entity
  rather than three persons.
- Mainline Christian denominations, like Catholicism, Orthodoxy, and
  most Protestant groups, affirm the Trinity, believing in one God
  existing in three persons: Father, Son (Jesus), and Holy Spirit.

3\. Scripture and Authority:

- Different denominations have varying approaches to interpreting
  scripture and the authority of tradition.
- Most, like most Protestant groups, emphasize the Bible as the primary
  source of authority, while others, like Catholicism and Orthodoxy,
  give more weight to church tradition and the authority of the early
  Church Fathers.

4\. The Role of the Church:

- Some denominations, like Presbyterianism, emphasize the importance of
  the church as a community of believers, while others, like
  Catholicism, emphasize the hierarchical structure of the church with a
  clear line of authority.
- Different denominations also have varying views on the role of the
  church in society and its relationship with the secular world.

5\. Sacraments and Rituals:

- Denominations have many different understandings of which sacraments
  are considered essential and the nature of these sacraments.
- Some denominations, like Catholicism and Orthodoxy, recognize a
  greater number of sacraments than others.
- Even worse, *within the same denomination*, there can be varying
  practices and interpretations of sacraments.

Differences between denominations on essentials is problematic. But
Christianity itself is not a religion, and there is no central governing
authority. This sort of division is a natural outgrowth of that feature.

That said, we Christians can continually pray for and work towards
agreement at least on the essentials.
