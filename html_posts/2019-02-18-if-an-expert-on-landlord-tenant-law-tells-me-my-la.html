**If an expert on landlord tenant law tells me my landlady disapproves
of my middle class friends because they\'re probably giving me rides to
get access to the illicit sex and drugs on the property, what should I
do? I know they aren\'t. I can\'t move.**

Thankfully, your landlady's approval of your friends is not a contingent
portion of your lease. Unless you have some kind of "friend clause" in
your lease, what your landlady thinks of your friends is not really
relevant.

Now, she may refuse to renew your lease when it comes up, and she has
every right to refuse to renew your lease when it comes due. However,
she can't really kick you out because she doesn't like your friends. I
don't think a judge would look too kindly into a landlord breaking a
lease agreement because she thinks your friends are sketchy.

If the police have been called to the unit on more than one occasion
because of something illegal you may or may not be doing, that *might*
be grounds to evict you, but not liking your friends? Nah.

But when your lease is up, you might be ready to find another place to
live.
