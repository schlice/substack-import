**Is it illegal to take pictures of women in public place without their
consent?**

As with all legal questions, the answer is "it depends." And in this
case, it depends first on what country you are in.

In the United States, if you are in public, and in public view, someone
can take a picture of you. They can even post the picture online. If you
are in public, you have no expectation of privacy, and in general, "if
you can see it, you can shoot it." There are, of course, specific
exceptions to this law, but this is in general.

What you cannot do is *profit* off of the photos. You cannot sell them.
You cannot charge a subscription fee to have someone see them. The
photos would then be considered *commercial use* and you must have the
permission of the subject in order to make money off of the photos.
