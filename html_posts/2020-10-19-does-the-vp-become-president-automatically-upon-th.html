**What happens if a president resigns? Does the VP immediately become
president?**

Yes, the 25th Amendment says:

> *In case of the removal of the President from office or of his death*
> ***or resignation****, the Vice President shall become President.*

Therefore, as soon as the President resigns, the Vice President becomes
Acting President.

Once the Acting President is sworn in, he becomes President.
