**Legally**, there is no distinction. "Driving" is a colloquial term for
"operating a motor vehicle," which is the technical and legal term.

The person operating the motor vehicle is legally known as the "driver"
and the other people inside the car are known as "passengers." But
"driving" is nothing more than a colloquial term for what the operator
of the vehicle does.

We tend to say that a person is "driving a car" when they are operating
it, and the passengers are "riding in a car" when they are simply in the
other occupant positions which are not the driver's position. But the
person sitting in the operating position causing the car to move under
its own power is the "driver" and is "operating a motor vehicle."

In all states in the United States, you must be licensed to operate a
motor vehicle. Colloquially, you must be licensed to drive a motor
vehicle.

It is only sovereign citizen types who try to draw a distinction between
"driving" and "operating a motor vehicle." In reality, there is no legal
distinction in any state law of which I am aware.
