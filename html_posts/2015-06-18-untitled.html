<h2>Answer Comment</h2>
<div>

**Content:** [I didn\'t say \"God,\" I said \"higher power.\" A higher
power can be anything you believe in. It can even be the group
consciousness of a like-minded community. Whatever it is, we know that
it exists.\
\
Some know that it exists and choose to deny its existence as delusion or
fantasy or imagination. But they still believe in absolute morality. But
they have to embrace the fact that an amoral universe accidentally gave
rise to moral creatures, which also violates the laws of causation. So
either the laws of causation are wrong, or there is a higher power.
Can\'t be both.\
\
We do have a higher power, and we do have natural law which originated
from a higher power. The ignorance of this fact only makes life harder
for those who actively choose to ignore it.]{.rendered_qtext}
