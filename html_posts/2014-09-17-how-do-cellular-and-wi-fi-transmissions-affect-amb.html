**Content:** [The amount of power needed to affect oxygen bonds
(essentially splitting the O2 bond and creating free radicals) is far

surrounding an RF microwave tower, but not around a Wi-Fi base station,
even a commercial access point doesn\'t provide the power needed to
split oxygen bonds.]{.rendered_qtext}
