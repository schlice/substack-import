I fear that you, questioner, are under the mistaken impression that
vaccine refusal is somehow due to a lack of information. Like somehow
the people who aren't getting the vaccine aren't doing so because they
are somehow uninformed.

In most cases, this is usually not the case.

Proponents of the vaccine seem unwilling to accept the thinking of
vaccine skeptics, or even accept the fact that they are thinking at all.
But vaccine skepticism [[was studied by
MIT](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=7c4325&url=https://news.mit.edu/2021/when-more-covid-data-doesnt-equal-more-understanding-0304){.external_link

onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="mit.edu"}]{.qlink_container}, and they found that it is
"highly informed, scientifically literate, and sophisticated in the use
of data. Skeptics used the same data sets as those with the orthodox
views on public health.

"The researchers combed through hundreds of thousands of social media
posts and found that coronavirus skeptics often deploy
counter-visualizations alongside the same "follow-the-data" rhetoric as
public health experts, yet the skeptics argue for radically different
policies. The researchers conclude that data visualizations aren't
sufficient to convey the urgency of the Covid-19 pandemic, because even
the clearest graphs can be interpreted through a variety of belief
systems."

And they found that vaccine hesitancy is not based on partisanship, or
lack of information, or Trump, or DeSantis or Florida or any other
excuse the legacy media is telling you.

"\[M\]ost vaccine skepticism, if by that we mean reluctance, is not
based on conspiracy theorizing --- it's based on risk-benefit
calculations. You may think it's an innumerate calculation. But when you
look at patterns of uptake in the United States, two factors stand out,
factors that are larger in their effect than partisanship: age and
density. The older you are and the denser your community, the more
likely you are to be vaccinated. The younger you are, and the more rural
your community, the less likely you are to have gotten it. This reflects
the real facts about the risk of death from COVID. People may be wildly
overestimating their risk from the vaccine and underestimating their
risks from COVID --- but they have the directional thinking correct.
Those who are in less danger, act like it."

In other words, they may have gotten the risk of catching the virus
wrong, and they may have gotten the risk of taking the vaccine wrong,
but they have the general idea right. Most people who are not getting
the vaccine are younger, or live in areas where they are at less risk of
contracting the virus in the first place. In other words, "those who are
in less danger, act like it."

Bottom line: if people have a right to not be vaccinated, then we must
allow them to have their own consequences. We don't have a right to tell
them that they can't go to the hospital if they get sick; we never say
that about anyone ever. Not only is that unethical, it's immoral. Don't
think like that. Maybe they won't be able to use their insurance, and
maybe they'll have to pay for their own hospitalization. But saying they
can't go to the hospital is wrong.

So just to have a complete answer, let me answer your actual question:

**The police can do this, but it's not their job, and vaccine skepticism
is not due to a lack of information.**

Original question:

Why can\'t the police knock on every unvaccinated person\'s door and
provide each of them with a pamphlet that focuses on getting vaccinated?
