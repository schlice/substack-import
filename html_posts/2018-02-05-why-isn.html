Apple does not give away their software for free. You buy Apple's
software every time you buy an Apple product.

Here's the difference: Microsoft is a **software company** and Apple is
a **hardware company.**

Apple sells hardware. The sell iPhones and iPads and MacBooks and a
variety of other hardware. They also distribute software that you can
only legally run on that hardware. Legally, I can't take Mac OS X and
install it on my Dell Precision Tower here under my desk. You are only
licensed to install Apple software on Apple hardware. Apple does not
independently sell software because that software is designed only to
run on the hardware you already bought. Therefore, the cost of Apple's
software is bundled into the hardware you already purchased. You didn't
get Apple software for free. You paid for it when you bought Apple
hardware.

By contrast, Microsoft is a **software company**. Sure, they have made
some forays into the hardware side with devices like the Surface, but by
and large, Microsoft sells software. When you buy a PC with Windows
pre-installed on it, you have received an **OEM** copy of Windows (or
Original Equipment Manufacturer copy). Microsoft entered into a
licensing agreement with that computer manufacturer and they sold copies
of Windows at a bulk discount. The hardware manufacturer then passes on
the lower cost of that copy of Windows to the end consumer in the price
of their computer.

Since you asked about Office, and not about Windows, let's compare
apples to apples:

Apple's iWork suite (which is similar to to Microsoft Office) is priced
under a similar pricing structure. Once you have a license to install
Apple software (which means you have purchased or are otherwise a valid
user of Apple hardware), you can install iWork at no additional charge.
Office 365 is priced under a new Microsoft pricing structure which
recognizes the cloud-based nature of work today, and the requirement for
portability. As a personal user, you can buy a license to Office 365,
for one user, which includes cloud-based access to all of the Office
applications from anywhere, tablet and mobile use, and full installation
on one PC, for \$6.95 per month, or \$69.99 per year. If you want to
purchase the standalone Office software package as with previous
versions of Office, it's \$149.95.

**TL;DR: You actually bought iWork when you bought your Apple hardware.
The cost of Apple's software is rolled into the cost of Apple's
hardware, which is why you cannot install Apple software onto anything
but Apple hardware.**
