**If an employer wants you to sign a written warning but you disagree
with it, should you sign it?**

Generally in the US, signing a warning is only an acknowledgement that
you received the warning. It is not an acceptance or agreement with the
contents of the warning. Generally, the warning document also explains
that your signature only verifies receipt of the warning, it does not
imply agreement or acknowledgement of any wrongdoing.

If the warning does not explicitly state the above, you can always write
"SIGNED UNDER PROTEST" above your signature and then sign it, or you
could refuse to sign it. Refusal to sign will be noted on the form by
the person delivering the warning (usually your supervisor) and will be
yet another red mark against you (the first one being the one triggering
the warning in the first place). You might therefore consider refusal to
acknowledge the warning as "strike two" which makes your future with
that employer seem less bright.
