I'm not sure I understand your question.

Anyone is allowed to have animals for whatever reason they want them.

If you're asking whether or not emotional support animals can somehow be
treated like service animals, the answer is no.

Service animals are specially trained to perform specific tasks to
assist a person with a disability. They are usually dogs, but in some
cases can be miniature horses. Service animals have **full public access
rights** under the law, which means they can go places other animals
can\'t. For example, they can go into restaurants, stores, libraries,
and other public places. They can also go on airplanes and other public
transportation. Essentially, if the public is allowed in a space, a
service animal is allowed in that space.

Emotional Support Animals (ESAs) provide companionship and emotional
support to people who have documented disabilities, but they aren\'t
required to perform specific tasks. They are protected under the Fair
Housing Act (which means they don't count as "pets" in your apartment or
rental property), but hotels aren\'t subject to this act. To legally
have an ESA, the owner must be considered to have a qualifying mental
health or psychiatric disability by a licensed mental health
professional. This is documented by a properly formatted prescription
letter. The landlord should be provided with this letter.

Most importantly, unless your state has special protections for ESAs,
they don\'t have the same protections as service animals. This means you
can't take them everywhere people can go, and businesses can legally
restrict ESAs from their premises. Some businesses allow ESAs, but it is
not a legal requirement. It is up to the business whether or not they
will allow ESAs, and people who own ESAs must be aware that they cannot
legally force businesses to permit ESAs on their premises.
