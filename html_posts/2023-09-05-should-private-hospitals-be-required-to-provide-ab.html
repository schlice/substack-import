If, by "receiving public funding," you mean paying for Medicaid, then
under current United States law, they cannot.

The Hyde Amendment has been re-enacted every year since 1976. It is not
a permanent law, but rather a temporary "rider" to the Congressional
appropriations bill. Congress has the opportunity to lift the Hyde
Amendment each year. But every year, since it was enacted in 1976, they
have added it.

The Hyde Amendment prohibits federal Medicaid funding for abortion
services. The only exceptions are when continuing the pregnancy will
endanger the patient\'s life, or when the pregnancy results from rape or
incest. These circumstances are considered medically necessary health
services.
