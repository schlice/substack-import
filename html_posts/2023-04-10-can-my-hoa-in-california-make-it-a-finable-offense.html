The HOA can make whatever rules they choose, so long as they follow
their procedure for modifying the rules in the particular area of the
Governing Documents they are modifying.

The question you are apparently asking is "can the HOA make a rule that
doesn't respect my right to freedom of speech?"

And the unfortunate answer is **yes.**

Homeowner's associations are generally regarded as private
organizations. The HOA is, in most places, a 501(c)(4) non-profit
corporation. And while the First Amendment prohibits the government from
making rules that curtail your freedom of speech, this does not apply to
private corporations. There are indeed some aspects of the Constitution
that apply to HOAs (since they maintain property, collect "taxes", and
are responsible for other municipal-style duties), but that's where the
similarity ends. The HOA is a private corporation that you join by
contract.

Unless there is some state-level restriction on HOAs in California that
I am unaware of, generally HOAs are considered private corporations, and
they can indeed limit your freedom of speech, including at HOA meetings.
