There are a million different things that can cause muscle weakness,
especially weakness that is concentrated in a certain part of your body
(i.e. your legs). We\'d probably run into some sort of Quora character
limit if we tried to review them all now.

If I were you, I would make an appointment with my primary care doctor
if this is something worrying to you. You and he can order some tests to
figure out what\'s going on, or at least point you in the right
direction.

Good luck!
