The external force need not be a god, but objective moral truth cannot
exist without an external force, be it cooperation between people to
hold to a certain moral standard, or reliance on an external standard.

Otherwise, you only have morals that you infer (i.e. **subjective**),
and my morals may not match yours. For example, I may say that "survival
of the fittest" is my objective moral truth, and I may kill you to
achieve it. There is no objective moral truth that all sentient beings
naturally arrive upon without some external collaboration to achieve it.

HOWEVER, if there is an *imprinted* morality, how did it get there?
Morality cannot develop from nature, as the cold, immoral universe
cannot impart morality onto any of its creations (see the Law of
Causation). Arguing such implies that you can get something from
nothing, which is a postulation long since abandoned.
