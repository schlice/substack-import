**How could Trump find a good reason to declare Martial Law in order to
remain the President when he should legally leave office?**

This question shows that the OP doesn\'t know what marital law in the
United States does.

In the US, martial law is basically the suspension of *habeas corpus,*
or more generally, suspension of the oversight of the executive by the
judiciary. People can be arrested without probable cause, and held
without trial for extended periods. This is normally done to quell
uprisings and restore order.

There is no provision which can be implemented by the President to allow
him to stay in office beyond the natural conclusion of his term.
