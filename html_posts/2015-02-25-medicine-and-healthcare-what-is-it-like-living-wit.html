**Content:** [Thanks for the A2A, but I don\'t have PPMS. I have
Relapsing-Remitting MS (RRMS), so I can\'t relate to what it\'s like
living with PPMS.\
\
What I do know is that PPMS is fundamentally different from all the
other forms of the disease. The other forms of the disease, including
RRMS and Secondary Progressive MS (SPMS) (to a degree), are
characterized by demyelination and nervous system inflammation. In other
words, the other forms of the disease are inflammatory in nature. The MS
medications we have today treat the inflammation in the nervous system,
reducing severity of symptoms and decreasing the duration of relapses.\
\
PPMS is primarily not inflammatory in nature, it is categorized by nerve
degeneration without the relapsing/remitting inflammation. Therefore,
none of our current treatments, which target the inflammatory response
and not the degenerative response, are effective with PPMS. While we
have a fair understanding of the inflammatory response, and we have a
fair ability to control that response to a degree, the underlying
degenerative response is still unknown.\
\
PPMS primarily affects the spinal column, so the most prevalent symptoms
are gait, bowel/bladder problems, and sexual dysfunction.\
\
I can imagine what it would be like if my right-side weakness never got
better. I think I\'d be using a cane by now.]{.rendered_qtext}
