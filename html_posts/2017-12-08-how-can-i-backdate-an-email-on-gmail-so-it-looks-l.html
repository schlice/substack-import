**How can I backdate an email on Gmail so it looks like the email was
sent on a previous date?**

Within Gmail, there isn't a way to change the send date. When using
sendmail (the protocol which sends electronic mail between servers), you
can add the sent date as part of your custom header, but the actual
timestamp is embedded by the server, not the sender.

So the short answer is: you can't.
