**What happens if the US Senate ties 50-50 on whether to call witnesses
in the Trump impeachment trial?**

You need a simple majority in order to change a rule. The President of
the Senate (the VPOTUS) is usually the tie-breaker, but because of
conflict of interest when a President has been impeached and is on
trial, the Chief Justice of the SCOTUS acts as the presiding chair of
the Senate during the trial.

However, Roberts is not a voting member of the Senate. He is not
President *Pro Tempore* of the Senate. He is simply the chair of the
proceedings. Therefore, it is extremely unlikely that Roberts would cast
a vote at all.

Therefore, as I said in Sentence One, you need a simple majority in
order to change a rule. That means you need 51 votes to change the rule
and add a rule that allows calling of witnesses. If you have a tie, that
means you only have 50 votes in favor of changing the rule, which is one
vote shy of the majority you need to change the rule.

With 50 votes, the motion fails to carry. No witnesses.
