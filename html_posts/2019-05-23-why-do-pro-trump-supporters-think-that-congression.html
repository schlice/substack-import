**Why do pro-Trump supporters think that Congressional oversight does
not apply to him?**

Because unless that oversight is directly related to drafting or
improving a law or ensuring laws are being executed as written, then
direct Congressional oversight does not apply to him.

Congressional oversight is a tool which is specifically designed to
allow Congress to evaluate the effectiveness of the laws they write, so
that they can improve their laws, or maybe even write better laws. They
can also ensure that laws are being executed in the way in which they
intended, and if they are not, the laws can be amended, or new laws can
be written. For example, if Congress believes an agency is not operating
in accordance with its original mandate, it can pass a law to "refocus"
that agency on the principles upon which it was originally established.

There is nothing in the Constitution that allows Congress to oversee
Federal agencies. It is an *implied* power rather than a enumerated
power. But in all cases, it has to do specifically with laws written,
and how efficiently or effectively Federal agencies are implementing the
law.

Oversight entails a number of overlapping objectives:

> - improve the efficiency, economy, and effectiveness of governmental
>   operations;
> - evaluate programs and performance;
> - detect and prevent poor administration, waste, abuse, arbitrary and
>   capricious behavior, or illegal and unconstitutional conduct;
> - protect civil liberties and constitutional rights;
> - inform the general public and ensure that executive policies reflect
>   the public interest;
> - gather information to develop new legislative proposals or to amend
>   existing statutes;
> - ensure administrative compliance with legislative intent; and
> - prevent executive encroachment on legislative authority and
>   prerogatives.[\[1\]](#mMoQo){#cite-mMoQo .citation_link}

Notice that all of these reasons why Congress has oversight authority
over the Executive are all rooted in *legislation*. The ultimate reason
why Congress watches the Executive is to ensure that their laws are
being carried out as effectively and efficiently as possible.

**Congress writes laws. Congress does not investigate crimes.**

If Congress believes a crime was committed, it is incumbent on Congress
to report this information to the judiciary, or to the Attorney General.
They would normally report this information to the Court of Appeals for
the DC Circuit, or directly to the Attorney General's office and the
Department of Justice. The AG can then engage the FBI to investigate the
allegation. They can also engage the Inspector General's office in the
particular agency in which the alleged crime was discovered.

***But Congressional oversight is not about searching for crimes. That's
literally not their job.***

The only other Constitutional remedy Congress has if they believe an
appointed Federal official is committing crimes is impeachment. The
House Judiciary Committee is well within its authority to draft a
resolution to open an impeachment inquiry. That they have not done this
smacks of political dinner theater rather than actual Congressional
authority to oversee the legislative process.
