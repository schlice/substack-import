**Is corruption defined by criminal law statutes, civil law statutes,
the Constitution, or a general sense of corrupt action?**

First, you must define "corruption." Corruption is using the power of
your political office illegally for personal (usually financial) gain.

There are Federal anti-corruption statutes for government officials. It
is illegal for a government official to sell favors, or use their office
for personal gain in addition to their salary. Penalties include fines,
jail time, removal from office and prohibition from holding any other
government office, and being sued for damages in civil court.

Most states have similar anti-corruption laws for their state officials.
