My guess is you're looking at a Ford, a common law enforcement vehicle
brand.

If so, you're looking at the door lock keypad.

Ford is well known for having vehicles with a 5-button keypad on the
driver's side B-pillar. Input a 5-digit code, and the driver's door
opens. Then press the 3/4 button, and all doors open, or press the 5/6
button and the powered trunk/powered liftgate opens. If you press the
7/8 and 9/0 buttons together, all doors lock.
