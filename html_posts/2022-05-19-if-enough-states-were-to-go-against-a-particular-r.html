The Court doesn't issue "rulings" that states must follow. The Court
simply decides whether a law, or the way the law is implemented,
violates the Constitution.

For example, the draft opinion from the court regarding *Dobbs v.
Jackson Women's Health* says that the law is Constitutional because the
grounds upon which the case was appealed (a violation of the finding in
*Roe v. Wade*) are unconstitutional. In doing this, the Court is stating
that the finding in *Griswold v. Connecticut* (that a right to privacy
exists in the Constitution) was incorrectly decided and is reversed, and
that the finding which flowed from it in *Roe v. Wade* (that the right
to privacy found in *Griswold* extended to abortion rights) is also
reversed.

Therefore, since none of these things are actually
Constitutionally-guaranteed rights, the question of whether or not those
things are *legal* falls back on the states to decide. States are
actually free to do as they please when it comes to abortion. Some
states will ban it, most states will apply some level of restriction to
it, and some states will allow it completely.

However, if the Supreme Court finds that a law is constitutional, any
state "going against" that finding (and enforcing the unconstitutional
law anyway) will find that the aggrieved party will file suit in
district court alleging that the law is unconstitutional based on the
Supreme Court's findings, and the law in that state will be ruled
unconstitutional and will be unenforceable.

At best, the state could re-write the law to achieve the same goal,
while doing so in a Constitutional way.

Original question:

If enough states were to go against a particular ruling from the Supreme
Court, could they possibly overrule it?
