Your easiest option is to talk to a lawyer. If you can substantiate
stalking and harassment over a three year period, your lawyer can help
you file a lawsuit against the department. At the very least, they can
bring the matter to the attention of the department and the district
attorney in such a way that if they happened to be unaware of it, they'd
certainly be aware now, and it should stop either way.

Another option would be to contact the nearest branch of the ACLU
(American Civil Liberties Union) for assistance. I know, also lawyers,
but since it's a little different, I added it separately.
