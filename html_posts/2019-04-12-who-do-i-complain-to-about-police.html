Feel free to go down to the department and file a formal complaint.

If you don't feel that you've been treated fairly or that they've
actually heard your complaint, you can go to whichever government runs
that department (i.e. if it's a Sheriff's office, go to the Board of
Commissioners for the county; if it's a city police department, go to
City Council or the Mayor's office; if it's State Police, go to the
Governor's office or the state AG).
