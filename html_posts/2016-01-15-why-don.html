The problem we face here is that regardless of your gender identity,
*your genes don\'t lie*.

Therefore, while *gender identity* is a construct of a conscious mind, a
*gender* is a physiological construct that no surgery can ever alter. If
you were born a woman, you will always have two X chromosomes.

Gender, therefore, is not something you can \"abolish,\" legal or
otherwise. It will always exist. And regardless of your gender identity,
the male and female of the species are required to procreate. Therefore,
at some level, we *must* maintain gender if we are to survive as a
species.
