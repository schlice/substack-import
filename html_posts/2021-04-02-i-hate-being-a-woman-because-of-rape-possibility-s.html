**I hate being a woman because of rape possibility strongly higher than
man, it's not fair. How do I overcome it?**

Know that you're not the only one who can look at life and claim that
it's "not fair."

Men look at life every day and could easily claim that it's "not fair"
to be a man. How can I say that?

- 97% of combat deaths are men
- 76% of homicide victims are men
- 93% of industrial accidents happen to men
- 80% of suicides are men
- 16% of men win their custody suits
- 93% of the prison population is male
- 70% of the homeless population is male

I don't want to dismiss your fear; rape is primarily a crime which has
women as its victims.

But you're not the only one who has the deck stacked against them.
