The 25th Amendment was designed to lay out the succession of power
should the president become unable to carry out his duties.

Congress does not need to be involved in the approval unless the
President is upright and breathing and still retains his faculties.

The VP, and a majority of the Cabinet, tells the Speaker of the House
and the President pro tempore of the Senate that the VP is taking over
as President, and they are done. The amendment does not require
Congress' approval.

Section 4:

> Whenever the Vice President and a majority of either the principal
> officers of the executive departments or of such other body as
> Congress may by law provide, transmit to the President pro tempore of
> the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives their
> written declaration that the President is unable to discharge the
> powers and duties of his office, the Vice President shall immediately
> assume the powers and duties of the office as Acting President.

Then, the President gets to rebut the claim, and the original group gets
to rebut the rebuttal:

> Thereafter, when the President transmits to the President pro tempore
> of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives his
> written declaration that no inability exists, he shall resume the
> powers and duties of his office unless the Vice President and a

***THEN***, it goes to Congress to decide if the President is really
unfit to serve. They have to approve the usurper's claim with a
supermajority (2/3 in both Houses) before the usurpation sticks.

So "someone authorized by law" says "You are unable to serve." President
says, "No I'm not," and the usurper says, "Yes you are." Then Congress
decides who is right.

"Unfit to serve" means physically incapable of carrying out the duties
of the office. It doesn't mean doing so ***poorly***. It means being
***unable to do so at all.*** The President can be embarrassing or crude
or even irreverent. None of that is grounds for removal from office
under the 25th Amendment. And Congress knows it. You'll get a lot of
Democrats to go along with it, but with both houses controlled by
Republicans, you'll never get a supermajority out of Congress for this.
