Not necessarily, but you're approaching precariously close to a very
serious sin.

Because next, after declaring that "video games and other frivolous
things" are more fun than God, you might go on to say, "I want to
ignore, disobey, and dishonor God and spend all my time with video games
and other frivolous things."

And you can probably guess what might happen if "video games and other
frivolous things" become your god instead of God.

The First Commandment addresses this: "I am the LORD your God. You shall
have no other gods before me."

If you allow something else to become "god" in your life, you are indeed
committing a very serious sin.
