The United States holds that the rights granted to citizens cannot be
abridged without due process. The 5th amendment says that citizens
cannot be deprived of "life, liberty, or property without due process of
the law." Guns are most definitely property.

How is someone placed on the terror watchlist? No one knows. The process
is secret.

Does someone on the terror watchlist have the opportunity to appeal? No,
there is no process.

Does someone on the terror watchlist get notified that they are added to
the watchlist? No. They find out when they try to buy a plane ticket and
discover they are on the "No Fly list" which is a derivative of the
terror watchlist. Trying to keep the bad guys from boarding planes and
flying them into buildings again.

Therefore, addition to the terror watchlist does not involve any
semblance of due process.

You cannot summarily deny a guaranteed right in the Constitution without
due process.

Therefore, **you cannot summarily remove someone's right to keep and
bear arms without the same due process.** Since addition to the terror
watchlist involves no semblance of due process at all, you cannot
therefore use it as a basis to lawfully deny someone a Constitutional
right.

You could potentially modify the process and ***delay*** the purchase of
a gun, alert the government, and give them the opportunity to bring
charges against the person, but if they fail to do so, we default to
allow the purchase to proceed.

But I don't think that's in any of the current proposals.

Thus, the stupidity of the argument.
