All three of those things can be true at the same time, because none of
them are in conflict:

- Unbelievers will go to hell. Unbelievers are people who know the truth
  and actively reject it.
- Every knee will bow, and every tongue will confess that Christ is Lord
  (Phillipians 2:10--11). Even those who did not believe will eventually
  believe. But if they do so unwillingly, they should not expect
  leniency.
- God is indeed infinitely loving. But He is also infinitely just, and
  He can be both at the same time. His commands are for our good
  (Jeremiah 29:11). It is perfectly loving to say that if you willingly
  violate His commands, you receive the due results of your actions. It
  would be patently unloving to have rules in place that you don't
  enforce.

"Evangelicals" do not decide if people go to hell or not. That's
entirely up to God.

That said, we can (and we are commanded to) point out things that
believers might be doing which is sinful. In fact, it would be
*unloving* to **not** point out sin in others for which they may not
have repented.

> **Don't unbelievers have a chance?**

People who are willfully ignorant have already had their shot. Indeed,
the Bible says that everyone knows about God through simply viewing His
creation, as well as what is written on their hearts

> *For his invisible attributes, namely, his eternal power and divine
> nature, have been clearly perceived, ever since the creation of the
> world, in the things that have been made. So they are without excuse.

Original question:

**The Bible says unbelievers go to hell but it also says every knee will
eventually confess to god and that he is all loving? So why do
evangelicals still think they have a right to decide if people go to
hell or not? Don't unbelievers have a chance?**
