**Why do some people drive illegally in the HOV lane with no passenger
during traffic knowing that they will be fined if caught?**

Risking fines is what you would call a "calculated risk." On the plus
side, you get to completely bypass traffic. On the minus side, you could
face a \$500 fine (in some places, may be higher or lower in your neck
of the woods).

This is a risk/reward calculation that people make. Should I *risk*
losing \$500 so that I can reap the *reward* of bypassing traffic
without having a passenger in my car? If the risk is too great (i.e. the
fine is not money you're willing to throw away), you don't break the
law. If the risk is acceptable to you (you're willing to lose the \$500
to pay for the privilege of illegally driving in the HOV lane), you do
it.

If you want to curb illegal HOV lane usage, you must simultaneously
increase patrols and monitoring of HOV lanes, and you must increase
fines to make it financially unwise to break that law. When it becomes
*more costly* to break the law than it does to follow it, then the law
breaking will stop.
