**Content:** [There was a study done that showed that people with MS had
lower levels of copper (and zinc) in their system. They even came up
with a hypothesis for how the lower levels of metals could relate to MS.
They hypothesized that because copper has an ameliorative effect against
demyelination (copper helps to prevent fat cell damage, and myelin is a
fatty acid), a lower level of the mineral in the bloodstream could lead
to more damage of myelin during disease activity. Therefore,
malabsorption of metals like copper and zinc could have a contributory
effect on MS.\
\
There are no studies that I am aware of that have otherwise reviewed
copper\'s relationship to MS.\
\
There are no studies that I am aware of that have focused specifically
on Cu77 and its relationship to MS.\
\
Remember though that correlation does not equal causation. Just because
a correlation was discovered between MS patients and lower levels of
heavy metals does not mean that lower levels of heavy metals causes
MS.]{.rendered_qtext}
