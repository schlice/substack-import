The Cockpit Voice Recorder and the Flight Data Recorder are fairly
simplistic boxes capable of recording essentially all telemetry and
voice communications on the aircraft. If the aircraft crashes in water,
the underwater locator beacon is activated, and will continually
\"ping\" until its battery dies.\
\
You could certainly fit a CVR and a FDR with bigger batteries, but to
what end? Do most searches take longer than 30 days? Is this a constant
problem (beacons running out before they are found)?\
\
The answer is that most searches are very short and are concluded in a
much shorter timeframe than 30 days. 30 days is a very generous number
for a search.\
\
Plus, any change you make to any aircraft system is very heavily
regulated, and would be made in an industry which has some of the
thinnest profit margins of any industry. In 2012, Forbes published a
study that said that airlines make a grand total of \$4 in profit per
passenger. Any changes that would cut into that profit are going to be
very heavily scrutinized.\
\
EDIT: Since the late 90s, military aircraft have been fitted with a
second set of CVDRs (combined cockpit voice and data recorders) that are
\"deployable\" and \"eject\" from the aircraft just milliseconds before
impact, will float on water, and contain an ELT (electronic locator
transmitter) which transmits its location to satellites. Congress has
been unable to pass the legislation to implement the new system, which
would be covered by taxpayers, into commercial aircraft. The SAFE (Safe
Aviation Flight Enhancement) Act was re-introduced in Congress following
the MH-370 incident, highlighting the limitations of the current system.
