If the aircraft crashes in water,<br>the underwater locator beacon is activated, and will continually<br>\"ping\" until its battery dies.\<br>\<br>You could certainly fit a CVR and a FDR with bigger batteries, but to<br>what end? Do most searches take longer than 30 days? Is this a constant<br>problem (beacons running out before they are found)?\<br>\<br>The answer is that most searches are very short and are concluded in a<br>much shorter timeframe than 30 days. 30 days is a very generous number<br>for a search.\<br>\<br>Plus, any change you make to any aircraft system is very heavily<br>regulated, and would be made in an industry which has some of the<br>thinnest profit margins of any industry. In 2012, Forbes published a<br>study that said that airlines make a grand total of \$4 in profit per<br>passenger. Any changes that would cut into that profit are going to be<br>very heavily scrutinized.\<br>\<br>EDIT: Since the late 90s, military aircraft have been fitted with a<br>second set of CVDRs (combined cockpit voice and data recorders) that are<br>\"deployable\" and \"eject\" from the aircraft just milliseconds before<br>impact, will float on water, and contain an ELT (electronic locator<br>transmitter) which transmits its location to satellites. Congress has<br>been unable to pass the legislation to implement the new system, which<br>would be covered by taxpayers, into commercial aircraft. The SAFE (Safe<br>Aviation Flight Enhancement) Act was re-introduced in Congress following<br>the MH-370 incident, highlighting the limitations of the current system.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
