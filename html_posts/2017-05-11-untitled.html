This is the first time I've read this as well.

I was there in the room for the birth of all three of my boys. My oldest
son was born 21 years ago, and they had a segregated, sterile delivery
room, and then a "semi-private" LR room. My other two were all born in
LDR rooms. I agree wholeheartedly with your sentiment. So I was in my
scrubs when my son was born. I was actually mouth agape behind my mask
when my son was born, and I literally had to think about closing my
mouth in order to remember to take a picture. It was the most
awe-inspiring feeling I have ever felt. I never knew how deeply I could
love until I saw that one event.

(side note: I didn't cut any cords. I decided to let the doctor earn
their paychecks ;-)

And I cried like a baby throughout your story, with equal parts joy and
sorrow. Excellent writing, thanks for sharing.
