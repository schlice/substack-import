What's wrong with getting baptized without believing in God?

**Nothing.**

There is absolutely nothing wrong with being baptized without believing
in God.

And if you think there is something wrong with it, you don't understand
what baptism is.

More importantly though, if you don't believe in God but you still want
to be baptized, **then it is you who does not understand what baptism
is.**

\

First of all, let's talk about what baptism is. Baptism, or water
immersion, is an outward sign of an inward faith. Baptism doesn't do
anything magical for you. In other words, **baptism doesn't save you;
baptism is what saved people do.**

Once you are saved, *then* you make the choice to be baptized, *to show
everyone else that you are obedient to God.*

Does it hurt you to dunk under the water and come back up? No, not at
all. Most of us have taken a bath or went swimming at least once in our
lives, and we probably have performed that one maneuver countless times.

But baptism, which is essentially taking a dunk under the water, is
different. But it's different not because of the action of dunking under
the water; that's commonplace. It's why we do it and what we believe
about it that makes baptism special.

Baptism is an outward display to everyone else that you believe Christ
died for your sins, and that He is your Lord and Savior. Partaking in
baptism means that you believe these things, too. So you are declaring,
to this group of people that you believe are healthy and you want to be
friends with, that you too believe as they do. Could you *lie* and say
you believe those things in order to be baptized? Sure. In fact, I'd
posit that it happens more often than we think. But again, baptism
doesn't do anything for you. It doesn't gain you anything. It is
commanded of believers, so we do it.

If the only reason you want to be baptized is to be "part of the crowd,"
you've got it backwards. Be part of the crowd by standing out from the
crowd. Believe and be saved first, and then we'll talk about doing the
things that saved people do. Maybe you want to be part of the crowd so
badly that you're willing to lie to do it. But why? If you don't believe
what they believe, why do you want to be part of their group so badly? I
wouldn't want to spend my time with people who do not believe as I do.

Maybe instead of wanting to do the things they do, you should instead be
asking them to explain why they believe what they believe, and then if
you believe those things, you can do the things they do.

\

Next, I want to address your studying of the Bible as a JW. You were, no
doubt, studying the New World Translation, the only version of the Bible
specifically edited and modified in order to fit the beliefs of a
specific faith. So you may have been studying a version of the Bible,
but you must understand that it is not the whole truth. It was edited to
fit the beliefs of JWs. Rather than conforming their faith to the Bible,
JWs decided to write a Bible which fit their faith. That's kinda not how
faith works.

Maybe if you want to fit in with the group of friends who appear to be
healthy, you should find out what exactly they believe, and you can
start by reading a translation of the Bible which was not specifically
edited to deliver a unique, man-made message. Perhaps you should read
*literally any other translation* of the Bible, but I'd suggest reading
the English Standard Version (as it's easier to read), or the New
International Version (because it's a much closer word-for-word
translation).

Good luck to you, and I pray for all the best for you.
