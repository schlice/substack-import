There's literally no one on this platform who could conceivably speak
for "the vast majority of Trump supporters." I can't speak to what
"Trump supporters" think, because I'm really unsure what it means to
"support" a former President. Support him in what, exactly?

No one dismisses philosophy as gibberish. People either understand
philosophy and accept it for what it is, or they don't understand
philosophy and they ignore it, and people who talk about it. They know
their own versions of right and wrong, and they live by that moral
standard.

Most Conservatives dislike Trump as a person, but are grateful for the
work he did for the country. I fall squarely into the Conservative camp.
And I'm not a fan of Trump the man. I judge how much of a fan I am of a
person by whether or not I'd enjoy sitting down and having a beer with
him. For example, I'm a fan of Obama. I'd enjoy spending time to sit
down and have a beer with the man, even though I am diametrically
opposed to his politics. As for Trump, I'm glad for the work he did as
president. His list of accomplishments is long and storied, and the
country is indeed a better place for them. However, he is a brash,
bombastic womanizing New Yorker, and he "broke a lot of eggs" to make
the omelette he was trying to make. He broke more eggs than he probably
needed to, and that's irritating to me. I would not enjoy sitting down
to have a beer with him.

Conservatives (especially Conservatives like me who understand
philosophy) have the ability to separate the *politics* from the
*person*.
