Your best bet is to do a factory reset. Your phone will wipe and will be
re-installed from the recovery partition. Unless you've been doing some
interesting phone hacking yourself, your recovery partition will have a
clean version of Android in it. Once you wipe and reboot, your phone
will reach out to the Google Play Store and re-install the apps you had
previously.

There may be some bits of data that don't get recovered, especially if
they were not stored in a cloud-based account.

(EDIT) Since the question changed, let's update the answer.

**How do I stop a relentless hacker from hacking my Android phone? I\'ve
changed phones and numbers and eventually it\'s right back.**

If your hacker is as relentless as you claim, then it's not about
hacking your phone. It's about you.

If you are certain it's a hacker targeting you, contact the police. Let
them help you catch the hacker. If he's persistent, he'll eventually get
caught.
