"Take every thought captive."

Have you heard that phrase before? It comes from 2 Corinthians 10:5.

> We destroy arguments and every lofty opinion raised against the
> knowledge of God, and take every thought captive to obey Christ (ESV)

Paul is offering us a way to keep our minds focused on the things of
heaven rather than the distractions of the world. But how do we "take
every thought captive?" It is a three-pronged effort:

1.  Ask for God's guidance
2.  Repent (turn away) from sin
3.  Maintain a continuous relationship with God's Word.

Author Christina Patterson says, "Our thoughts lead to our beliefs,
which lead to our actions, which lead to the quality of our lives. Our
thoughts have too great of an impact for us not to guard them and keep
our mind on God\'s will."

So what about the question, when you say that you sometimes think that
your good deed saved you? Well, "take that thought captive." What does
that look like? When you think the thought:

1.  Stop and ask the Holy Spirit to guide you.
2.  Release the thought through confession. You could even explore
    writing it down, or journaling.
3.  Compare what you think to what you ***know***, and that is the truth
    of the Bible. We know that the Bible tells us that our faith saves
    us, not our works. Recall James 2:24:

> "You see that a person is considered righteous by what they do and not
> by faith alone." (ESV)

James isn't saying that works saves you. James is saying that you *see*
a person is righteous by what they do. In other words, *if you don't see
the works, you can probably guess that there's no faith.* **Their faith
will produce fruit (works).** And Matthew 7:16--20 tells us that you can
tell a tree by its fruit:

> You will recognize them by their fruits. Are grapes gathered from
> thornbushes, or figs from thistles? So, every healthy tree bears good
> fruit, but the diseased tree bears bad fruit. A healthy tree cannot
> bear bad fruit, nor can a diseased tree bear good fruit. Every tree
> that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
> Thus you will recognize them by their fruits. (ESV)

And, of course, the ultimate and unequivocal passage in Ephesians 2:8--9
tells us that it is faith alone that saves us:

> "It is by grace you have been saved, through faith---and this is not
> from yourselves, it is the gift of God---not by works, so that no one
> can boast." (ESV)

So you remind yourself that ***it is faith which begets good works;***
*not the other way around.* Works do not save you. Only faith saves you.
