In the police car is not considered formal arrest, it is considered a
"detention" which an officer is allowed to do for his own safety and
yours. You were "detained," not "arrested," For an arrest to be recorded
in III, you need to be processed into the criminal justice system. You
need to be booked into the jail, ID'd, fingerprinted, photographed, and
placed into a cell. The DA still has 72 hours to charge you or release
you, so you can be "arrested, never charged" but if you've been
arrested, you know it. And there's no way you get an III printout a mile
long if you've never been arrested before.
