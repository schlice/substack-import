- Crime in general would skyrocket, especially violent crimes with guns,
  since only criminals would have guns. Citizens who choose to remain
  unarmed would be completely defenseless.
- Self-defense shootings would skyrocket, as the only people able to
  defend themselves would be armed citizens.
- Police officers would become targets of every lawless criminal and
  crazed half-baked nutjob who believes that police are all racist and
  gets a wild hair and decides to go kill some cops. This will lead to
  many officers quitting, as they would rather take off the uniform so
  they can be an armed civilian than wear the uniform and become an
  unarmed walking target.

In short, states would become ineffective at enforcing their laws, and
would eventually have to call *someone* with guns (i.e. the National
Guard) to restore order.

So the short answer is that only people with guns can maintain order
amongst other people with guns.
