You'll probably have to be more specific as to which Supreme Court
ruling you are referring.

I can *assume* you're talking about the recent (17 Apr 25) Supreme Court
of India ruling regarding homebuyers, since that's roughly around the
same time as this question.

In that ruling, the SC of India ruled that peaceful protesting (in this
case, with signs) against home builders is permitted free speech.

The homebuyers were respectful in their protest. "We find that the
manner of the protest resorted to by the appellants was peaceful and
orderly and without in any manner using offensive or abusive language.
It could not be said that the appellants crossed the lakshman rekha and
transgressed into the offending zone," the court said. There was "no
foul" or rough language used. "There is no reference to any expression
like 'fraud, cheating, misappropriation,' etc. In mild and temperate
language, certain issues, which the appellants perceived as their
grievances have been aired," the court noted.

So how will this change the relationship between homebuyers and
builders? Builders should do well to listen to the concerns of their
homebuyers. Dissatisfaction should be addressed with the utmost care and
timely attention, or dissatisfied homebuyers could peacefully protest
and air those grievances in public.
