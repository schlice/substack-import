The media is in full-on panic mode.

They have never had to deal with anyone like Trump, and to them, that is
"dangerous." Trump is not beholden to them, so he represents a threat to
their position in the order of things. And people will go to great
lengths to protect their place in the hierarchy.

So they are doing their utmost to do the only thing they can: absolutely
destroy and decimate Trump.

*Nah, Bill, the media isn't really trying to destroy Trump. They're
impartial!*

Heh, they used to be a long time ago. We've known for quite some time
that they were nothing more than the media arm for the Democrat Party,
but this week, they have actually **admitted** that this is what they
are. They have admitted that they are in fact trying to destroy Trump.

In this piece, normally-level-headed-for-a-journalist writer Jim
Rutenberg lays it all out there. He says it's time to throw objectivity
out the window, and it's time to be oppositional (as if they haven't
been oppositional for the past 25 years, if not longer):

> If you\'re a working journalist and you believe that Donald J. Trump
> is a demagogue playing to the nation\'s worst racist and nationalistic
> tendencies \[\...\] how the heck are you supposed to cover him?
>
> Because if you believe all of those things, you have to throw out the
> textbook American journalism has been using for the better part of the
> past half-century, if not longer, and approach it in a way you\'ve
> never approached anything in your career.
>
> If you \[a journalist\] view a Trump presidency as something that\'s
> potentially dangerous, then your reporting is going to reflect that.
> You would move closer than you\'ve ever been to being oppositional.
> That\'s uncomfortable and uncharted territory for every mainstream,
> non-opinion journalist I\'ve ever known, and by normal standards,
> untenable.[\[1\]](#rDWrl){#cite-rDWrl .citation_link}

I needed to go over this piece in the New York Times to underscore what
you're dealing with here in the media.

Since their **stated** end-game is the complete decimation and
destruction of Trump, they will latch on to *anything* that they can,
blow it out of proportion, and try to make you believe it. This is the
new media playbook. Under the old playbook, if the media did this, the
candidate would have to make a public appearance, walk back his
statement, and he would be so decimated that he would have to drop out
of the race. They've been very successful doing this in the past. But it
doesn't work with Trump. When they do this against Trump, he *doubles
down* his previous "misstatement" and turns it back on his opponent.
It's like nothing they've ever seen. But they keep trying.

It happened a few weeks ago, when Trump was giving a press conference
during the Democrat National Convention (another unfathomable thing,
according to politics-as-usual, but yet the media covered every word of
it). He was discussing the then-recent email dump on Wikileaks, and he
was asked whether or not he thought Russia was the source of the emails.
He said (paraphrasing), hey Russia, maybe you can find Hillary's missing
30,000 emails. I'm sure the media will reward you mightily. It was an
attempt at humor, aimed at people who clearly have no sense of it.

The liberal media, at that moment, lost their collective minds. They
believed that Trump was *actually asking Russia to conduct espionage
against the United States*. It's unheard of! We have never seen anything
like this before in our lifetimes! It's untenable! A presidential
candidate *actually calling for Russia to conduct espionage against the
US!* He should be arrested! The FBI should start an investigation!

But it didn't have any legs. Because it's a bunch of crap.

And it's happening again. Remember the new media playbook: listen for
words. Twist the words into something completely different. Attempt to
get the American people to believe the new twisted words to destroy the
candidate. These words are in relation to Second Amendment people.

"If she gets to pick her judges, nothing you can do folks," he said.
"Although the Second Amendment people, maybe there is, I don't know."

Once again, the media decided these would be the words they'd use to try
to destroy Trump. *He's calling on gun owners to assassinate Hillary!
He's a maniac! He's inciting violence!*

In true Trump form, he doubled down, reminding people that he was
calling for Second Amendment supporters to *vote* against Hillary, not
*aim or fire* at her:

"This is a political movement, this is a strong powerful movement, the
Second Amendment. Hillary wants to take your guns away. She wants to
leave you unprotected in your home.

\"And there can be no other interpretation,\" Trump said. \"I mean, give
me a break.\"

The "I mean, give me a break" was a dig at the media for, once again,
trying to twist his words and destroy him, which he will never allow to
happen. Mike Pence, the Vice Presidential nominee, also weighed in on
the statement: \"Trump is urging people around this country to act
consistent with their convictions in the course of this election, and
people who cherish the Second Amendment have a very clear choice in this
election.\"

#UnderstatementOfTheYear. All people have a very clear choice in this
election. Liberty or tyrrany. It's as simple as that.
