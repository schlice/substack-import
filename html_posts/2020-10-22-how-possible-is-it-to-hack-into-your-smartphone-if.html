**How possible is it to hack into your smartphone if someone stole your
\'Ring\' doorbell?**

**TL;DR: Unless you've jailbroken or rooted your phone, it's exceedingly
unlikely that your phone will be hacked.**

Your network, however, is another story altogether.

Once someone has stolen your Ring doorbell, they now have the key to
your wireless network. The doorbell has your wireless network's
information, and the hacker can spoof the doorbell's identity to enter
your network. They can do all sorts of nefarious things around your
network, but most importantly, they can *monitor* your network.

They don't have to hack into your smartphone to watch you log in to your
email.

And once you do that, *they have the keys to the kingdom.*

With your email account, they can reset your password on **any other
account you have:** banking, home mortgage, social media, everything.

They can blast out your email and do the whole "forgot password" thing
and when your providers dutifully send you password reset links to your
email, they can activate those and they now have control of
*everything*.

So here's a few things you can do ***right now*** to secure your digital
life:

1.  **Turn on two-factor authentication on your email account. If your
    email provider does not use two-factor authentication, dump them.**
    Note that Apple and Google both use two-factor authentication.
    Apple's is on by default; you have to turn Google's on.
2.  If you use the same password at more than one service, **change
    them.** Never use the same password at more than one service. A good
    scheme which helps you remember your password is to use a password
    scheme that incorporates the name of the service into the password.
    So for example, you could have passwords like,
    "Th1s1smyTw1tt3rP@ssw0rd!" for Twitter and
    "Th1s1smyFaceb00kP@ssw0rd!" for Facebook. I actually don't recommend
    using those two passwords because they're really easy to guess, but
    you get the idea. These are different passwords, but you only need
    to remember the pattern.

Then, if your Ring doorbell is stolen, **immediately delete your
wireless network and create a new one**. You will need access to your
wireless router to do this. You should learn how to do this now in case
this happens to you. You will then need to re-connect every wireless
device you own to the new wireless network. Yes, it's time-consuming,
but it is eminently necessary to protect yourself and your smart home
(to the extent that you have built one out).
