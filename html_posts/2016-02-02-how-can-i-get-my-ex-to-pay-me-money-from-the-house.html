Other than asking really, really nicely,

answer is sadly your only course of action. You need a lawyer.
Hopefully, your lawyer can help prove your financial investment in the
house, which means that regardless of whose name the title is in, you
have a portion of the financial interest in the house.

Again (as was previously stated), you\'re not going to get very far
without a lawyer, and YMMV depending on the specific laws in your
jurisdiction.

I wish you the best of luck in your struggle.
