**Is it outrageous that MGM Resorts International has filed federal
lawsuits against more than 1,000 victims of last October's mass shooting
in Las Vegas in an apparent attempt to avoid liability?**

***Not at all.***

As with any opinion site masquerading as news, you have to do your
homework.

Doing your homework reveals

What you find is that the people who MGM sued are people who have
already sued MGM, or have threatened to sue MGM. MGM's lawsuit is in
accordance with the [[federal SAFETY
Act](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=ead50f&url=https://www.safetyact.gov/){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="safetyact.gov"}]{.qlink_container}, which provides "a
calibrated balance of remedies and limitations on liabilities arising
from mass attacks committed on U.S. soil where services certified by the
Department of Homeland Security were
deployed."[\[1\]](#PfsxC){#cite-PfsxC .citation_link} Since MGM used the
security services of Contemporary Services Corporation, "whose security
services have been certified by the Secretary of Homeland Security for
protecting against and responding to acts of mass injury and
destruction," (*ibid)* according to the SAFETY Act, any cases for relief
of injury due to mass violence where DHS certified services were used
are exclusively Federal cases under original jurisdiction, not to be
handled in the local courts.

Obviously, MGM is looking to dismiss these actions because the victims
need to sue Contemporary Services Corporation, not MGM, since the SAFETY
act provides that "\[s\]uch cause of action may be brought only against
the Seller of the Qualified Anti--Terrorism Technology and may not be
brought against the buyers, the buyers' contractors, or downstream users
of the Technology, the Seller\'s suppliers or contractors, or any other
person or entity" (6 C.F.R. ยง 25.7(d)). The seller of the "qualified
anti-terrorism technology" is CSC, and the "buyer or downstream user" is
MGM.

Therefore, the suits will be dismissed at the federal level, and the
plaintiffs will need to sue CSC, not MGM.

Basically, the Federal suit is saying to the defendants, "Hey, you can't
sue us because Federal law says you have to sue CSC instead. So any
current lawsuits against us should be dismissed, and any future suits
should be directed against CSC."

This action provides injunctive relief for MGM, keeps the victims'
petitions for relief moving in the correct direction according to the
law, and keeps the local courts unclogged with cases which they legally
cannot adjudicate.
