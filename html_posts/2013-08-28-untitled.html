<h2>Answer Comment</h2>

**Content:** [Marcus, thank you for your well thought out argument. I
appreciate your opinion, and I do love reading them. I always challenge
my own beliefs, and reading opinions like yours always makes me question
my opinions. While I agree with you in principle, I still don\'t believe
that changing the law, and thus changing the definition of marriage, is
the correct approach.\
\
You cannot compare gay marriage to interracial marriage. In my post, I
centered my discussion on the purpose of marriage. People have ascribed
purposes to marriage that are way beyond what the state ever intended.
This is partly caused by the fact that churches marry people, as well as
states. When a church marries a couple, it is for different reasons and
towards different ends than when a state grants a marriage license or
marries people. A religious marriage has much more to do with love and
commitment than the state\'s reasons for granting licenses, which have
absolutely nothing to do with love or commitment. We are talking about
changing law, so our only point of discussion is why the state grants
marriage licenses and why the state has any compelling interest in
regulating who gets married. We are not talking about church marriages
at all. Therefore, basing your arguments on who someone should be
allowed to love are not relevant. Basing your arguments on what
commitments should be recognized by the state is also pointless; the
state does not recognize commitment in any form, it has no compelling
interest in regulating commitment.\
\
States regulate marriage because there has to be some structure around
generativity, or what happens to children who may be created as a result
of this union. The compelling interest of the state is the protection of
children, so the state encourages the union which gives children the
best chance for success. This is why the state grants marriage licenses
to couples comprised of men and women, because the state has no other
compelling interest to regulate any other form of union. The state may
have a compelling interest in regulating polygamy, but since the church
does not allow it, the state also does not allow it. The state really
has no reason to deny it.\
\
Since the only state interest is ensuring that children created by that
union are given the best chance of success, and since men and women of
different colors can procreate, then interracial marriage bans were
based on nothing more than bigotry and hatred. A ban on interracial
marriage did not make sense in the scope of the law. Men and women can
marry, and interracial men and women can produce children. Banning
interracial marriages was contrary to the state\'s reasons for granting
marriage licenses. Therefore, that practice was reversed.\
\
The state does have a compelling argument when not granting marriage
licenses to gay or lesbian couples. When these couples have sex, they
cannot produce children. Therefore, there is no compelling reason for
the state to grant marriage licenses to these couples. It\'s like the
state granting marriage licenses between men and trees. It makes no
sense when looking at the state\'s interest in regulating marriage.\
\
There is no \"right\" for gay or lesbian couples to marry, because
according to the state\'s interests, marriage does not apply to them
because they cannot produce children. There is no \"basic human right\"
to marriage, so the state is not violating any human rights by not
granting marriage licenses to same-sex couples. As far as the state is
concerned, there is no compelling state interest in regulating such
unions.]{.rendered_qtext}
