**Is it possible for the Congress to outlaw abortion everywhere if
SCOTUS allowed it, or would each state decide?**

If *Roe* is overturned, Congress *could* pass a law outlawing abortion
throughout the country. The 14th Amendment would mean that this law
applied to the states. Therefore, no states would be allowed to perform
abortions at all.

**This will not happen**.

Not only can Congress not get a consensus about this, *they shouldn't*.
If *Roe* is overturned, it will be up to the individual states to make
laws regarding abortion. This actually should be a state's rights issue,
and each state should decide for itself how it will structure its laws.
Some states will allow elective abortions at any time, up until the baby
is born. Some states will ban abortions once a heartbeat is detected.
Some states will ban all abortions except in cases of rape or incest, or
when the life of the mother is threatened.

The only thing that Congress should do is to pass a law to ensure that
Title X money is not used to pay for abortions in any state, such that
taxpayers in an anti-abortion state don't end up paying for abortions in
an abortion-friendly state.
