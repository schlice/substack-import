If you were a loving God, would you create people who had no free will
and who could do nothing **but** love you? Would you create meat-robots
who could not make choices of their own?

Do you think God is *happy* about people rejecting Him? Of course not.
He wants everyone to be saved. But by the same token, He is willing to
let people decide for themselves whether they will love Him or reject
Him, and thus make their own choices about their own eternal destinies.

C.S. Lewis quipped that hell has a door which is locked from the inside.
In other words, people with free will have chosen their eternal destiny
willingly.
