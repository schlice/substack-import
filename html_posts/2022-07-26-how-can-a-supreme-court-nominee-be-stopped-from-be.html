Well, let's see...

\<checks instruction manual\>

Ah yes, here it is: Article II, Section 2, Clause 2 of the United States
Constitution:

> \... and \[the President\] shall nominate, and by and with the Advice
> and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint Ambassadors, other public
> Ministers and Consuls, Judges of the supreme Court, and all other
> Officers of the United States, whose Appointments are not herein
> otherwise provided for, and which shall be established by Law: but the
> Congress may by Law vest the Appointment of such inferior Officers, as
> they think proper, in the President alone, in the Courts of Law, or in
> the Heads of Departments.

So the instruction manual for the United States (also known as the
Constitution) says that the Senate can vote no on a nomination. That's
what that line in there about "Advice and Consent" means. "Consent"
means the Senate has to approve a nomination by vote.

So the President make an *appointment*, and the Senate must "consent" to
that appointment with a vote.
