**Will the House eventually start fining or jailing White House
officials who refuse to testify on impeachment after being issued a
subpoena?**

The House has no authority to fine or jail anyone. You might counter and
say that the Sergeant at Arms has locked people in broom closets in the
distant past, but that was before the well-provisioned FBI that we have
today.

Today, if the House wants to enforce its subpoenas, it must get past the
not-insignificant legal challenges to both their basis and the
overcoming of Executive authority and privilege. Remember, White House
officials are not refusing to testify because they are simply being
obstinate. They are refusing to testify because the President has made a
claim of Executive Privilege over their testimony. This means that there
is a valid reason that these people may not necessarily be forced to
testify.

Only a court can decide which privilege wins the day: Congress' subpoena
authority through its standing subcommittees, or the President's claim
of Executive Privilege. These are two equal powers. Both branches have
needs for information, and both branches have valid reasons for either
wanting information, or wanting to protect information.

So where does this go from here?

The House subcommittees issuing the subpoenas will have to take them to
the US Attorney's Office in DC, who will schedule a hearing in front of
a Federal judge. The Congress and the White House will have the
opportunity to present their arguments, and the judge will make a
determination as to whether or not the subpoenas are valid, and whether
or not the subpoenaed person can be compelled to testify.

Either way, the House does not need the testimony to file Articles of
Impeachment. They do not need any investigation; they can claim they
already have everything they need to make a determination that the
President has done whatever impeachable thing they believe he has done,
and they can move forward. So even if these subpoenas fail to get the
testimony they want, they can press on with whatever they have now.
