**If I burn a song to a CD which already has songs on it, will it wipe
the CD completely?**

Depends on whether or not it is a CD-R and the session is still open, or
if it is a CD-RW or CD+RW.

If it is a CD-R and the session is not closed, your new music will be
burnt to the end (called a "multisession CD-R"). If the CD-R session is
closed, you will not be able to burn to it at all.

If it is a CD-RW or CD+RW, you can erase and re-burn the CD, in which
case the CD will be completely wiped.
