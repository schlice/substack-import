In general, it is not illegal to forge a report card to show to your
parents.

If, however, they are overjoyed at your report card and they take you to
Chick-Fil-A (or [[any number of
companies](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=942d96&url=http://stayathomemoms.about.com/od/schoolresources/a/Rewards-For-Students.htm){.external_link

rewards based on your grades), you (and by extension, your parents)
would be committing theft of service or theft by deception, and that\'s
a charge that is more likely to be pursued than your parents suing you
for getting cash for grades.
