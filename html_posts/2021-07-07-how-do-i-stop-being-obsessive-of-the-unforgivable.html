Get mental help.

I don't say that dismissively, I say that in all love and sincerity.

You may very well be suffering from **obsessive-compulsive disorder
(OCD).** One of the diagnostic criterion of OCD is called
[[**scrupulosity**](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=d7c4ef&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrupulosity){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"

mental disorder in which one's obsessions center around sin. The
person's obsessions focus on moral or religious fears, such as the fear
of being an evil person or the fear of punishment for sin.

I would strongly advise you to seek the advice of a mental health
professional, as there are very effective treatments which may help you
understand and cope with your disease.

Good luck!
