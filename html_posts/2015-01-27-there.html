**Content:** [Let me start by saying that there is ***never*** any
justification for rape. Ever.\
\
I want to address what the poster is trying to say, because I think
there is something there that women should think about: **what you wear
speaks volumes about who you want to portray yourself as.**\
\
If you go to a costume party and you want to dress up as Santa Claus,
wearing a bunny costume would send the wrong message: that you\'re not
Santa Claus. What you wear determines the message you are trying to send
about yourself. If you\'re trying to say \"I am Santa Claus,\" don\'t
dress in a bunny rabbit costume, because, right or wrong, people will
think you\'re the Easter Bunny.\
\
And to make my point more clearly, I offer as evidence the quote of that
scholar of ethics, that paragon of virtue, comedian Dave Chappelle:\
\

> The girl says \"Oh uh-uh, wait a minute! Wait a minute! Just because
> I\'m dressed this way does not make me a whore!\" Which is true,
> gentlemen, that is true. Just because they dress a certain way
> doesn\'t mean they are a certain way. Don\'t even forget it.\
> \
> But ladies, you must understand that is fucking confusing. It just is.
> Now that would be like me, Dave Chappelle, the comedian, walking down

> thank God. Officer, help us! Come on. They\'re over here. Help us!\"
> \"Oh-hoh! Just because I\'m dressed this way does not make me a police
> officer!\" See what I mean? All right, ladies, fine. You are not a
> whore. But you are wearing a whore\'s uniform.

\
There\'s no way that the average person, let alone the hormone-filled
16-25 year old male, can separate those two: the way you dress and the
way you are perceived.\
\
Your outfit does not make you a certain way. But your outfit speaks
volumes about how you want to be perceived. You cannot deny that if you
walk into a board meeting wearing the same outfit you wore to the club
last night, you\'re going to get more than the casual look, and it is
going to color the perception that people have of you. You can\'t help
but have people make the connection between what you are wearing and the
personality type of the person who would normally wear such an outfit.\
\
Saying, \"I can wear slutty clothes, but you can\'t make the connection
in your mind\" is disingenuous. Other posters are saying the same thing.
[[John

a man whose opinion I greatly respect even though we occasionally
disagree, is right on point when he says that we have hopelessly
intertwined seduction and rape, and it should not be that way. The
simple fact is that in today\'s society, ***that\'s how it is.***\
\
So that we are clear here, I need to stop and point out again, **what
you wear should never have any bearing on whether or not you are
raped.** Ever.\
\
But if you could shape opinion about yourself by having others perceive
you differently based on your choice of outfit, wouldn\'t you want to
guide their perception to the right one for you?\
\
In short, if you don\'t want people to automatically think of you as
slutty, don\'t dress like a slut.\
\
I think there may be something to that.\
