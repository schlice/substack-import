Yes.

While I have no idea what the "shadow of appointments" means (probably
because I'm not Jewish), I recognize the feasts:

The **Feast of Trumpets** is a Jewish celebration which marked the
beginning of ten days of consecration and adoration before God.

The **Day of Atonement** is a Jewish celebration also known as Yom
Kippur. It is the most solemn holy day of all the Israelite feasts and
festivals, occurring once a year on the tenth day of Tishri, the seventh
month of the Hebrew calendar. On this day, the High Priest performs
elaborate rituals to atone for the sins of the people.

The **Feast of Tabernacles** is one of three feasts that all "native
born" male Jews are commanded to participate in, and is the seventh and
last feast that the Lord commanded Israel to observe. The Feast of
Tabernacles, like all of the feasts, was instituted by God as a way of
reminding Israelites in every generation of their deliverance by God
from Egypt.

> Is Messiah your King, High Priest and Bridegroom?

If you're referring to Jesus, then yes. Jesus is our Messiah. He is our
King. He is our savior. He is sovereign, He is holy, He is worthy of our
praise. Several passages in the bible hint at Christ as the bridegroom
(cf Revelation 21:2, Revelation 21:9, Ephesians 5:25 etc)

> Are you going to practice these Appointments this fall?

No.

Primarily, I'm not going to practice these Appointments because I'm not
Jewish.

Secondarily, these feasts do not make sense in a Christian worldview.
For example, the Day of Atonement is the day that the High Priest
performs a ritual to atone for the sins of the people. As Christians,
Jesus Christ sacrificed Himself on the cross to atone for **all** of our
sins; past, present, and future. There is no further need for sacrifice.
**Christ sacrificed once, for all.** Therefore, the Day of Atonement has
been "overcome by events," so to speak. The necessity of continuing to
atone for sins has been replaced by Christ's one-time sacrifice. His
blood washes us clean. We don't "re-sacrifice" Christ every year, or
every week, or on any other periodic schedule. Christ's sacrifice was
sufficient to cleanse us of all of our sins.
