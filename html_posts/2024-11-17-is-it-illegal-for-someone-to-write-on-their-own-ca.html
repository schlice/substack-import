In general, no.

There are specific things you write on the car which could be
actionable, but the police probably won't be the one charging you. For
example, if you wrote "My neighbor Greg is a child molester," you could
be sued for libel and ordered to pay a big fine if you are wrong about
that, but you don't get arrested or charged by the police. And you could
run afoul of HOA regulations about cars with writing on them if your HOA
has such a regulation, but that doesn't involve the police either.
