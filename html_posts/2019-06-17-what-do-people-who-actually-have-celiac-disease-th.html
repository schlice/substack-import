**What do people who actually have Celiac disease think of the \"gluten
sensitivity\" claims?**

I am a "gluten sensitive" person.

It only make sense. Wheat is one of the biggest GI irritants out there,
along with dairy and eggs. It's entirely possible that a person can be
sensitive to wheat even without having Celiac disease.

By the way, my sensitivity is induced by the medication I take for MS.

When I was going through the worst of my sensitivity, I switched to a
gluten-free diet and felt better than I had in years. I stayed on that
diet for two years, and then slowly weaned off of it. I had to do it
slowly, because the GI sensitivity was still there for me. It still is
to this day; I still must take supplements to control the gas and
bloating I get if I eat a whole plate of pasta, but I can eat bread
(like a bun or sandwich bread) and items with wheat in them without any
trouble.

There is a big difference between Celiac disease and gluten sensitivity.
They both exist, and they are both different from each other.

It's odd; a fast food restaurant I frequent (who shall remain nameless)
offers the option to replace your bun on your burger with an iceberg
lettuce wrap. When you ask for it, they ask you if it is "allergic or
lifestyle." Clearly, they are doing so because they want to know if they
need to control allergens or if you just don't want the bun. But the
oversimplification tends to illustrate exactly the sort of divide you're
assuming in your question. There is more to it than just "Celiac or
lifestyle."
