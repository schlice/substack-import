You believe in plenty of things which have no evidence. Why do you
continue to believe in math, logic, aesthetics, ethics, morality, etc.,
when science can't prove those things? There is no evidence of their
existence, yet you believe in them.

Is scientific evidence the only way you can arrive at truth? Or is it
*just one way* you can discover truth?
