This is a great question, and it highlights a facet of our belief which
we call **progressive revelation**. In short, God's requirements for
belief are based on the amount of information He has revealed to people
up to that point.

Before the times that Scripture was written, the people were still
responsible to God for what He had written on their hearts, and what was
visible in nature all around them. Abraham believed what God had said in
the past, with the addition of what God has revealed to him (cf Genesis
12, 15).

Think of it this way. Have you ever used a credit card? You buy things
before you have the money to pay for them, but the people you buy from
know that *eventually* you will have the money to pay.

Throughout the Old Testament times, believers essentially *bought on
credit.* They believed that *someday*, God would permanently address the
problem of their sin, but they believed and acted based on the
information they had on hand at that time. They burnt offerings to God,
which temporarily addressed their sin, but they had faith that God
would, someday, permanently take their sin away. On the Day of
Atonement, they would symbolically transfer their sin into a lamb and
sacrifice it, addressing their sin for that year. It was a stop-gap
solution until the Lamb of God, who takes away the sins of the world,
**past, present,** and **future**, would be given.

Today, we have far more revelation from God than the people then had.

Today, we can see the full picture. We know that God did address our sin
permanently, through the person of Jesus Christ, and we believe and live
accordingly.
