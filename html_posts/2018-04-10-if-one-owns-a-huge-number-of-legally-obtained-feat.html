**If I own a huge number of legally obtained feature films (ex,. Disney,
classics, foreign films, etc.) on DVD, could I legally create my own
streaming service and then charge people to view them? Kind of like a
competitor to Netflix. Is this legal?**

No, this is not legal.

When you buy a movie, you actually buy the license to watch the movie.
The costs of the media you buy are not really relevant, as most media
today is distributed in multiple medium (Blu-Ray, digital download,
etc).

You are licensed (when you buy a DVD) for *personal use only*. What you
are describing is called *commercial use*, and that is not covered by
your license agreement. You may not rebroadcast, retransmit, charge
admission for, or otherwise make money from, that movie.

(EDIT) So how does Netflix work? You may not rebroadcast, retransmit,
etc., without a *license* to do so. In order to get a license, you must
enter into contract with the license holder. This usually involves
paying them *royalties* when their movies are shown. That means they get
some remuneration every time the movie is shown, or perhaps they make a
fixed amount per month depending on how many users you have on the
system. Whatever the contract states, once you have a commercial
rebroadcast license, *then* you can start showing the movies from that
licensor.

So if you have a full collection of Disney movies, you'd have to go to
Disney and work out a rebroadcaster's license agreement with them, and
then you could broadcast Disney's movies. However, it's not likely that
they'll grant it, as it would compete with their own service (which they
run in conjunction with Fox, Sony, Universal and Warner Brothers),

it financially acceptable to them, which will likely be financially
unacceptable to you.
