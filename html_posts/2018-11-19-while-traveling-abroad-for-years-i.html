**While traveling abroad for years, I\'ve routinely seen mobile phone
SIM cards being re-loaded at 7/11. Why isn\'t this available in the
US?**

On the contrary, this is definitely available in the US. It's just less
popular.

What you're referring to is called **prepaid cellular.** Airtime is paid
for up front, before it is used. You can either refill your airtime by
buying a card at a retailer (like 7--Eleven or Walmart), or you can use
the phone itself and enter a credit card number to refill your airtime
over the phone. These phones require no contracts.

Most US users use **postpaid cellular**. You are billed at the end of
the month for your usage, after you use it. These are contract services.
