Because you cannot prove that your life is at risk because someone else
chooses to not protect themselves with a vaccine. Your hyperbole does
not follow the science.

Since you can be fully vaccinated and still contract COVID-19, as well
as pass COVID-19 on to other people, then their vaccination status
should mean nothing to anyone but them.

In other words, the only people who have to fear the unvaccinated are
the unvaccinated.

If they are unvaccinated and they contract COVID-19, they have greater
potential to end up with a worse disease course and worse outcomes than
those who are vaccinated. But the people who are vaccinated can put you
at risk just as the people who are unvaccinated can.

Additionally, Omicron changes the entire discussion. Omicron hits
**everyone**, regardless of vaccination status. But Omicron in general
does not produce bad outcomes. It produces general flu-like symptoms,
and burns out quickly. Both vaccinated and unvaccinated alike can be hit
by Omicron, but it is killing very few people at all. The people dying
with Omicron had comorbidities, and they are dying because Omicron
exacerbated their other illness.

Original question:

My life is at stake because of anti-vaxxers. Why aren't they forced to
take vaccine with harsh force?
