For this example, the police do not generally handle that situation.

If the store was approved by the zoning commission, this is the group
with which you must start your complaint. If the zoning commission
approved the store in violation of the law, you can then file with the
court for an injunction against the store, claiming that the zoning
commission unlawfully approved the location of the store.

It\'s possible that the zoning commission knew of the law and chose to
allow the store anyway. If they did not process a waiver for the store,
you can absolutely file for injunctive relief. If the zoning commission
did process a waiver, then the store is allowed despite the law.

The commission may have also evaluated the business next door and found
that it didn\'t meet the standard for a \"child-centered activity\" as
defined by the law.

Regardless, you have to start with the city zoning commission and find
out why they approved the store in that location.
