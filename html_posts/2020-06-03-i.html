**I'm 15 years old and a VERY lukewarm Christian. I really, really want
to know Jesus, but I have no idea where to start. Do you have any
advice?**

I want to tell you to go dig in to the Bible, because all the answers
are there, but reading the Bible with a correctly-oriented heart is
important.

So I think it's more important to become "less-lukewarm" in your faith
before you really dig in to the Bible. You'll really get more benefit
from your time with the Bible if your heart is in the right frame.

Let me suggest a great book, easy to read, that may help you tease out a
little more faith and a little less lukewarm-ness: [[*I Don't Have
Enough Faith To Be An
Atheist*](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=317866&url=https://smile.amazon.com/Dont-Have-Enough-Faith-Atheist/dp/1581345615){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="amazon.com"}]{.qlink_container} by Norm Geisler and Frank
Turek. They use discussion, based on logic and reason, not the Bible, to
help explain why faith in Christ is not only reasonable, but is actually
more rational than unbelief.

*Then* you can follow the advice of my contemporaries here on this
answer and dig in to the Bible to learn even more about Christ and how
to live as a Christian.
