Perhaps another church might be a better fit for you. Have you ever
attended a non-denominational service? They are all Bible-based, but
they aren't so steeped in ceremony that they miss the forest for the
trees. They do a communal meal, but they don't believe that the bread is
*actually* Christ's body, and that the wine is *actually* Christ's
blood. They believe the Last Supper was symbolic, yet another example of
Jesus teaching his disciples through parable and stories. You might
consider looking into such a church. They are either labeled Bible
Churches or Nondenominational Churches or Christian Churches.

Nevertheless, your position is quite unjustifiable. You can't
simultaneously believe and be "unreligious." You either believe or you
don't. If you believe, you act like a believer. If you don't, you don't.
It's really quite that simple. You can't believe (affirming the tenets
of the faith) and then ignore those beliefs. Either you believe and you
consciously choose to violate your faith, or you don't believe.

I think maybe a change of scenery might do you some good.
