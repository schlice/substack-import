**If President Trump left office under investigation, how would deciding
to pardon him or not pardon him affect Mike Pence\'s future
electability?**

If Trump voluntarily "left office under investigation," in order to
complete the hypothetical, he would then be indicted (as a regular
citizen) and tried in a regular court. If he were found guilty, I highly
doubt that Pence would pardon him.

If Trump were impeached AND removed from office (a feat which is nigh
impossible given the composition of the Senate), and then indicted and
found guilty, Pence could conceivably claim that the whole thing was, to
borrow Trump's words, a "witch hunt," and *maybe* pardon him.

But Pence is actually a politician. He's keenly aware of one thing that
Trump seems to be far less concerned with: *optics*. I doubt that if
public opinion swayed against Trump, especially after he was indicted
and convicted in a court, for real crimes, that Pence would pardon him.
And if he was actually *removed from office,* he would be the first
president to ever be removed from office. Nixon was close, but he
resigned before he could be removed from office. Pardoning someone who
was *so guilty* that he became the first president ever to be removed
from office would play very poorly with everyone. Optics is key.

Would it hurt his future electability? Not at all. It's not going to
change anyone's votes whatsoever. The people who believe Trump is guilty
weren't going to vote for Pence anyway, and you're certainly not going
to lose any Trump voters because you *help* Trump when you think he's
being railroaded.
