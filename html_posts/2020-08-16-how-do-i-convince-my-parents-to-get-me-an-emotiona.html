**How do I convince my parents to get me an emotional support dog. I
have serious anxiety, and I have thoughts of suicide constantly. My dad
says I can't get one because he lives in an apartment. I'm only with him
on weekends. It has to go everywhere?**

Work the angle a different way.

First, **get help**. If you are not seeking counseling, tell your
parents you want to talk to someone. If they won't help you, check the
box on this page that says "There is Help," find a resource in your area
and reach out.

Hopefully you are either talking to someone or you are going to talk to
someone. In your talks with that person, maybe see if they think that an
emotional support animal would be helpful. They might be able to help
convince your parents that you would benefit from one.

Be aware, however, **emotional support animals are not service
animals.** They are not legally protected like service animals are.
Businesses and landlords ***can*** restrict emotional support animals,
where they cannot restrict service animals. **The Americans with
Disabilities Act and the Fair Housing Act do not protect emotional
support animals.**

This is why it is critical you get help for yourself first, and worry
about the emotional support animal later.
