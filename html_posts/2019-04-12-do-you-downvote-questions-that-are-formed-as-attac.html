**Do you downvote questions that are formed as attacks on conservatives,
Republicans, or other parts of the center-right coalition and why?**

No. Not at all.

Why?

***Because that's not what the Quora voting system is for.***

Votes are cast for *high-quality content.* Votes will move a question up
or down in other users' feeds, or make it visible to a larger segment of
the Quora population.

Similarly, upvoting answers is reserved for *high-quality content.*
Answers which are both correct and engaging get upvoted, *even if I
disagree with what the user says.*

There are many popular Quorans with whom I fundamentally politically
disagree. I still consistently upvote their content, because it is
high-quality content.

*So how, then, do we deal with questions which attack any group (not
just Conservatives)?*

**The answer is to** ***Report*** **that content.** You can do that
through the three dot menu underneath the question. Click it, and choose
*Report.*

If a question attacks a person or group, I immediately report that
question as Harassment.

*But Bill*, I can hear you saying right now, *when you Report a
question, it automatically downvotes that question! So why are you
saying we shouldn't downvote the question?*

The answer is **if your downvote is in relation to a Report, then that's
Quora using their algorithm to show the answer to fewer people because
of the alleged harassment, not because of your opinion on the tone of
the question.**

The report is the important part; the downvote is secondary to the
report. The downvote alone only fixes the symptom of the problem, not
the problem itself.

**To that end, using downvotes alone does nothing to alert Quora to
harassing behavior, and the misuse of their platform.**

Please, don't downvote questions like this. Please Report them, and the
system will downvote the question automatically.
