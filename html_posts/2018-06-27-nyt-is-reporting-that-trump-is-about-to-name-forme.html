**NYT is reporting that Trump is about to name former Fox News executive
Bill Shine as his communications director. What changes do you see in
communications from the White House if he is named?**

What I would *like* to see is **consistency in messaging.**

I am hoping that a new communications director will set communications
policy and be consistent with it. If anyone goes on the air, they better
know what the actual policy is, and they better stick to it. The fact
that senior WH officials are going on air and inserting their size 12's
directly into their oral food cavity is disheartening at best, and is an
utter failure at worst. The way that the child separation issue was
handled was an unmitigated disaster, and a good part of that was a lack
of consistency in communications out of this White House.

I hope they can get their collective acts together.
