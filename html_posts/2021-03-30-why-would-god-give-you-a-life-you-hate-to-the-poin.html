**Why would God give you a life you hate to the point you commit suicide
and then send you to hell for killing yourself? It really doesn't make
sense, why not just never give them life at all?**

Why do you think you feel like you have a life you hate? Clearly, you
see something outside of your own life that you don't have to which you
are comparing, and it bothers you. You probably see other people being
successful, getting what they want out of life. Maybe you spend time on
Instagram, seeing just how much fun everyone else is having with their
lives, and comparing yourself to them. We're always going to see other
people who appear to be happier, healthier, more successful. They seem
to have everything we want and just somehow can't get.

**But that is folly**.

Remember the parable of the rich man:

> And he told them this parable: "The ground of a certain rich man
> yielded an abundant harvest. He thought to himself, 'What shall I do?
> I have no place to store my crops.'
>
> "Then he said, 'This is what I'll do. I will tear down my barns and
> build bigger ones, and there I will store my surplus grain. And I'll
> say to myself, "You have plenty of grain laid up for many years. Take
> life easy; eat, drink and be merry."'
>
> "But God said to him, 'You fool! This very night your life will be
> demanded from you. Then who will get what you have prepared for
> yourself?'
>
> "This is how it will be with whoever stores up things for themselves
> but is not rich toward God." --- Luke 12:16--21 NIV

Don't envy the people who have more than you. How foolish of us to
resent those who are comfortable now, but who may not be right with God,
and could be eternally lost. And how foolish of us to resent others who
have something that we wish we had when we serve a God who is working in
your life to give you the one thing that you so desperately need: more
of him.

Ask God to show you his plan for your life. He desperately wants to be a
part of your life, and he wants to do great things with you, and for
you.

But to do that, you must focus less on what you don't have, and more on
what you do. You have him. Rest on that, because he is more than enough.
