**Why do Trump supporters embrace herd immunity when it doesn\'t work?**

It's not that it doesn't work, because to a certain extent, it does
work. However, coronaviruses are more like the flu than smallpox, so
herd immunity just doesn't apply.

In order for herd immunity to be effective, doctors estimate that
60--70% of the population would need to be infected and recover in order
for it to have any benefit, and that immunity must last for a
significant period of time.. Currently, we're pushing around 3% of the
population, and we are putting a strain on our medical system with just
that. We would probably need to be pushing that 70% figure in order to
prevent community transmission of this disease.

But much like the flu, the immunity doesn't last forever. Some studies
have shown that the immunity only lasts for about four or five months.
So much like the flu shot, you'll need to get re-vaccinated every year,
and even with the shot, it's only estimated to be somewhere between 30
and 80% effective against whatever strain happens to be circulating that
year.

If it follows that this strain of coronavirus is similar in transmission
characteristics to the flu, you'll be getting a coronavirus shot
alongside your flu shot, but even that is not a guarantee that you won't
get the virus.

Maybe in ten to fifteen years we'll have something akin to herd
immunity, but if this coronavirus is anything like the flu, then herd
immunity just isn't a thing.
