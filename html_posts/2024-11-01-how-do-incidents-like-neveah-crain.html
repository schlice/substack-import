They make it **abundantly** clear that *how states word their laws makes
a huge difference.* Texas is a shining example of how **not** to write
law. It's also a shining example of something that both parties are
guilty of: great idea, poor execution.

Texas' anti-abortion laws make it **so difficult** to decide that a
person is eligible for an abortion, and they impose **such high
penalties** for performing a procedure to remove a baby that *might even
be considered to possibly be an abortion* that they don't want to do it.
Hospitals will pass patients off to other hospitals because they don't
want to take the legal risk of being wrong.

In other words, in Texas' zeal to criminalize the medical professionals
who might perform an abortion has caused these situations to happen.
When your laws interfere with medical practice, then your laws are
incorrectly written.

Now, the next thing we must discuss is *how do we deal with this*.
Because there are two ways to deal with this:

- Don't ban any abortions
- Be smarter about banning abortions.

Sure, if we don't ban any abortions, then this type of scenario would
never happen. Also, if we don't have any speed limits, then no one will
ever get a speeding ticket. But there will be a lot more car accidents,
and they will be more deadly. Either we set limits, or we do not set
limits, and there are consequences to both decisions.

**But crucially, this type of scenario is the exception rather than the
rule.** This scenario is the "perfect storm," the perfect combination of
an incomplete miscarriage leaving fetal tissue in the womb and doctors
and hospitals who are more worried about lawsuits than they are about
treating patients.

**TL;DR:** This is solely a problem with **how** Texas wrote their law;
it is not a problem **that** Texas wrote their law.
