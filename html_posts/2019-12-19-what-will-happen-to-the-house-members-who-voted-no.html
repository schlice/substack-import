**What will happen to the House members who voted not to impeach
President Trump?**

The Republicans will be just fine. No Republicans thought that there was
anything to this impeachment sham anyway, so they won't lose any votes
back home that they weren't going to get anyway. They may have even
picked up a few Independent voters, according to most polls.

There are a few Democrats who voted against a few Articles. These were
Democrats elected in 2018 in red districts which voted for Trump in
2016, and they were going to have a really hard time going back to their
districts and explaining to all these Trump voters why he/she voted to
impeach. So they made a political gamble and split their votes, voting
for one article and voting against the other. That way, they can appear
studious and thoughtful, as if they really analyzed the situation and
voted their conscience. This may allow them the tiniest possibility that
they'll be retained in office. But it's a political gamble either way.
