**You need to be more specific.**

**Equality** is good. We want equality. Everyone gets the same
opportunity to succeed. To clarify, we call this *equality of
opportunity.*

**Equity** is bad. We'd like equity, but equity is not required. While
everyone has the opportunity to succeed, not everyone will. We call this
*equality of outcome*.

That said, conservatives are all about the government using tax dollars
to ensure *equality of opportunity.* They are completely against the
government using tax dollars to ensure *equality of outcome.*
