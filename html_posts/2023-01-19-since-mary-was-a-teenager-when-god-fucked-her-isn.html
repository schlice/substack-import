1.  That law did not exist at the time of Mary, so no, there was no such
    thing as statutory rape.
2.  There was no intercourse in the creation of Jesus. God is
    immaterial, so He is incapable of having sex. Because no sin was
    passed down through the line of a physical father, Jesus was born
    *sinless*. He remained sinless throughout His entire life, which
    enabled Him to take on the sins of the world on the cross. If Christ
    was conceived through sexual intercourse, He would not have been
    able to be born sinless, and would not have accomplished His
    mission.

See? I turned your disgusting, irreverent, disingenuous troll question
into a mini-Scriptural lesson. You're welcome.
