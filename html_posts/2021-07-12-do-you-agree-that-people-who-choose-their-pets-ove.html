No.

But I *can* agree that **a person** who chose **a pet** over **a
spouse** wasn't meant to get married to **that spouse**.

People with pets get married all the time. You do know that you don't
*have* to choose your pet over your spouse, right?

It's just that sometimes, a person will give an ***ultimatum*** to their
spouse, and will force them to "choose the pet or me."

In marriage, that's unfair. It is unfair to try to force your spouse to
do things your way. You are both equals in marriage; no one has
exclusive authority over the other. You work out your differences; you
don't force your spouse into a decision which they do not want to make.

So if you're going to ***force*** your spouse to make an inherently
unfair choice, don't be surprised if that spouse decides that you're not
the person they want to be married to. And it's not because they chose
the pet over you, it's because they chose the pet over a person who is
too unreasonable to consider continuing to be married to a pet owner.

Original question:

Do you agree that people who choose their pets over their spouse aren\'t
meant to get married?
