Since I can only answer for myself, the worst feeling I have ever
experienced when I was younger was watching my mother cry.

She was crying because someone stole her engagement ring, part of the
burglary that occurred at my childhood home.

I came home from school one day to find police cars at my house. This
was nothing new; my dad was a cop. There were routinely police cars at
my house. This time was a little different, though. There was a
higher-than-average number of police cars at my house. There was also a
CSI van at my house. *That's a little unusual*, I thought, but still
thought nothing of it. I was rarely surprised at the types of police
vehicles I'd come home to find in front of my house. As I approached
further, I found officers walking in and out of my house, and the front
door propped open. That's about the time that my thought process started
to turn from *This is a little unusual but no big deal* to *Something
about this scenario is very wrong.*

Upon entering the house, I was placed on the living room couch, while a
crime scene unfolded around me. My dad checked in once, but he was very
busy with the investigators. My mom was nowhere to be found.

At right about that time, she made her presence known. She walked out of
her bedroom and fell into my dad's arms, sobbing, "They took my
engagement ring!"

I will never get that image out of my head. Despite how my current
feelings about them may have changed, that image still makes me well up.
It was such a feeling of helplessness. I felt violated, and despite the
presence of half the police force at my house, I still felt defenseless.
My mom was tough as nails in my eyes, and anything that could make her
cry was obviously tougher than her, which scared the daylights out of
me. I was visibly shaken.

They also stole my dad's service revolver, our two TVs, our turntable,
our stereo, and our speakers. Surprisingly, they left the 8-track
player, and my *Meat Loaf - Bat Out Of Hell* 8-track. Small victories...
