The Constitution provides a method for presidents to be removed from
office in the event of "high crimes and misdemeanors." That method is
called *impeachment.* Impeachment is generally reserved for things that
a president does which are *criminal* or *unethical.* That said, it's
important to note that *impeachment is not a legal process, but a
political one.* So it's not about prosecutors and judges and police,
it's about Representatives and Senators.

So what happens if a president actually commits a crime while in office?

The president isn't above the law. The president is indeed subject to
the law just like any other citizen of the country. But indicting a
sitting president, arresting him and jailing him has broader
implications for the country. Arresting a president would be very
damaging to the country, and we recognize that fact. The general legal
philosophy here is that you don't arrest a sitting president. He's
certainly not a flight risk; we know exactly where he is at all times.

So what do you do? If a president (as Trump alluded to) shoots someone
in the middle of Fifth Avenue, what do you do? You make him no longer a
sitting president so that you can indict him. Therefore, you must first
*impeach* the president and remove him from office, and *then* you may
indict and arrest him.

I've often thought about this, and I've wondered about the statute of
limitations. What if it expires while we are waiting to impeach and
remove from office? What if we impeach but we do not remove from office,
and then the statute of limitations expires? I'm reasonably sure that
the statute would be *tolled* until such time that the president becomes
*eligible* for prosecution, but because it has never happened before,
there is no legal precedent to say either way. I'd like to say that I'm
confident in my analysis, but I have no real world experience to back it
up.

Nevertheless, to answer the question, the Constitution does not provide
any immunity for *criminal* acts while a president is in office.

Since the question did not specify, let's talk about a president's
*political* acts while in office. As we just discussed, impeachment is
the Constitutional remedy for high crimes and misdemeanors. But what if
the president just does *bad things* while in office? What if he signs
treaties which are not in the best interest of the US? What if he's just
a *bad president?*

Unfortunately, there is no remedy for a president who simply does his
job badly. The Framers chose to not add a provision into the
Constitution whereby a president could be *recalled* from office. They
certainly could have, but they chose not to. They wanted the presidency
to have some permanence. They wanted presidential elections to be
meaningful. They wanted people to only elect people into office who can
do the job; they did not want presidential elections to say "We'll elect
you today, but we reserve the right to decide later on if you're doing a
good job." Then we have to deal with the ramifications of a recall. Does
someone else serve until the end of that term? Do we hold new elections?
We have a hard enough time getting an election done every four years,
could you imagine if we had to do it more frequently?

So if a bad president is elected, what do you do? The answer is **you
don't re-elect him**. The next time he is up for election, you elect
someone else. The downside is that you have to live with his bad
presidenting for four years, but that's why people will often say
"elections have consequences."
