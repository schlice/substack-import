**If a burglar on your premises had a serious accident, are you
obligated to help him?**

Legally, the answer in the United States is no. And it doesn't even have
to be a burglar. Unless you're a doctor, you don't have any obligation
to render first aid to anyone, their legal presence on your premises
notwithstanding. We've created Good Samaritan laws to try to encourage
people to render first aid without worrying that they'll be sued if they
inadvertently make it worse. But you are under no legal obligation to
render aid.

Since you said he's a burglar, you're probably calling police anyway, so
you should probably also inform them of his condition so they can send
medical personnel.

You should note that there are a few exceptions to this rule. For
example, if you created the peril which was encountered by the burglar,
you have a duty to assist. And once you start trying to assist, you have
a duty to continue. Finally, if you have a special relationship with the
burglar (like he's your family), you may have a duty to assist.

Also, some states have a duty to report crimes against children, or
sexually-based offenses. And in the states which have an actual duty to
assist, calling 911 is considered "assisting." You don't actually have
to render first aid.

If a duty exists and you failed to help, you could open yourself up to a
negligence lawsuit.
