I feel like this is a disingenuous question because I feel like I'm
going to answer it and the OP will then say, "Well, why did X case go on
for Y years and this person was captured 3,245,233,184 times on video
selling drugs and still not arrested" but like the gullible person I am,
I'll answer it anyway. So be aware, if you respond to me with one of
these comments, I will delete it out of hand. If you're the OP, I will
report the question as not seeking genuine answers.

Evidentiary requirements can be satisfied with a single incident. They
are not satisfied in every case. You cannot generalize and say that
every case has enough evidence to be brought after only one recording.
There may be other factors that the DA is considering. But as far as the
question goes, since they are talking about cops having enough evidence
to make an arrest, one recording will suffice. Whether or not the DA has
enough evidence to make a conviction stick is another story. The police
will likely have enough evidence to make an arrest after one video
recording.
