**Do the sheriffs have to present the search warrant to the owner of the
house when she asked to see it that same day?**

Laws vary by state, but in general, if the owner asks to see the
warrant, the police must present it. There are narrow exceptions in some
states, but under most conditions, the warrant must be presented when
the occupant asks to see it.

Courts generally hold the police to the "reasonableness" standard, since
the Fourth Amendment requires them to act in a reasonable manner.
Conducting a reasonable search generally involves displaying the warrant
upon request. If the court finds that the execution of the warrant was
unreasonable, they can throw out the evidence obtained under that
warrant.
