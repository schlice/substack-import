I was going to get into the political part, but I really don't want to.
Just too much controversy. Maybe one day I'll be brave (or stupid)
enough to do it, but that day is not today.

Instead, I'm only going to focus on the religious part of your question.
You said that "this care allows those children to be who God made them
to be."

Since you invoked God in this discussion, let's discuss exactly what God
intended.

When God designed the human body, it was *perfect*. It did not age. It
did not get sick. It did not die. God doesn't do anything halfway. God
doesn't make junk. He actually made the human body absolutely perfect.
This was the body that Adam inhabited, and then Eve after him.

But something changed.

**Sin** entered the world when Adam and Eve *disobeyed God*. This was
the world's first sin, and it introduced a whole *host* of changes into
the world, including in those perfect bodies that God created. Those
bodies were now *fallen*, bags of skin which would decay, develop
disease, feel pain, and eventually die. Women (yes, the real ones with
two X chromosomes and functioning uteruses) would feel the pain of
childbirth. Men (yes, the one with the Y chromosome and a functioning
penis) would toil to grow food, scratching at the hard ground to get it
to eek out some subsistence, and their lives would be filled with
suffering. They would grow old, and at the end of their lives, they
would die.

And all that happened because of **sin**, not because of **God**.

Diseases, including the mental condition which causes you to not feel
comfortable in your own skin, are a result of **sin** entering the human
condition. It is one of many conditions which humans face, caused by the
introduction of sin into the world.
