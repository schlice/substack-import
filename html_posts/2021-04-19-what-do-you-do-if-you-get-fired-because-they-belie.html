**What do you do if you get fired because they believe you have COVID?**

1.  Get a rapid COVID test.
2.  If you are negative, give the company one opportunity to re-hire
    you.
3.  If they fail to do so, consult with an employment attorney in your
    area.

The company can certainly have you tested, but firing you because they
believe you have a virus is not a valid reason to fire someone.

Despite the "at will" employment status that companies may enjoy, during
the pandemic, the Federal government (as well as nearly every state
government) has provided protections for employees who may become
infected with COVID-19. At worst, the employee would be eligible for
emergency FMLA leave (Family and Medical Leave Act) which provides for
unpaid leave from work and protects your position.

Simply firing someone because the employer "believes you have COVID" may
place the company at odds with federal labor laws. At worst, you would
have been eligible for unpaid leave if you were actually positive.
