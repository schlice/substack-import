\
Live for today. Don\'t live in your past with regret. There is nothing
you can do about your past. What\'s done is done. Take stock of what you
have today.\
\
I would trade your condition for mine in a hot second. TRUST ME when I
tell you that there are others who are far worse off than you are
(regardless of the cause of their conditions), and they still make the
best of their lives. I might just be one of them.\
\
My decision to serve my country left me with multiple sclerosis. Wanna
trade? Yeah, didn\'t think so.\
\
However, there are people who rely on me, people who look to me for
their guidance, people who I brought into this world and now I have the
responsibility to care for and to lead and to teach. Because my legs
don\'t want to work some days doesn\'t mean that I\'m less of a person
because of it. If you lose an arm, or a leg, are you less of a person?
Are your body parts what makes you a person, or is it something else?\
\
You are still you, even with your condition. Be the best you that you
can be.
