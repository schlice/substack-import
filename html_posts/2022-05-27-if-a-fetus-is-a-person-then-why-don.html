Some mothers do hold funerals for their stillborn children, or children
they lose in pregnancy due to miscarriage or other causes. They remember
them either on the day they were supposed to be born, or on the day they
were stillborn. One of my friends lost a child due to miscarriage and
she says she now has an "angel baby" and she remembers her angel baby
all the time. It's a very painful thing to have to go through.

The census, on the other hand, is a count of living people, not a count
of all people who have ever existed. The census counts "every resident
in the United States," as mandated by the Constitution.

Original question:

If a fetus is a person, then why don\'t they get funerals or recorded in
the census?
