**How would you as an HOA president defend spending money to clear land
and build a small playground?**

Easy. The majority of homeowners want it.

This is especially true if funds do not exist in the operating budget to
do the work without a special assessment or raising dues. If either of
those must take place, then it is critical that homeowners consent to
the new playground.
