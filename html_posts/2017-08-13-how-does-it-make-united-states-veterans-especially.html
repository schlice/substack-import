Dissent and differences of opinion are healthy and normal in a
well-functioning society. The ability to express your differing opinions
is a function of a free society.

Unfortunately, the political climate which has been fostered over the
last eight years and capped off by the election of a contentious figure
has ignited the passions of those who were already easily swayed by such
dramas. So normal differences of opinion morph into violence at the drop
of a hat.

I don't feel sad that a protest and a counter-protest took place. I feel
proud that I live in a place where such things are legal and that the
protesters are not immediately hauled off to jail for daring to express
an opinion. That's a sign of a well-functioning free society. I **do**
feel sad that a protest and a counter-protest so easily devolved into
violence. That's a sign that we have allowed our passions to take over
for our logic.
