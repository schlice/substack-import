title: "In its Roe v. Wade decision, SCOTUS indicated the issue does not fall under The purview of the Federal Legislature and referred such laws back to the states. Why is Joe Biden calling on Congress to codify a law if this is unconstitutional?"

This is the *effect* of what SCOTUS said.

What they *actually* said is that *Roe v. Wade* ***itself*** was decided
wrongly. There is no right to abortion in the Constitution.

That's it. That's all they said.

The majority in *Dobbs* held that there is no constitutional right to
abortion under either the Due Process Clause or the Equal Protection
Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Relatedly, although the Dobbs
majority did not directly address the argument, Justice Kavanaugh's
concurrence observed that "no Justice of this Court has ever advanced"
the so-called "fetal personhood" argument that the Fourteenth Amendment
requires states to prohibit abortion (a view advocated by some amici in
*Dobbs*).

The *effect* of this ruling is that there are only a few *potential*
methods by which Congress could have the authority to regulate abortion.
Potentially the Commerce Clause or the Spending Clause could be used to
either enhance or restrict the ability of states to regulate abortion,
but ultimately SCOTUS shut down most of what the Federal government
could do to either support or restrict abortion.

This means that the ability to either permit or restrict abortion is a
state issue, not a Federal one.

Biden's handlers are well aware of this fact. They'll continue to have
him tell anyone who will listen that he wants Congress to codify *Roe*
into law, even though he knows full well that there's no way in Hades
that such a thing will ever be attempted, let alone succeed. Those sorts
of talking points are just pandering to one's base.

The SCOTUS ruling does not mean that making laws about abortion is
unconstitutional. It simply means that there is no Constitutional right
to get an abortion (like the right to freedom of speech or the right to
be free from unreasonable search and seizure). Laws can be passed...if
you can get consensus to do so.
