**Is doxing protected by the First Amendment?**

Doxing, or "doxxing," is the practice of researching and then
broadcasting private information about an individual, usually on the
Internet, and usually done with malicious intent.

Doxing is illegal, and is not protected by the First Amendment. In just
the same way that you can't shout "Fire!" in a crowded theater because
it induces panic and can cause people to be hurt, doxing someone (even
if the information was previously publicly available) with malicious
intent is still harassment, and you can be sued if you do cause someone
harm.
