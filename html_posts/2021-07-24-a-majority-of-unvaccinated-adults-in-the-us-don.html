The way we reach herd immunity when people will not vaccinate: The
people who refuse to vaccinate will contract COVID-19, and they will
either get better (and thus have natural immunity), or they will die and
you won't need to worry about them infecting everyone around them.

But everyone gets to choose their own path in life. Take the vaccine if
you want to avoid COVID. Don't take the vaccine if you think you can
survive being infected. But **ultimately, what you do is your choice.**

It absolutely fascinates me that this pandemic has literally caused
everyone to forget how to live in the United States of America.

- Is it *really* medically necessary for everyone, regardless of age and
  prior infection status, to get the vaccine?
- Shouldn't Americans have the freedom to decide if they want to get a
  shot that remains unapproved by the FDA, has no long term studies to
  indicate any possible health effects, and is known to cause serious
  complications in some?

The public health apparatus in this country has failed us. It
politicized the virus. It politicized the vaccine. It has destroyed
trust in public health.

Why didn't we just present the facts, present the hard evidence about
for whom the vaccine would be beneficial, who might suffer the most by
being infected, and then treat people like adults and allow them to make
their own decisions?

Instead, we have this push toward mandates and coercion which will
further erode trust in public health.

With this mad push toward forced vaccinations, you would think that
there is some sort of grave risk of mortality from the disease (you
know, like the Black Plague that literally killed half of Europe or
something) which would necessitate everyone, young and old, getting
vaccinated. But is that what the medical evidence shows?

"There is a thousand-fold difference in the risk of mortality from the
disease from the oldest to the youngest," says Dr. Jay Bhattacharya,
professor of medicine at Stanford University. "Give people the
information, the solid, good scientific information, let them make their
own choice. And that is how public health gains trust. That's how public
health becomes effective. **And that's how the pandemic actually ends**,
not with coercion, but with good medicine conveyed by trustworthy people
treating \[the public\] like adults as opposed to serfs."

*But what about the people who have already been infected with COVID and
survived? Don't they need the vaccine?*

\"Natural immunity is quite effective at preventing you from
reinfection,\" Bhattacharya said. \"100 million people \[in the U.S.
have been\] infected, at least. And yet we have very few
\[re\]infections. It protects you against the variants as well \... I
read the scientific evidence around natural immunity \... If you had
COVID and recovered from it, then you\'re protected against that just as
much as you would be if you had the vaccine.\"

Bhattacharya went on to express his puzzlement at why this is not being
acknowledged by the leading public health officials. \"\[It\'s\] a very
odd denial of natural immunity \... I don\'t understand it,\" he said.
\"It\'s as if the only valid immunity is vaccine induced immunity \...
If you\'ve had the virus and recovered, you have natural immunity. There
are an enormous number of studies in prominent journals that have
established this. I don\'t really understand why the public health
community has not incorporated \[this\] into their thinking in a deep
way.\"

Bhattacharya also underscored another important aspect of the debate
that doesn\'t seem to be getting any attention: why isn\'t the vaccine
being distributed to those most in need? \"There are tens of millions of
older people worldwide who have not had the vaccine,\" he noted. \"Why
are we discussing vaccinating a population of people, younger people who
face very low risk if they were to get infected, while still tens of
millions of people worldwide have not had the protection of the vaccine?
Just because they don\'t live in a rich country doesn\'t mean they
don\'t deserve to have this kind of medical care available to
them.\"[\[1\]](#SAqUr){#cite-SAqUr .citation_link}

Original question:

*A majority of unvaccinated adults in the U.S. don\'t plan on getting
vaccinated. Considering compliance issues with voluntary mask wearing,
how can we reach herd immunity and stay ahead of the variants with the
fewest human and economic casualties*

*Sorry, no comments on this one.*

*If you don't like what I wrote, tough shit. If my answer is
grammatically low-quality or is un-cited opinion masquerading as fact,
downvote it. If you think I'm wrong, write your own answer. But Quora is
a question-and-answer site, not a debate site. If you were simply going
to comment to tell me "ackshually, you're wrong," then you're the reason
why I disable comments. Well done, Karen. You ruined it for everyone.*
