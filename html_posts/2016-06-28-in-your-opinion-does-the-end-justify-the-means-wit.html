In my opinion, the ends never justify the means. "The end justifies the
means" means you can do anything to get what you want. Even if it's
illegal, immoral, or unethical. So long as you get what you want,
nothing is off the table.

A man once said, "If I can't go back with my self-respect, I won't go
back at all." That man was Capt Theodore Harris, USAF, who was in
solitary confinement for 14 months as a prisoner of war (POW) in Korea.
Why did he need his self-respect so much? Isn't getting home the most
important thing of all? Couldn't you compromise just a few of your
principles to get yourself home? Maybe even just one? Couldn't you live
without your self-respect?

See, the thing is, once you can compromise one of your principles, you
can compromise any of them. If you believe that the end justifies the
means, you have no self-respect, because you can compromise any of your
principles at any time. I don't want to be someone who isn't respected
because he compromises his principles. But more importantly, I need to
be able to respect myself. And holding myself to my principles is more
important than achieving a goal. If I can't achieve an end without
compromising a principle or two to do it, the goal isn't worth
achieving.
