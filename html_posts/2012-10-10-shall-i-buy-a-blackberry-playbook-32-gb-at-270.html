**Content:** [I\'ll assume that the PB you are looking at is Wi-Fi only.
If so, you would be paying too much. Currently, prices on eBay for new
32GB PBs with Wi-Fi only are running between \$150 and \$200.\
\
If it is Wi-Fi and LTE, get it quick before someone realizes it\'s
listed too cheaply. New PBs with Wi-Fi and LTE radios are selling for
over \$450.]{.rendered_qtext}
