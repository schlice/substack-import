<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [I\'ll assume that the PB you are looking at is Wi-Fi only.<br>If so, you would be paying too much. Currently, prices on eBay for new<br>32GB PBs with Wi-Fi only are running between \$150 and \$200.\<br>\<br>If it is Wi-Fi and LTE, get it quick before someone realizes it\'s<br>listed too cheaply. New PBs with Wi-Fi and LTE radios are selling for<br>over \$450.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
