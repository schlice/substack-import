**Content:** [Relationships are far more complicated than you are making
them out to be in your question. You can\'t reliably predict what will
happen to two people simply because you have classified their mental
disorders.\
\
The scenario you laid out is one possibility. There are plenty of other
possibilities as well. They may get together and find such happiness
that it overcomes the tendencies of their personality disorders and they
stay together. They may get together and it becomes abusive.\
\
There are as many possibilities as there are people to live them
out.]{.rendered_qtext}
