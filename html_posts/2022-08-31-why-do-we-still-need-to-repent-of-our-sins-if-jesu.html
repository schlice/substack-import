This is an excellent question!

I think part of the explanation comes from *point of view.*

- From God's point of view, our justification has forgiven all of our
  sins, *past, present,* and *future*, as He is timeless and sees our
  entire life before Him, all at once. For God, everything is *now*.
- But for **us**, we haven't sinned in the future yet. So God's
  justification, *from our perspective*, is forgiveness of our past and
  present sin, and something like the legal grounds upon which our
  future sins can be forgiven.

When we sin in the future, we return to God and ask again for
forgiveness. However, it's not a new justification. We've been justified
once, but we're *re-applying* our justification to our new present.

We therefore approach the sin with a different heart. When the unsaved
confess their sins, they do so with the longing and desperation of
someone seeking justification. But a *believer* confesses sin as someone
who retains the assurance of justification, and who comes *gladly* to
Christ, knowing that our salvation is assured, and that His love and
forgiveness is everlasting. Even in our confession of sin, we glorify
God.

Let's take that a step further, because John actually discusses this
"future justification" thing:

> But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship
> with one another, and the blood of Jesus, his Son, purifies us from
> all sin.
>
> If we claim to be without sin, we deceive ourselves and the truth is
> not in us. If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will
> forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness. --- 1 John
> 1:7--9 NIV

So let's break this down. He starts by saying that if we walk in the
light, the blood of Jesus purifies us from all sin. So therefore, if we
walk in the light, Jesus' blood continually cleanses us from our sin.
This is that "future justification" we were discussing.

But what does it mean to "walk in the light?" He goes on to explain it.
He says that if we claim to be without sin, we deceive ourselves. In
other words, "walking in the light" does not mean that we are without
sin. Walking in the light, therefore, means that you are aware of your
sin. The "light" illuminates your sin, and you see it. Christ's
forgiveness doesn't inoculate us against sin, nor is it a
"pre-forgiveness" for all sin, or we could then sin with abandon and we
would be automatically forgiven, and this doesn't seem like what the
Biblical writers were saying at all. Clearly here, there is a
recognition that we are sinners and that *we repent* of that sin (we
turn away). Yet, we are still human, and we still sin. "Walking in the
light" shows us our sin.

So what do we do with what we see? He goes on to say that if we confess
our sins, God is faithful and forgives our sins. Therefore, "walking in
the light" must also include recognition that we're sinners and
confession of that sin.

So I think the message here is pretty clear. In order to "walk in the
light" of the salvation we have been given, we need to continually
recognize that we are sinners, and acknowledge that Christ died for our
sin and His blood washes us clean. I think a little gratitude in that
prayer is probably a good thing as well, as I don't think I could ever
thank God enough for rescuing me from where I was and offering His
salvation to me.
