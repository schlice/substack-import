It's not so much the gun as it is the state that you're in which
matters. There is no gun that is simply universally accepted in every
state without any hassle.

It's up to the gun owner to know the laws of the state into which they
are entering and to be prepared to have their weapons confiscated until
such time as they get themselves properly registered in that state. In
many states, only state residents may register weapons. Guests are often
not allowed to register weapons (where weapon registry is mandated by
the state), and the process to get registered (if you're even allowed to
do it as a non-resident) may take longer than the amount of time you're
going to be in the state.
