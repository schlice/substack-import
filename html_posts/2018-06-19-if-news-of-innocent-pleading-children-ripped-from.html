**If news of innocent, pleading children ripped from their parents does
not move Trump Nation to disagree with their leader, what will?**

Why would it move me to disagree with the President when he is doing
exactly what he was elected to do? He is enforcing the law as Congress
wrote it. It's been a long time since a president hasn't acted
extra-legally, as Sen. Schumer would like Trump to do. He'd like Trump
to write an Executive Order to change the law. This, unfortunately for
the esteemed Senator, is unconstitutional. Obama had no trouble acting
extra-legally and unconstitutionally. Trump does.

If Congress doesn't like separating children from criminals, they can
write a new law to fix it. How is that the President's fault?
