**Content:** [In other words, you\'re asking if someone says they
committed a murder, but there is no body, can they be convicted of
murder?\
\
The answer is yes, you can be convicted of murder without the body,
assuming there is enough other evidence (i.e. physical, circumstantial,
etc) that shows that a crime was committed.\
\
If there is **no evidence whatsoever** that a crime was committed, it
would be very difficult (but not impossible) to convict someone of
committing said crime. Any halfway-competent public defender should be
able to avoid conviction if there is absolutely no
evidence.]{.rendered_qtext}
