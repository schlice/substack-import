The Air Force became its own service in 1947. Before that, it was part
of the Army as the Army Air Corps.

So it was already using Army-style ranks.

But they did make a few changes; for example, they did not keep the Army
enlisted ranks. They changed the color of the uniform, adopting Air
Force Blue instead of Army Green, but the styling of the uniform was
identical to the original Army Air Corps uniform. They did keep the rank
insignia and the rank structure on the officer side.
