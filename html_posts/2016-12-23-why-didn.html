What [[Subhankar

is trying to say is that the reason Asus went with the more durable less
scratch-resistant Gorilla Glass 4 on the Zenfone 3 is the same reason a
company makes any business decision: **cost**. They were trying to
control the costs on the Max and Laser, so they went with the cheaper
glass (Gorilla Glass 3). It's more durable, but less scratch-resistant,
which makes it cheaper.
