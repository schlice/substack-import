**Content:** [Four ways:\
]{.rendered_qtext}

- Fly in Business or First Class, or on an airline that has power ports
  at each seat. Check with
  [[SeatGuru](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=004fee&url=http://www.seatguru.com){.external_link
  rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
  onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
  qt-tooltip="seatguru.com"}]{.qlink_container} to see if your airline
  and your airframe has power ports to which you can connect.
- Use an external battery pack. There are literally a bzillion on the
  market (yes, it is a real number, as it was used in *Toy Story*, which
  makes it real by default).
- Use a solar powered charger and hope that you get enough sunlight in
  your window seat to power it. Chargers from
  [[GOALZERO](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=2a1781&url=http://www.goalzero.com){.external_link
  rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
  onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
  qt-tooltip="goalzero.com"}]{.qlink_container} should do the trick, but
  there are many different kinds.
- Use your laptop as a charger. Most modern day laptops have some USB
  ports that can be set to continuously deliver 5V power *even when the
  laptop is off.* My Lenovo ThinkPad has this feature. The USB port is
  yellow to indicate the \"always-on\" port.

There\'s probably even more creative ways to charge your phone, but this
is all I can think of at the moment.\

(EDIT) Some older lavatories on aircraft had 110V sockets to power
electric razors and toothbrushes. You might be able to suck a tiny bit
of juice out of there in the time you\'re in the lav. With a fast
charger, you might get yourself 5-10% of battery charge this way.
