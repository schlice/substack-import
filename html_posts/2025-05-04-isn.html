The Bible doesn't *allow* slavery. The Bible only allows it insofar as
it doesn't outright *condemn* it. **But why? Even if the Bible doesn't**
***allow*** **slavery, why doesn't the Bible** ***condemn***
**slavery?**

So, we must discuss a few things to set the stage before we dive in to
the discussion. First, we must be very careful to not apply our modern
sensibilities to a culture which existed more than 2000 years ago. Even
just 100 years ago, it was considered Constitutional that a black man
could be "separate but equal." So it's clear that certain social issues
change over time, even in the relatively short span of a century.

Second, we must understand what we're talking about. The Bible discusses
several different concepts of slavery. The slavery we are used to
discussing is "chattel slavery," which is an involuntary form of
slavery. In the Bible, enemy soldiers captured in battle are sometimes
subject to chattel slavery. The next most common type of slavery in the
Bible is what is more commonly referred to today as "indentured
servitude," where a person essentially asks someone else to pay their
debts, and the person becomes *indebted* to the payor, and agrees to
live as a servant until such time as that debt has been paid off. Our
modern-day employment contracts are an outgrowth of that form of
indentured servitude.

Finally, we have a tendency, because we live in the United States and
Abraham Lincoln abolished slavery in the 1800s, to think of slavery as a
*past* thing. But it is most definitely not. It is estimated that
roughly 27 million people today, worldwide, are still subjected to
slavery: forced labor, the global sex trade, inheritable property, etc.

As those who have been redeemed from the slavery of sin, Christians
today should be the foremost champions of ending human slavery in the
world. But if that's the case, why does the Bible not speak out strongly
against slavery?

In other words, **why does the Bible seem to support the practice of
human slavery?**

Slavery was a common practice long before the Mosaic Law was written. So
rather than *condemning* the practice, the Law instead sought to
*regulate* it. It gave instructions for how slaves should be treated
rather than outright condemning the practice. And the law also gave
specific directions based on who you were, and who your slaves were:

> **Hebrews with Hebrew slaves.** The law allowed for Hebrew men and
> women to sell themselves into slavery to another Hebrew. They could
> only serve for six years, however. In the seventh year, they were to
> be set free (Exodus 21:2). This arrangement amounted to what we might
> call indentured servanthood. And the slaves were to be treated well:
> "Do not make them work as slaves. They are to be treated as hired
> workers or temporary residents among you" (Leviticus 25:39--40). The
> law also specified that, "when you release them, do not send them away
> empty-handed. Supply them liberally from your flock, your threshing
> floor and your winepress. Give to them as the Lord your God has
> blessed you" (Deuteronomy 15:13--14). The freed slave had the option
> of staying with his master and becoming a "servant for life" (Exodus
> 21:5--6).
>
> **Hebrews with Gentile slaves.** When the Israelites conquered the
> land of Canaan, they were to drive out or destroy all the former
> inhabitants. However, that order was not fully obeyed, and many
> Gentiles remained in the land. God allowed the Hebrews to take slaves
> from among that population \[and these were the equivalent of "chattel
> slaves"\]: "Your male and female slaves are to come from the nations
> around you; from them you may buy slaves. You may also buy some of the
> temporary residents living among you and members of their clans born
> in your country, and they will become your property. You can bequeath
> them to your children as inherited property and can make them slaves
> for life, but you must not rule over your fellow Israelites
> ruthlessly" (Leviticus 25:44--46).

So clearly, the Mosaic Law made provisions for slavery. But *any* sort
of provision for slavery was *revolutionary*. In the time of the Bible,
**slaves had no rights**. But the Mosaic Law in Exodus 21 gave slaves
rights: right to keep a wife (verse 3), the right not to be sold to
foreigners (verse 8), the right to be adopted into a family by marriage
(verse 9), the right to food and clothing (verse 10), and the right to
be free from corporal punishment by their masters (verses 20, 26--27).

So why didn't Jesus and His apostles immediately condemn every slave
owner? ***They didn't need to.*** Jesus' earthly ministry was never
intended to be a political movement. It was instead intended to change
*individual hearts*, and those changed people would go on to make social
and political change. Indeed, everywhere where slavery was ended, you
could find at the nexus of that change a Christian. The Bible already
contains all the concepts a person needs to end slavery: men are all
made in the image of God (Genesis 1:27), people should not kidnap and
sell a person (Exodus 21:16; cf. 1 Timothy 1:8--10), and that a slave
can truly be "a brother in the Lord" (Philemon 1:16).

So like the questioner, people criticize the Bible because it didn't
immediately call for the banning of every social and political evil. But
that was never its goal. The truth of God's Word changes *people*, and
*changed people* *change people.* The Bible creates Christ-followers who
themselves create Christ-followers. Even today, you'll find the mission
statements of many Christian churches describe them as just that: Christ
followers who create Christ followers. And since Christ followers
themselves have been released from slavery (the slavery of sin), they
should desire to spread that belief to others who would then be released
from their own slavery to sin.
