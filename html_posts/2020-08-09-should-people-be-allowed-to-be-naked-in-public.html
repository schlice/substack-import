**Should people be allowed to walk around naked?**

I just answered a different question (but the fundamentals are the same)
regarding when it is no longer appropriate to allow little girls to run
around topless.

[[Bill Stein\'s answer to At what age does it become inappropriate for a
little girl to run around
topless?](https://www.quora.com/At-what-age-does-it-become-inappropriate-for-a-little-girl-to-run-around-topless/answer/Bill-Stein)]{.qlink_container}

So why can't people walk around naked?

Well, depending on what part of the world you live in, maybe you can.
But at least part of the reason is related to climate.

Humans do not have thick coats of fur or layers of blubber to keep us
warm. Granted, we are warm-blooded so we don't rely on the environment
to heat us, but our skin is definitely not designed to be exposed to
bone-chilling cold. Our skin can freeze and our ability to regulate our
own body temperature is compromised when it is exposed to the elements.

But the question was not "can people walk around naked." The question
was "should people be allowed to walk around naked."

And the answer, *in current society*, is **no.**

In today's society, there is a thing called *modesty* and *propriety*.
Whether or not you believe those things *should* exist is certainly a
topic for debate. Regardless, those things *do* exist, and in
determining whether or not we should allow people to walk around naked
all the time, we must take society as it *is*, rather than how we *wish
it would be.*

In today's society, there is also a thing called *evil*. There are
people called *predators* who are literally itching for you to get your
proposal approved and start walking around naked. Combine your public
nudity with the laws which say that I can take pictures and video of
anyone in public, and you've got yourselves the makings of a world-class
pervert factory. I can't imagine that such a move wouldn't have a
non-trivial affect on the rate of crimes against the person, if you know
what I mean. I shouldn't have to spell it out. Oh, for heaven's sake,
rapes and sexual assaults will skyrocket. C'mon, work with me here.

If you want to talk about the creation of an *ideal society*, we can
certainly talk about whether or not clothing should exist. We can also
talk about whether or not certain articles of clothing should be
mandatory.

But in today's society, with today's issues, we simply can't support the
idea that anyone can walk around naked at any time. Americans are indeed
private about their bodies. It's not appropriate to call it "prudish,"
it's more appropriate to call it "private." Today's society sexualizes
nudity, and women use their, er, assets to their advantage when they
choose clothing. To suddenly declare that "no longer a thing" isn't
really possible.

And it's also important to remember that *not everyone in the world
believes as you do.* It is appropriate to take others' feelings into
account when we make policy that affects everyone, and there is a
sizable group of people who don't want everyone to be naked all the
time.

**TL;DR: In today's society, no, people should not be allowed to walk
around naked.**

*For the time being, I have re-enabled comments on selected answers.
Some people like to comment. Some people like to engage with me in a
civil manner, and I did kinda miss that\...a little. But do not
misunderstand, I take this step very cautiously. My mental well-being
isn\'t worth your harassing, inane behavior. If you don\'t like what I
wrote, tough shit. If my answer is grammatically low-quality or is
un-cited opinion masquerading as fact, downvote it. If you think I\'m
wrong, write your own answer. But Quora is a question-and-answer site,
not a debate site. If you are simply commenting to tell me \"ackshually,
you\'re wrong,\" don\'t be surprised if I quietly delete your comment.
Put anything vaguely harassing in there, and your deletion will be
followed by a block and a mute, and a BNBR report. I will do this
immediately and with no compunction. You have been warned. Be nice.*
