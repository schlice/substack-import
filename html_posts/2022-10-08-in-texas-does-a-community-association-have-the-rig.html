As we have mentioned several times here already, the HOA only has the
rights granted to it in the Governing Documents. Every HOA is different,
and every set of Governing Documents is also different.

But I will tell you that most HOAs allow the Board to enter your
*property*, not your *home*. For example, just yesterday, we had a
property in the neighborhood which is a rental property (the owners live
in New Jersey). The previous tenants had moved out, and the house is
vacant currently, but in the intervening time, a sprinkler line had
broken and was shooting water continuously into the air. While that
doesn't seem to be a terrible thing, it could pose a problem for the
neighboring house. So what to do? I and one other Board member contacted
the rental management agency, and I entered the property (not the house)
and went to the main sprinkler line cutoff and turned it off, stopping
the water. Our Governing Documents allow us to enter property to address
safety issues, and so we did. We took copious time-stamped photos and
sent them all to the rental company. They were fine with our action, and
they sent someone today to have a look at the issue.

TL;DR: Generally, Governing Documents don't allow the Board permission
to enter your *house*, but most allow them to enter your *property* to
address safety issues.
