You can join the FBI if you are a member of the Inactive Reserve. You
can also join the FBI if you are a member of the Active Reserve as well
(i.e. one weekend a month, two weeks over the summer).

Bear in mind that if the United States goes to full-scale war and we
begin activating Reservists, you could be activated. You would follow
all of the protocols that any Active Reservist would follow. You will
maintain your position in the FBI for as long as they can afford to
leave your position vacant. They do have the authority to backfill your
position, and when you return from Active Duty, you must then be given
an equivalent position at an equivalent grade (not the same position)
with equivalent pay and no loss of time in service or benefits.
