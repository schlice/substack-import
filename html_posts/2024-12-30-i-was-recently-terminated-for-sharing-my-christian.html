As a Christian, I tell you this in the most loving and caring way I
possibly can.

**You are free to say anything you like, even to share the Gospel.**

**You are** ***not*** **free from the consequences of what you say.**

You are free to tell an atheist that he's going to burn in hell. But if
that atheist tells your employer what you did, your employer can choose
to terminate you for any reason they like, or no reason at all.

The Constitution grants you the right to say anything you want. The
Constitution does not make you *immune* to any consequences from that
speech.

If your company decided that you are not the type of person that they
wish to keep employed, then they can fire you. You don't have a right to
work, and you don't have a right to say anything you choose without
consequence.

My employer could similarly fire me for what I write on Quora. I assume
that risk when I voice my opinion on this platform. I am under no
disillusion that I can somehow sue my former employer for unlawful
termination because they didn't agree with the content of my free
speech.

Again, you are free to say whatever you like to whomever you like. But
you are not free from the legitimate and expected consequences of such
speech. Your speech indicates your character, and your company can
absolutely hold its employees to minimum standards of character.
