**Why does \"scam likely\" keep coming up on my phone\'s caller ID for
certain numbers?**

I am a big fan of this one. It's actually the carrier trying their
hardest to stop fraud.

There has been a rash of scam calls lately, and people are rightly upset
about them. There's not much that anyone can do. It's challenging to
even get the government involved, as sometimes these companies operate
from out of the country. People have fallen prey to these scammers and
have lost millions.

So the carriers have decided to step in. On numbers known to be used by
scammers, *the carrier* is intercepting the Caller ID, before it comes
to you, and changing it to "SCAM LIKELY" or some other warning for you.

When you see that caller ID, it's because your carrier is trying to help
you avoid being scammed.

You can assist too. There are services you can use to help stop the
calls. For your landline, I suggest you take a look at
[[Nomorobo](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=df0749&url=http://nomorobo.com/){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="nomorobo.com"}]{.qlink_container}. It's free for your
landline. For your mobile device, I strongly recommend
[[Hiya](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=e67c36&url=https://hiya.com/){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="hiya.com"}]{.qlink_container}. Not only does it provide
Caller ID for your phone where caller ID is not provided, but it also
integrates with community blacklists to block known telemarketers and
scammers.
