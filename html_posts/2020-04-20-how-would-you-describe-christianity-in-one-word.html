**HOPE.**

Christianity acknowledges the state of the world as it is. It
acknowledges that the world is fallen and broken.

*But for all of that, it offers* ***hope****.*

It's precisely like the story of Pandora's Box. Adam and Eve opened the
box, and released all of that evil into the world. With free will comes
the possibility to choose evil.

But stuck down in the small corner of the box was the one thing that
Christianity offers: hope. We are hopeful for our future because of the
gift of salvation that we have been given.

> In this world you will have trouble. But take heart! I have overcome
> the world. --- John 16:22 NIV
