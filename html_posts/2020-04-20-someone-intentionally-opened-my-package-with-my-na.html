**Someone intentionally opened my package, with my name on it, and used
the content. Is this illegal?**

On multiple levels, yes.

This is literally the best definition of the *Federal* crime of mail
theft:

> Because the United States Postal Service is a federal agency,
> mailboxes are considered federal property, and mail theft is charged
> as a federal offense. If you are charged with mail theft, you could
> face up to five years in federal prison and fines of up to \$250,000.
> It is also a crime to injure, deface or destroy any mail deposited in
> a mailbox. For each act of vandalism, you could be imprisoned for up
> to three years and fined up to \$250,000. Depending on the manner in

> charges, such as assault, and breaking and entering. If personal
> identifying information, such as names, dates of birth, addresses,
> telephone numbers, tax I.D. numbers, Social Security numbers and
> driver's license numbers, was stolen you could also face identity
> theft charges.[\[1\]](#HlzrF){#cite-HlzrF .citation_link}

In addition to the Federal charge, most states have also criminalized
mail theft. Some states (like California) charge it *more harshly* than
even Federal law does; check with your state laws to see what the
punishment could be for mail theft.
