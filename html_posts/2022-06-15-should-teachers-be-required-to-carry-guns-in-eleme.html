I really don't know why this is so difficult to understand.

Teachers should not be required to carry guns in elementary schools.
Teachers should be *allowed* to carry guns in elementary schools.

The teachers who do carry guns would be teachers who, just like outside
of the school, must apply for and receive a Concealed Carry Permit
(CCP). It's called different things in different states. Some call it a
Concealed Weapons Permit, but while the name may change, the
requirements do not.

Not only must you be a person who is not legally barred from possessing
a firearm (felons, mental defectives, etc), you must pass a gun safety
course and go through a thorough background check. You'll need to
provide fingerprints for your file, and usually pay a fee to cover some
of the costs of the processing of your permit. The teacher pays for this
out of their own pocket.

Statistics bear out the fact that concealed carriers are literally the
group in society which is the least likely to commit any crime
whatsoever. Concealed carriers kill fewer people than the police.

When teachers carry guns (since this wigs people out so bad), it's
likely they will be required to take additional training *over and
above* your usually CCP holder. Most school districts who have permitted
licensed teachers to carry have required them to take additional
training, such as the training Colorado offered to teachers through

**TL; DR: Teachers should not be required to carry guns in elementary
schools. Teachers should be** ***allowed*** **to carry guns in
elementary schools.**
