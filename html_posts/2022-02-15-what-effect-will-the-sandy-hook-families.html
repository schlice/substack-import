If gun violence were caused by marketing, then *maybe* this case might
cause gun manufacturers to think differently about how they market
firearms.

But no reputable study has been able to link gun violence to marketing
by gun manufacturers. Sure, there are studies. But they all show how gun
manufacturers' marketing practices *may play a role* in gun violence,
not that marketing guns in a specific way or to a specific target
demographic *causes* gun violence.

So at best, the mentally unhinged might not choose a Remington for their
next killing spree because of updated marketing. But until we stop
focusing on the tool and start focusing on the violence, this is nothing
more than a Pyrrhic victory.

Original question:

What effect will the Sandy Hook families\' settlement for \$73 million
with gun maker Remington have on gun violence in the future?
