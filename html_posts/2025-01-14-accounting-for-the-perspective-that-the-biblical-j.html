So let's assume for the moment that the Jesus of the Bible was invented
out of whole cloth as you claim. So for this analysis, we can't rely on
the Bible for any historicity.

How do you explain all of the non-Christian writers who wrote about
Jesus? And some of these sources are decidedly *anti-Christian, not just
non-Christian.* So even in denying certain aspects about Jesus (like
denying that He is God or that He was resurrected), they simultaneously
prove that He existed.

All in all, there are ten non-Christian sources who mentioned Jesus
within 150 years of His life. They are:

- Flavius Josephus, a historian;
- Tacitus, the Roman historian;
- Pliny the Younger, a Roman politician;
- Phlegon, a freed slave who wrote histories;
- Thallus, a first-century historian;
- Seutonius, a Roman historian;
- Lucian, a Greek satirist;
- Celsus, a Roman philosopher;
- Mara Bar-Serapion, a private citizen who wrote to his son;
- the Jewish Talmud

Whether you doubt the truth of those particular authors, or whatever
your personal issues with them are, these authors collectively
acknowledged certain facts about Jesus. These non-Christian authors
admit facts about early Christianity that help us piece together a
storyline that is surprisingly congruent with the New Testament. These
are the facts which come out of those authors' stories:

1.  Jesus lived during time of Tiberius Caesar.
2.  He lived a virtuous life.
3.  He was a wonder-worker.
4.  He had a brother named James.
5.  He was acclaimed to be the Messiah.
6.  He was crucified under Pontius Pilate.
7.  He was crucified on the eve of the Jewish Passover.
8.  Darkness and an earthquake occurred when he died.
9.  His disciples believed he rose from the dead.
10. His disciples were willing to die for their belief.
11. Christianity spread rapidly as far as Rome.
12. His disciples denied the Roman gods and worshiped Jesus as God.

So in order to claim that Jesus didn't exist, you would have to also
doubt the validity of all of these authors.
