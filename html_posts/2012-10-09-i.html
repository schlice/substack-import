**Content:** [To be brutally honest with you, this is why CCSVI is not
an approved treatment for MS. The studies which have shown promise are
not clearly usable studies across the board. Clinical trials are still
in progress.\
\
Also, as with any treatment, it is not 100% guaranteed to produce
results. This is especially true for MS, in which no one\'s MS is
exactly like anyone else\'s MS. What you respond to may be completely
different from what someone else responded to.\
\
I responded successfully to Copaxone for six years. Then it stopped
working. Don\'t know why. I was exactly as faithful in taking my
medicine in year one as I was in year six. That\'s just it; no one knows
exactly why.\
\
So, I did what anyone in my position would have done: tried the next
medicine in the list. Yes, my neurologist and I have a list. We looked
at all the choices and made the best one, in our collective opinion.\
\
I suggest you do the same.]{.rendered_qtext}
