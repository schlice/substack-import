No. At best, the HOA doesn't have the authority to issue the fines it
does. But *criminal?* No, not at all.

First of all, let's discuss what is a "made-up fine."

In the US, if an HOA is going to cite you for a violation of the Rules,
the Rule in question must be specified. And it must be a Rule that the
Board of Directors has voted to approve at a Board meeting. The HOA is
required to let you know what that rule is that you are being accused of
violating.

It may be something as simple as, "No homeowner may participate in any
activity which is a nuisance to other homeowners." Who decides what is a
nuisance? Who decides whether or not that nuisance bothers other
homeowners? The answer is that the HOA, in its *exclusive* authority,
decides what is a nuisance and what is not.

I don't know your specific situation, but I *do* know that everything
the HOA fines you for must be something as recorded in the Governing
Documents, or in the Rules and Regulations. So first, find out what
provision within your Governing Documents was violated. If they cannot,
or will not, cite the actual provision being violated, do not pay the
fine.

If they do cite a provision, was that provision approved at a Board
meeting? Were those meeting minutes made public? Were you provided with
an updated copy of whatever document is being cited (even posting on the
HOA website is considered "providing a document")? These are all very
important questions for you to ask. If there is an appropriate
provision, and they provided you with the necessary documentation, and
they can show they did, pay the fine and fix the violation. It's not
worth pissing them off.

Finally, be cautious if you think you don't want to pay the fine.
Failing to pay a fine is a very dangerous proposition. I would never
fail to pay a fine without already retaining a lawyer and discussing the
situation with him/her. There is a great deal of risk in failing to pay
a fine. If you accumulate enough fines, the HOA can turn your account
over to their own attorney, who will not only continue to accumulate
fines and late fees, but then their own attorney's fees as well. Once
the dollar amount gets high enough, the HOA and their attorney can place
a lien on your home until those fines are paid, and if they go unpaid
for long enough, they can foreclose on that lien, sell your house out
from under you, and use the proceeds of the sale to recoup the money
they are owed. I STRONGLY suggest you talk to a real estate attorney in
your local area who specializes in HOA law. DO NOT FAIL TO DO THIS if
you plan on not paying the fines.
