**Can a legal expert tell my why you MUST give up your right to remain
silent to provide your name and date of birth when arrested? There is
nothing in the 5th Amendment about this.**

Actually, it is very clearly in the 5th Amendment.

Here's the whole thing, with the important bit highlighted:

> No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous
> crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury, except
> in cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in the Militia, when
> in actual service in time of War or public danger; nor shall any
> person be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of
> life or limb; **nor shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a
> witness against himself,** nor be deprived of life, liberty, or
> property, without due process of law; nor shall private property be
> taken for public use, without just compensation.

The important bit is "nor shall be compelled in any criminal case to be
a witness against himself\[.\]"

"Being a witness against yourself" basically is the definition of
"self-incrimination." You say something that proves your own guilt. For
example, if you revealed something that only someone at the scene of the
crime while it was being committed would know, it would prove that you
were present at the crime. Not answering based on the grounds that you
may become a witness against yourself, or "pleading the 5th," is exactly
that.

Positively identifying yourself (i.e. providing your real name and date
of birth) does not cause you to self-incriminate. Therefore, it is not
covered by the 5th Amendment.

To that end, nearly all states do have laws which require you to give
your real name and other personally identifying information (but not
necessarily protected information like your Social Security Number) to
police when asked. And police don't have to have you arrested; when
police conduct a *Terry stop*, they can also ask you for your real name
and you must provide it, or you can similarly be detained until they
figure out your real name (another example of a "process crime" like
lying to a Federal agent). It goes without saying that when I said
"nearly all states," what I meant was that all states are different.
Specifics about when exactly in the process you must provide your real
name differ between states.
