**Why is it possible for a veteran that was dishonorably discharged
(from the United States Air Force for rape), to be permitted to live in
a VA sober living home free of charge?**

Veterans who received a dishonorable discharge are not entitled to VA
healthcare benefits. In most cases, if a veteran was dishonorably
discharged, there is no recourse to receiving medical care. However,
sometimes care may be offered on a temporary, emergency basis when
substance abuse or mental health are issues. If the veteran is later
found to be ineligible, the veteran will be responsible for the costs of
that healthcare.

I can't speak to this particular veteran's situation, but it sounds like
the discharge was not officially categorized as dishonorable. It may
have been under Other Than Honorable (OTH) conditions, or may have been
a Bad Conduct Discharge, but it was likely a character of discharge that
was something other than honorable but also something other than
dishonorable. In those circumstances, the veteran may still receive VA
healthcare for service-connected conditions, or conditions made worse by
service. Other VA benefits may not be available to this category of
discharge, but healthcare for service connected issues generally remains
intact.
