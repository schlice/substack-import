Short answer: yes.

Longer answer: You will most likely be attested. You may get convicted.
Preemptive defense is not normally permitted (it\'s an assault),
**unless** you can clearly articulate that you were in fear for your
safety. It will be up to a jury to decide if your defensive action was
reasonable, given that you were not actually attacked.
