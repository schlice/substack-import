**If someone is arresting you, but you have reason to believe that they
are not actually a cop, what are your options?**

If you're actually being arrested (i.e. already in handcuffs in the back
of a car), you're out of luck; you're too late. Pray to whatever higher
power you believe in (if you have one) that your reasons are wrong.

If the officer arrives in a local police car, wearing a local police
uniform, there is almost no chance that the person is not a police
officer.

If you're still paranoid, or if the person is in plain clothes rolling
up in a car with nothing more than a Kojak light on it

then you can do the following:

- Ask the officer for his identification card. Someone playing at being
  an officer will have a very official-looking badge and usually a gun,
  but very rarely will have an ID card. If you see an ID card, even if
  you're not an expert in the ID card layouts of your local law
  enforcement agencies, and it doesn't look like it was printed on a
  dot-matrix printer and laminated at Kinko's, you can be reasonably
  assured that the person is a police officer. Real ID cards are
  directly printed onto plastic cards because they are usually proximity
  cards which function both as ID cards and as keys to the station
  doors. They're not usually laminated.
- Request to call 911 and ask the dispatcher if the person is a real
  officer. If it is a real officer, he or she should indulge you that
  much leeway, but just that much. They will probably dial 911 on their
  phone and then hand it to you to talk to the dispatcher.

If none of these things assuages your fears (or if the person does not
show you an ID card and does not let you call 911), you have a choice to
make. If you're still in your car, you can attempt to flee, and drive
immediately to the nearest police station and run inside. Once the
officer is identified, however, be prepared to face additional charges,
such as resisting arrest. If you're not in your car, you could try to
run, but this could also be very dangerous for you.

Regardless, if you do run, don't run away, run to a police station. In
the unlikely event that the person was not a real police officer, you'll
be safe and exonerated. If they were actually an officer, they will
likely arrest you at the police station, but at least you know it's real
cops, so there's that. Just be prepared for additional charges.
