**Content:** [The only assumption we can make was that the locking
mechanism broke and simultaneously locked the pilot out, and locked the
co-pilot in.\
\
The door is designed to lock from the inside only, so if that system
failed and the co-pilot was unable to unlock the door, the pilot would
be locked out.]{.rendered_qtext}
