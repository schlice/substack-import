**If rape victims don\'t get justice with the legal system, should they
just start taking matters into their own hands?**

I think you need to be careful with your terminology.

A legally accurate ruling in court is **justice,** even if no one goes
to jail

A pound of flesh, or for *someone* to pay for what happened, is
**retribution.**

Are you sure you want justice? Or do you really want retribution?
