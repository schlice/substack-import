**What action can I take against a shopkeeper who allows people to drink
in front of his shop, and also serves snacks to those who drink? The
police officers might be helping him in running his shop.**

You didn't mention where this is happening. Since I know the laws in the
US, I'll address this as if it is happening in the US.

In order to be able to do something about it, you have to be an
*aggrieved party*. In other words, there must be some *demonstrable
harm* caused by what's going on. For example, you own the neighboring
shop, and the actions are causing you to lose business. If you're not
experiencing some demonstrable harm from the action, it's unlikely that
your suit would go anywhere as you do not have *standing* to bring a
suit.

Secondly, you have to ensure that you're targeting the right person.
Unless the shopkeeper is responsible for enforcing laws on the street in
front of his shop, he probably is not the right person to address. You
should be talking to the city, asking them why they are not enforcing
the laws.
