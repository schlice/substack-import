**Content:** [I think you\'re in a unique position. People marry \"for
better or for worse\" and then when someone develops an incurable
disease, they realize they didn\'t really mean it, or didn\'t really
understand that they were committing to someone even when the physical
quality of their life changes, sometimes drastically.\
\
I think that if you can appreciate that you are there for her in
whatever way she may need, then her MS should not make a difference.
It\'s a big deal and it is going to be something you will both have to
deal with for the rest of your lives. But it should not change how you
feel about someone. And if you truly care for her, then you will want to
support her and help her through the rough patches and be that shoulder
to lean on when the challenges of MS become unbearable to endure alone.\
\
If you can be that person, then you are perfect for
her.]{.rendered_qtext}
