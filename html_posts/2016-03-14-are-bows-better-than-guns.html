Better for what? Bows are better than guns for some things.

Bows are better than guns at killing silently, or near silently. Even a
suppressor still makes a loud report. It\'s not the whisper-quiet puff
of air the movies make it seem.

Bows are better than guns in not using gunpowder.

Bows are better than guns because you can use a lighted nock to find
your target in the dark.

Bows are better than guns because you don\'t contaminate part of your
target\'s meat with lead.
