**If you were on the jury, how would you have voted in the case of the
off-duty Dallas police officer shooting her upstairs neighbor?**

Exactly as the jury did.

There's not a lot of wiggle room here. She claimed that the Castle
Doctrine applied even though she made a "mistake of fact" and entered
the wrong apartment. She truly believed she was in her own, and that
belief is what drove her desire for self-defense.

However, the Texas Castle Doctrine law is very clear.

> (c)â€‚A person **who has a right to be present** at the location where

> at the time the deadly force is used is not required to retreat before

She did not have "a right to be present" in the other person's home, so
there is no application of the Texas Castle Doctrine, according to plain
language of the statute.

Therefore, Castle Doctrine theory did not apply, so a determination of
whether or not she was justified in shooting took place, and they found
quite clearly that a reasonable person would not have feared for their
life in the same situation.

Guilty, although if I had a choice, it would have been manslaughter, not
murder. Murder is a killing with malice and forethought, and this was
more an unjustifiable homicide than a murder. I would have called it
manslaughter, not murder, but this is Texas, so...
