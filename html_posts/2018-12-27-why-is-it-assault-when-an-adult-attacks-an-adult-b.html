**Why is it assault when an adult attacks an adult, but it\'s not
considered assault when a kid attacks another kid?**

Assault is a crime under the adult justice system. It requires an *actus
reus* (the guilty act) and *mens rea* (the guilty mind). Mens rea is
"the mental element of a person\'s intention to commit a crime; or
knowledge that one\'s action or lack of action would cause a crime to be
committed."[\[1\]](#inJnL){#cite-inJnL .citation_link}

Children cannot form *mens rea*. Their minds are not yet developed
enough to be able to determine that their action or lack of action would
cause a crime to be committed.

Therefore, we have a *juvenile justice system* in the United States.
Assaults that are actually referred to the juvenile justice system are
not handled in the same way as assaults in adult courts. If an assault
were to actually be brought to a juvenile court, it would be called a
"delinquent act" which is essentially anything that could be charged as
a crime in an adult court. Proceedings are generally not open to the
public, as juvenile records are normally sealed from public disclosure.

They may not have to have formal charges pressed at all. Factors that
may affect a court\'s treatment of a juvenile offender and the
disposition of the case include:

1.  The severity of the offense. A serious crime is more likely to
    result in the filing of a petition than a less severe crime.
2.  The minor\'s age. Petitions are more likely to be filed in cases
    involving older children.
3.  The minor\'s past record. Formal charges are more likely when a
    minor has been previously involved with juvenile court.
4.  The strength of the evidence that the minor committed a crime.
    Obviously, stronger evidence leads to a greater likelihood of formal
    charges.
5.  The minor\'s sex. Formal charges are more likely to be filed against
    boys than against girls.
6.  The minor\'s social history. Petitions are more likely to be filed
    when children have a history of problems at home or school.
7.  The parent\'s or guardian\'s apparent ability to control the minor.
    The greater the lack of parental control, the more likely the intake
    officer is to file a petition.[\[2\]](#bfBND){#cite-bfBND
    .citation_link}

Unofficially, courts can also be swayed by factors like:

1.  The minor\'s attitude. Formal proceedings are less likely to occur
    when a child shows remorse for committing a crime.
2.  The minor\'s appearance. If the young person is polite, dressed
    well, and neatly groomed, then the intake personnel are more likely
    to handle the case informally.
3.  Whether the minor has family or community support. The more support
    the young person has, the more likely the intake officer is to deal
    with the case informally.
4.  Whether the minor has an attorney. Disposing of a case informally
    may be less likely when a child has a lawyer.

When a case is decided in juvenile court, there are generally three
possible outcomes:

1.  Informal supervision: The court informally monitors a child and
    automatically dismisses charges if there is no further troublesome
    activity
2.  Formal supervision: Similar to adult probation, the court requires
    the child to stay out of trouble and report periodically to a
    juvenile probation officer.
3.  Incarceration: The child is referred to a juvenile detention
    facility.
