I think the confusion you have is that you believe that a "gun show" is
just like a "gun store" and it is not.

A "gun show" is a place where sellers can go to sell guns, and buyers
can go to buy guns. Just as outside of the gun show, there are two types
of sellers: FFL dealers, and private sellers.

The same rules that apply outside of the gun show apply inside the gun
show.

- If you buy a gun from an FFL dealer, you will fill out a 4473 and you
  will have a background check performed through the NICS system before
  you can buy your firearm. You must follow all federal and state laws
  in the state where the transaction is taking place in order to
  purchase the gun. At a minimum, you must be 18 to buy a rifle and 21
  to buy a handgun.
- If you buy a gun from a non-FFL seller, it is considered a private
  sale, and federal law does not require a background check. Some states
  do require background checks for all sales, but most do not. All
  federal laws still apply to private sales.
- A FFL dealer is a FFL dealer whether he's in the gun show or not. He
  can't refuse to sell you a gun inside the gun show knowing that you'd
  fail your background check, and instead bring you out to his car, and
  conduct a private sale out of his trunk.
