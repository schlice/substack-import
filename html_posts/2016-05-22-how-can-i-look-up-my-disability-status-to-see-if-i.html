If you live in the United States, you do not have a "disability status"
recorded anywhere official.

According to the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), which is the
seminal law surrounding protection of rights for disabled persons, a
person is defined as having a disability if he or she is "a person who
has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or
more major life activities, a person who has a history or record of such
an impairment, or a person who is perceived by others as having such an
impairment."

Note that there are three facets to the definition:

- A person who has a physical or mental impairment that substantially
  limits one or more major life activities. This one is pretty
  self-explanatory. Someone with a physical limitation is considered
  disabled. A person with a hidden disability which substantially limits
  one or more major life activities is also considered disabled.
- A person who has a history or record of such impairment, as listed in
  the first bullet, is also considered as a person with disability, even
  if they do not currently have a disability.
- People who are not disabled but are perceived by others as being
  disabled are also protected under ADA.
