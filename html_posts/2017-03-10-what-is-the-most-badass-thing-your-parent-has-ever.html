Let me start off by saying that I am not my dad's biggest fan. Since
I've reached adulthood (which I define as having the mental acuity to
see through the childhood glamour we have of our parents and see them as
the flawed humans they are), we have had a falling out, and I don't talk
to them anymore.

That said, while my dad was a cop, he was pretty badass.

I remember when he won two "Top Cop" awards two months in a row. This
was a department-level award that was presented monthly. I guess it was
a pretty big deal to win one. But to win two in a row? That's something.

\[WAR STORY ALERT: and this one is fairly graphic. No images other than
the ones you form in your mind. You've been warned.\]

The first month, he was responding to a domestic disturbance. I call it
a domestic disturbance because that's how it was characterized over the
radio. But the victim he found was, for lack of a better term,
*disemboweled* but still alive. He was on the ground, and much of the
contents of his lower GI tract was on the outside of his body, hanging
out of a large knife wound which spanned the width of his torso. My dad
removed his uniform shirt, and removed his white T-shirt (the only
color-free cloth he had access to) and, using his T-shirt, carefully
returned the man's "guts" to his gut, and stuffed the wound with the
improvised trauma dressing. After many hours of surgery, the man did
survive.

The second month saw him back on the department's hazmat unit. Now, I
know what you're thinking: isn't he a cop? Don't firefighters do hazmat
stuff? Well, yes and no. Yes he was a cop. But where I lived growing up,
all of the fire departments were volunteer. No paid firefighters means
very little training budget, and certainly no budget for the extensive
training required to man a hazmat crew. So my dad was recruited out of
Emergency Services to start a hazmat team. One hazmat call he took was
for a truck crash on one of our local highways. A box truck had gotten
into an accident, and when fire crews checked the back of the truck,
they found it full of 55-gallon drums of unidentified chemicals, which
the driver identified as various toxic and highly dangerous chemicals he
was illegally hauling to be illegally dumped. Not only were the
chemicals toxic, but they were highly unstable, and the truck was well
on its way to catching fire. We're talking nitroglycerin in one drum and
sulfuric acid in another (memory is a little fuzzy on that second one; I
remember the nitroglycerin but I don't remember what the other chemicals
were specifically). The drums were not labeled, some of the drums were
damaged in the crash and were leaking, and an explosion would have
decimated a 20 square block radius, and the ensuing chemical cloud would
have injured many millions more. The firefighters did what they could to
keep the fire down, but how were they going to get these drums out
safely? My dad donned a Class 1 fully-encapsulated hazmat suit replete
with SCBA gear (kinda like SCUBA gear, just not underwater) and entered
the back of the truck. He sprayed liquid nitrogen on all of the barrels,
freezing them solid so they could be safely removed, preventing what
could have been one of the largest losses of life and damage to the
environment that the region would have ever seen.

All in all, pretty badass. Like I said, we may not be friends now, but
gotta give credit where credit is due.
