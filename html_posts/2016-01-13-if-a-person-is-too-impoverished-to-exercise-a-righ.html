The right to an attorney is in the 6th Amendment to the Constitution
(\"In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a
speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury \[ \... \] and to have the
assistance of counsel for his defense\"). Additionally, the right to due
process is in the 5th and 14th Amendments (basically, a citizen of the
United States \"shall not be deprived of life, liberty, or property
without due process of the law\"). Besides an affirmative granting of an
attorney, you have the right to procedural due process, and substantive
due process. The government is therefore obligated to ensure that your
right to due process is guaranteed when you proceed through the legal
system. Therefore, in order to ensure your due process rights are
granted, you have the right to have an attorney present at any time. If
you are adjudicated to be impoverished, this changes nothing about the
wording of the 6th Amendment, and you still must have due process rights
protected, therefore the state will provide you with an attorney.

The right to keep and bear arms is completely different, in that it is a
natural right. The Constitution does not \"grant\" you the right to keep
and bear arms. It does not say \"You have the right to keep and bear
arms.\" The Constitution \"enjoins\" or \"prevents\" the government from
taking your natural right to self-defense away. It says \"The right to
keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.\" This means the government
cannot take away your right to keep and bear arms; in other words, it
says the government cannot make a law which takes away your right to
keep and bear arms. Nothing in that statement is read to mean that the
government must also provide you with arms. It simply states that the
government cannot pass any laws which take away your right to keep and
bear arms. Whether or not you can, or choose, to exercise that right, is
up to you.
