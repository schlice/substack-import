**If it costs us millions of dollars every time Trump takes a trip, how
much are his rallies costing us, and why is it okay? How can he campaign
on U.S. tax money?**

Some of the costs of any president's political campaign travel (not just
Trump) is paid by the taxpayer. For example, Secret Service details
guard the president 24x7, regardless of where he is. This is true
whether he's visiting Pittsburgh for a funeral, traveling to a campaign
rally, or going on vacation. This is just one of the costs we as
taxpayers bear to protect the president, regardless of what he's doing
or where he goes.

But some other costs when campaigning, like the cost to run Air Force
One, are not paid for by taxpayers. Federal law requires that campaign
travel is reimbursed by the campaign. In Trump's case, the RNC pays for
that portion of his travel. In the most recently available figures, it
costs approximately \$180,118 per flight hour for Air Force One, which
includes everything needed (spare parts, food, fuel, etc). The campaign
pays for that.

If someone flies on AF1 with the president while campaigning (like when
Hillary Clinton flew with Obama while she was campaigning), they don't
get a free ride. A formula is used to compute what they pay, and it is
relative to what it would likely cost for a commercial first-class
ticket[\[1\]](#ejDWk){#cite-ejDWk .citation_link}, and the campaign
similarly pays for that.
