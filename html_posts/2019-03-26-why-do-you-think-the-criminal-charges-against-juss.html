**Why do you think the criminal charges against Jussie Smollett were
dropped when there is fairly compelling evidence he made the story up?**

There are one of two possibilities.

1.  The prosecution found a defect in their case. Perhaps something in
    the background of the witnesses or the defendant that would make
    prosecuting the case problematic.
2.  The prosecution engaged in a one-time good-deal known as ***deferred
    prosecution***, where they simply decided that pursuing these
    charges did not benefit the state. Fortunately for Smollett, Chicago
    does not require the defendant to plead guilty before prosecution
    can be deferred like some other states.

In this case, the prosecution requested, and the judge granted, a *nolle
prosequi* (or "will not prosecute"). This can happen for any number of
reasons: new evidence, discovery of a defect in their case, or perhaps
just to "cut a break" to the defendant. We do know that Smollett's
community service was considered, and we also know that Smollett
forfeited his bond (the \$10,000 he used to bail out of jail). After
these considerations, the prosecution decided to nol pross the case.

We may never know which one of these possibilities is the real reason
why the prosecution decided to drop the case.

The case is left as if charges were never brought. This is different
from an acquittal, because charges can be brought again if the
prosecution chooses (after filing a new charging document). Acquittals
generally mean that charges cannot be filed again.
