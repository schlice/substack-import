This is called a *faithless elector*. What happens to you if you are a
faithless elector is up to the state. If your state has faithless
elector laws, you would be subject to the penalties for violating those
laws. In 16

states, if you don't vote the way the state told you to vote, your vote
gets cancelled

and you get replaced. Five of those states impose a penalty on you for
doing so.

Under the [[Uniform Faithful Presidential Electors
Act](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=e8921e&url=https://www.uniformlaws.org/committees/community-home?CommunityKey%3D6b56b4c1-5004-48a5-add2-0c410cce587d){.external_link

vote for a candidate, and a mechanism exists to replace them if they
don't.

Original question:

What happens if any of the 538 electors in the US Electoral College
decide they don\'t want to cast their vote for the candidate who has
received the majority vote in their district?
