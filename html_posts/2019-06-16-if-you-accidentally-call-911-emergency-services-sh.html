**If you accidentally call 911 will the police definitely come to your
house even if you call and tell them its an accident?**

No, but the key to whether or not they will come out to your house is
whether or not you hang up on them without telling them about your
accident.

Short answer: if you accidentally call 911, ***stay on the phone!***
Tell the 911 operator that you accidentally dialed. Answer all of their
questions, and *wait for them to tell you it's okay to hang up.* If you
do this, the police will not be dispatched.

If you accidentally call 911 and then hang up, there's a chance that
something could be wrong where you are, and they may very well send a
unit out to confirm you're okay.
