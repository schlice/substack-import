My dad was a detective with Nassau County PD (just east of NYC on Long
Island). At least one case that he worked on personally was featured on
*NYPD Blue*. The good crime dramas use actual cases (changing the names
to protect the guilty, of course) to enhance the realism of the show.
The phrase \"that\'s so crazy that it must be true\" comes to mind
because some of the cases seemed exactly that way. My dad called me one
night while the season was on-air and asked if I was watching. When I
confirmed that I was, he said, \"That\'s my case! That\'s my case!\"
I\'ll spare you the (actually) gory details of the case, but they did
use his case on the show. While the squad room dynamics were overly
dramatized to make them more interesting, the mannerisms, speech
patterns, lingo, and overall attitudes that the actors captured were
top-notch and very realistic. Much of that quality has to do with the
show\'s on-set advisor, usually a retired member of the department being
portrayed, and that person\'s ability to effect the dialogue and other
aspects of the show.

Today? Want to find a good cop show today that accurately reflects what
police officers (especially detectives) go through? Watch *The First 48*
on A&E. If you want true realism, that\'s your show.
