**Content:** [Amending the Constitution without actually amending the
Constitution would be a real challenge, as the only way you could change
Article V of the Constitution is with *a Constitutional amendment*.
It\'s like a Catch-22.\
\
Except that it\'s not.\
\
If you can\'t get agreement that the Constitution *should* be changed,
then maybe the Constitution shouldn\'t really be
changed.]{.rendered_qtext}
