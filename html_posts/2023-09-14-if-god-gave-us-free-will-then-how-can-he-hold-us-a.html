You've got it backwards.

If we have no free will, then we cannot be accountable for what we do,
because we don't get to choose.

If we have free will, and we have the choice to follow God or not, and
we choose to not follow God, we can be held accountable for that choice.

***It it precisely because we have free will that we are held
accountable for our actions.***
