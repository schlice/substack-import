There are two major ones:

1.  **The first life.** In order for macroevolution to occur, you must
    evolve *from* something. So macroevolution, even if it is true that
    one species can evolve into another, still must start with a living
    being which was created out of nothing, and macroevolution cannot
    answer how that happened. Intelligent design still explains that
    better than macroevolution. Evolutionists will hand-wave that away,
    saying that it's irrelevant to macroevolution, but I submit that
    it's pointless to investigate macroevolution because it is
    impossible for it to have actually occurred without explaining where
    the first life came from.\
    \
    In other words, even if evolution is true, the first life didn't
    evolve. Evolution is a pointless discussion if you can't (or won't)
    provide evidence to show where that first life came from.
2.  **DNA**. No one can explain how an intelligent message was randomly
    assembled, because all of the evidence we have shows us that a
    message (specified complexity) comes only from intelligence. DNA is
    a perfect example of specified complexity, and evolution cannot
    explain how DNA evolved from nothing.\
    \
    DNA, in computer programming terms, is the world's most complex
    piece of software to ever have been created, and yet evolutionists
    believe it randomly self-assembled (regardless of the mechanism they
    have contrived). They haven't proven that it actually did assemble
    that way; it's all theory. They have no evidence. They show how
    small steps *could have* assembled and then induce how the larger
    process may have happened. But the likelihood of that induction is
    extremely small (in other words, the gap between what they know and
    what they believe is very large).
