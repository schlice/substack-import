**Will Rep. John Conyers and Sen. Al Franken voluntarily surrender to
police to be booked and arraigned for felony sexual assault, or will
they have to be arrested and handcuffed in their offices?**

First of all, I don't think either of them are the subjects of criminal
investigations. I don't see where any accusers have any legal standing
to begin criminal investigations, as it appears that the allegations of
misconduct have all happened many years ago, and the statutes of
limitations have already expired.

But even if there was a criminal charge and even if the District
Attorney wanted to arrest them, they would work out a deal under which
they would voluntarily surrender to police. They would not need to be
handcuffed in their offices.
