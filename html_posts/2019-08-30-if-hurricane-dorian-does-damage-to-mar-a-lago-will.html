**If hurricane Dorian does damage to Mar-a-Lago will Donald Trump pay
for it or would the US taxpayers pay for the repairs?**

The government would only pay for damages to government assets. For
example, if USSS set up facilities at Mar-a-Lago, those would be paid
for by the government.

The government would not pay for any general damages to the facility.
