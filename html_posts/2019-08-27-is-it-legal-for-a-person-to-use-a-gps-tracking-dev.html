**Is it legal for a person to use a GPS tracking device to monitor their
spouse\'s location/movements throughout the day?**

It is perfectly legal to track a car you own. If it's an asset you own,
and it's likely that the asset would be taken without your permission,
you can also absolutely track it, regardless of what it is. You can
track your children if they are under 18.

It is generally illegal to track people who are over 18 without their
consent, and it is generally illegal to track vehicles which you do not
own.

The state may not track you without a warrant.
