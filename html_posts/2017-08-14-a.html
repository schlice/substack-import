I'm reasonably certain that this question stems from [[the proposed
"Eric's Law" in
Colorado](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=a70557&url=https://www.change.org/p/support-eric-s-law-a-law-that-requires-people-to-report-life-threatening-situations/nftexp3/fb_share_post_dynamic/671863199?recruiter%3D671863199%26utm_source%3Dshare_petition%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook%26utm_campaign%3Dshare_petition.guest_form_reduction%26utm_term%3Dshare_petition%26utm_content%3Dfb_share_post_copy_6%253Afb_share_post_dynamic){.external_link

onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="change.org"}]{.qlink_container}. The petition says that
"nine other states have such laws," but I have been unable to find many
states that require anyone to report *crimes*, let alone situations
which are not crimes but in which someone is in danger.

Existing duty to report laws, where they do exist, make it a crime in
itself to fail to report *a crime*. Reporting any time someone's life is
in danger would overwhelm 911 switchboards, as stupid people put their
own lives in their hands every day doing stupid things, and the casual
observer can't separate the personally incompetent from the situation
which really requires someone's assistance. Technically, any time you
see someone riding a motorcycle without a helmet, you would be required
to report it or face charges yourself, as this is a situation in which
someone's life is in danger. In the case which inspired the proposed
"Eric's Law," the raft in which he and his raftmates were travelling in
capsized. The raftmates returned to Eric's car without him, and left.
This law would put the onus on not only those raftmates, but on anyone
passing by and seeing a capsized raft to call police every time, or face
criminal prosecution.

Also, who's job is it to determine when someone's life is in danger? How
do you know? From an outside observation, there are a scant few
scenarios in which there is no reporting requirement, but it is clear
that someone's life is in danger. Prosecuting someone under this law
would be challenging, because you would have to prove beyond a
reasonable doubt that the person *knew* that the victim's life was in
danger, and knowingly, with intent, failed to report it. Unless you're
planning on making this a strict liability crime, you would also have to
show some *mens rea* showing that the person recklessly or knowingly
failed to report what he or she *knew* was a life-threatening situation.

Actual "duty to report" laws require reporting of **crimes**, not
reporting when someone puts themselves in danger, or when someone is
personally in danger.

To make a complete analysis, let's examine some actual duty to report
laws.

Misprision of felony is a crime under US law (18 USC 4):

> Whoever, having knowledge of the actual commission of a felony
> cognizable by a court of the United States, conceals and does not as
> soon as possible make known the same to some judge or other person in
> civil or military authority under the United States, shall be fined
> under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both.

However, you might note that this offense is for concealing a known
felony, rather than reporting it.

As far as the states go, the vast majority of states do not have duty to
report laws, and in general, the public has no duty to report a crime,
nor to do anything to stop one. For the few that do, you are only liable
if you fail to report a *crime*, which means that failing to report
anything else is still not a crime in and of itself.

Texas has a state statute which makes failing to report a crime which
results in grievous bodily injury or death a class A misdemeanor. Ohio
also has a law which makes it illegal to knowingly fail to report a
felony. However, while these states have these laws, rarely is anyone
charged under them.

Some professions have an affirmative duty to report, even if the general
public does not. For example those who work with children or the elderly
are under mandatory reporting rules as part of their profession. In some
states, anyone who learns of child abuse of any kind is required to
report it.

However, reporting as the OP is asking (and as Eric's Law is proposing)
is not required anywhere in the United States (as far as I can tell),
and in the few states in which there is a duty to report crimes, it is
very rarely prosecuted.
