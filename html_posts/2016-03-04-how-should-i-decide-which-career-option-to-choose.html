You\'re already in AFJROTC; have you thought about joining the Air
Force?

You could check off lots of the items on your list:

- Creating solutions to problems
- Getting stuff done
- Working with other people
- Helping / training others
- Creating / implementing plans
- Being a role model
- Being organized

If you\'re still in high school (which I assume from the fact that you
list AFJROTC), going to college and doing actual ROTC would make you an
**officer** in the military, which would check off the following extra
items:

- Leading / being a role model
- Managing

Even if you don\'t go the college route, coming out of AFJROTC, you\'ll
start higher in rank if you enlist, which means extra money.

My advice (which you can do with what you wish) is to take this list to
your local Air Force recruiter. Even if there isn\'t an available career
field that lets you do CAD/CAM, there are plenty of fields that allow
you to work with some of the highest tech stuff we have available today.

But whatever you do, I wish you well. Good luck!
