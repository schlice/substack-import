What he specifically said was the following:

> As a society, \"we are becoming addicted to wanting particular
> outcomes, not living with the outcomes we don\'t like,\" Thomas said.

> \"We can\'t be an institution that can be bullied into giving you just

The Supreme Court specifically is an organization which is designed to
be *outside* of the influence of people. That's one of the reasons the
Justices are appointed for life. They don't ever have to worry about
appeasing the public in order to be re-elected. They can focus their
attention on the Constitutionality of the laws, even if the decisions
may be unpopular.

What people need to realize is that while they are indeed allowed to
freely express their opinion, there is no requirement for the government
to respond, or to alter what they are doing because of it. In 1984, the
court said, "Nothing in the First Amendment or in this Court\'s case law
interpreting it suggests that the rights to speak, associate, and
petition require government policymakers to listen or respond to
communications of members of the public on public
issues."[\[2\]](#jHjwQ){#cite-jHjwQ .citation_link} This is especially
true of the courts, which are designed to be free from public pressure.

Thomas is basically saying that people need to realize that these
protests are more about expressing your opinion than they are pressuring
a Justice to change his vote, as the latter encroaches dangerously close
to some violations of federal law.

What do you think of Judge Clarence Thomas complaining about the
nationwide protests against the leaked draft overturning Roe v. Wade,
calling it bullying the Supreme Court?
