**Why isn\'t a law background (or mandatory law courses) required for
law enforcement officers in the USA?**

The basic police academies of nearly every police agency in the country
include basic law courses covering the criminal laws which the officers
will be required to enforce. A general law degree is too broad and
covers far more information than a police officer is required to know in
order to effectively do his job.

In other words, police officers are police officers, not lawyers. Sure,
it might be nice if your electrician has an EE degree from college, but
it's unneeded. It might be useful if your lawn care professional has a
biology degree from college, but it's unneeded for his job.

Similarly, if a police officer had a law degree, he'd become a lawyer,
not a police officer.
