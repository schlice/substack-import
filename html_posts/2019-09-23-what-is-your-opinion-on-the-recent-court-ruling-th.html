**What is your opinion on the recent court ruling that that has
essentially made it legal for women to be able to go topless in
Colorado, Kansas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Utah, and Wyoming?**

This case is interesting, and it highlights the changing landscape of
gender equality, and how courts are changing along with it.

First of all, specific to this ruling, a Fort Collins, Colorado
ordinance banning female toplessness (even though the state holds a less
restrictive view) was struck down in the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals
(which encompasses the six states in the title). Basically, in doing so,
it has stated that city bans on female toplessness in those six states
are unenforceable. Colorado allows public nudity as long as it is not
sexually oriented. Cities, however, previously enacted public nudity
bans against female toplessness.

The two women who sued were part of the "Free the Nipple" campaign,
which started on Instagram, which blocks the exposure of female breasts.
They argued that the 1st and 14th Amendments were violated here, as the
law restricted freedom of expression and unequally forced women to not
go topless while not having the same force against men, and the court
agreed.

The city argued, and it's not a trivial argument, that society is to
blame for the disparity. It is society, they argued, that has sexualized
the female breasts, and therefore female breasts are more analogous to
sex organs than to generic female body parts. The city still retains the
ability to restrict the public display of sex organs if it so chooses,
for the maintenance of the public decency and to avoid contributing to
the delinquency of children.

However, the court noted, we are in a new time, and how we interpret the
validity of many gender based laws "may in fact reflect 'archaic and
overbroad generalizations about gender' or 'outdated misconceptions
concerning the role of females in the home rather than in the
marketplace and world of ideas.' J.E.B., 511 U.S. at 135 (quoting
Schlesinger v. Ballard, 419 U.S. 498, 506-- 07 (1975), and Craig, 429
U.S. at 198--99)".

With this "new understanding" of how we judge "gender equality," laws
must be held to a much higher standard than they have been before. In
other words, things like outmoded societal standards (such as the one
sexualizing the female breast) no longer stand up in court, and the 14th
Amendment will apply in more cases than ever before.

This case illustrates how the court is changing along with society, and
as standards change, so too does the way we read and interpret the law.
