It\'s not an ethical issue. Business owners can give away whatever they
choose, to whomever they choose.

However, it presents an image of favoritism, and if officers know they
get free stuff, they will frequent that place. That\'s not a bad thing
for the business owner, but it makes for the appearance of uneven,
unfair policing, favoring the businesses who can afford to give out free
stuff.

So in order to avoid even the appearance of impropriety, our agency and
others like it prohibit deputies from receiving anything for free while
on duty.
