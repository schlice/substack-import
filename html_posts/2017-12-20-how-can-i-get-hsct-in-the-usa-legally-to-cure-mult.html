[[Me](https://www.quora.com/profile/Me-9043)]{.qlink_container}'s answer
is correct. And I'm reasonably sure that Northwestern is the only
location in the US which is actively doing HSCT trials, although this
may have changed by now (these trials do change rather quickly).

But the trial, as Dion mentioned, is really difficult to get into. Not
only do you need to have *very* aggressive MS, but you also have to have
tried traditional disease modifying drugs and have had limited or no
success with them.

The procedure is **dangerous** because, as Dion mentioned, they will
have to **destroy your immune system** by using chemotherapy to destroy
your bone marrow. Then, using stem cells they previously harvested,
replicated, and forced into pluripotency, they will rebuild your immune
system and your bone marrow.

You will be as an infant, with a brand-new immune system. At this point,
the common cold can kill you. You will need to be in sterile isolation
until your immune system can be rebuilt, **and there is no guarantee
that you will emerge on the other side without MS.**

As you can see, you have to be in some very dire straits before HSCT
would even be considered an option for you. The procedure is still too
new and too untested to be recommended to any but the most severe cases
of MS that are simply not responding to any of the therapies we
currently have. It is currently a treatment of last resort, and you
still may not even qualify.

But if you think you meet these criteria, discuss it with your
neurologist. If you truly fit the profile of someone who might qualify,
I'm certain they would go out of their way to help you get into the
trial in whatever way they could help.

Good luck.
