Nope. There's no federal issue here. This will be resolved by the
Florida courts.

However, what the Governor's plan is here is tough to tell; he hasn't
really revealed much of it yet (as of 7 May 2022).

We've all been going off of the assumption that, like with most things,
this will simply be re-negotiated. In fact, the legislation that was
signed dissolving Reedy Creek by July 2023 says, in the next sentence,
that any organization affected can renegotiate, with the effective date
being July 2023. This says (without saying) that what the legislators
were really going for was to dissolve an old special district *and
replace it with a new one.*

Oddly, a week or so later, in another press conference, Governor
DeSantis doubled down on his rhetoric, saying that he did not want to
renegotiate Reedy Creek; he wanted to dissolve it, and that Disney would
pay their bond debt, not Orange or Osceola County taxpayers.

I don't yet have a good understanding what his angle is here. The
special district was, in truth, beneficial for both Florida and Disney.
Disney still paid their property taxes, over \$300 million last year,
and an additional \$250 million in other state fees. So while there may
have been some tax incentives, Disney wasn't making out like bandits at
the state's expense. So I'm a little confused by this.

We shall see as the story unfolds.

Original question:

The wrap reports that DeSantis is telling Disney that Florida won't pay
off debts to dissolve the special district. Is it possible that this
will evolve into a lengthy legal battle to the Supreme Court?
