If you're walking in one direction, can you truly go the other direction
if you simply apologize and admit that you're going in the wrong
direction but never turn around?

If you don't actually *implement* any changes, you'll never change.

Will Rogers said, "When you find yourself in a hole, stop digging."
You'll never fix anything until you stop doing the thing that caused you
to break in the first place.
