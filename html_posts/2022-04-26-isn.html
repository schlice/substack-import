At best, it could be considered a *retaliation* against a company who
exercised its free speech rights. But an *infringement* of free speech,
it is not. The law change does not prevent the corporation from
expressing its opinion freely. However, retaliation could be considered
because the corporation exercised a protected free-speech right, and the
state retaliated against the corporation for doing so.

Disney would have a good case against Florida. But Disney has a few
things to consider before they file a lawsuit.

- Florida would have the right to discovery. While no one is saying that
  Disney has violated any other state laws, they probably don't want
  Florida mucking about in business that they'd rather keep
  confidential. Most companies would prefer to keep their inner
  machinations private, so this makes the idea of a lawsuit
  unattractive.
- Disney would do well to remember that it was Florida who allowed them
  to re-open just months after they were forced to close for COVID, but
  the great and lauded state of California, wherein resides their
  corporate headquarters, forced their *other* property to remain closed
  for over a year. From the outside looking in, Florida is a bigger
  supporter of Disney's continued business than California.
- While Disney could sue and win, at best, all they would get would be
  an injunction against making any modifications to RCID today, but they
  would also sour future relations with Florida, and you can't un-ring
  that bell. Republicans are not going away any time soon from the
  Sunshine State, and Disney should probably stay on their good side, at
  least for now. They could re-tool the law, bring it in to
  Constitutional compliance, address all the concerns that the lawsuit
  brought up, and pass it later. Disney can win this battle in the short
  term, but if they go down this road, they will likely lose the long
  game.

That said, Disney doesn't need Florida. Florida needs Disney.

- While Disney likely couldn't *relocate* Disney World, it could
  absolutely *close* the Florida business permanently, sell off all of
  the assets, and only lose a small chunk of operating revenue. They
  would make far more in real estate sales than they make from the park
  itself, enough to pay off all of their bond debt and still make a tidy
  profit. They simply don't make a large portion of their profits from
  their theme park business. Disney would lose a handful of employees,
  but Florida would lose its largest business and its largest employer.
  Disney would continue to hum along, but Florida would lose its biggest
  tourism draw, probably the one thing that keeps the state from having
  to implement a state income tax.

So what's probably going to happen here is that Disney and Florida are
going to quietly renegotiate the terms of the Reedy Creek Improvement
District, and everything will go back to the way it was before.

Isn\'t Florida\'s law specifically targeting Disney a massive
infringement of free speech?
