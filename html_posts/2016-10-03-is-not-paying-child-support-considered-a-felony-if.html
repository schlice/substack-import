Short answer: it depends on the state. Some states call the crime
"Nonsupport of a Child," which in Indiana for example is a Class D
felony.

Longer answer: It is counterproductive to jail parents who refuse to pay
child support. It's the same reason we got rid of debtor's prisons over
200 years ago. When you put someone in prison, they most assuredly won't
be able to pay child support, so you're not actually improving anything.
The goal of the laws is to be a deterrent against failure to pay,
instead of a mandatory sentence.

At a federal level, the Child Support Enforcement Act of 1984 grants
districts attorneys and state attorneys generals the authority to
collect back child support on behalf of custodial parents. This and
other federal child support initiatives are managed by the Office of
Child Support Enforcement within the U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services (DHHS).

A deadbeat parent's failure to follow directives from a district
attorney or state authority could subject them to penalties including
jail time. However, like I said, since a jailed parent is unlikely to be
able to make regular payments, it is reserved as a last resort and used
more as a deterrent. Because the goal is to encourage parents to pay
child support, enforcement typically begins with the removal of certain
privileges and/or the application of certain restrictions. For example,
a parent owing more than \$2,500 in support may be denied a passport
until he or she pays their past due balance.

In accordance with the Act, state attorneys may take any of the
following enforcement measures against a delinquent non-custodial
parent:

- Garnishment of wages
- Liens against property or real estate
- Reporting the debtor to credit bureaus
- Freezing bank accounts
- Suspension of professional or driver\'s license (in some states)
- Contempt order
- Jail time [\[1\]](#tVlwf){#cite-tVlwf .citation_link}

If a parent simply cannot pay, it's very unlikely that they will
actually go to jail simply because they don't have the money to pay. The
parent who cannot pay must make a motion in court to modify the child
support order, taking into account the parent's current financial
situation. Child support is one of the debts that cannot be waived
through bankruptcy proceedings.
