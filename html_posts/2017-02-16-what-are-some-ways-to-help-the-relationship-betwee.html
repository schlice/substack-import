Let's assume we're talking about children. We're not talking about
college students, because they are technically adults.

**Children model what they see from their adult mentors.**

So the easiest way to change the behavior of children is to *model
better behavior.* Changing the behavior of children first involves
changing our own behavior. If we are rude, condescending, or dismissive
of police during our own interactions, or even if we see them as we
drive by and we make a comment, kids hear that. They absorb that, and
they model their own behavior after it. It's hard to believe, but while
you may think they are ignoring you, they are most definitely not.

**Change the narrative**.

The narrative of late has been the one that cops are nothing but racist
killers. The facts and the data say otherwise, but that doesn't stop the
antagonists in groups like Black Lives Matter. *Their entire platform is
based on a lie.* Plain and simple. Yet, they are given ample airtime by
a complicit media, and the message, however false and misleading,
spreads.

When you see these examples on TV, take the time to explain to your kids
why this is wrong. Explain that most cops will go their entire careers
and never shoot anyone, and that the vast majority of cops are decent,
hard working men and women dedicated to their communities. Lumping them
all in with the few bad seeds (and yes, we know they are there) is not
fair to the vast majority of the law enforcement community.
