**Is it illegal for US companies to disobey Trump\'s orders to
immediately start looking for an alternative to China, including
bringing their companies home and making their products in the US? Can
the Supreme Court overturn Trump\'s orders?**

Anyone who has taken basic Civics classes already knows that Trump's
tweets aren't an "order." The Executive Branch does not have the
authority to "order" businesses to do anything. The Executive Branch
executes existing law. Trump likes to use words, but not all of his
words are grounded in law. We get that. He's a businessman, not a lawyer
or a politician. However, if there is a law that Trump is going to start
enforcing (where they failed to enforce it before), then maybe that's
something he can "order." But Trump sending out a few tweets does not
constitute an "order" that businesses "must follow."

But if I was an American company, I wouldn't read Trump's tweets as an
"order." I'd read them as a "strong suggestion." As in, "If I were you,
I'd start looking for an alternative to working in China." Reading
between the lines, I'd read: "Because there are going to be some
significant changes related to the things I can control: tariffs. And
those changes will have a significant impact on your company, if you
continue to choose to work in or with China." It's true, Shenzen set
itself up to provide this sort of cheap labor and parts, and American
businesses have taken advantage of it, but the rampant IP theft and
potential security issues leaves Shenzen a temptress which might just be
too costly with which to climb into bed. Or stay there.

As a company, I may not change anything *today*. But I also would have
put an entire team together to examine my whole business model, find out
what parts of it are dependent on manufacturing in China or materials
sourced from China, and look for alternatives.

I hear India is ramping up to meet the challenge. In fact, some
companies are already doing this (i.e. [[Apple is moving some of its
manufacturing to
India](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=469e12&url=https://appleinsider.com/articles/19/04/15/foxconn-confirms-that-mass-production-of-the-iphone-will-begin-in-india-soon){.external_link

If China continues to be so flippant with US patent law, I would be
looking elsewhere anyway.
