**Content:** [I think it\'s pretty clear that the father won\'t be
charged with a crime, since he was in the act of self defense.\
\
Sadly, if you watch the state of affairs of the US legal system, the
rapist may have a civil claim against the father for using unreasonable
force to stop him. That, too, would be an uphill battle for the rapist,
but we\'ve seen burglars sue the homeowners of the houses they were
robbing for the injuries they sustained while in the commission of their
crimes, so it\'s not uncommon to see this kind of thing in court. And in
rare cases, they win.\
\
The rapist would argue exactly what most people here are arguing: the
father used more force than was necessary to stop him from committing
his illegal act. The extra force was excessive, and he should be held to
account for that.\
\
The father would argue \"heat of the moment\" or \"heat of passion\" in
the protection of his child. It\'s the same motivation that drives
voluntary manslaughter, where crimes are so disgusting that the
retaliation tends to be swift, immediate, and generally more than what
is minimally necessary. Like killing the guy you catch in bed with your
wife and not raping her.\
\
The judge would have a very hard time finding the point at which the end
of the crime happened and the unlawful beating started. I still think
the rapist would have a tough row to hoe.]{.rendered_qtext}
