The answer is that it depends on what the "rules about rules" are in
your Governing Documents. We really cannot provide you the answer you
are looking for, as the answer is going to be specific to your HOA and
your Governing Documents.

In general, HOA Boards are allowed to create *Rules and Regulations*
(R&Rs). No community voting is necessary; the HOA Board can create and
modify RR&s as they see fit. Now, *they* have to vote on the rule
change, and it has to be done at an open Board meeting, but you do not
need a vote of the members for the Board to create or modify a rule.

This is different for modifying the rest of the Governing Documents (the
Declaration of Covenants, the Articles of Incorporation, or the Bylaws),
as each of those document has different requirements for amendment,
usually involving assent by some percentage of the homeowners.

As long as those newly-added rules do not violate any other provisions
in the Governing Documents, they are legal and enforceable.

So details matter.

- What rule was created? How was it created? Does that rule require a
  vote of the membership, or just of the Board?
- What rule does it contradict? How was *it* created? Did *that* rule
  require a vote of the membership, or just the Board?

We cannot answer these questions here. You should probably seek the
advice of a real estate attorney in your local area who specializes in
HOA law.
