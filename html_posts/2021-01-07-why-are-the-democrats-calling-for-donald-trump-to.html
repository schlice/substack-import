**Why are the Democrats calling for Donald Trump to be removed via the
25th Amendment or are they really setting us up to remove Joe Biden via
the25th Amendment?**

My personal opinion is because they know they can't get an impeachment
done in time, and there may even be some moderate Democrats who are more
in favor of censure than impeachment.

Also, if they can "stretch the legs" of the 25th Amendment, then it
might become easier to use in the future.
