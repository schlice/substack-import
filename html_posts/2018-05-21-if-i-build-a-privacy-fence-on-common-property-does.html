**If I build a privacy fence on common property, does the Homeowner
Association own it?**

Yes they do. If you build a fence on someone else's property, that
someone else (whether it be a private owner or an HOA) can tear down the
fence and bill you for the cost of doing so.

If you want a fence on that property, petition the Board for a fence.
Tell the Board you'll be happy to pay the entire cost of the
installation of the fence. Perhaps the Board will approve your request.
