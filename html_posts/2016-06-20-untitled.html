Let's look at what you just said.

**Background checks** are already done when someone wants to purchase a
firearm.

**Psychology tests:** We already have a process where someone who is
**adjudicated** by a judge as having a mental deficiency cannot buy a
gun. Who exactly would perform these tests? What are we testing for? If
we can't even wrap our heads around the problem, we may as well call for
laws mandating laser-beam eyes and it will have exactly as much effect
on the industry.

The President's statements are inflammatory and nonsensical. We already
do the things he's calling for.
