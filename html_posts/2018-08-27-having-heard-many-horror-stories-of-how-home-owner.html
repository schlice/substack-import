**Having heard many horror stories of how Home Owners Associations treat
their residents, can somebody explain the advantages of belonging to an
HOA?**

If you own a condo, an HOA can be very valuable, and if you live in a
small(ish) neighborhood of single-family homes, it can actually help. By
keeping home exteriors neat and uniform(ish), HOAs help keep
neighborhoods looking good, keep living conditions safe for children and
families, and home values high. As an example, we have 130 homes and we
live across a main street from another very similar neighborhood built
around the same time. We have an HOA, they do not. Our home prices, on
average, run about \$30,000 more than theirs do, for a comparable house
("comps," in real estate jargon), and we're just across the street.

You can tell why. Drive around their neighborhood, and you see the car
on blocks in the driveway. You see the house next door, painted electric
blue. You see the house across the way where the owner doesn't bother
cutting or watering the lawn, ever. You see cars all over the streets.
It simply looks crowded and uninviting. Now drive around our
neighborhood. Lawns are maintained. There are no electric blue houses
(although there's a forest green house which looked better on paper than
it did on the walls). The roads are mostly car-free. It looks neat. It
looks well-kept. It looks like people care about the neighborhood (even
though some of them couldn't care less). It looks like a place you'd
*want* to live.

Additionally, we negotiated a trash and recycling service for the
neighborhood. What usually would cost you about \$20 a month we could
negotiate at \$8 per house, and we pay for that out of your HOA dues.
Plus we have the added benefit that with only one trash company, we have
only one day per week that trash cans are out, only one day a week that
trash trucks are around, and the service pulls the cans back up as close
to the garage as they can get them when they dump your trash, so the
neighborhood still looks neat.

Finally, here in Colorado, we have marijuana. Not such a big deal,
right? Wrong. Many different things can go wrong with this law, and many
have. The cartels have moved into neighborhoods and made grow houses,
converting the entire house into a grow house, because they know that
law enforcement is mostly powerless to stop them. By the way, Feds are
not, and that's the only way we've been able to bust the drug houses is
with the DEA's help. But without the local police to help, the HOA's
"nuisance odor" rule was the only other way we could legally take care
of the drug house. We fined the owner, and when he didn't pay, we put a
lien on the home, and then when we didn't get paid for another *year,*
we foreclosed on the lien. We got the drug dealers out when the police
could not.

HOAs have their place. When the HOA lives by its charter (keeping home
values high), and doesn't get lost in the minutiae of management, then
it's a good thing.
