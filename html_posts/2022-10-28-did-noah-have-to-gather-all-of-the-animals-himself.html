That section in the Bible really isn't all that long, it's fairly easy
to read, too.

Here, I'll quote it for you, and I'll even highlight the answer to your
question. You're welcome.

> Now the earth was corrupt in God's sight and was full of violence. God
> saw how corrupt the earth had become, for all the people on earth had
> corrupted their ways. So God said to Noah, "I am going to put an end
> to all people, for the earth is filled with violence because of them.
> I am surely going to destroy both them and the earth. So make yourself
> an ark of cypress wood; make rooms in it and coat it with pitch inside
> and out. This is how you are to build it: The ark is to be three
> hundred cubits long, fifty cubits wide and thirty cubits high. Make a
> roof for it, leaving below the roof an opening one cubit high all
> around. Put a door in the side of the ark and make lower, middle and
> upper decks. I am going to bring floodwaters on the earth to destroy
> all life under the heavens, every creature that has the breath of life
> in it. Everything on earth will perish. But I will establish my
> covenant with you, and you will enter the ark---you and your sons and
> your wife and your sons' wives with you. You are to bring into the ark
> two of all living creatures, male and female, to keep them alive with
> you. Two of every kind of bird, of every kind of animal and of every
> kind of creature that moves along the ground **will come to you** to
> be kept alive. You are to take every kind of food that is to be eaten
> and store it away as food for you and for them."
>
> Noah did everything just as God commanded him. --- Genesis 6:11--22
> NIV

Note that I highlighted where the Bible says that two of every kind of
animal "will come to you." So Noah just had to build the ark, and the
animals would come.
