Hello, thank you for the A2A.

First of all, people with pacemakers are not at increased risk of their
pacemaker malfunctioning after being hit with a Taser. Studies have been
completed which proved that the Taser does not adversely affect
pacemakers or ICDs.[\[1\]](#hWUTP){#cite-hWUTP
.citation_link}[\[2\]](#PesrW){#cite-PesrW .citation_link}

However, they probably have some underlying problem with their heart
(which is why they have a pacemaker in the first place). And Tasers
**can** affect your heart if you have an underlying heart condition.

There really isn't any practical clothing which can stop the barbs from
penetrating. They are very good at penetrating even thick layers of
clothing. Unless it's the middle of winter and you're in heavy coats and
many layers, the dart will probably penetrate.

Your best possible defense could be chain mail, but it's really heavy
and impractical to wear on a regular basis.
