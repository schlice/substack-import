I assume you're talking about "historians" from around the time Jesus
lived, right? And I also assume you're talking about others who weren't
included in the Bible hundreds of years later, because those writings
were pretty close. Regardless, I'll discuss both.

From the Bible, the earliest *undisputed* writing is the John Rylands
fragment, which was written between AD 117 and 138. There are also nine
*disputed* fragments that date from A.D. 50 to 70, found with the Dead
Sea Scrolls. Some scholars believe these fragments are parts of six New
Testament books including Mark, Acts, Romans, 1 Timothy, 2 Peter, and
James. While other scholars resist this conclusion (perhaps because its
admission would undermine their liberal leanings that the New Testament
was written later), they have not found any other non--New Testament
texts that these fragments could be.

*Outside* of the Bible, there are ten non-Christian authors who wrote of
Jesus within 150 years of His life:

- Flavius Josephus, a historian;
- Tacitus, the Roman historian;
- Pliny the Younger, a Roman politician;
- Phlegon, a freed slave who wrote histories;
- Thallus, a first-century historian;
- Seutonius, a Roman historian;
- Lucian, a Greek satirist;
- Celsus, a Roman philosopher;
- Mara Bar-Serapion, a private citizen who wrote to his son;
- the Jewish Talmud

Whether you doubt the truth of those particular authors, or whatever
your personal issues with them are, these authors collectively
acknowledged certain facts about Jesus. These non-Christian authors
admit facts about early Christianity that help us piece together a
storyline that is surprisingly congruent with the New Testament. These
are the facts which come out of those authors' stories:

1.  Jesus lived during time of Tiberius Caesar.
2.  He lived a virtuous life.
3.  He was a wonder-worker.
4.  He had a brother named James.
5.  He was acclaimed to be the Messiah.
6.  He was crucified under Pontius Pilate.
7.  He was crucified on the eve of the Jewish Passover.
8.  Darkness and an earthquake occurred when he died.
9.  His disciples believed he rose from the dead.
10. His disciples were willing to die for their belief.
11. Christianity spread rapidly as far as Rome.
12. His disciples denied the Roman gods and worshiped Jesus as God.
