**Should the Congress exercise its constitutional authority and have the
sergeant-at-arms place Trump Administration officials who defy subpoenas
under arrest?**

[[John

is spot on here. There is no "impeachment inquiry." There are no
subpoenas.

Any competent court would review these supposed "subpoenas" and laugh at
them. They were not issued as part of an "impeachment inquiry" as
authorized by the full House. They are nothing more than letters from
partisan politicians requesting voluntary cooperation. They do not
express the authority of the full House, which is required under the
Constitution.

On the flip side, some may say that the House has already elected the
Speaker, and she is thus endowed with the power to speak on behalf of
the entire body. As [[I have previously
shared](https://www.quora.com/q/war-elephant/Ignore-the-hype-this-is-not-an-impeachment-inquiry?ch=10&share=d7d5601b&srid=uClI)]{.qlink_container},
if Speaker Pelosi wants to ipse dixit her way to articles of
impeachment, no one can stop her unless she is legally challenged.

It is, however, the realm of the courts to protect those ensnared in the
web of a kangaroo tribunal. The only time the courts will become
involved is when the Congress attempts to exercise its presumed
authority against someone and denies them of one of their rights.

So I say: let Congress exercise what it believes to be its authority.
When that person immediately sues and forces them to prove the
legitimacy of their actions in court, and when they are proven wrong and
brought up on charges of false arrest and kidnapping, it will turn into
one helluva shitshow.
