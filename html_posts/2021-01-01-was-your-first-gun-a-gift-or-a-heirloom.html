**Was your first gun a gift or a heirloom?**

If we presume that a "gift" is a gift of a new or previously unowned
gun, and an "heirloom" is a gun which was previously owned by someone
and then *gifted* to someone else, my first two guns were heirlooms.

My dad was a police officer in New York. After he retired, he gave me
two of his firearms: a Sig Sauer P228 DAO (it was New York's first foray
into semi autos, and they wanted it to be as "revolver-like" as
possible), and the gun it replaced, the Smith & Wesson Model 66,
standard barrel (4.25â€³).

After I started buying my own guns, I gave the two "heirloom" guns to my
brother. Within one week, the Sig was stolen from the house he was
renting. The Smith was in the range box in the basement; the Sig was in
a nightstand. We still have the Smith in my family.
