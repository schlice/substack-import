**Content:** [The cheapest way is to use Verizon, who still exclusively
subsidizes phones for customers. I believe AT&T will subsidize your
phone if you want the contract. I\'m pretty sure that T-Mobile doesn\'t
have subsidies anymore. But the cheapest way to get the phone is to get
it subsidized by the carrier and to sign a 2-year agreement.\
\
Using programs like AT&T Next or T-Mobile JUMP doesn\'t get you a
cheaper phone. It actually costs you more, more than double, for the
actual phone.\
\
For example, (totally made up numbers, btw) let\'s say you can get a
6plus from AT&T for \$199 on contract. You pay a total of \$199 for the
phone, and you have to keep it for two years. You could also get it for
\"\$0 down\" and \$20 per month, no contract. Your monthly \"line access
charge\" will be much lower to account for the monthly phone charge, but
over 2 years, you actually pay \$480 for the phone, because there is no
carrier subsidy because you are not locked into a contract. If you
cancel, you have to return the phone, which the carrier sells to get
refurbished and reused. It\'s a win-win for the carrier. No more paying
out subsidies, no more contracts which people hate (when most people
stay anyway), and they get all the devices back to
resell.]{.rendered_qtext}
