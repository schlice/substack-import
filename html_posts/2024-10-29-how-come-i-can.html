There are three levels of belief about Trump in the current Republican
party, ranked from those who love Trump to those who don't:

- **MAGA Republicans:** These people ***love*** Trump. These are the men
  who wear "'Mericuns fer Trump" and the women who wear "He can grab
  this pussy any time" shirts. Their houses are decorated outside with a
  garden of Trump flags, American flags, and weird amalgamations of the
  two. The insides of their homes are decorated with every single bit of
  swag that some enterprising entrepreneur has ever come up with to
  market Trump, from candy bars to collectible dinner plates. Some of
  them (since the attempted assassination) have ascribed some sort of
  *divine mandate* to his candidacy. They will **never** not vote for
  him. If he would have, as he described in his first presidential bid,
  shot someone in broad daylight in the middle of 5th Avenue, these
  would be the people who would still vote for him. This is a
  ***small*** ***fringe*** of the Republican party.
- **Bog-standard Republicans:** This is the "considered middle." These
  are the people who know that Trump is a flawed man. They know that he
  is a sinner, just as we all are. But they vote for **policy, not
  people**. And they know that Trump's policies are going to be better
  for the majority of their citizen brethren than Harris' policies every
  day of the week and twice on Sunday. They are looking forward to
  easing grocery store prices and easing gas prices. They're looking
  forward to an improving economy and more money in their pockets. They
  will overlook Trump's personal foibles because he's human, and he's
  flawed, but his policies are good. This is the ***vast majority*** of
  the Republican party.
- **Never Trumpers:** These are the people who know that the Republicans
  have answers that will be better for everyone, but they simply cannot
  bring themselves to put a vote in the R column while Trump is on the
  ticket. They believe the GOP has sold us out by nominating someone
  like him. They know all people are flawed, but they cannot, in good
  conscience, vote for any ticket that he is on. These are the people
  who are willing to ***throw their vote away*** instead of voting for
  Trump. They certainly won't vote for Harris, but they won't vote for
  Trump either. They will either stay home, or they will vote
  third-party. This too is a ***small fringe*** of the Republican party.

So to answer your question, you can't find any MAGAs who say they will
stop supporting Trump if he revealed he is a pedophile because they are
MAGAs; they will never not support Trump. If you're looking for MAGA
Republicans to not vote for Trump because he did
\<insert_bad_thing_here\>, good luck. They will **never** not vote for
him, because in their eyes, he can do no wrong.

Honestly, you probably are just trolling, looking for some MAGA person
to respond to you so you can poo poo all over their values, but these
people are mostly silent. Oddly, it's questions like yours which cause
them to stay silent. They also don't respond to polls for the same
reason, so poll numbers you see before the election woefully
underrepresent Trump's support. Again, it's questions like yours which
cause MAGAs to stay silent.

**Original question:** How come I can't find any MAGA who says they will
stop supporting Trump if he revealed he was a pedophile?
