**Can you get military disability for a partial lung removal due to
cancer?**

The Veteran's Administration would have to determine that the cancer was
caused by your military service. In order to be something which the VA
will treat, there is a component of "service connection" that must be
determined.

If the cancer is considered a "service-connected disability," the VA
will rate it. Service connection for a disability may be established in
the following ways:

- DIRECT: Service medical records show that the disabling condition was
  diagnosed during military service and the condition has continued to
  affect the veteran.
- AGGRAVATION: Evidence demonstrates that the disabling condition which
  existed prior to service was aggravated beyond normal progression
  during military service.
- PRESUMPTIVE: Evidence demonstrates that the disability is one
  predetermined by the VA to be presumed for service connection by time,
  place and type of service.
- SECONDARY: Evidence demonstrates that the disability developed as a
  result of, or residual of, another service connected disability.
- INJURY AS A RESULT OF VA MEDICAL TREATMENT: This is a disability that
  the veteran incurred, had aggravated or died from because of medical
  treatment at a VA Facility.

The easiest way to get started in pursuing a claim for disability is to
visit your local Veterans Service Office (VSO). These organizations are
funded by your state and exist solely to help veterans navigate the VA
system. They can assist veterans with many facets of veterans benefits.
