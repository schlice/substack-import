I like this one. It's the *Scopes trial* conceit: the sun was created on
the fourth day, how can there be any light if there was no sun?

Recall what we are talking about. This is documented in Genesis 1.
Genesis 1:3-5 declares, \"And God said, \'Let there be light,\' and
there was light. God saw that the light was good, and He separated the
light from the darkness. God called the light \'day,\' and the darkness
He called \'night.\' And there was evening, and there was morning ---
the first day.\" A few verses later we are informed, \"And God said,
\'Let there be lights in the expanse of the sky to separate the day from
the night, and let them serve as signs to mark seasons and days and
years, and let them be lights in the expanse of the sky to give light on
the earth.\' And it was so. God made two great lights --- the greater
light to govern the day and the lesser light to govern the night. He
also made the stars. God set them in the expanse of the sky to give
light on the earth, to govern the day and the night, and to separate
light from darkness. And God saw that it was good. And there was
evening, and there was morning --- the fourth day\" (Genesis 1:14-19).

How can that be? How can there be light on the first day if the sun
wasn't created until the fourth day?

**This is only problematic if you discount the presence of an omnipotent
God.** ***GOD IS LIGHT!*** God's very presence provided the light for
the first three days.

The Bible reinforces this in several areas.

> \"This is the message we have heard from him and declare to you: God
> is light; in Him there is no darkness at all.\" --- 1 John 1:5 ESV
>
> "There will be no more night. They will not need the light of a lamp
> or the light of the sun, for the Lord God will give them light. And
> they will reign for ever and ever" --- Revelation 22:5 ESV

Jesus even echoed this same message:

> "I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will never walk in
> darkness, but will have the light of life" --- John 8:12 ESV.

Jesus is the Light of the World who provides light to those who believe
in Him. Those who do not will be thrown out to the "outer darkness"
where there will be great "weeping and gnashing of teeth" (Matthew
8:12).
