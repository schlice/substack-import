Tysabri has always been a great "second-line" MS drug, meaning you
should only take it after you have tried other MS therapies and they
have not been successful. It's a great drug: its efficacy is unmatched
in the realm of MS drugs, which makes it an obvious choice if you can
tolerate it. But Tysabri has always had one really negative thing that
caused it to get relegated to second string status: the risk of
[[progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy
(PML)](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=9f0d6d&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_multifocal_leukoencephalopathy){.external_link

However, research by the National Institute of Health may cause
neurologists to re-think that choice. NIH recommends that Tysabri be
considered for "first-line" use for some patients:

- Patients who are "JCV negative" (who test negative for [[the JC
  Virus](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=4ede7e&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_polyomavirus_2){.external_link
  rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
  onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
  qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}, which causes PML)
- Patients who are "JCV low-positive" who have not taken any previous
  immunosuppressant, and
- Patients who are "JCV high-positive" who have an aggressive disease
  course, so long as its use is limited to 12--24
  months.[\[1\]](#RfneB){#cite-RfneB .citation_link}

The risk of PML is greatest in patients who are both JC positive and who
have previously been treated by an immunosuppressant. The risk of PML is
lowest in patients who are JC negative.

So depending where you are on the immunosuppressant scale and where you
are on the JCV scale, Tysabri may be a good option. It's a good time to
ask your neurologist.
