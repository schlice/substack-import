Circumcision began as a religious practice, and still continues today as
such. But it is performed by non-religious people as a matter of health
and for social reasons.

Circumcision was practiced among Egyptians and Jews historically, with
the earliest records of the practice from Egyptian temple paintings and
wall drawings from 2300 BC.

These days, it is practiced non-religiously for both health and social
reasons.

On the health front, it was discovered around 2007 that circumcision
greatly reduces a man's risk of acquiring HIV. From UNAIDS:

> "With the recent findings that male circumcision significantly reduces
> a man's risk of acquiring HIV the practice is receiving renewed
> interest as the world looks to understand what this will mean for HIV
> prevention," said UNAIDS Chief Scientific Adviser, Dr Catherine
> Hankins.[\[1\]](#dVssv){#cite-dVssv .citation_link}
