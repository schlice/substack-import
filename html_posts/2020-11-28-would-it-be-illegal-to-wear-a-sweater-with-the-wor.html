It doesn\'t just have to be a sweater. You can wear an entire sheriff\'s
uniform, badge and all, and a full duty belt replete with everything you
are legally allowed to carry, if you wanted to. That\'s all perfectly
legal, it\'s protected first amendment expression.

What you ***cannot*** do is attempt to do the job of a sheriff\'s
deputy. The moment that you begin to exercise the authority of a
sheriff\'s deputy is when you commit the crime of impersonating a police
officer.

You also can\'t use the uniform to try and get a 10% discount at
Starbucks. That\'s called theft of service, and it is also highly
illegal. Using the uniform to gain any special privilege that you
wouldn\'t normally have could be considered theft of service, or
impersonating a police officer.

I might add that a very small number of jurisdictions have laws
regarding whether or not non-deputies can wear a deputy\'s uniform, but
these laws just exist because they haven\'t been struck down yet. Those
laws are largely unenforceable.
