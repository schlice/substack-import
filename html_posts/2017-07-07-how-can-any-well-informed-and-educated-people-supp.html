I am, by all objective measures, exceedingly smart. I could review my CV
with you, but besides being pedantic, it seems a bit too
self-aggrandizing and too much of a "you're not smart enough to call
yourself smart" debate that I refuse to engage in. Let's just say that
I've got the chops to be considered "smart." I'll let you take the time
to review my profile if you'd like to verify that.

In this last election, we had a choice between two terrible candidates.
There are other Republican candidates who would have arguably been
better choices. There are also other Democrat candidates who would have
arguably been better choices. But by hook or by crook, these two ended
up being our candidates.

Quora user
[[CEO1](https://www.quora.com/profile/CEO1)]{.qlink_container} said why
we voted for Trump far more succinctly and eloquently than I can, and I
want to give him credit for his excellent answer (**emphasis** mine):

So why do intellectually intuitive people support Trump? Because despite
his flaws (and which one of us isn't flawed in some way), we hope above
hope that this is "the one" who will restore some level of sanity to
American politics. It's likely going to be messy while we go through it,
but we can't dance around it; we must plunge headlong *through* it.
Churchill said, "When you're going through hell, keep going." We must go
*through* the tough time to emerge on the other side. There's no
side-stepping the inevitable conflict. We must simply deal with it.

What gets me is that liberals can't see it.

The cognitive dissonance that must exist when they run around with
bumper stickers and t-shirts reading things like "well-behaved women
seldom make history\" (a quote by Laura Thatcher Ulrich), while they
simultaneously marvel at the fact that a disruptive force in Washington
is, well, *actually disruptive*, must be surprisingly disturbing. I
question how they live with such conflict.

Nevertheless, Trump was fairly elected. There is no evidence that anyone
tampered with votes. There is no evidence of any Russian collusion to
tamper with the results. There is no evidence of any Russian-induced
voter suppression. So now that Trump is the president, we stand behind
him because, despite all your "not my president" drivel, he *is* your
President. He is *all* our president. I'm no Obama fan, but he was my
president and I supported him in his job, even though I disagreed with
many of his positions.

So we support our president and we do what we can to see him succeed,
because we believe in America. If we want the democratic process to
work, *we have to make it work*. If you don't like the guy we have, then
when he's up for re-election, elect someone else. That's the way it has
worked for hundreds of years. It will probably continue to work that way
for some time.
