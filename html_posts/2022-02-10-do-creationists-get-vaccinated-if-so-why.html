I think this is a really great question. It illuminates one of the major
misconceptions about Creationists vs Evolutionists: that Creationists
are "anti-science." The media perpetuates this myth, through tropes like
the ones immortalized in the book/movie *Inherit the Wind* which
fictionalized the 1925 Scopes "monkey trial." The trope goes like this:
here come those crazy Fundamentalist types imposing their religious
dogma and ignoring objective science.

Let's be clear about this: Creationists are not anti-science. This
debate is often couched as a *religion vs science* or *Bible vs science*
debate, when it is nothing of the sort. It is actually a *good science
versus bad science* debate. And Creationists certainly do not corner the
market on bad science.

Here's just one example of Evolutionist bad science: Science is a search
for causes. Logically, there can only be two types of causes:
intelligent or non-intelligent. When we look at the question of the
First Life, Evolutionists rule out the idea of an intelligent cause
before they even look at the evidence. Their conclusions are pre-loaded
into their assumptions. Spontaneous generation of life by natural
processes *must* be the cause of life because they don't consider any
other options. *This isn't an example of good science.*

Creationists do believe in **good science**.

Since we know that Creationists do believe in good science, there is no
reason to believe that Creationists would not get vaccinated. There is
nothing in the Creationist worldview which would argue against
vaccination. Believing that God controls all doesn't mean that we
shouldn't use our brains (also given to us by God) to impart a little
bit of protection to ourselves. That's simply being smart. Believing
that God has already pre-ordained an outcome doesn't mean that we
shouldn't take precautions. That's just fatalism, not good science.

Some people I know who refused the vaccine simply **don't believe that
the implementation of this vaccine qualifies as** ***good science*.**
They were worried about the lack of sufficient product testing as was
done with other vaccines in the past. They worried about the rushed
implementation. They worried about the unknown long-term effects of the
delivery method. But they don't avoid vaccination *because* they don't
believe in science. They simply said that they would risk it, and if
they contracted COVID, it would be God's will whether or not they lived.
And I know at least one person in my circle of acquaintances who *did*
die in exactly this way. But she died with her eyes wide open, making
her own choices in her own life.

I can tell you from personal experience that I (a Creationist) was fully
vaccinated. And I still got COVID anyway. I simply believe that this was
all part of God's plan for me. I don't blame the vaccines. I don't think
that the vaccines are fake. I don't think that it's some sort of massive
government conspiracy. I just believe that it was all part of the plan.
God has a plan for me, and it included contracting COVID at Christmas. I
don't know the details of his plan; God doesn't often reveal the
details. But I know he has a plan, because he has never failed to keep
any of his promises, and he promises us that he has a plan for us, a
plan of fullness, not of harm, to give us a future and a hope (Jeremiah
29:11).
