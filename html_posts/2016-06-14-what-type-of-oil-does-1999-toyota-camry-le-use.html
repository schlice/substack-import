Same type of oil that every other car uses: Automotive engine oil.

Could you potentially be asking what the ***best*** grade of oil would
be to use in the engine? Generally, the owner's manual will tell you
which oil the engine should use. With few exceptions, that's the oil you
should use.

I don't have a manual for a 1999 Toyota Camry, so I'm unsure which oil
is specifically recommended. You should check the manual, but I can
almost guarantee you it will say **5W-30** as the oil to use.

There may be an exception to this. Basically, if you live in a climate
that gets cold over the winter, you should be looking at **5W-30** oil.
If you live in a warmer climate, you might be looking at **10W-30** oil,
but you really would only be looking to use one of those two types of
engine oil.
