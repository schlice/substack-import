MS does not make you more likely to get other diseases.

Medications you may take for MS may make you more susceptible to disease
in general, depending on the medicine.

Some MS medications have not been subjected to long-term testing, so
their lasting effects are not known.

But MS, on its own, does not make you more likely to get any other
diseases.
