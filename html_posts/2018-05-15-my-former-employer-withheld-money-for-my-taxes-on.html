**What happens if my ex-employer never pays the IRS my withholding? Will
I still get my refund?**

The answer, of course, is "it depends," and it all depends on whether or
not you have a W-2 which shows that the employer withheld the amount
from your paycheck.

*If you have a W-2 which shows that your employer withheld Federal
income taxes from your paycheck*, then you're fine. You submit what your
employer gave you (because it's the same thing the employer gives the
IRS), it is used to compute your actual tax due, and if you have
overpaid (based on what your employer claims they withheld), you get a
refund, period. If the employer then fails to pay the withholding to the
IRS, that's between the IRS and the employer, **not you**.

*If you have a W-2 which shows that* ***no taxes were withheld***, then
the responsibility is on you to pay those taxes on your income. This
sucks royally, and if an employer did that to me, I'd be out the door in
a hot second. That's a lotta tax that I'd owe. I'd have to set up a
payment plan with the IRS in order to repay the tax I owed. No fun at
all.
