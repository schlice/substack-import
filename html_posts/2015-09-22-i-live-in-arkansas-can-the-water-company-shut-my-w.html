**Content:** [Unless they say they sent you certified mail, it\'s
certainly possible that letters they sent you never reached you.\
\
Did you pay your bill on time, every month? If you have records that
show your water bills that you paid every month and the checks you wrote
and the cancelled checks that came back to you, you can go to the water
company and fight the shutoff, and make them credit you for the time
they had your water shut off. But you have to show that you paid your
bill, and that they accepted your check. You can work with your bank to
confirm that the checks you mailed to the water company were cashed.\
\
If you don\'t have any records that show you paid your water bill on
time, every month, it\'s their word against yours. You can claim you
never received a notice that you haven\'t paid your bill. They can claim
they never received a payment. Who wins in that case? The one providing
the service for a fee. You don\'t pay, you don\'t get
service.]{.rendered_qtext}
