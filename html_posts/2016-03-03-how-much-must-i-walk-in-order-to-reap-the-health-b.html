First of all, anything is better than nothing.

But if you can walk, 10,000 steps a day is a good goal to shoot for.
Using a simple pedometer that tracks steps taken (there are many
available for very little money), you can easily achieve this goal. For
most people, it\'s about 5 miles of walking.

Yes, but does it help?

Remember, always talk to your doctor before you start any exercise
routine, but yes, something as simple as walking can be very beneficial
for you.
