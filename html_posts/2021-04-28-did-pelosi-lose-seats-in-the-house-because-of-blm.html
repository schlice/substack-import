No, "Pelosi" didn't lose seats.

Democrats are losing seats in the House because their states are
shrinking in population as people move out of those states into others.
Democrats are losing those seats because those states declining in
population are traditionally blue states. People are fleeing high tax,
heavy regulation states and fleeing towards lower tax, lighter
regulation states. In other words, they are voting with their feet.

The number of House Representatives is partly based on the population of
the state, determined every 10 years in the census, as required by the
Constitution. The number of representatives goes up or down depending on
the population change.
