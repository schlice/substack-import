**Content:** [I hesitate to answer, because I don\'t find the question
truthful.\
\
Two options:\
\
1. If your account of the story is 100% accurate, and you\'re not
obfuscating anything at all, I suggest you contact DPD directly and file
a complaint against the officer, or sue him for assault.\
\
2. Post your video to YouTube, append the link to your question\'s
comments, and let us comment on the actual video. Otherwise, the
\"facts\" you\'ve presented don\'t really engender a lot of belief in
the veracity of your claims.]{.rendered_qtext}
