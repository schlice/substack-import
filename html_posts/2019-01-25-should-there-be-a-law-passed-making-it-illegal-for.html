**Should there be a law passed making it illegal for expecting mothers
to drink alcohol to as avoid damage to the fetus?**

I know it seems like a common sense thing to you, but the law doesn't
agree.

Think about this: you want to make it illegal for an expectant mother to
do things which might *damage* the fetus, but it's still perfectly legal
for the mother to ***kill*** the fetus?

Doesn't make much sense, now does it...
