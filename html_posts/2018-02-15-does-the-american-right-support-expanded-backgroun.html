**Does the American right support expanded background checks for guns?**

In general, no. It's completely unnecessary and won't tell us anything
new.

Maybe if you explain what you're thinking, like in terms of what
"expanded background checks" means, and what bad guys it will catch that
we don't catch now, maybe we can better answer your question.

But "expanded background checks" seems like a lot of work for very
little, if any, additional benefit.
