*We cannot demand that others change to accommodate what we want, even
if we believe that what we want is in their interest. We can only change
ourselves.*

There are entire recovery programs built upon this fundamental truth.
12-step programs teach this to family and friends of addicts. "Didn't
cause it, can't control it, can't cure it." If people could somehow
learn this early in life, I think people in general would live happier,
more stress-free lives.

In recovery, we used to use the hula-hoop example. Drop a hula hoop at
your feet, and stand inside the circle. Everything you have control over
is inside the circle. You have control over nothing outside the circle.

Once you accept that you can't change anyone but yourself, you begin to
learn to accept others for who they are.
