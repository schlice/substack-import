The Constitution is interpreted dispassionately. Or, at least, it is
supposed to be.

The *effect* of laws is something that *lawmakers* take into
consideration. The *Constitutionality* of laws is the only thing
addressed by SCOTUS.

So to answer the big question:

> Would SCOTUS overturn a gun law that actually prevented deaths without
> disproportionately inconveniencing lawful gun owners?

The answer is **yes, if the law was unconstitutional.**

*How* that elimination of that law played out is irrelevant to the
decision. In other words, "preventing deaths" is not a valid reason to
leave an unconstitutional law in place, just as "retaining a woman's
access to legal abortions" is not a valid reason to leave an
unconstitutional decision like *Roe* in place.

If lawmakers want to continue to prevent deaths or retain access to
legal abortion, they can write a new law which does not violate the
Constitution.
