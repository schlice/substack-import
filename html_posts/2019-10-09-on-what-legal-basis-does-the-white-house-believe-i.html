**On what legal basis does the White House believe it can ignore
congressional subpoenas? What recourse does Congress have?**

Since I'm assuming you are talking about the "impeachment inquiry"
regarding President Trump, I'll answer by quoting a post from Andrew C.
McCarthy, former Assistant United States Attorney for the Southern
District of New York who is most notable for leading the 1995 terrorism
prosecution against Sheikh Omar Abdel-Rahman and eleven others.

McCarthy is a contributing writer at

it is 100% worth it if you truly want to understand why the White House
can ignore these "subpoenas" (and also why I'm putting all this stuff in
quotes. Also, **emphasis** mine):

> There is no impeachment inquiry. There are no subpoenas.

> You are not to be faulted if you think a formal inquest is under way

> completely understandable if you have been taking in media coverage
> --- in particular, reporting on a haughty Sept. 27 letter from House
> Democrats, presuming to direct Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, on pain
> of citation for obstruction, to cooperate in their demands to depose
> State Department officials and review various records.
>
> The letter is signed by not one but three committee chairmen. Remember
> your elementary math, though: Zero is still zero even when multiplied
> by three.
>
> What is portrayed as an "impeachment inquiry" is actually just a

> is not conducting a formal impeachment inquiry. To the contrary,
> congressional Democrats are conducting the 2020 political campaign.
>
> The House has not voted as a body to authorize an impeachment inquiry.
> What we have are partisan theatrics, proceeding under the ipse dixit
> of Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.). It raises the profile, but not the
> legitimacy, of the same "impeachment inquiry" House Judiciary
> Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) previously tried to
> abracadabra into being without a committee vote.

> Moreover, there are no subpoenas. As Secretary Pompeo observed in his

> was merely a letter. Its huffing and puffing notwithstanding, the
> letter is nothing more than an informal request for voluntary
> cooperation. Legally, it has no compulsive power. If anything, it is

> The Democrats, of course, hope you don't notice that the House is not

> Judiciary, Foreign Affairs, Oversight and Reform, Financial Services,
> and Ways and Means --- whose normal oversight functions are being
> gussied up to look like serious impeachment business.
>
> But standing committees do have subpoena power, so why not use it?
> Well, because subpoenas get litigated in court when the people or

> They certainly do not want to defend their letter. The Democrats'

> Pompeo to comply "shall constitute evidence of obstruction of the
> House's impeachment inquiry." What a crock.
