I know a lot of people believe that Satan lives in hell, and that he is
actually ruler of hell, lording over the tormented souls burning forever
in the lake of fire.

But while that may be the picture painted by Dante's *Inferno*, it is
not the reality relayed by the Bible.

In fact, when Satan was cast out of heaven, he was cast down to the
earth, not into hell. Jesus talked about Satan being the "ruler of this
world" (John 14:30). He spends part of his time actively roaming the
earth, seeking to tempt and destroy people.

Satan was cast out of heaven long before the incident in the Garden. But
interestingly, he still retains access to heaven. In fact, there are
several passages in the Bible which talk about Satan's activity
post-casting-out in heaven. Job 1 and 2 show Satan agitating against
God. And in Revelation, just before he is to be cast down to hell, he
will be found in heaven, where he "accuses them \[the brethren\] before
God day and night." Imagine that Satan is there presenting your sin to
God, and probably embellishing the story just a little bit to try to
make it seem worse than it is, in just the same way that he twisted
God's words in the Garden.
