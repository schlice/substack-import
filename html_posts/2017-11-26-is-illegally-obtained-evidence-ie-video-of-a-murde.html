**Is illegally obtained evidence (i.e. video of a murder) usable against
a serial killer? Will he/she be free if there\'s no other evidence?**

So, two questions here. Let's break them down:

**Is illegally obtained evidence (i.e. video of a murder) usable against
a serial killer?**

It depends on who obtains it, and whether or not they will testify as to
how they obtained it.

Clearly, if an agent of the government (i.e. a police officer) illegally
obtains evidence, that evidence is inadmissible. If a civilian illegally
obtains evidence at the behest of a government agent, it is still
inadmissible. But if a civilian illegally obtains evidence all on his
own, and without government direction, the evidence is (in most cases)
legal and admissible. Of course, this will usually require the person
obtaining the evidence getting up on the stand and testifying as to how
they came into possession of said evidence, which would clearly
implicate them in criminal behavior, opening up a Pandora's Box of
issues. But prosecutors have done this in the past, especially in
high-profile cases; a serial killer would definitely count.

**Will he/she be free if there\'s no other evidence?**

Not necessarily.

Circumstantial evidence can be so strong that even without illegally
obtained evidence, a person can be guilty *beyond a reasonable doubt.*
Remember that the standard to which the jury is held is the "reasonable
doubt" standard. If the prosecutor can make the case using the
circumstantial evidence, the defendant can still be found guilty.
