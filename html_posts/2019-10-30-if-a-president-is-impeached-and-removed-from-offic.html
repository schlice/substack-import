**If a president is impeached and removed from office, where would he
serve his sentence if the cause is a misdemeanor or felony?**

Impeachment is a political remedy, not a legal one. A president can be
impeached without ever breaking a Federal law.

If a president is impeached and removed from office because it is
*alleged* that he violated a Federal law, he still has to be *indicted*
by a Federal prosecutor, tried in Federal court, and convicted of an
actual crime.

Remember, you're still innocent until proven guilty in America.
