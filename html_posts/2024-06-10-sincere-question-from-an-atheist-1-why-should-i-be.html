We've already answered these questions a number of times. But who knows,
maybe once more for good measure.

> **why should I believe in a god who tortures you for eternity if you
> don\'t believe in him**

If such a god exists, I'd want to weigh the whole "torture for all
eternity" thing against believing in him, and I'd probably believe in
him so that I don't get tortured for all eternity.

But since you seem to be asking this question of Christians, I can tell
you that God doesn't "torture you for all of eternity for not believing
in Him."

Two things wrong with that:

1.  First, Hell isn't "eternal torture," but "eternal torment." Knowing
    that you are 100% separated from the love of God, and knowing that
    it was your own choices that put you in that position, would indeed
    be pretty much torment.
2.  There is a "lake of fire," but it is saved for Lucifer, the demons,
    and anyone else who ***consciously knows about God and rejects
    Him***. In other words, you'd have to be a person who says, "I know
    God exists. I know what God wants from me. I know God created me.
    And I choose, actively, to separate myself from Him and do my own
    thing and violate His rules because IDGAF." Those are the people who
    are headed for the lake of fire.

The Bible talks about hell, but only in very general terms. Not a lot of
specifics, and certainly not something that the believer needs to worry
much about. There are a lot of references to the "eternal torment" of
hell, but not lots of specifics. The primary reason for this is that
*hell was not created for you.* Hell was created for Satan and the
demons. It is ***our individual sin*** which destines us for hell. We go
to hell because of what we do, and only what we do. We have all sinned,
each and every one of us. In our thoughts and in our words, in what we
have done, and what we have failed to do. Each of us has failed to meet
the mark, and have fallen short of God's glory. ***This*** is what makes
hell our ultimate destination, nothing more.

But having an accurate description of hell shouldn't be that big of a
deal. The point is that *if the only reason you want to love God is to
avoid hell, then you've got it all wrong anyway.*

You can comment if you didn't understand any of those points, and I'll
be happy to try to explain.
