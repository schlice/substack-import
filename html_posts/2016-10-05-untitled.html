Also, what partially happened with Brexit was the "likely voters" issue.
Pollsters tend to contact people who are "likely voters," people who
have voted consistently in past elections, and who are registered. In
the Brexit vote, you had a large number of people show up who haven't
voted for anything in a long time.

Does Trump inspire people who have been out of the political system for
decades to get out and vote? Does he motivate people who haven't voted
to do so? We simply don't have any data to show that, but if we base it
on nothing more than the enthusiasm generated by Trump supporters, there
may be something to that argument.
