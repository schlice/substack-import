The Bible doesn't prohibit smoking and drinking directly.

But it does warn that you must care for your body, and it also directs
Christians to avoid drunkenness, since it clouds judgement and is called
debauchery.

Care for your body:

> Or do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit
> within you, whom you have from God? You are not your own, for you were
> bought with a price. So glorify God in your body. --- 1 Cor 6:19--20
> ESV
>
> So, whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory
> of God. --- 1 Cor 10:31 ESV
>
> Do you not know that you are God\'s temple and that God\'s Spirit
> dwells in you? If anyone destroys God\'s temple, God will destroy him.
> For God\'s temple is holy, and you are that temple. --- 1 Cor 3:16--17

Drunkenness:

> Now the works of the flesh are evident: sexual immorality, impurity,
> sensuality, idolatry, sorcery, enmity, strife, jealousy, fits of
> anger, rivalries, dissensions, divisions, envy, drunkenness, orgies,
> and things like these. I warn you, as I warned you before, that those
> who do such things will not inherit the kingdom of God. --- Galatians
> 5:19--21 ESV
>
> And do not get drunk with wine, for that is debauchery, but be filled
> with the Spirit --- Ephesians 5:18

So you can be a good Christian even if you smoke and drink. But you must
take care of your body, and you must avoid drunkenness. So bear that in
mind!
