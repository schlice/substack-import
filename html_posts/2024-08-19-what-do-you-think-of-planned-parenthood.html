Well, it's certainly on brand.

If there was ever a more willing group of people, who would prevent the
problem of accidentally creating a baby while they were having sex with
anything with appropriately sized appendages or holes by *permanently
altering their bodies,* the DNC would be a full collection of them, all
in one place.

Personally, I think it's a terrible look, and smacks more of
self-selected eugenics than anything else. I'm sure they meant it as a
"put your money where your jiggly bits are" or a "walk the talk" sort of
thing, but the optics just seem so totally off to me.
