**Content:** [The sharp edges are called \"chines\" and are part of the
SR-71\'s design from the A-4 through A-6 models of the aircraft. The
main reason that this was added was to reduce the radar cross section
(RCS) of the aircraft. Besides the radar-absorbent material (RAM) which
is painted over the entire aircraft, early studies in stealth
technologies found that a shape with flattened, tapering sides would
reflect most radar energy away from the beam\'s origin location.\
\
They did find that the chines added additional lift, acting as
leading-edge extensions which also created turbulent (vs laminar)
airflow over the wings at high angles-of-attack (AOA), which helped to
prevent stalls. So besides creating a smaller RCS, it also helped the
plane fly better.\
\
Modern aircraft may use foreplanes called \"canards\" instead of
chines.]{.rendered_qtext}
