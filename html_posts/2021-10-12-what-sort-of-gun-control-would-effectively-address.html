I propose "criminal control" rather than "gun control." Criminals can
use any variety of tools to commit crimes, and guns have more uses than
just committing crimes. Guns make crime *easier*, guns do not make crime
*possible*.

[[Don
Woods](https://www.quora.com/profile/Don-Woods-11)]{.qlink_container} is
hinting at what we can do to impose better "criminal control" instead of
focusing on the tool the criminals use. We can begin with mandatory
charges for crimes committed with guns (i.e. charges which cannot be
plea bargained away). Criminals use guns to commit crime because they
know they'll never be charged with a gun crime. Prosecutors often use
the lesser gun charge as leverage to convince criminals to confess or
roll over on higher-level criminal bosses. In other words, they offer to
waive the gun charge in exchange for testimony against some upper level
crime boss. But what this does is make criminals completely fear-free
about using guns in their crime.

Making charges for gun crimes mandatory and not available for plea
bargain would be a great first step to getting criminals to stop using
guns. Even if the original charge is pled away, the gun charge would
remain, and this could be a very powerful disincentive to using guns to
commit crimes.

Secondly, while I am generally opposed to mandatory sentencing, I would
be open to it in this case. Removing the ability to plead down a
sentence for a gun crime would again increase the penalties for
committing crimes with guns, convincing criminals to not do so.
