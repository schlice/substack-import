I am happily married, and have been for approaching 30 years. I wasn't
blissfully happy every second of every day of my marriage; it ebbs and
flows, but it's always there.

That fact does not "switch off" biology. It does not "switch off"
temptation.

Biology is normal. Temptation is normal. For those of you who are
religious (and know of Jesus), even he was tempted; it's documented in
the Bible.

But while **temptation** is normal and expected, **acting on
temptation** is abnormal and is unexpected.

As a married man, you must recognize that biology will cause attractions
to happen naturally. **You must consciously resist those attractions**.
The attraction should be a *trigger* to you to be on your guard for
situations which may devolve into action which you may desire initially,
but is undesirable in the long term. And if you just happen to be in one
of those "ebbs" in the cycle of your marriage, and you hit one of these
attractions, it just makes it that much harder to resist.

We learned when we were toddlers that we don't get everything that we
want. We may want to eat ice cream and cookies for every meal of the
day, but we don't, because doing so (even though you may desire it
initially) is undesirable in the long term.

You may *want* to continue talking to that attractive woman who seems to
be into you, but the results of doing so will be undesirable in the long
term. It may seem exciting that "you still got it," and that another
woman besides your wife might actually consider you attractive and may
want to talk to you. Good for you, cowboy. You're not a stinking pile of
turd. Congratulations for that.

And that's exactly where that road of discovery should end. It requires
*conscious thought* and *deliberate action* to cut off that conversation
and move on. And take it from the fellas who have been doing this whole
marriage thing for a while now: if it hasn't happened yet, it will. And
if you think it's easy, you haven't experienced it yet. And if you
think, "Meh, I can keep talking to her, because ***I*** would never
actually physically do something," you're probably wrong. You'll think
you can keep walking that line until you wake up in a hotel room bed
with a massive hangover next to a woman who is not your wife, and at
that point it's too late. You can\'t un-ring that bell.

You thought you were a strong man before? Try denying your biology. Try
telling your mind and your body to go do something else when every nerve
in your...well...everywhere is screaming to stay and get closer. If you
can do that, **then** you can consider yourself a strong man. I don't
care how many cast iron plates you can lift off the ground; if you can
do this, that's when I consider you strong.

And don't forget: ***YOU MADE A VOW!*** (In modern-speak, that's a
really sincere promise, in front of other people who saw you make that
promise). Now tell me: *how much is your word worth?* And more
importantly, *how much should* ***others*** *value your word?* In other
words, if you can break your promises whenever you feel like it, how
much stock should anyone place in anything you promise to do? If you
don't care to keep your promises, how much should *anyone* value your
reputation?

(Don't misunderstand here: as I mentioned, this is not easy; people fail
all the time at this. Just look at how high the divorce rate is. This
doesn't mean that you can't come back from a divorce and be a good and
faithful husband. What it ***does*** mean is that it's much harder to
repair a broken reputation than it is to never break your reputation in
the first place.)

Remember the upshot of all of this: **temptation** is normal and
expected, **acting on temptation** is abnormal and is unexpected.
