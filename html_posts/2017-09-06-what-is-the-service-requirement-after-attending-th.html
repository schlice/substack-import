Not sure about USNA, but the USAF service requirements actually start
while you are a cadet at USAFA.

What we are discussing is called **Active Duty Service Commitment**
(ADSC). This indicates the amount of time you must repay to the Air
Force in order to repay the cost of your time at school. This also means
that you can attend your first two years at the Academy, collect all
your credits, and leave the Academy and finish your degree at any
university which will accept your transfer credits, and you will pay
nothing back to the military. You could also likely finish your degree
in only one more year, based on the courseload at the Academy.

After your first day of classes as a junior at USAFA, you begin to
accrue ADSC. I honestly can't remember the actual ADSC for cadets, but
if I remember correctly, it's one year of active duty if you leave as a
junior, three years AD as a senior, and then upon graduation, it's five
years active duty. Remember, if you haven't graduated yet, your ADSC
must be served as an enlisted Air Force member.

Some education benefits also incur ADSC. I completed my Master's degree
after graduating, and I incurred two years ADSC from that. The Air Force
paid the cost of my Master's program (I paid for books and labs), which
is what earned me some extra ADSC. Thankfully, that ADSC ran
*concurrently* with any other ADSC I already had. This means that I was
still repaying my USAFA ADSC when my education ADSC expired, so it was
like I had no commitment at all for my degree. An incentive to finish
the degree as soon as you can following graduation. I took a total of 6
months off of school after I graduated, and then I was right into my
Master's program.
