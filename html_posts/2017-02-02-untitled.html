*I don't consider that an infringement of free speech, but the
enforcement of separation of church and state.*

That's actually the embodiment of the entanglement between church and
state! The state is telling churches how and when they can exercise
their First Amendment rights, and they are using tax-exempt status to do
it!

What other rights in the Bill of Rights should we hold hostage to that
same status? "Hey churches, you can keep the right to be free from
unreasonable search and seizure, as long as you pay taxes!" "Hey
churches, you can be free from cruel and unusual punishment, as long as
you pay taxes!"

You do not purchase your First Amendment rights with tax-exempt status.
Without a compelling state interest, you cannot restrict any right
granted by the Constitution. There is no compelling state interest in
restricting the speech of the pulpit.

Yet this law has not been overturned yet. Why? Because the IRS refuses
to enforce it. Every year, several thousand pastors give sermons
***directly in violation of the Johnson Amendment.*** They preach about
political candidates, politics in general, and the government in
particular. There were over 1,800 pastors last year who did it. And yet,
the IRS hasn't removed tax-exempt status from any one. Why do you think
that is? Because they don't want the Johnson Amendment to actually go to
court. Because they know that if it does, it will be found to be an
unconstitutional restriction of free speech, and then it will be gone.

They'd like to keep it on the books, unconstitutional or otherwise,
because sadly many pastors simply abrogate their rights and refuse to
stand up for them, and muzzle and censor themselves, to avoid any
entanglement with the law. The government is quite happy with this
arrangement, despite the pastors who openly violate the law, hoping for
a test case.

The amendment violates multiple tenets of the First Amendment, namely
the Free Speech Clause, the Establishment Clause, and the Free Exercise
Clause. The government knows this, and so the two thousand or so pastors
who blatantly violate the amendment will simply go unpunished. You can
only restrict the First Amendment if you can show that there is a
*compelling state interest* to do so. There is no compelling state
interest in restricting the free speech of a pastor. It also violates
the Free Exercise clause because a pastor is not free to exercise the
entirety of his religion, and violates the Establishment Clause because
it forces the government into determining when speech has crossed some
perceived threshold and becomes "too political." It violates the Free
Speech clause several times, requiring the government to restrict free
speech simply based on the content of that speech (the SCOTUS has ruled
against this kind of speech discrimination for decades), and also by
conditioning tax exemption on refraining from certain types of speech.
In other words, if a church wants their tax exemption, they can't speak
on any and all issues addressed by Scripture. This is an
unconstitutional restriction on free speech.

I'm glad you're not confused, because that simply means you're
under-informed. Please read through my comments, and perhaps you'll
start to see why this is not only unconstitutional, but it violates the
very principle of separation of church and state that we try so hard to
uphold.
