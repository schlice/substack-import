**How are the HOA rules and city ordinances that regulate the appearance
of peoples homes not violate the first amendment? Isn\'t how I choose to
keep my house as much an expression as what I choose to wear?**

You abrogate those rights of free expression when you sign a contract
agreeing to allow a third party to control those expressions.

When you buy a house in a covenant-controlled community, you sign a
contract. That marathon document-signing session you went through at the
title company included a covenant that you agreed to. You agreed to
allow the HOA to control the external appearance of your house. You also
agreed to follow any other rules that the HOA legally comes up with (and
by legally, I mean in accordance with the Bylaws of the Association,
which you also signed).

In addition, you agreed to allow the HOA to have an *ownership interest*
in your property. This means that if the HOA fines you and you don't
pay, the HOA can put a lien against your property for the unpaid amount.
If you still don't pay, they can foreclose on that lien, selling your
property out from under you to cover their unpaid expenses (plus
attorney's fees, of course).

You signed that contract. You agreed to all of this.

A Homeowner's Association, under state law, has broad authority to
regulate many things that are within its purview, including the outward
appearance of your property.

You agreed to that, in writing. There is no First Amendment violation
here, because you agreed to allow the HOA to control the external
appearance of your home.
