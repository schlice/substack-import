If that were the case, the enemy would put a red cross on every vehicle
they own, and you wouldn\'t be able to attack it!

Under the Law of Armed Combat, of a hospital, for example, is *also*
being used for other military uses (i.e. as a munitions depot,
communications center, or a command bunker), **it becomes a valid
military target.**

Actionable and reliable intel showing the facility being used for a
military purpose, *even if it is still being used as a hospital,* makes
it a valid military target. If DWB knew there were military operations
taking place in that facility, they should have packed up and left.

(EDIT) We don\'t know this was the case, and I\'m not simply trying to
defend the military by pointing out that any facility can be a military
target. But it does help to know the scope of this \"military target\"
exemption. For example, Hiroshima was a valid military target \-- there
was at least one factory and warehouse there. That made the city a valid
target for airstrikes.
