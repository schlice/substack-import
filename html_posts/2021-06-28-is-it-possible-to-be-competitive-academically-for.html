*(NOTE: My answer is specific to the Air Force Academy, but because
these programs are governed under Federal law, the answer will be
similar for any of the US service academies)*

Yes, it is possible to be *very* competitive academically with a 3.5 GPA
from a foreign high school and a 4.0 from a US online high school, and
good SAT scores.

The problem will likely be that you are not an American citizen, and you
must be an American citizen in order to be accepted at the Air Force
Academy. We do host foreign exchange cadets at USAFA, but International
students cannot apply directly to the Air Force Academy. They must apply
through their government, usually their ministry of defense. Only a
select number of countries can nominate students. The home country may
also require a commitment to serve in the home country's military.
Students should check with their home country's government for more
information on the country's eligibility to nominate and the country's
nomination procedures. Additionally, Federal law only allows us to have
60 foreign cadets at any one time, which means we only allow 15 cadets
per class year to attend USAFA, so the slots for international students
are extremely limited.

If you are a US citizen studying abroad with your parents, your entrance
requirements are the same as any stateside candidate. You already have
the high academic scores, but it will be the other things the Admissions
Board will be looking for, namely athletics and leadership potential.
