God doesn't require worship. He doesn't need our worship. We don't need
to worship Him. **We worship Him because He is worthy of worship.** We
worship Him because of what He has done for us.

Regarding church attendance, the Bible talks about worshipping together:

> *not giving up meeting together, as some are in the habit of doing,
> but encouraging one another---and all the more as you see the Day
> approaching. --- Hebrews 10:25 NIV*

In the early church, people were avoiding meeting together, and the
author of Hebrews says that's not a good idea. We need the encouragement
of other believers, especially as we approach the end times.

Our friends at
[[GotQuestions.org](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=e4ff7d&url=http://GotQuestions.org){.external_link

reasons why we need to regularly attend church. Their list is so
exhaustive and comprehensive that I figured I'd just reproduce it here:

> Church is the place where believers can love one another (1 John
> 4:12), encourage one another (Hebrews 3:13), "spur" one another to
> love and good works (Hebrews 10:24), serve one another (Galatians
> 5:13), instruct one another (Romans 15:14), honor one another (Romans
> 12:10), and be kind and compassionate to one another (Ephesians 4:32).

> When a person trusts Jesus Christ for salvation, he or she is made a
> member of the body of Christ (1 Corinthians 12:27). For a church body
> to function properly, all of its "body parts" need to be present and
> working (1 Corinthians 12:14--20). It's not enough to just attend a
> church; we should be involved in some type of ministry to others,
> using the spiritual gifts God has given us (Ephesians 4:11--13). A
> believer will never reach full spiritual maturity without having that
> outlet for his gifts, and we all need the assistance and encouragement
> of other believers (1 Corinthians
> 12:21--26).[\[1\]](#WWxDR){#cite-WWxDR .citation_link}
