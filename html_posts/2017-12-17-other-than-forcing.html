The whole point of the HOA is making sure that home values stay high.
Primarily, the HOA does this by making sure the changes you make to your
home do not negatively impact the value of your neighbor\'s home.

So while they are, in a sense, "forcing curb appeal," the goal is not to
force your compliance, it is to keep a uniform appearance to the
neighborhood, which increases home values overall.
