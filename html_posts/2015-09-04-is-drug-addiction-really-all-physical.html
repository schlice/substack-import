**Content:** [Thanks for the A2A.\

I highly suggest you watch [[Pleasure Unwoven: An Explanation of the
Brain Disease of
Addiction](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=e1f92a&url=http://www.amazon.com/Pleasure-Unwoven-Explanation-Disease-Addiction/dp/B003AC98V2/ref%3Dsr_1_1?s%3Dmovies-tv%26ie%3DUTF8%26qid%3D1441384723){.external_link

used to be a doctor when addiction took over his life. He then went on a
fact-finding journey learning the pathways in the brain which lead to
addiction.\
\
The physical addiction symptoms are actually resident in the brain. The
symptoms manifest in the body, but ultimately the problem is one of the
brain, not of the body.\
\
Yes, addiction is a physical disease. \"Disease\" means an improper
functioning of a body system, and addiction is an improper functioning
of the pleasure/response feedback loop system in the brain.\
\
The improper functioning of this system feeds the physical cravings.\
\
The video explains it very well. You\'ll also find snippets of the video
on YouTube, albeit not the full video.]{.rendered_qtext}
