<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: [And you are a coward for not backing up your tough talk<br>with your *name.* Coward.\<br>\<br>Anyway, yes, it\'s clear to anyone with two brain cells to rub together<br>that some police procedures can produce what we like to call *unintended<br>consequences.* And you are absolutely incorrect that giving heed to his<br>plea will produce no loss to the police. What you don\'t see are the<br>thousands of times that police do actually provide a little breathing<br>room and get hurt (or in some cases, killed) because a suspect actually<br>lied and they could breathe, but they made that little wheezing sound<br>with their throat, and an unsuspecting officer loosened his grip. WIth<br>fatal consequences. For the officer.\<br>\<br>But I guess that\'s okay with you, that an officer dies, and not a<br>suspect.\<br>\<br>However, like I already said, I\'m certain that this incident will<br>prompt a re-evaluation of the use of grappling holds on suspects, just<br>as cases of positional asphyxiation caused police to stop the practice<br>of hogtying unruly suspects. Now, we take them out of the car,<br>pepper-spray them until they calm down, and put them back in the car.<br>This process continues all the way to the jail as long as a suspect<br>continues to be unruly and a danger to himself. We can\'t restrain him<br>any more than we already have, because he could die of positional<br>asphyxia. So our only option is to take him out of the car and pepper<br>spray him until he stops being a danger to himself.\<br>\<br>Or should we just keep the TASER darts in him and buzz him all the way<br>to the jail? Because that\'s where this whole incident is headed: a<br>much-increased usage of non-lethal technologies like TASER and pepper<br>spray.\<br>\<br>I, for one, will be much quicker now to go to the TASER than to try to<br>restrain someone. Heck, if they could die from being restrained, I\'m<br>much more likely to use the TASER on him than to touch him before he is<br>completely compliant.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-likelihood-that-the-next-time-an-arrestee-says-I-cant-breathe-the-police-will-listen/answer/Bill-Stein<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
