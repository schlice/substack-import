**Content:** [And you are a coward for not backing up your tough talk
with your *name.* Coward.\
\
Anyway, yes, it\'s clear to anyone with two brain cells to rub together
that some police procedures can produce what we like to call *unintended
consequences.* And you are absolutely incorrect that giving heed to his
plea will produce no loss to the police. What you don\'t see are the
thousands of times that police do actually provide a little breathing
room and get hurt (or in some cases, killed) because a suspect actually
lied and they could breathe, but they made that little wheezing sound
with their throat, and an unsuspecting officer loosened his grip. WIth
fatal consequences. For the officer.\
\
But I guess that\'s okay with you, that an officer dies, and not a
suspect.\
\
However, like I already said, I\'m certain that this incident will
prompt a re-evaluation of the use of grappling holds on suspects, just
as cases of positional asphyxiation caused police to stop the practice
of hogtying unruly suspects. Now, we take them out of the car,
pepper-spray them until they calm down, and put them back in the car.
This process continues all the way to the jail as long as a suspect
continues to be unruly and a danger to himself. We can\'t restrain him
any more than we already have, because he could die of positional
asphyxia. So our only option is to take him out of the car and pepper
spray him until he stops being a danger to himself.\
\
Or should we just keep the TASER darts in him and buzz him all the way
to the jail? Because that\'s where this whole incident is headed: a
much-increased usage of non-lethal technologies like TASER and pepper
spray.\
\
I, for one, will be much quicker now to go to the TASER than to try to
restrain someone. Heck, if they could die from being restrained, I\'m
much more likely to use the TASER on him than to touch him before he is
completely compliant.]{.rendered_qtext}
