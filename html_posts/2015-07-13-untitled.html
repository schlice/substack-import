The tax helps to pay for the subsidies to the low-income people who
purchase healthcare through one of the state-sponsored exchanges. States
expand Medicaid, more people join Medicaid, Medicaid costs go up,
someone has to pay for those. Those who don\'t purchase health insurance
pay extra tax to help cover those expenses.
