**My daughter wants to file termination of parental rights due to the
father being a convicted criminal and drug addict. They live in
different states. If she gives me power of attorney can I stand in court
for her during the process?**

As with all legal questions, the answer is "it depends."

Depending on the state and depending on the case at hand, in most cases
an "attorney in fact" cannot represent you in court. Only an "attorney
at law" can represent you, if in your special circumstance you are not
physically required to appear in court. This is generally only
applicable in special circumstances and for administrative proceedings.

Under most circumstances, if you are required to be present in court,
you must be physically present. An attorney in fact (which is a power of
attorney holder) cannot represent you in court. Only a licensed attorney
can represent a client.
