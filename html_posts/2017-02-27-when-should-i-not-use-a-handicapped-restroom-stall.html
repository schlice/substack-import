Any time you can avoid it. This is not a hard-and-fast rule; anyone can
use that stall at any time. But the purpose is to afford the
wheelchair-bound a place to maneuver with handrails, so it is a
c*onvenience* for you, but it is a *necessity* for them. So there are no
"laws" against it (that I know of; states are weird though so your
mileage may vary), but it is a matter of *common courtesy* to leave the
stall open for the wheelchair-bound.

If all the other stalls are occupied and there are no persons in
wheelchairs waiting for a stall, you may use it.

Otherwise, try to use a standard-sized stall if you can.
