Ooo, an excellent question!

You're absolutely right, the clichÃ© "love the sinner, hate the sin" is
not a quote from the Bible. But it is sort of reflected in some other
verses. Jude 1:22--23 comes to mind:

> Be merciful to those who doubt; save others by snatching them from the
> fire; to others show mercy, mixed with fear---hating even the clothing
> stained by corrupted flesh. (NIV)

So here, we're told that mercy for the sinner and a healthy loathing of
sin and its consequences should be the defining characteristics of our
evangelism.

As part of what James 1:27 refers to as \"pure and faultless\" religion,
we are to feel compassion on those for whom Christ died and keep
ourselves \"from being polluted by the world.\" But we also understand
that we are flawed human beings, and that there is a huge gap between us
and God in terms of loving and hating. Even as Christians, we are not
capable of perfect love or perfect hatred (i.e., without ill will). But
because He is God, God is able to perform both of these things
flawlessly. Without any desire to sin, God can hate. Because of this, He
is able to despise both the sin and the sinner in a completely holy way,
while also forgiving the sinner in love at the point of repentance and
faith.

The Bible clearly teaches that God is love.

> Whoever does not love does not know God, because God is love. This is
> how God showed his love among us: He sent his one and only Son into
> the world that we might live through him.--- 1 John 4:8--9 NIV

While we can't comprehend it, it is nonetheless true that God can
perfectly love and hate a person at the same time. This means He can
love him as someone He created and can redeem, as well as hate him for
his unbelief and sinful lifestyle.

We, as imperfect human beings, cannot do this; thus, we must remind
ourselves to "love the sinner; hate the sin." But how do we do that? We
demonstrate our love for sinners by treating them with respect (1 Peter
2:17), praying for them (1 Timothy 2:1), and sharing the gospel with
them. We demonstrate our hatred for sin by identifying sin for what it
is, abstaining from it, and decrying it as incompatible with God\'s
character. Sin should not be tolerated or dismissed; it should be hated.

**It is a true act of love to treat someone with respect and kindness
even though you do not approve of his or her lifestyle or sinful
choices.**
