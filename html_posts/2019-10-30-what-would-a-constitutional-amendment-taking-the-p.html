**What would a constitutional amendment taking the power to regulate (or
ban) abortion from both the state and federal governments look like?**

Not only would it be a complete disaster, but it is completely
unnecessary.

The Constitution already has a way to deal with things that are not in
the Constitution. It's called the 10th Amendment.

It says (paraphrased) that if it's not a power explicitly granted to the
Federal Government, it is reserved for the states and the people.

The problem we have today is that an activist Supreme Court "invented" a
right which was not written in the Constitution: the right to privacy.
Nowhere in the Constitution can you find a right to privacy. Those words
do not exist.

But they did. They found it. In the "emanations" and "penumbras" of the
Constitution.

This "supposed right" should be unequivocally removed. *Roe*, which was
based on that decision, should be overturned.

The power to decide abortion law should be left with the states.
