MS is known as "The Great Imitator" because none of its symptoms are
unique to MS. Everything you experience with MS can be experienced as a
consequence of some other disease or condition.

*So how do you know if you have MS or some other disease with the same
symptoms?*

A diagnosis of MS is a "diagnosis of exclusion" wherein neurologists
will "exclude" everything else which can cause the symptoms you are
seeing. When they have excluded everything else, the only remaining
choice must be MS.

There are also symptoms which, in the aggregate, would appear in many
other diseases, but together only appear in MS. This includes the white
spots on the MRI, the positive spinal tap, the positive findings on a
neuro exam, etc.
