**Why do victims of PB (police brutality) sue police departments or the
city instead of the officers directly? It makes more sense to punish the
policemen instead of the PD or city?**

Short answer: they can't. While they are on the job, police officers are
protected by what's known as *qualified immunity.*

Qualified immunity is a doctrine that states that so long as the police
are not violating an established law, and they are acting under color of
law, they cannot be personally sued for actions that they take as part
of their job.

It extends to all government officials, and basically says they can't be
sued unless you can show that they violated \"clearly established
statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would
have known\".

It was instituted in 1967 to protect police officers from frivolous
lawsuits and to protect them from financial liability in situations in
which they acted in good faith when the situation was legally unclear.
Over the years, it has been expanded. Most notably, the "clearly
established law" test has been expanded to require that in order to be
"clearly established," there must be case law already on the books
regarding that issue.

Critics have claimed that this makes it far more difficult to recover
damages when police officers violate civil rights, because most suits
don't even qualify.
