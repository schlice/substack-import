**Content:** [I\'m assuming you\'re talking about a national border and

As long as the checkpoint is run by USCBP, they can place the actual
checkpoint wherever they like. You\'d assume that they place it
somewhere near the actual border, but it doesn\'t have to be directly at
the border, it can be several miles in-country. They can have multiple
checkpoints (at the border and further in-country), and all of this is
