Whoa, that's a lot of questions all in one question!

> **How does God know things that would but do not happen (when there is
> free will)?**

God operates on a different level of existence than we do, and it's a
level of existence that is really hard for our human brains to wrap
themselves around. God is transcendent, omnipotent, and eternal. That
means He exists outside of the universe (which means outside of matter,
space and time), He has unlimited power to effect change within our
universe, and He has no beginning and no end.

What we want to focus on to answer this question is God's
*transcendence*. Because He exists outside of the universe, He exists
outside of **time**. Time is a construct which only exists within this
universe, because time began with the Big Bang (see Einstein's Theory of
General Relativity).

The best way to describe how God sees us is that "everything is now" for
God. For Him, the past is now. The present is now. The future is now. He
sees everything, even though we (living in the universe as we do) only
see the present. The past is history, and the future is mystery. We can
see neither the past nor the future. We only see the now.

Additionally, God sees everything that we *will* choose. He has *always*
seen everything that we *will* choose, so everything He has designed was
designed with the results of our free choices already being understood,
even though we haven't made those choices yet.

See why this is so hard to wrap your head around? If I haven't made the
choice yet, how can God see it? What if I make a different choice when I
actually get there? These are all questions framed from a perspective
*within* time. God's perspective is so much greater. He's already seen
what we will choose. And He's already designed everything in accordance
with our choices which He can see even though we have not yet arrived at
the moment of choice on our timeline yet. We haven't even had the
opportunity to exercise our free will, but God has already seen the free
choice that we will eventually make.

> **How did he know ancient peoples he wiped out would be entirely evil
> a generation ahead? By developmentally simulating?**

Same reason: because He sees everything for all time as **now,** even
things which haven't come to pass yet for us.

> **Why does he torture me who would always stay good?**

You're going to have to re-phrase this question because I'm not sure
what you're asking here.
