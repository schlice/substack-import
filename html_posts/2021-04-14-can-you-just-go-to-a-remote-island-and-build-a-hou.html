**Can you just go to a remote island and build a house to live in the
rest of your life? What about taxes? What about owning the property? Can
a government just take your house you built without buying the land or
permits if they ever found you?**

There are a scant few areas on Earth which are not owned by any country,
and each one of those areas is functionally uninhabitable. For the most
part, all of the habitable land on Earth is owned by some country.

When that country owns that land, they have the right to allow you to
live there, or not.

You can definitely go buy a private island and live there, but you are
buying that island *from some entity*, usually some country. You will
have to pay ownership tax on that property.

So it sounds like you are asking if you can just go *squat* on an island
and claim squatter's rights. In essence, you can. You can't be summarily
thrown off the island in a single day, as property right claims are a
civil matter, so you won't be arrested unless you're trespassing on
someone else's property. But after a certain amount of time, you will be
discovered and you will be evicted.

Your best bet to do this legally is to buy a houseboat and go out to
international waters. You can literally live there for the rest of your
life, plus you can put in to shore to re-provision and then go right
back out to sea.
