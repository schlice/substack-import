**Content:** [Do you remember the movie *Mask*? There is a scene where
Rocky (who has Lionitis, or **craniodiaphyseal dysplasia**) teaches
Diana (the pretty blind girl) what colors look like.\
\
He hands her a cotton ball and says, \"this is white.\" He hands her a
hot rock and says, \"this is red.\"\
\
I have always imagined that this is how the blind \"see\" colors.\
\
If someone has been blind from birth, I do often wonder if they know
what colors look like.]{.rendered_qtext}
