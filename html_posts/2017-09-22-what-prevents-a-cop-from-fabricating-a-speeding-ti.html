> *What prevents a cop from fabricating a speeding ticket?*

You mean, are there mechanisms in place (besides department policy) that
prevent it?

The short answer is **nothing**. Nothing prevents a cop from fabricating
a speeding ticket.

But stop and think logically about it for a second, and ask yourself
this basic question:

**WHY?**

Why would a cop fabricate a speeding ticket? To what end? Do you *know*
the cop? Does he have a personal grudge against you? Besides a personal
vendetta against you, what reason would he have to do something like
that? I mean, if there was incentive to write you a false ticket, I
suppose he might, but these days, what incentive would be there? There
are no "ticket quotas," and even if there were, it would likely only be
for dedicated traffic cops or for cops on a dedicated traffic duty (like
motorcycle cops working a targeted intersection or targeted road), but
even those guys don't have "quotas." The cop could literally let you go
and within two minutes, find another speeder. Seriously, they are
everywhere. There's no need to risk their own career to do something so
silly as to falsify a ticket against you, when there are many speeders
out there to choose from.

Cops don't even *like* writing speeding tickets. Why then would they
waste the energy not only to pull you over, but then to *make up a
story* about pulling you over?

It simply makes no sense whatsoever.

FYI: my dashcam records not only the time and date, but it receives
actual GPS data and encodes it onto the video; this includes the speed.
So if I was really not speeding, I could use that data to assist in
fighting the ticket.
