The key is to prepare for this type of thing before someone is actually
in your house. Defense-in-depth is what you're going for. I've already
written a post on defending your home; if I find it, I'll link it.

But you spoke about a burglar in the house. What you will need is a
**safe room**. You've probably seen movies like *Panic Room* with Jodie
Foster; you probably don't need to go that crazy. Just find a closet
that has power and set it up as your safe room. At the least, make sure
it has a lock on it that you can lock from the inside. In there, you
should put a cell phone that works, and a charger for that phone. It
doesn't need to have a cellular plan active on it; you can call 911 from
any cell phone whether or not it has a contract on it, so long as it can
connect to the network. You can optionally have some form of personal
defense in there, be it a baseball bat or a gun, your choice.

If someone breaks into your home, go straight to your safe room and lock
the door. Call 911 from inside your safe room. Wait for the police to
arrive.

If you hear the burglars attempt to enter your safe room, yell to them:
"Do not come in here! I have a gun and I'm on the phone with the
police!" Yell this whether you have a gun or not. Chances are, the
burglar won't take the chance on entering the closet.
