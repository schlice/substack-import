**In the US, can a company legally fire someone for being an alleged
rapist?**

Short answer: Yes.

Most employment is what is called "at-will" employment. This means that
you're not a contract employee. You work as long as both you and the
employer agree that your continued work is still needed and wanted. You
can be terminated at any time, and you can quit at any time.

There are only a handful of things for which you cannot be legally
terminated, and these are protected by law. They're the same things for
which you are protected during hiring - age, sex, race, religion, and
national origin. You also can't be terminated because of a disability,
unless you can't perform the essential functions of the job with
reasonable accommodations.

Anything else can legally be grounds for termination. I could see that
if you were accused of rape, your company may question your integrity.
Your company's customers may not want to deal with you, making you less
effective at work.
