**Content:** [You have a basic contract. The contract doesn\'t ask
anyone to do anything illegal, so there is nothing illegal about the
contract.\
\
The reason you wrote the contract is irrelevant. Even if the assault is
no longer legally actionable, it doesn\'t change the nature of the
contract.\
\
You have a contract which states \"Person X is to pay person Y a certain
amount of money over the course of the following timeframe\...\"\
\
Since the contract was initiated in Taiwan, you will likely have to file
your suit there, but I\'m unsure on that point. You may be able to file
in South Africa since that\'s your current residence. I\'d check with
the courts there first, but this should be a pretty simple breach of
contract case. Did you have any provisions in the contract for what
would happen if he fails to pay, such as late fees? If not, you can
probably only get the money he owes you.]{.rendered_qtext}
