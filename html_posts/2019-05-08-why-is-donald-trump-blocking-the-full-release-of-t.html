**Why is Donald Trump blocking the full release of the Mueller Report
that allegedly exonerates him?**

Why *should* the President have to resort to Executive Privilege in
order to prevent Congress from forcing his Attorney General to violate
the law?

He shouldn't. He shouldn't have to.

But in this case, Congress doesn't care. They want to use their subpoena
power to run roughshod over the law. And they wouldn't wait for more
negotiations before holding the AG in contempt.

So the President did the only thing he could in order to ensure that the
law was followed: he asserted Executive Privilege over the full,
unredacted report.

Remember that Barr already released a redacted report, which he was
under no legal obligation to do, but because of the intense public
interest in the results of the Mueller investigation, he did. Remember
too that only 8% of the report was redacted for various reasons.

But that wasn't good enough for House Democrats.

Barr offered to show a "less-redacted" version to a closed session of
the House Judiciary Committee, only leaving redacted the parts required
by law to redact.

But that wasn't good enough for House Democrats, either. They *insisted*
on the full, unredacted report, *along with Mueller's investigation
notes, which are confidential for the Department of Justice.*

Yes, Congress has oversight authority. But **the branches of government
are co-equal.** Congress has no authority to *demand* anything of the
Attorney General, unless the law allows it.
