Inventing a weapon that fires something besides bullets and uses a
propulsion system besides black powder would definitely do it.

There are significant engineering challenges which need to be overcome,
and there are current physical limitations to our technology which
prevent such changes from taking place (because, you know, physics).

Refining the gun won't disrupt the industry.

Changing laws won't disrupt the industry.
