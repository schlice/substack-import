**Sam Harris claims Brett Kavanaugh lied and doesn\'t deserve to be on
the Supreme Court of the United States, do you agree or disagree? Why?**

Whether or not Brett Kavanaugh lied is a matter of fact to be decided in
a court of law, since we're talking about Federal charges. We do not
have the requisite information available to even think about what to do
next until we decide what to do *first*. If Congress believes that
Kavanaugh lied, then Congress will have to engage the FBI and open an
investigation into whether or not Federal charges of lying to Congress
can be pursued.

If Brett Kavanaugh **"knowingly and willingly made** **materially false
statements to Congress,"** meaning that the lies had to be knowingly
made (he knew the right answer and he said the opposite with the intent
to mislead), and the lies had to be **material**, that *the lies were of
such a significant nature that if he had answered truthfully then it
would have changed a yes vote to a no*, then I would absolutely question
whether or not he should be allowed to remain a judge at all.

But we're not even close to being at that point.

Anyone offering such an opinion is simply bloviating at this point. If
Congress has the political will to attempt to prosecute a "lying to
Congress" charge, then we'll talk.

Until then, it's all speculation.
