**Do you think kids can return to school in 2 months without the fear of
a shooting accident?**

Of course they can! There are *50 million students* in schools. The
number of students who died in school shootings in the 2017--2018 school
year was around 50 (that's September, 2017 through June, 2018). This
means any one individual student, even in an aberrant school year like
2017--2018, still has a **one in one million** chance of dying in a
school shooting, and that's the high risk. The risk in a normal
(non-aberrant) school year is even lower than that. I think those are
pretty safe odds.

And with school security becoming more of an issue in places where it is
not (and some high profile shootings detailing both what good and bad
security can do), schools will only become safer over the next few
school years as security is given a much more serious look in schools
that don't yet have it.

It is up to parents to review your childrens' school security plans, and
if you find it lacking, maybe you should either consider moving,
changing schools, or homeschooling until the district can get its act
together. Don't leave your children's safety in the hands of those who
do not believe it precious enough to protect it!
