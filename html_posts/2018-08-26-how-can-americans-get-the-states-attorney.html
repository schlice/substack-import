**How can Americans get the States Attorney\'s Office to enforce the
Title 18 Sections 241, 242, 245, and 249, against Law Enforcement
agencies?**

Why would the state attorney be reviewing violations of Federal law?
It's kinda not his department. The US Department of Justice would be
reviewing the case, which they already (usually) do. However, I think
you may be confusing *enforcement* with *findings you like*.

Nearly every time there is an Officer-Involved Shooting (OIS), the
Justice Department of the United States investigates the circumstances
to see if there are any violations of the victim's rights under Title 18
USC Sections 241, 242, 245, or 249. It happens all the time when there
is a police shooting, along with reviews of the incident by the District
Attorney, and the police department which employs the officer.

If you have standing (i.e. you are part of the estate of the victim),
and the Justice Department has not investigated, you can request that
they review the incident. You do have to have standing in order to make
that request, however.

Beyond this narrow scope, the Justice Department does not have
enforcement jurisdiction over state law, so you can't get the Federal
government to do something that they have not been authorized to do in
the Constitution.
