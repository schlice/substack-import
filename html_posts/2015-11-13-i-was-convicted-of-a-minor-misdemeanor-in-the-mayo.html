answer, if you have a bench warrant out on you, you can be arrested
anywhere in the country for that warrant. If you\'re not in the
jurisdiction where the warrant was issued, you will be detained until
the original warrant is pulled, and the original jurisdiction will
decide whether or not they want you held for extradition back to the
original jurisdiction. If they do want you held, the officer stopping
you will have absolutely no choice but to hold you. If not, the
complaining officer can let you go.\
\
The further away from the jurisdiction you get, the less chance you have
of being extradited. If you get stopped in the jurisdiction where the
warrant is active, you\'ll be arrested. If you get stopped in another
jurisdiction within the state, there\'s a good chance you\'ll be
transferred back to the warranting jurisdiction. If you\'re out of
state, you may or may not be held for extradition.\
\
That said, I\'m not telling you to leave the jurisdiction. Understand
that if you\'re far away from the original jurisdiction, and you know
you have a warrant out for your arrest, they\'re going to wonder why you
are so far away from the jurisdiction, because it kinda looks like
you\'re running from your conviction, which is bad.\
\
If you don\'t have a criminal defense attorney, it\'s time to retain one
and see if you can plead this thing out. You can\'t really live long in
this country with any kind of warrant out on you. If it\'s a
misdemeanor, you might be able to plead it out to something really
small, so just get it done and move on. Running will just make it
worse.]{.rendered_qtext}
