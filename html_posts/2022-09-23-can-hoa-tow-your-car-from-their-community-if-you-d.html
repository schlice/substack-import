1.  The HOA can only tow cars from land they own. If you live in a gated
    community, they can tow cars from the street. If the city or county
    owns the streets, they cannot tow from the streets. If the HOA owns
    the clubhouse, they can tow from the parking lot, but that's it. If
    the HOA owns parking spaces, they can tow from those spaces.
2.  The HOA can set whatever rules they like regarding cars on property
    they own. If one of those rules is that cars must have a current
    registration and must have license plates attached and visible, then
    they can tow cars which do not follow this rule.

You can find all of the HOA's rules in the Governing Documents, which
the HOA should give you, but if you can't find them, they are also on
file with the County in which the HOA is located.
