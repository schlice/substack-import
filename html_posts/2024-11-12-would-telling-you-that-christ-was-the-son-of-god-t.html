Sure it is! Of course, it's only more plausible if you're trying to find
a ***natural*** explanation for a ***supernatural*** event.

Nevertheless, the truth is that Jesus was born of a virgin through a
***supernatural*** event. "Supernatural" literally means "beyond the
natural." That means that it is something which ***cannot*** be
explained using natural means.

So if you're trying to explain a ***supernatural*** event using
***natural*** means, you might end up missing the significance of what
happened.

So why is being born of a virgin important?

Because **sin is passed down from generation to generation through the**
***male.***

> Romans 5:12 ESV

But when Jesus was conceived, it was **without a man**. Therefore, Jesus
was born **without original sin**. He lived His entire life without sin.
Thus, he was able to take on the sin of the world and redeem humanity.
He was able to do this *because* He was sinless. He is the only person
who could do it.

Thus, Jesus ***not*** being conceived by a man was the linchpin in His
ability to take on the sins of the world.
