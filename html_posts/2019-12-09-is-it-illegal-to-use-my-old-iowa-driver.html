**Is it illegal to use my old Iowa driver\'s licenses to claim instate
tuition, even though I\'ve been living in Minnesota for 6 months?**

The answer is "it depends."

It depends on which state is your state of residence, of which you can
only have one.

You can own property in more than one state, and you can live in more
than one state throughout the course of a year, but which state you
claim as your state of residence is well established.

You will file a tax return under one state as a resident, and the other
state as a non-resident. You can claim a state as your state of
residence, but then your other state is not your state of residence.

In this case, you may have been living in Minnesota for 6 months (maybe
for school or for work, or just for fun), but that doesn't automatically
make you a resident of the state of Minnesota. Unless you "abandoned" or
"moved out" of Iowa, or you intended to change your state of residence
from Iowa to Minnesota, you're still a resident of the state of Iowa.

You will remain a resident until you "abandon" or "give up" your
residency in Iowa in order to live in Minnesota permanently. If you
earned money in Minnesota, you may have to file a non-resident tax
return in Minnesota as well as a resident tax return in Iowa, but your
state of residency does not change until you take positive steps to
change it, such as "moving out" of Iowa and selling your property in
Iowa. If you have done *this*, there is a case to be made that you are
*de facto* no longer a state resident of Iowa, but are in fact a
resident of Minnesota, and maintaining an active Iowa driver's license
may be unlawful under Minnesota state rules.

If you're only temporarily in Minnesota, but you intend Iowa to be your
state of legal residence, then that remains so. If you have sold all
your property in Iowa and moved all of your belongings out of the state,
it is clear that you have "abandoned" your residency in Iowa and have
"moved" to Minnesota.
