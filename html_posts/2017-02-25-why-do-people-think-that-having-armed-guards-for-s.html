Because people believe that somehow, having the mere presence of guns in
school will harm their children.

Not that school security guards would ever harm children with those
guns, or use them inappropriately. Simply the mere presence of the gun
in the school imposes some level of psychological harm on their
children.

They believe the school is sacrosanct. They believe that no violence
should ever occur in a school, and the answer (to them) to school
violence is not armed guards.

Not that they've come up with a better answer, mind you. Just that armed
guards *can't be* the best way to handle school violence.

It's true that many people and places are protected by armed guards.
Many more people self-protect, more people than you would probably
guess. But somehow, the school is different, because, well, it's a
*school*. There just shouldn't be guns in a school.
