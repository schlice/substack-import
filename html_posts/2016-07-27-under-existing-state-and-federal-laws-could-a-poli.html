1.  Your medical records are protected health information (PHI) and
    cannot be accessed by anyone without your written consent. This
    falls under the federal HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and
    Accountability Act) guidelines. No agency has the authority to
    override this law. Your VA disability rating is considered PHI.
2.  The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) also protects you, as you
    are an American and you are disabled. ADA changed how employers are
    allowed to screen potential candidates so that persons with
    disabilities are not discriminated against. Your prospective
    employer is only allowed to list the physical functions required in
    the job and then they are allowed to ask you whether or not you can
    perform the physical functions listed, **with or without reasonable
    accommodations.** You only have to answer yes or no. The employer is
    allowed to perform physical testing to ensure you can meet those
    standards. So long as you pass the physical test, you can be hired.

I have personal experience with this, as I too have a service-connected
disability and I successfully completed the hiring process for my local
Sheriff's Office. You can choose to disclose or not to disclose this
information to your prospective employer; you are under no obligation to
disclose that information. Your employer may not discriminate against
you because you have a disability.
