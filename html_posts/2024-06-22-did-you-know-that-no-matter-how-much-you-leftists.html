I'm a Christian and I really despise these "did you know" questions.

**OF COURSE THEY KNOW THAT THEY CAN'T PROVE THAT GOD DOES NOT EXIST.**

But in exactly the same way and using exactly the same tools, **we also
cannot prove that God exists.**

Of course, the reason for that is, in that scenario, the tools we both
are trying to use are wrong. Science can never prove or disprove the
existence of God, because God exists outside of what science can detect.
It's like trying to use an X-ray machine to find a plastic spoon.
Science is simply the wrong tool.

We can prove that God exists using logic and reason. This is evidence
gained through *inductive* reasoning, and as such, can never be 100%
certain. Atheists, however, reject these proofs as lacking, despite the
fact that we can prove God exists beyond what we would consider
reasonable doubt. The difference between our two camps is what we both
consider *reasonable.*

**And that, dear questioner, is** ***by design.***

**TL;DR: Yes, atheists know full well that they can't prove God doesn't
exist. And that is by design.**
