So if you believe that Jesus is God, then what Jesus says must be true,
right? Because anything that Jesus (who is God) says must be true.

**Jesus said that the Bible is the inspired word of God.**

Clearly, Jesus would have to be speaking about the Old Testament, as the
New Testament books hadn't been written yet. But Jesus taught that the
Old Testament was the Word of God. He said it:

1.  **Is Divinely Authoritative**---When tempted by Satan, Jesus
    corrected him by quoting from the Old Testament. He said, "'It is
    written, "Man does not live on bread alone, but on every word that
    comes from the mouth of God.' \[...\] Jesus answered him, 'It is
    also written: "Do not put the Lord your God to the test.' \[...\]
    Then Jesus said to him, 'Away from me, Satan! For it is written:
    "Worship the Lord your God, and serve him only'" (Matt. 4:4,7,10).
    Why would Jesus so confidently quote from the Old Testament if the
    Old Testament was not authoritative? He must have considered the Old
    Testament to be a source of truth in order to dismiss his most
    powerful enemy with it.\
    \
    In fact, on 92 occasions Jesus and his apostles supported their
    position by saying "it is written" (or words to that effect) and
    then quoting the Old Testament. Why? Because Jesus and his apostles
    considered the Old Testament Scriptures to be the written Word of
    God, and thus the ultimate authority for life.
2.  **Is Imperishable**---In the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus claimed that
    not even the smallest little mark in the Scriptures (the equivalent
    of a dot on an "i" or a cross on a "t") will ever perish: "Do not
    think that I came to destroy the Law or the Prophets," he declared.
    "I did not come to destroy but to fulfill. For assuredly, I say to
    you, till heaven and earth pass away, one jot or one tittle will by
    no means pass from the law till all is fulfilled" (Matt. 5:17,
    NKJV). Jesus could not express the imperishability of the Scriptures
    more forcefully.
3.  **Is Infallible**---In John 10, Jesus was about to be stoned for
    blasphemy. To get himself out of this jam, Jesus cited the Old
    Testament and declared, "the Scripture cannot be broken" (John
    10:35, NKJV). In other words, when His life was on the line, Jesus
    referred to an infallible authority that cannot be broken---the
    Scripture. Furthermore, He later affirmed the truth of the
    Scriptures when He prayed for the disciples, "Sanctify them by the
    truth; your word is truth" (John 17:17).
4.  **Is Inerrant**---When the Sadducees tried to trap Jesus with a
    question, Jesus said to them, "You are in error because you do not
    know the Scriptures or the power of God" (Matt. 22:29). The
    implication, of course, is that the Scriptures are inerrant. It
    wouldn't make any sense for Jesus to say, "You are in error because
    you don't know the Scriptures, which also err!"
5.  **Is Historically Reliable**---In addition to declaring that the Old
    Testament is divinely authoritative, imperishable, infallible, and
    inerrant, Jesus affirmed two of the most historically disputed
    stories in the Old Testament: Noah (Matt. 24:37-38) and Jonah (Matt.
    12:40). Jesus spoke of those stories as being historically true. And
    why wouldn't they be true? The miracles associated with Noah and
    Jonah are child's play for the all-powerful God who created the
    universe. With our limited intelligence, we build great ships and
    keep people alive for months underwater. Why couldn't God do the
    same?\
    \
    Jesus also affirmed other aspects of the Old Testament that the
    critics deny. Jesus taught that Daniel was a prophet (Matt. 24:15)
    while many critics say Daniel was merely a historian (the critics
    claim a later date for Daniel, because surely he couldn't have made
    all those predictions; their anti-supernatural bias is revealed
    again). Furthermore, Jesus specifically quoted different sections of
    the book of Isaiah (e.g., Matt. 7:6-7; 13:14-15; Luke 4:17-19),
    never once suggesting that there were two or three Isaiahs as many
    critics claim.
6.  **Is Scientifically Accurate**---Jesus made other claims that
    contradict those of today's critics. When asked if divorce was
    acceptable, Jesus cited a scientific fact out of Genesis. He said,
    "Haven't you read that at the beginning the Creator 'made them male
    and female,' and said, 'For this reason a man will leave his father
    and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one
    flesh'? So they are no longer two, but one. Therefore what God has
    joined together, let man not separate" (Matt. 19:4-6). In other
    words, the nature of marriage is bound up in the scientific fact
    that Adam and Eve were created for a purpose.\
    \
    Moreover, Jesus did not accept the false idea that the Bible could
    tell you how to "go to heaven" but not "how the heavens go." He told
    Nicodemus, "If I told you earthly things and you do not believe, how
    will you believe if I tell you heavenly things?" (John 3:12, NASB).
    In other words, Jesus taught that if the Bible does not speak
    truthfully about the physical world that you can see, then it cannot
    be trusted when it speaks about the spiritual world that you cannot
    see. Indeed, Christianity is built on historical events---such as
    Creation and the Resurrection---that can be tested through
    scientific and historical investigation. While adherents of other
    religions may accept a complete separation from science, Christians
    do not. Truth about the universe cannot be contradictory. Since all
    truth is God's truth, religious beliefs must agree with scientific
    facts. If they do not, then either there is an error in our
    scientific understanding, or our religious beliefs are wrong. Yet
    many of the claims of Christianity are affirmed by scientific
    investigation. Christ knew it would be this way.
7.  **Has Ultimate Supremacy**---Since Jesus taught that the Old
    Testament is divinely authoritative, imperishable, infallible,
    inerrant, historically reliable, and scientifically accurate, you
    would expect him to assert that it has ultimate supremacy over any
    teaching of man. This is exactly what Jesus said. He corrected the
    Pharisees and the teachers of the law by claiming that they should
    be obeying the Old Testament Scriptures instead of their own
    man-made traditions. He said, "Why do you break the command of God
    for the sake of your tradition? \[...\] You nullify the word of God
    for the sake of your tradition" (Matt. 15:3,6). He then blasted them
    for failing to live up to the Scriptures by quoting from the Old
    Testament: "You hypocrites! Isaiah was right when he prophesied
    about you: 'These people honor me with their lips, but their hearts
    are far from me. They worship me in vain; their teachings are but
    rules taught by men'" (Matt. 15:7-9). Why would Jesus correct the
    religious leaders of Israel with the Old Testament unless the Old
    Testament had ultimate supremacy over their own ideas?

In light of Jesus' teaching, there's no question He considered the
entire Old Testament to be the inerrant, written Word of God. He said he
came to fulfill the entire Jewish Old Testament (Matt. 5:17), which He
referred to as "the Law and the Prophets" (Matt. 5:17; Luke 24:26-27).
And He told the Jews, "You diligently study the Scriptures because you
think that by them you possess eternal life. These are the Scriptures
that testify about me, yet you refuse to come to me to have life" (John
5:39-40).

Therefore, if Jesus taught that the Bible is the inerrant word of God,
who are we to not believe Him?
