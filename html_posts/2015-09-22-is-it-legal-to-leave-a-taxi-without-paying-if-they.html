The taxi can bill you if their credit card system is broken and they
only will accept cash. In some cities, city ordinance requires cabs to
take credit cards. If their cab advertises that they take credit cards,
it\'s reasonable for you to assume that you can pay by credit card.
Therefore, they can\'t \*force\* you to pay by cash if there are clear
advertisements on the door of the cab that show they take cards. If this
ever happens, make the cab company bill you for the ride. Give them your
name, your address, show them your driver\'s license, etc., and make
them bill you. If the cabbie wants cash that badly, make him drive you
(off the clock) to an ATM, then drive you back to your original
destination (off the clock) and pay him the original fare.

Ideally, however, you and the cabbie should work this out before you
ride.

Protip 1: Tell the cabbie when you get to the door, before you \*start\*
your ride that you have no cash and can only pay credit. If the cabbie
can\'t take your card, he\'ll call you another cab that can.

Protip 2: When you call to request your ride with the cab company, tell
them over the phone your driver \*must\* be able to accept your credit
card because you have no cash. Then when the cab arrives, use Protip 1.
