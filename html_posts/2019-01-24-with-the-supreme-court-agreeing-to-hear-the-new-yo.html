**With the Supreme Court agreeing to hear the New York firearms
transport laws case, is it likely that they will agree to hear
challenges to state assault weapons bans in the future?**

Possibly.

The court has already upheld assault weapons bans (AWBs) in New York,
Connecticut, and Maryland, so it's likely that AWBs will be unaffected
by whatever SCOTUS finds in this transport case. However, these AWBs
came before the court while Kennedy was still present, so the court may
have simply been unsure about the outcome, so they refused to hear those
cases.

With Kavanaugh on the court now, they may be feeling a little bit more
sure about their chances.

This case is specifically about people with premises licenses
transporting their guns outside of city limits. They're already allowed
to transport within city limits, to one of the seven gun ranges in the
city, but the current law disallows them from transporting their guns
*outside* of city limits, anywhere, at any time, for any reason, no
exceptions. And considering that the lower courts already upheld the
law, there's a really good chance that SCOTUS did not agree to review
just so they could uphold the law, too. It's probably a good sign that
the law is on its way out.

So why now, and why this corner case? It could be that SCOTUS is simply
stretching its newly-originalist Constitutional legs, and this simple
case is a good way to do it. Or, they're taking baby steps towards
developing a full body of gun rights precedent. First, it's striking
down a really stupid New York restriction, and then moving on to
dismantling other, more onerous restrictions. Finally, the court could
be ready to apply a test to the Second Amendment. A test would be
something that you could use to measure whether or not any law is
Constitutional. It could be a "strict scrutiny" test, wherein the
government law must be narrowly tailored to advance a compelling state
interest. If they created such a test, most gun control laws would be in
violation. They could impose an "intermediate scrutiny" test, wherein a
state law must advance an important government interest "by means that
are substantially related to that interest." It is this level of
scrutiny that currently allows most gun control regulations to remain
intact, such as the aforementioned assault weapons bans.

The truth is, we don't really know. But the simple fact that the court
has entertained another gun case within a decade is a telling sign in
and of itself: they're ready to put some well-needed definition to the
Second Amendment.
