**Can you sue a landlord for wrongful eviction?**

You can sue anyone for anything. The question becomes how likely you'll
be to prevail.

If the landlord followed correct legal procedures for the eviction, then
it's highly likely you'll lose any lawsuit you attempt. Legal evictions
include a court order, so judicial review has already taken place. This
means a judge has looked at the evidence and found that it has enough
merit to warrant eviction.

If your landlord did not do this, and simply evicted you by locking you
out of your rental space and throwing your belongings on the street
(commonly known as a "self-help eviction"), you may have a case for
wrongful eviction.

I would suggest getting in contact with a tenants rights group in your
area, or retaining the services of an attorney in your area who
specializes in landlord/tenant cases.
