**Is there a huge morality gap in today\'s Christians faith, when we
consider their perverted support for a disgusting immoral, unethical,
extreme sinner named Trump? Shall the rest of us assume that these
Christians are as immoral & unethical as Trump?**

As with everything that Christians do, let's refer back to Jesus as our
guidepost. What did Jesus do?

Well, he supported a disgusting, immoral, unethical extreme sinner named
Mary Magdalene. Anyone remember her profession? Right, she was a hooker.
He also supported those immoral, unethical tax collectors. Remember
Zacchias? Yeah, he was a bad guy. Jesus supported him, too.

Jesus came to *save* those people.

And now for the zinger: *if Jesus supported prostitutes, tax collectors,
and other "disgusting, immoral, unethical, extreme sinners," how could I
do less?*

Trump, while not necessarily fitting the list of badness you said, is
indeed bombastic, narcissistic, and misogynistic (and probably a few
other "ics" as well). But one thing we learn in the military that the
rest of the country would do well to learn is that *you can respect
someone as a leader without respecting them as a person.* I've had
plenty of bosses that I'd never go have a beer with, but I'll still obey
their orders to the letter. Trump is not of the highest moral character,
and is indeed many of the things you said, *but he's a good president.*

And I elected a president, not a pope.

Trump is not the spiritual leader of the country. Jesus is. And all
government is derived from God, for the good of his kingdom. Romans 13:1
clearly states that "Every person is to be in subjection to the
governing authorities. For there is no authority except from God, and
those which exist are established by God." 1 Peter 2:13-14 says "Submit
yourselves for the Lord's sake to every human institution, whether to a
king as the one in authority, or to governors as sent by him for the
punishment of evildoers and the praise of those who do right." So we see
that God establishes all governmental leaders in the world, including
President Trump. Clearly, he has a plan for us, and it includes Trump.

Additionally, in case you missed it, *we're all sinners. We've all
fallen short of deserving God's forgiveness.* Thankfully, God is
*gracious*. Grace is getting what you do not deserve, and God gives us
grace.

Finally, God commands us to *love others,* ***not to judge them.*** By
you saying that we are immoral because we support Trump and he's a
sinner, ***you are judging both us and him***. That's God's job. He'd
probably appreciate it if you did your job and not his. Your job is to
love God, and to love your neighbor as you love yourself. Let God do the
judging. You do the loving.
