No one has the right to violate the amendments of the Constitution.

***That said***, persons who are on parole ***are still serving a prison
sentence***. They're just not doing it inside of a prison.

That means that as prisoners (on parole), they still have some of their
Constitutional rights curtailed.

Parole officers can continue to do the same things that happened within
the prison walls. So that right to privacy? Very much curtailed while
you are on parole. Along with several other rights, the biggie is the
Fourth Amendment. You pretty much surrender your Fourth Amendment search
and seizure protections while you are on parole. You can be subject to
random urinalysis. Your home and your car can be tossed at any time.
Your person can be searched, and they don't need reasonable doubt or
probable cause to do it. And not just by your probation officer, but by
any authorized law enforcement officer, at any time.

Just one more of the privileges of being on parole.
