**Within United States law, if I am witness (innocent bystander rather
than accomplice) to a murder whereby my intervention may have prevented
the murder, cloud I be found culpable of any charges?**

There is only one instance in which you can be charged, and that is if
you have an affirmative duty to protect the person who was murdered.
This primarily applies to the police in the United States, but could
also apply where persons are under your specific protection (such as a
security guard, a bodyguard, etc).

In general, the police do not have a specific duty to protect any one
person, unless special circumstances exist (such as that person is in
custody), or the police caused the conditions which resulted in an
increased risk of harm to that person.

So for example, if you are a police officer and you have arrested
someone, and you leave that person temporarily unattended, and that
person is murdered, you can be held responsible in that specific case.

Beyond that, in general, citizens in the United States do not have a
duty to protect anyone from anything, especially not the harmful actions
of a third party. We only have a duty to protect others from our own
actions.
