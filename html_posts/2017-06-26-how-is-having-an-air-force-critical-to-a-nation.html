**Content:** []{.rendered_qtext}

The answer is way too short to be tolerated by the Quora filters, so
I'll add some other text. Okay, enough of that. The reason:

**Force projection**

Our Air Force "projects" the power of the nation to any corner of the
world, at any time, in the amount of time it takes to fly to that
location. Being able to project the power of the nation anywhere is a
massive geopolitical advantage.

We also use our Air Force to defend us at our border, faster than any
water craft can, and with more lethal effect.
