**Why is the lie that Mueller declined charging the president with
obstruction due to OLC precident being spread?**

Because it's not a lie.

He really failed to do his job because he truly believed that a OLC
policy told him he couldn't. Which really makes no sense: why would the
DOJ ask him to investigate obstruction if he couldn't charge
obstruction?

So instead, he did a legal side-step. He said that he did not render a
decision because he thought it wouldn't be fair to recommend charging
someone who couldn't be charged. But he also said that Congress has
another method by which you accuse a sitting president of wrongdoing.

In case you weren't sure what exactly was going on here: ***Mueller teed
up the ball for Congress to hit an impeachment home run.***

Basically, Mueller set the stage for Congress to impeach the President.
He's practically begging them to do it. He gave them all the evidence
they need to move forward *today* with Articles of Impeachment. All the
legwork has already been done. Now, Congress needs to ***grow a spine***
and actually impeach. If they're brave enough. Which they're not.

They won't impeach because they know that impeachment proceedings now
will be a guaranteed victory for Trump in 2020.
