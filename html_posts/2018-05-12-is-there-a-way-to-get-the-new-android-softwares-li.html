Yes, you can apply whatever software you want to your phone. In the case
of the S6, the only way to do this is to root your phone and apply the
software yourself. It's absolutely feasible and can actually be done
fairly easily if you have some computer and hardware knowledge.

However, there is less of a question of whether or not you **could**.
There is more of a question of whether or not you **should**.

Newer operating systems are going to be optimized for newer hardware.
The reason why the S6 never got Android O from the carriers is because
it would run like crap on that hardware. Putting Android P on that
hardware would make it run like hot crappy crap.

If I may be so bold as to make a suggestion. You want the new features,
but you want something that will actually run on your hardware. I would
suggest an open source port. I would formerly suggest **Cyanogenmod**,
but that project was discontinued. Some savvy developers took over the
source for the Cyanogenmod project and now produce an open source
firmware called
[[LineageOS](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=05c99b&url=https://www.lineageos.org){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="lineageos.org"}]{.qlink_container}. In this way, you can get
the best of both worlds: you'll get many of the most recent additions to
the Android baseline, but you'll get it in a package that will actually
run on an S6. That hardware is out of warranty now, so there's no risk
in installing it on your phone. It's not like you're going to void a
warranty or anything like that.

If you don't have any phone hardware experience, this might be a good
project to try to learn on. You can always use Odin to put the original
firmware back on the phone. I'd say save off all of your personal data,
and load Lineage.
