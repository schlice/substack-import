You said "employment contract." That's a very specific legal term.

That term means the employer and the employee have signed a contract
specifying a length of time of employment. Employment contracts will
have specific termination requirements, or they may have none at all,
depending on the character of the termination. The requirement for
giving notice will be spelled out in the employment contract depending
on the character of the termination.

In other words, if it is a termination "with cause" (because you broke a
term of the contract), it will have one specific set of rules regarding
notice, and if it is a termination "without cause" (when you didn't
break a term of the contract), it will have another specific set of
rules.
