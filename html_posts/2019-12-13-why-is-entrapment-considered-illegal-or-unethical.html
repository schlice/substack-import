**Why is entrapment considered illegal or unethical? In some cases, it
might be the only way to catch someone in the act.**

Entrapment is far different than "catching someone in the act."
Entrapment is what happens when you take an otherwise law-abiding person
and convince or coerce them into breaking the law.

There is a big difference between simply offering someone the
opportunity to break the law (which is not entrapment) and coercing,
harassing, or threatening someone who wouldn't have broken the law in
the first place into breaking the law.
