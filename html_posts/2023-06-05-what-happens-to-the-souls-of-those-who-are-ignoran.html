The answer is that no one is actually ignorant except for those who are
willfully ignorant.

Yes, there may have been some who never heard of Jesus, but God has
written His truth on our hearts. Whether or not they have "heard about
Him," all people are accountable to God. Scripture says that God has
clearly revealed Himself in nature (Romans 1:20) and in the hearts of
people (Ecclesiastes 3:11).

The problem is that humans are all sinners. We know what is on our
hearts, yet we actively reject it in favor of what "feels good" or
whatever the desires of the flesh hold for us. If it were not for God's
grace, we would be trapped in our sin, unable to see just how useless
and miserable life is apart from Him. He allows those who choose their
own desires over Him to suffer the due penalty for their sin (Romans
1:24--32).

Therefore, this is not a problem of not ever hearing about Jesus. It's
about rejecting the truth of what you know in your hearts and you see
all around you.

It might be comforting to believe that someone shouldn't go to hell just
because they haven't heard of Jesus. But that presents a problem. If we
assume that those who never hear the gospel are granted mercy from God,
there is no reason for us to ever tell anyone about God. If people who
never hear the gospel are automatically saved, then it is logical to
make sure no one ever hears the gospel, because then there would be a
chance they would hear it and reject it, and then be condemned. It would
be better that they never heard it at all.

Clearly, Jesus commands us otherwise.

The Bible is clear that those who die without knowing Jesus will face an
eternity in hell. And the Great Commission (Matthew 28:19--20) is still
in force. People need to repent and believe, but "How, then, can they
call on the one they have not believed in? And how can they believe in
the one of whom they have not heard? And how can they hear without
someone preaching to them? And how can anyone preach unless they are
sent?" (Romans 10:14--15).

We have been sent. The onus, therefore, is on us to spread the Good News
to everyone.
