Do you need a physical copy?

If you do not need a physical copy, head over to
[[bible.com](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=dd5a50&url=https://bible.com){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="bible.com"}]{.qlink_container}. They have, currently, 3558
versions of the Bible written in 2308 languages. There's a good chance
you can find a version of the Bible in a language you want.

If you do need a physical copy, you should ask around at your local
churches. They may not have that version of the Bible, so you may have
to try multiple churches. Or you can just buy the KJV. It's like \$5 at
Walmart.
