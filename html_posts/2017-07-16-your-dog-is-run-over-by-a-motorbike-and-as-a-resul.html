It doesn\'t seem as if anyone answered the question from a purely legal
(US) perspective, and despite all the good-natured
who-I-might-morally-desire-to-help-first answers, it really falls down
like this:

- I have no legal duty to render aid. I\'m not a doctor. I\'m not an
  EMT. Yes I\'m trained as a first responder, but I'm only protected by
  Good Samaritan laws, and we know those are not foolproof. If I treat
  the rider, and I hurt him in the process, Good Sam laws or not, I'm
  likely going to be the target of a negligence lawsuit. Doesn't sound
  like the perfect recipe for a happy day to me.
- The motorbike damaged my property (my dog). Dogs are not people, they
  are property under the law. My property, which **is** my
  responsibility, was damaged.

Therefore, I'm going to tend to my damaged property (my dog) while I
take pictures of the bike and its license plate so that I can prepare to
file suit to recoup the costs to repair my damaged property (i.e. my vet
bills caused by the rider, whether through accident or negligence), and
maybe, if I have time, as I'm taking my dog to the vet, I'll call 911 to
report that a motorbike hit something and the rider fell off and
probably needs an ambulance.
