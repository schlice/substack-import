**What legal action can I take against a man who runs to get in my face
for 5 minutes (close enough to smell his breath outdoors) shouting every
hateful, racist profanity known to man at me, for doing nothing but
nicely asking a car damage question?**

In tort, this is a simple assault. You could sue him in small claims
court for assault. In most civil jurisdictions, "assault" is separate
from "battery" in that "assault" is the threat, and "battery" is the
physical contact.

But there's no crime here. The 1st Amendment protects his right to
speak, even loudly and in your face. If he didn't touch you or
physically harm you, there is no crime.

But he did "assault" you in tort, so you can sue him for assault
(specifically, verbal abuse) if you suffered emotional harm from his
outburst.
