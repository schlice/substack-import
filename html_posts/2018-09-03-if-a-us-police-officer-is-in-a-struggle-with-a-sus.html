**If a US Police officer is in a struggle with a suspect and the suspect
seem to get the upper hand, should I help the officer?**

Whether or not you should really depends on the situation, as well as
your tolerance for legal problems, which you will have.

As a civilian, you are not protected by qualified immunity. While it's
unlikely that the district attorney would file charges against you, you
will most likely be sued for assault and battery. The damages you will
have to pay will be limited by the fact that the petitioner was engaged
in an altercation with a police officer for (presumably) something
illegal he was doing, but you could still face monetary damages for your
part. Your damages will also be limited by the fact that the petitioner
will not be able to be certain which injuries were inflicted by you and
which injuries were inflicted by the officer, but there will be some
level of liability you will face for inflicting injuries.
