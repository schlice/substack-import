(US answer only)

Not really, but as this is a legal question, the answer really is "it
depends."

The statement "you are an asshole" is an *opinion*. Opinions cannot be
construed as fact, so you cannot legally be lying about someone by
calling them an asshole. You certainly can't be found guilty of slander
or libel.

What you *can* potentially be charged with would be *harassment* if you
call someone an asshole so many times that the behavior is considered to
be

- Targeting someone
- With behavior meant to alarm, annoy, torment, or terrorize, *and*
- Creating reasonable fear in the victim for their safety or the safety
  of their family or property

Otherwise, just telling someone they're an asshole is just an opinion.
You can't be sued for expressing your opinion.

Can you be sued and found guilty of anything, if you tell someone \"You
are an ass hole\" in an email context?
