International flights have two full cockpit crews. One crew will do the
takeoff and landing, the other crew will do the intermediate navigation.
On large aircraft, there is a crew rest room right off the cockpit where
the off-duty crew goes to sleep.

There are no domestic flights where crews will sleep.
