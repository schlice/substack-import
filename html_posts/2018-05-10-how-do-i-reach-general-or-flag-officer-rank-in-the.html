**How do I reach general or flag officer rank in the United States Armed
Forces?**

I've heard lots of generals speak to us about careers. Basically, there
are a few things you have to do:

1.  Fill all the squares
2.  Do your job, and then do it better
3.  Be flexible with where the service wants to send you.

The first one is **fill all the squares.** This is a military saying
which means that for all of the "must do" items you have to do in your
career, do them. Do your PME (professional military education) when you
are supposed to do it. Do all of the things you are supposed to do as
part of your career field, when you are supposed to do them. Don't put
them off.

Secondly, **do your job, and then do it better**. Strive to accomplish
all of the things you need to do in your job, and then excel. Shoot for
the stars and you'll probably hit the moon, and that ain't bad.

Finally, when assignments calls and says they need to send you on a 1
year unaccompanied remote but there will be a good deal in your
follow-on, take it. Don't complain about it. The service will treat you
right, if you let them. Don't try to micromanage your career.

After all that's done, it's just a lotta luck. Maybe knowing the right
people to put in a good word for you, but there's not a lot of room at
the top of the pyramid, and you just have to know that.
