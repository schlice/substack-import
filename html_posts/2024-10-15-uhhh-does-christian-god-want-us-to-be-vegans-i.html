You probably need to keep reading.

So this encounter happens right after Noah gets out of the Ark with his
family. We pick up the action in Genesis 9:

> And God blessed Noah and his sons and said to them, "Be fruitful and
> multiply and fill the earth. The fear of you and the dread of you
> shall be upon every beast of the earth and upon every bird of the
> heavens, upon everything that creeps on the ground and all the fish of
> the sea. Into your hand they are delivered. Every moving thing that
> lives shall be food for you. And as I gave you the green plants, I
> give you everything." \-- Genesis 9:1--3 ESV

So yeah, previous instructions superseded and updated with new
instructions.
