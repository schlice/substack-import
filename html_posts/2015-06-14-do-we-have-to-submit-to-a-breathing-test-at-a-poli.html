**Content:** [You can refuse, but not without consequence.\
\
In some states, refusal is probable cause to detain you and force you to
take a blood test, or to force you to drive to the station to get a test
on an admissible breathalyzer. These cannot be refused.\
\
In some states, you can lose your license if you refuse.\
\
In some states, police have to get a warrant before they can take your
blood, but they\'re fully prepared to do that too.]{.rendered_qtext}
