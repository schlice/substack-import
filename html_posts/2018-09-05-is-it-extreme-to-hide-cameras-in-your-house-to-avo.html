**Is it extreme to hide camera\'s in your house to avoid getting falsely
accused by your partner?**

Oh yes, it's extreme.

If you are literally to the point that you're thinking about hiding
cameras to avoid false accusations, then presumably you've been through
the communication part, where you've discussed the issue with your
partner and you've gotten nowhere.

So you're at the point where you think that it's better to try to save
the relationship without the trust that you won't be falsely accused
rather than ending the relationship.

**THAT** is the extreme part.

***Without trust, you have nothing.***
