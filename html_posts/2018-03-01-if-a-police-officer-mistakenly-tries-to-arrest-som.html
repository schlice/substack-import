*"You may beat the rap, but you can't beat the ride."*

Police officers have a lower threshold than courts do when they place
someone under arrest. Police only need to have "**probable cause**" in
order to arrest someone. Probable cause means that there must be a
*reasonable basis* for believing that the suspect committed a crime.
This is why the person is brought in front of a judge for *arraignment*,
a process which involves reviewing the officer's cause for arrest and
determining if there is enough evidence to hold the suspect over for
trial. The judge will determine if the police did, in fact, have
probable cause to make the arrest. If they did not, the person must be
released.

Later, when the person appears in front of the judge at his or her
trial, it then becomes the job of the prosecution to *prove* *beyond a
reasonable doubt* that the person did, in fact, commit the crime.

Remember too, the erroneous nature of an arrest is only determined by a
competent court in that jurisdiction; it is not determined during the
arrest. Therefore, since no one, not the suspect, not the police, not
the supervisor, no one other than a court can determine whether or not
the reason for arrest was legally in error, you must operate under the
*presumption* that the reason for the arrest is *reasonable*.

It doesn't have to be *right*, it only has to be *reasonable*.

Therefore, resisting arrest because ***you think*** that the officer
does not have probable cause is illogical, since it is the judge who
determines whether or not the officer did, in fact, have probable cause.
You have to be arrested first before the judge can make that
determination.

Therefore, you can be charged with resisting arrest ***even if the basis
for the arrest was in error.***
