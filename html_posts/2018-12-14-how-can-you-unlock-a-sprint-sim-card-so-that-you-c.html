**How can you unlock a Sprint SIM card so that you can hook up the phone
to another company?**

While most of the answers here are correct, they are missing the fact
that you must pay for the entire phone before it can be unlocked.

If you were in a contract, that contract must be fully paid before
Sprint will unlock the phone for you. If you had a Equipment Installment
Plan (EIP) to pay for your phone, it must be fully paid off.

To unlock the phone, contact Sprint Customer Service and they will
assist you. By law, if you own the phone, the carrier must unlock it for
you. The phone must be free of any contracts and completely paid off.

Based on the model of phone, it may not work on every other company's
network. It may only work on a few. Some Sprint phones (as [[Lars
Poulsen](https://www.quora.com/profile/Lars-Poulsen-2)]{.qlink_container}
mentioned) are CDMA, which means they will (possibly) only work on
Verizon's network. But there are even multiple bands of CDMA, and your
Sprint phone may not have the appropriate bands to work well on Verizon
in your area.

If you happen to have a Sprint phone with a SIM card, it may be GSM.
This means that it may work on AT&T or T-Mobile's networks. The same
restrictions about bands may hold true, so your mileage may vary when
taking a phone from one carrier to another.

Once you get the phone unlocked, you can bring it in to the new store
and they can help you determine if you can use it on the new network.

If you can't, don't panic. There are a few things you can do.

- Most carriers have a trade-in program which will give you a credit for
  a working phone you trade in when you get one of theirs. Granted, you
  probably won't get the full value of the phone when you do this, but
  it's the easiest way to use an old phone on a new network.
- You can independently sell the phone on eBay, or locally using apps
  like OfferUp or Letgo. You'll get a better price with the phone being
  unlocked, as you will be able to sell to a wider audience.

Hope this helps.
