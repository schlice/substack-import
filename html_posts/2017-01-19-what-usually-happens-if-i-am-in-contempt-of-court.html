If you are in contempt of court, a bench warrant will be issued for your
arrest. If the bench warrant is entered into NICS, any agency which
performs NICS checks (gun stores, law enforcement, security clearances,
etc) will see the warrant. The actions they take will depend on the
agency conducting the check.

If you are stopped by law enforcement and the warrant shows up, the law
enforcement agency will contact the court which issued the warrant and
ask if they want you to be held on the warrant. Extradition is not cheap
or easy, so not every agency will do it. They look at several factors,
such as the nature of the offense which caused you to be held in
contempt, as well as the distance away you are. They have to pay for two
officers' travel and expenses to go to where you are to get you, so they
get to decide whether or not they will extradite. If they do decide to
extradite, you will be held in your jurisdiction until the issuing
locality can retrieve you. If they do not decide to extradite, law
enforcement will proceed as they were going to before the warrant check.
