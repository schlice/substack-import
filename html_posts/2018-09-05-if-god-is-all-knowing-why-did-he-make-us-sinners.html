**If God is all knowing, why did he make us sinners?**

What difference does it make that God knows all? You're also presuming
that somehow "being a sinner" is something that goes against God's plan.
It certainly goes against God's *desire*, but having free will was
indeed part of God's plan.

You're also incorrect that God made us sinners. He made us have the
*ability* to sin, and gave us the free will to choose how we live our
lives.

If we didn't have free will, how would God know that we truly *wanted*
to live according to His plan? We wouldn't have a choice! The fact that
we get to choose signifies that we've seen God's plan, and we've seen
Satan's plan, and we've made the conscious decision to follow God.

Being all-knowing, God *knows* that it is far better that you get to
decide for yourself whether or not you will live according to His design
and His plan for you. He *wants* you to freely choose Him.

But making us have the ability to sin was also an important part of His
plan.

Jesus outlined this in the Sermon on the Mount when He basically
re-wrote the Ten Commandments. He basically said (paraphrasing) that you
know the old laws, but I say that there's a new law. For example, you
know in the old law how it says you can't covet your neighbor's wife.
But I say that if you even have the lustful thought, you have already
committed the sin.

*What? That's impossible! We can't control what our mind does!* I mean,
we can control what actions we take, but controlling the thoughts of our
minds? Heck, we'd be sinning every day!

**And that's exactly right.**

When Jesus re-wrote the old laws, He showed us that it is *impossible*
for us to do it on our own. There is literally *no way* to be acceptable
in the eyes of God under your own power. In other words, *nothing you
can do can save you.*

The *only* way to be acceptable in the eyes of God is through Jesus. "No
one comes to the father except through me." (John 14:6). The only way to
salvation is through Jesus' sacrifice on the cross, and your acceptance
of that gift.
