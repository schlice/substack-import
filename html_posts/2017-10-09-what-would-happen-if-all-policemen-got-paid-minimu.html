Minimum wage is reserved for *entry-level* jobs. The whole point of
minimum wage is to pay it towards a job that you are trying *not* to
incentivize people to make their careers. The idea behind minimum wage
is to give young kids some opportunity to work and gain a little
experience with things like punctuality, dealing with customers, and
gaining a little time in a job before moving on to your career.

Police are career professionals. Police work is definitely not an
entry-level job, and is definitely not the kind of job where you want
entry-level people.

Pay an entry-level wage, and you'll get entry-level employees.
