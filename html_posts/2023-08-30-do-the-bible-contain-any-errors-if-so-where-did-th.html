First of all, you can prove logically that the Bible is inerrant. The
logic goes:

1.  God cannot err.
2.  The Bible is the word of God.
3.  Therefore, the Bible cannot err.

This is a valid syllogism, so if the premises are true, then the
conclusion must be true. The Bible clearly declares itself to be the
Word of God, and we have strong evidence that it is. The Bible also
informs us several times that God cannot err, and we know this from
general revelation as well. So the conclusion is inevitable. The Bible
cannot err. If the Bible erred in anything it affirms, then God would be
mistaken. But God cannot make mistakes.

So what happens when we find an "error" in the Bible? First, we have to
define what an "error" is. Some have estimated there are about 200,000
errors in the New Testament manuscripts. First of all, these are not
"errors" but variant readings, the vast majority of which are strictly
grammatical (i.e., punctuation and spelling). Second, these readings are
spread throughout nearly 5,700 manuscripts, so that a variant spelling
of *one* letter of *one* word in *one* verse in 2,000 manuscripts is
counted as 2,000 "errors."

Textual scholars Westcott and Hort estimated that only *one in sixty* of
these variants has significance. This would leave a text 98.33 percent
pure. [\[1\]](#XcHAz){#cite-XcHAz .citation_link}Philip Schaff
calculated that, of the 150,000 variants known in his day, only 400
changed the meaning of the passage, only fifty were of real
significance, and *not even one* affected "an article of faith or a
precept of duty which is not abundantly sustained by other and undoubted
passages, or by the whole tenor of Scripture
teaching."[\[2\]](#MZUZC){#cite-MZUZC .citation_link}

So when we say that the BIble contains no errors, we are talking about
errors which would materially change "an article of faith or precept of
duty." In other words, **an error would be something that changes the
religious understanding of a passage.**

There are indeed none of those errors.

The part about that statement which is so amazing; indeed, supernatural,
is the fact that the Bible is not one book but 66 books written in three
languages by about forty different authors on three continents over the
span of about 1500 years. And with all of that time and space between
them, there is **complete unity** in the message, and there are, indeed,
**zero errors** (of the kind we identified already).

There is absolutely no way that such a thing could be accomplished by
the exertions of humans.

**That's why the Bible has zero errors: because the Bible writers were
divinely inspired.** In fact, the lack of errors is indeed a hallmark of
this divine inspiration.

\

On the topic of contradictory statements, because Jesus' authority is
well established by the evidence, we reasonably give the benefit of the
doubt to the Bible when we come across a difficulty or question in the
text. In other words, when we run across something inexplicable, we
assume that we, not the infinite God, are making an error. In other
words, it's more likely that we are ignorant than that the Bible is
wrong.

However, that doesn't mean we believe there's absolutely no possibility
for Bible errors. After all, there's always a chance that our
conclusions about inerrancy are wrong---for *we* are certainly not
inerrant. In fact, our conclusion on inerrancy would be falsified if
someone could trace a real error back to an original scroll.ยน But to
this day, after nearly 2,000 years of looking, no one has found such an
irreconcilable problem. This is truly amazing when you consider that the
Bible is really a collection of documents instead of just one big book.
Where could you find such agreement on a variety of issues from 40
authors who all live today, much less over a 1,500-year period?

\

ยน Copyist errors have been found in manuscripts, but they are easily
identified and known not to be in the original by comparing the many
manuscripts in existence. While no Bible originals have yet been found,
earlier manuscripts of other works have survived. So it is possible that
a Bible original may someday be discovered.
