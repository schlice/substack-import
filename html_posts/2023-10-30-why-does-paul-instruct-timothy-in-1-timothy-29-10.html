I have personal experience with this issue. Not me personally, but *my
pastor* is independently wealthy (from his former life, and he married
well also). So we talk about personal wealth and things like what we
wear (and how we accessorize) quite a bit, because it's a very outwardly
visible thing in my church.

The problem is not the fact that you wear expensive clothes. The problem
is *why* you wear expensive clothes.

Peter talks about "outward adornment" in parallel to what Paul says to
Timothy.

> Your beauty should not come from outward adornment, such as elaborate
> hairstyles and the wearing of gold jewelry or fine clothes. Rather, it
> should be that of your inner self, the unfading beauty of a gentle and
> quiet spirit, which is of great worth in God's sight. --- 1 Peter
> 3:3--4 NIV

As you can see, "outward adornment" is less important than the "inner
self." Christians should focus less on outward adornment and more on the
development of the "inner self."

The Bible also talks about doing everything we do (including how we
dress) for the glory of God:

> So whether you eat or drink or whatever you do, do it all for the
> glory of God. --- 1 Cor 10:31 NIV

So the motivation of our heart is well known to God. If you're wearing
expensive clothes to "stand out" or to "fit in," your motivation may
fall short of God's plan for us. The clothes themselves may not be
sinful, but our motivation for wearing them may be.

Finally, we are also God's ambassadors:

> We are therefore Christ's ambassadors, as though God were making his
> appeal through us. --- 2 Cor 5:20 NIV

What message does our clothing send? Does our clothing *enhance* God's
message, or does it *detract* from the delivery of that message?

Since what clothing exactly we should be wearing is never really
discussed, it's sort of a "gray area" where you should listen to the
Spirit and be sensitive to those around you. If you're standing out, you
might consider "dressing down" a bit.
