**If Trump exhorts violence after he leaves office, will he be open to
federal prosecution?**

If by "exhorts violence" you specifically mean "inciting violence," then
any American citizen can be charged with this, even a former President.

However, that's a pretty high bar to meet. The standard the courts use
is called "imminent lawless action." This standard was developed in a
Supreme Court case called *Brandenberg v. Ohio*, and has come to be
known as the "Brandenberg test."

Under the imminent lawless action test, speech is not protected by the
First Amendment if the speaker intends to incite violence that is both
imminent and likely.

Imminent violence means violence in the very near future, or at least a
specified time. The imminence piece has been tested several times, and
making speeches calling for violence at some unspecified future time
does not amount to imminence, and therefore does not fall outside of
First Amendment protection. Likelihood has also been tested. Simply
calling for violence is protected by the First Amendment, It has to be
"likely" that violence would be triggered by the speech before it might
lose that protection.
