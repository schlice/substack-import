You receive a new charge (in addition to the one you were originally
being stopped for). It has different names depending on your
jurisdiction, but it could be called:

From our friends at Nolo:

> Some states have statutes that specifically prohibit drivers from

> drivers from \"fleeing or attempting to elude a law enforcement
> officer.\" (Fla. Stat. ยง 316.1935 (2022).) Other states, such as New
> Mexico and West Virginia, include the offense as part of a broader
> \"resisting\" or \"obstructing\" statute. (N.M. Stat. ยง 30-22-1; W.V.
> Code ยง 61-5-17 (2022).) Still, others refer to the act as fleeing an

Regardless of what it is called, the end result is that you'll end up
with a new charge, on top of whatever you were being stopped for in the
first place.
