**Content:** [I would say first that \"emergency services\" covers a
broad range of career fields. That said, I would also postulate that
introverts *might* have a harder time in law enforcement than in
emergency medical services. I think the other contributors here have
commented sufficiently on EMS, and I agree with their assessments.\
\
In law enforcement, you do have to be outgoing. You have to be able to
engage with the public, in whatever state they are in, and regardless of
how you feel about actually engaging with them. You also have to be able
to make life-and-death decisions in very short time spans, but that\'s
not a function of introversion.\
\
Introverts might do well in law enforcement because they would be very
calm and methodical when dealing with many varied types of situations,
and less likely to \"fly off the handle.\" I\'m not sure they\'d prefer
to deal with those situations, but they might do well in
them.]{.rendered_qtext}
