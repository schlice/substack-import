I need to correct some of your understanding. You said this:

> **I'm afraid of going to hell and feel like I want to be rebaptized
> because I want to have my many sins forgiven**

So know this:

***Baptism doesn't save you. Baptism is what saved people do.***

Scriptures are abundantly clear on this (see John 3:16; Ephesians 2:8-9;
Titus 3:5). You don't need to be baptized in order to be saved.
Requiring anything other than faith in Christ for salvation is
considered to be "works-based salvation." In other words, it's a belief
that you need to "do" something in order to be saved, and Scripture is
clear that the only thing you need to be saved is faith in Christ.

In short, baptism is an *outward* sign of the *inward* salvation we
already have in Christ. Baptism is us proclaiming to the world: "I am a
sinner, but I am saved. I have been buried with Christ, and raised again
in new life."

Baptism is an act of obedience to God *after* we have already been
saved. The Bible says that believers are to be baptized, not that
baptism is necessary to be saved, or that baptism does anything special
for you. It doesn't "cleanse you of sin", only Christ does this when you
repent of your sin.

\

And as for baptism cleansing you of your blasphemous thoughts, I have
bad news for you. *You're always going to have blasphemous thoughts.*
But not because you're a bad person, because you're a *fallen* person.
You are a fallible human, living in a frail, sinful, fallen body. It is
the nature of our life on earth that we are bathed in sin. There is
nothing to be done for it.

We simply must recognize that our minds are sinful and will always turn
to sin if we allow them to run around unchecked. Just know that when you
have those thoughts, it is simply because you live in a sinful body. Do
not let the thoughts win. You and Christ, together, are stronger than
the thoughts. Christ gives you the power to overcome the thoughts when
you ask Him to help you. And He will, because He is faithful to keep His
promises.
