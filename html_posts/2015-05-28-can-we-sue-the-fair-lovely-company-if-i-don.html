**Content:** [Look closely at what the product claims to do:\
]{.rendered_qtext}

- BB cream instantly covers spots, blemishes, dark circles and dullness
  to give you a fabulous make-up finish.
- It is enriched with Multi-Vitamins that work from within\* to give you
  treatment like fairness#.
- Its SPF 15, PA++ protects your fairness in the sun, and its matte
  texture leaves your face feeling non-oily, fresh and bright through
  the day.

Then check the fine print:\
\
\

> Make-up finish/look via coverage. Results not equal to face make-up
> categories like the eye, lip, blush etc.\
> \
> \*within epidermin.\
> \
> #Refers to treatment in the cosmetic domain.\
> \
> Results not equal to clinical/invasive skin treatment. Use daily for
> best results.\

\
There is nothing there that says you will get fair. There is nothing
there that says you will retain fairness. It says you will get
\"treatment-like fairness\" and they are talking about cosmetic
treatment. So translated, that means it\'s makeup, and not much else.\
\
Their products never claim to make your skin lighter.\
\
So it\'s not likely they can be sued for false advertising, since their
products say exactly what they will do and what they won\'t (results not
equal to clinical/invasive skin treatment).
