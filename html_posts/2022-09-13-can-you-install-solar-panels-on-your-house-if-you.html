The short answer to all legal questions is "it depends."

And in this case, whether or not your HOA can block the installation of
solar on your house depends on what state you live in.

Arizona, California, Colorado, DC, Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Idaho,
Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts,
Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oregon, Texas, Utah,
Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia and Wisconsin have what are
known as "solar rights laws." These states have passed laws which
specify that the HOA cannot **block** your installation of solar. The
HOA can make changes to a solar install, but they cannot block it
outright. For example, if you want to install a freestanding solar
array, the HOA can tell you that you must install it on the roof
instead. As another example, the Illinois law says that the HOA can
relocate your array, so long as the new location does not reduce the
expected electricity production by more than 10%.

Some other states have no laws regarding solar whatsoever. Alabama,
Arkansas, Connecticut, Michigan, Mississippi, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania,
South Carolina, South Dakota and Wyoming have no laws at all regarding
solar. If your HOA denies your request, you're pretty much out of luck
in those states.

All of the remaining states have "solar easement" laws, which allow you
to enter into voluntary agreements with your neighbors specifying that
you have access to a certain amount of sunlight. This is important in
heavily wooded areas, or areas which will grow to become heavily wooded.
Once you have a solar easement agreement in place, it stays with the
property, so future property owners would be guaranteed the same right
to sunlight as you are.

So if you live in a state which allows you to get solar, follow your
HOA's process for exterior changes, and then you're good to go!
