First off, the Right to Treat Act was introduced by Sen. Ron Johnson
(R-Wis.), along with Sen. Mike Braun (R-Ind.), and Sen. Mike Lee
(R-Utah). And to understand why it was introduced, you need to
understand how these Senators view the government\'s handling of the
pandemic.

Their belief was spelled out by Senator Johnson: "Because federal health
agencies sabotaged the early treatment of COVID-19 using widely
available and safe generic drugs, an untold number of people needlessly
died from COVID-19. Americans and doctors should have the freedom to use
fully approved drugs without fear of reprisal."

To that end, the Right to Treat Act would "ensure that federal health
agencies return to their proper functions of gathering and providing
public health data and regulating drug safety -- not telling doctors how
to practice medicine."

In practice, the Act would "reaffirm that no federal agency has the
authority to regulate the practice of medicine and that no federal law,
rule, or regulation of policy will prohibit or restrict the lawful
prescribing or disbursing of any FDA approved drug or Right to Try
drug[\[1\]](#DJzjK){#cite-DJzjK .citation_link}."
