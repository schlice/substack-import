Roe v Wade.

Before you rush to the comments, note that I'm not saying this because
of a personal distaste for killing children or a particular lack of
empathy for women.

I'm only saying this because this decision is **bad law**. Not its
outcome, but its method of implementation. This was a terribly sourced
decision.

I would have much rather seen a decision based on the 14th Amendment and
due process and equal protection, instead of creating a right to privacy
out of some cobbled-together "emanations and penumbras" to create a
right which doesn't actually exist.

And I would have much rather seen the Court actually place an age limit
on when a fetus becomes a person. Saying that a fetus is not a person at
39 weeks, 29 days, 23 hours and 59 seconds, but then once it moves two
feet out of the birth canal, it's a person? It's medically,
scientifically, philosophically, and morally unsustainable, but there it
is.

I would personally set that date at 20 weeks. But that's my opinion,
considering all of the medical, scientific, philosophical and moral
evidence I can piece together about how developed a fetus is at 20
weeks. I'd say no abortions after 20 weeks except in cases of incest or
to save the life of the mother. Yes, that means if you were raped and
you choose to carry the baby for 20 weeks, you can carry the baby for
another 20 weeks and then give it up for adoption. Violations of that
law are visited on the doctor/hospital, not the mother. No doctor in his
right mind would risk his medical practice by knowingly aborting a fetus
older than 20 weeks. Does this mean that some women would turn to
back-alley abortions? Yep. Does that risk the woman's life? Yep. Does
she make that decision willingly? Yep, and if she's not, if she's being
coerced into a back-alley abortion, that's a violation of a different
law and should be handled accordingly.

(EDIT, 25 Jun 2022) This aged well.
