**What steps would need to be taken by Congress to get this \"policy\"
below reversed for possible future trials, so that a U.S. President
could be sued while in office?**

I'm glad you put "policy" in quotes. Because it's not policy. It's the
Constitution.

Quoting from "this policy" as was laid out in the landmark case *Nixon
v. Fitzgerald:*

> 2\. Petitioner, as a former President of the United States, is
> entitled to absolute immunity from damages liability predicated on his
> official acts. Pp. 744-758\
> \[...\]\
> (b) The President\'s absolute immunity is a functionally mandated
> incident of his unique office, rooted in the constitutional tradition
> of the separation of powers and supported by the Nation\'s history.
> Because of the singular importance of the President\'s duties,
> diversion of his energies by concern with private lawsuits would raise

Basically, having to defend against civil suits causes a president to
have to divert his attention away from his official duties, which
endangers the effective functioning of government. Remember, this
doesn't protect the President against *criminal* liability, but it does
provide immunity against *civil* liability.

This principle was upheld and further defined in *Clinton v. Jones*,
which stated that presidents can still be sued for actions they took
before becoming president, even if they are immune from suit due to
official acts while president.

If you still believe that a president should be able to face liability
for civil damages based on his official acts, then Congress isn't the
one to do it. The Supreme Court's interpretation of the Constitution
means that any law making a president so liable would be moot before it
was even signed.

Your only option is a Constitutional amendment.
