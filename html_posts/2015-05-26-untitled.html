**Content:** [There are some devices that you can supposedly buy on eBay
that will supposedly open locked car doors. Something like this out of
China is available on a website named [[ADK Auto Diagnostic
Tool](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=5a23bb&url=http://www.adkautodiagnostic.com/){.external_link

It\'s dubious whether or not something like this would work. It would
have to record the keypress and then play it back later. And if your
keyfob uses rolling-code technology, they would literally have minutes
(or possibly less than a minute) to unlock your vehicle becore the code
rolled over.\
\
If your keyfob uses a static code, it\'s possible that there is a
brute-force device out there that might be used to roll through all the
codes. It would take several minutes to do, but it is theoretically
possible. Most folks wouldn\'t be able to build something like that, and
most thieves wouldn\'t be smart enough to use one.\
\
This article at DailyTech has quite a bit more of the technical bits
involved in what a hack like this might look like, along with the gear
involved. It\'s probably going to be more complex than your average car
thief could pull off.\
