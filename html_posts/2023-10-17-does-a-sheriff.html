Yes. They need to be granted arrest powers by the Governor of the state.
Generally, this happens when they are sworn as law enforcement officers.

Oh, did you mean that they'd need approval of a supervisor every time
they make an arrest? No, no they don't. They already have the authority
granted to them by the Governor when they receive their badge. They
don't have to get "extra permission" to perform a lawful arrest.
