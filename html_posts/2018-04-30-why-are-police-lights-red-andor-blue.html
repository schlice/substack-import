**Why does the police have red siren lights and blue siren lights?**

In the United States, the colors of emergency vehicle lights is governed
by state law. Most states allow both red and blue lights on emergency
vehicles, while other states designate colors for certain functions
(i.e. red for police, blue for fire, green for ambulance, etc).

The colors tend to be historical in nature. When cars were first
produced, they were all black. Red vehicles were unheard of, so they
stood out very easily. Similarly, red flashing lights on a red vehicle
were very visible, as even lights on vehicles did not flash frequently.
A rotating light producing a flashing effect was added to emergency
vehicles to draw your attention to it, so that you can stay out of its
way. Most frequently, that light was red.

As cars advanced (and started to change color), the red color was
retained by most fire vehicles, but mostly through historical
preference. These days, emergency vehicles have been adopting other
colors which are not found on passenger cars, such as fluorescent
yellow.

Blue was added to light bars along with red because studies have shown
that blue flashing lights are visible from greater distances than red
flashing lights. Additionally, white flashing lights are also highly
visible from distance. You will also notice that along with the light
bar, the vehicle high beams are wired to a "winker" switch. This
alternates the high beams from left to right, producing a very visible
strobe pattern.
