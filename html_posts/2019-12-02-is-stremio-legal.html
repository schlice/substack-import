**Is Stremio legal?**

It appears so.

From their site:

> Stremio is a one-stop hub for video content aggregation. Discover,
> organize and watch video from all kind of sources on any device that
> you own.

Stremio is a **content aggregator** It is not a content provider. It
only aggregates content *for which you already have legal access*. It is
not providing access you do not already have.

Where Stremio needs to be careful is serving content you already have
access to in a way which violates that site's agreement. But that's just
a future watchout for them; they need to ensure they know the content
delivery policies of the sites they aggregate, and respect those
policies when their end user uses Stremio.

But assuming they do that, yeah from a first blush, it looks legit.
