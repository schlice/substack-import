**Isn\'t everyone who is physically within the borders of the United
States \'subject to the jurisdiction thereof \'?**

No, at least not in the sense that the 14th Amendment reads.

We tend to think about "jurisdiction" in terms of laws. If you're in a
state, you are subject to the jurisdiction of that state, and even if
you are a resident of another state, you can be charged under that
state's laws if you violate them.

The 14th Amendment reads:

> *All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to
> the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the
> State wherein they reside.*

In a very literal reading, this says that if you're born in the United
States, you are a citizen of the United States.

But let's dissect this a little bit more carefully.

The first clause says:

> All persons born or naturalized in the United States
>
> **AND**
>
> subject to the jurisdiction thereof

Just a simple dissection of this phrase shows that, at the time the
Amendment was written, there was a group of people who could be born or
naturalized in the United States **AND NOT** subject to the jurisdiction
thereof.

This means that our interpretation of "subject to the jurisdiction
thereof" does not match what the writers of the 14th Amendment intended.

Senator Jacob Howard worked closely with Abraham Lincoln in drafting and
passing the 13th Amendment (which abolished slavery). He also served on
the Senate Joint Committee on Reconstruction, which drafted the 14th
Amendment. In 1866, Senator Howard clearly spelled out the intent of the
14th Amendment by writing (emphasis mine):

> Every person born within the limits of the United States, and subject
> to their jurisdiction, is by virtue of natural law and national law a
> citizen of the United States. **This will not, of course, include
> persons born in the United States who are foreigners, aliens, who
> belong to the families of ambassadors or foreign ministers accredited
> to the Government of the United States**, but will include every other
> class of persons. It settles the great question of citizenship and
> removes all doubt as to what persons are or are not citizens of the
> United States. This has long been a great desideratum in the
> jurisprudence and legislation of this country.

Through a series of court cases which established case law, we have come
to the incorrect understanding that the 14th Amendment applies to
"aliens" when, at the time it was written, it did not.
