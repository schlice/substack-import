In the VAST majority of HOAs, the answer is no, because in the VAST
majority of HOAs, the inside of your home is not regulated. I have seen
**SOME** garages be regulated by the HOA, but usually only by saying you
need to park cars in your garage so it can't be full of crap. If you
were to make a claim that you're parking in your driveway because your
garage is full of cars, some of these HOAs regulating garage use in this
way *may* be able to look inside your garage window to confirm that your
garage is, indeed, full of cars, and not junk.

That said, to fully and *correctly* answer this question for any given
HOA, you must check the Governing Documents of that HOA to see what
authority the Board members have to enter property, or to look into
windows in the home. Whatever authority they have will be spelled out in
the Governing Documents.

While I can't say for certain, because I haven't read the Governing
Documents for every HOA and COA in the country, **I highly doubt any of
them would authorize Board members to enter your house without your
permission.** Entering your ***property*** outside of your house is a
different story, but I'm almost certain that none of them allow Board
members to enter your home uninvited.

**IF THERE IS A REQUIREMENT AT ALL TO ENTER YOUR HOME,** it will be **BY
APPOINTMENT** and **WITH ADVANCED NOTICE**. But again, I highly doubt
that any allow that at all.

AT BEST, in any HOA on which I have ever served, I was able to enter the
**property** (not the home) to address *emergency issues, and only
issues* ***which impacted other homeowners,*** when the homeowner was
not home. I did this one time, when a sprinkler line had burst and was
spraying water 20 feet into the air and into the neighbor's window and
yard. I entered the property (all on video, of course), located the
in-ground valve connecting the sprinkler system to the county's
reclaimed water delivery system, and turned it off. We then emailed the
video to the homeowner so that they knew why their sprinkler water was
turned off.
