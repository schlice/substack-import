**No.**

In the United States, there is no law that requires a civilian assist in
any circumstance. There are a handful of states with a limited set of
circumstances under which civilians are required to report, but even
there, there is no duty to assist.

The best we have is a series of Good Samaritan laws which protect
bystanders from liability when they do intervene.
