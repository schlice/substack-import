**Can I (as a nontechnical person) safely root my Samsung Galaxy S8? If
so, how?**

As a "non-technical" person, I would strongly suggest you **not** root
your phone, because a non-technical person should have very little need
to do so.

Especially for the S8 (which happens to be the phone I'm using as my own
daily driver these days), you're running nearly the latest Android
operating system available. We'll be getting Android Pie here shortly
(within a few months), and I'm hoping the intelligent battery life fixes
that Google added (which appear to be working well on Pixel devices)
will translate well to my S8.

I have to wonder: if you're as non-technical as you claim, why would you
want to root your phone in the first place? I'm not questioning your
decision so much as I'm questioning your need. Rooting breaks as much
functionality as it fixes on a S8. For example:

- You will ***VOID YOUR WARRANTY*** if you do this. Samsung uses an
  [[eFUSE](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=2be889&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EFUSE){.external_link
  rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
  onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
  qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container} to indicate whether or
  not you have ever rooted the phone. Rooting your phone will trip the
  eFUSE. You cannot get around this. You cannot reset the eFUSE. If the
  eFUSE is tripped, you cannot get warranty service. Before even
  considering whether or not you will root your phone, it must be out of
  warranty. If you haven't owned it for a year, stop right here. Don't
  throw away your manufacturer warranty.
- You will ***permanently*** be unable to use any Knox-based technology
  (most notably, Samsung Pay), ***even if you unroot your phone in the
  future.*** If that eFUSE is blown, you will be unable to create any
  Knox containers, or access any existing Knox containers. That means
  DATA LOSS if you had data in a Knox container (it's never coming
  back). Samsung Pay secures your credit cards in a Knox container, so
  Samsung Pay will also stop working.
- If you connect to a company network using any sort of Mobile Device
  Management (MDM) platform, your device will no longer be able to
  connect to those networks. Your device will essentially be out of
  compliance.

ALL THAT SAID, if you are here and you still think that rooting your
phone will get you something you totally need and you don't care about
using Samsung Pay or anything related to Knox ever again and you're out
of warranty, the process in CF-auto-root (which you can pick up at
[[firmware.mobi](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=e91612&url=https://desktop.firmware.mobi/){.external_link

and safest available.
