**What should somebody with multiple sclerosis avoid doing?**

In general, you should avoid doing anything which might aggravate your
symptoms. The reason why we talk about "in general" is that everyone's
symptoms are unique, and the triggers that everyone experiences with MS
are also different. Even when you have the same triggers as someone
else, you may experience them to a different degree than someone else.

However, some symptoms are more common than others, and are more
affected by common interactions. The classic example is **going in a hot
tub**.

In fact, before we had modern diagnostic instrumentation, doctors used
to put patients in hot tubs. If their symptoms got worse, and then upon
cooling off after getting out of the hot tub, their symptoms improved,
they had a good idea that what the patient was experiencing was MS.

However, even that is variable among people; not everyone is equally
affected by hot tubs.

Also, a majority of people with MS experience *fatigue*, also known as
"MS lassitude." It's one of the most common symptoms of MS. But even
then, I know my limit as to how much heat I can endure and how much
physical activity I can undertake before I will get too tired to
continue. That particular limit is different for everyone.

To that end, it's difficult to directly answer your question, because
that thing, or that number of things, that "people with MS" should avoid
doing is going to be different for everyone. There isn't one thing that
everyone with MS should avoid doing. It's a very individual thing. You
just have to live your life, experience your symptoms, and learn your
limits. Once you have found your limits, you figure out how to work
around them. For me, during the hot season, it's getting things done
early in the morning, as my energy level tends to taper off in the
evenings faster than everyone else. So if I have a relatively
high-energy project or activity planned, I try to get it done in the
morning or by early afternoon. If I go much more than that, I know I'm
going to start to lose steam.

Hope this helps. Let me know if you still have questions.
