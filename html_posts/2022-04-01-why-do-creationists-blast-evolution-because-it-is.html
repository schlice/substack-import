Let's look at this a different way.

Gravity is universal, right? I mean, you know, with **100%
certainty***,* that gravity works on *every dropped object?*

If you're honest, you say "no, I don't know for 100% certain, but pretty
darn close to 100%."

That's correct. Even gravity, which we're pretty sure works against
every dropped object, isn't 100% certain, because you personally have
not seen every dropped object. That said, we believe gravity is **true
beyond a reasonable doubt**. In fact, the level of uncertainty is so
small, that we sometimes call it the "law" of gravity. But while that
level of uncertainty *approaches* zero, it is never *actually* zero.

That's valid, and everyone agrees with the fact that gravity is true
beyond a reasonable doubt.

Now, let's look at evolution versus creation. Can you say, with 100%
certainty, that we evolved from single-celled organisms (from goo, to
you, through the zoo)? No, if you're honest, you can't say that either.
Neither can you say that the first life was caused by intelligence with
100% certainty.

The evolutionist believes that there is a *greater degree of certainty*
that life evolved from spontaneously generated single-cell life forms.
Similarly, the creationist believes that there is a *greater degree of
certainty* that intelligence formed the first life.

There is indeed evidence on both sides. Evolutionists have *physical*
evidence, which creationists cannot produce, since the creator would
necessarily have to exist outside of the physical. Intellectually
dishonest evolutionists attempt to cut off the argument there; if it's
not material, then it doesn't exist, they say. But even evolutionists
believe that certain things exist which are not material. So they
already believe that materialism is not a valid refutation of
creationism, but that's why we call them intellectually dishonest.

Creationists are sometimes hobbled by their reliance on religious texts
and the circular logic which sometimes surrounds them. Apologetics
attempts to cut through this with true reason and logic, but all too
often, they are so stuck on their dogma that they can't see past it.
Evolutionists are sometimes hobbled by their reliance on materialism
that they pre-load their assumptions of materialism into their
conclusions, which ruins the scientific method because it naturally
rules out some potential causes. In addition, some evolutionists have
formed *volitional* objections to even the idea that some sort of
intelligence could have been involved in the formation of the first
life.

You would need serious creationist apologists not bound to their
religious texts to sit down with open-minded, intellectual evolutionists
who are not bound to the idea of materialism to discover if there is any
understanding which can be gleaned from each other.

In my time, I have discovered that this is a tall order. So the two
sides just blast away at each other's sacred cows, and no one makes any
progress.
