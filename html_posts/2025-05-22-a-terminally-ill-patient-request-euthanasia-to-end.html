The Christian belief in the sanctity of life does not shape the response
to this request at all. The only thing that "shapes" response is the
letter of the law.

If a terminally ill patient requests euthanasia to end their suffering,
a doctor will only be permitted to assist if "medical aid in dying"
(what we used to call "assisted suicide") is legal.

Currently, medical aid in dying is legal in the District of Columbia and
**ten states** (California, Colorado, Delaware, Hawai'i, Maine, Montana,
New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, Vermont, and Washington. Rules vary in
each state, but in general the law allows providers to provide
prescriptions for medications when taken as directed, will painlessly
end the individual's life.

But now that we have the details out of the way, let's discuss the
elephant in the room. There are plenty of Christians who believe in the
sanctity of life who also struggle with the problem of suffering, and it
does not at all make you any less Christian to believe that there is
merit to the idea of minimizing a person's suffering. Those people are
no less Christian than anyone else who calls themselves Christian. You
can still believe in the sanctity of life and feel conflicted at these
edge cases, such as the terminally ill person in continuous pain who
just wants to die with dignity, or the mother who is brain dead but is
being kept alive on a ventilator so that her unborn baby in her womb has
the *potential* to be born at 32 weeks. These are challenging ethical
issues; no one ever said that they are easy.

To be fair, as Christians, we do believe that objective morality exists.
We believe that there are morally right and wrong answers to these
questions, as we believe that there is an unchanging moral standard
established by God. But it doesn't make us any less Christian to
acknowledge the suffering and to desire to minimize it because we love
our neighbor. Also, not every one of us Christians is a world-renowned
Christian philosopher who is able to do the moral math instantly in
their heads and always produce the "morally correct" answer.

In fact, I think that our propensity to struggle with issues like this
shows that we are human. It makes us far more relatable and reasonable
to those who support medical aid in dying than trying to twist ourselves
into knots to avoid giving up an inch of ground on the ethical part
versus the legal part.

In other words, we can simultaneously hold the view that all life is
sacred and it is still wrong to take that life before God decides to do
so, while at the same time having empathy and compassion for the person
involved and desire to minimize their suffering.

These horrific edge cases matter, and deserve to be discussed, but they
shouldn't keep Christians from working together to end medical
assistance in dying.
