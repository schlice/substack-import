**If I own the building where I work and I am fired, can I legally evict
my employer for that reason?**

If the lease you signed (as the building owner) contains a clause which
states that you can evict your tenant if they fire you, then you can.

You can evict a tenant for violating a term of the lease. If you can
show the court a provision of the lease they violated, you can begin
eviction proceedings.

If not, then perhaps you simply won't lease to them again once their
current lease is up. You are under no obligation to *renew* their lease,
but if they haven't otherwise violated the lease by firing you, you
can't evict them.

Note that this is general information; there may be specific laws where
you live which govern leases and it may be different, and of course, if
you have specific legal questions, you should always consult with an
attorney in your area.
