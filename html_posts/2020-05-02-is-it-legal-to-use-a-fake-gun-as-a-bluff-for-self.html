**Is it legal to use a fake gun as a bluff for self-defense?**

This is a great question, because it is far more legally nuanced than
you might think.

The TL;DR version: **fake guns are treated just like real guns as far as
the laws you are subject to are concerned.**

First, let's define the environment we are discussing. We are talking
about guns that *look* like real guns, but are not. They may even be
made by the gun manufacturer, using the same materials as the real gun,
and actually respond and feel like the real gun, but lack certain key
components (like a firing pin) and lack the ability to have the
component added (the slot for the firing pin isn't even milled out) and
so while they can even accept a real bullet, they simply cannot fire.

(EDIT) Since I was specifically asked, this *also* includes BB guns,
Airsoft guns, electronic kinetic energy BB guns, and any other
non-firearm (a firearm uses a black powder charge to propel a bullet)
**designed to look and feel identical to a firearm.** If your Airsoft
gun is electric blue with the required blaze orange tip, it is not
designed to look and feel identical to a firearm. But if you can't
immediately tell that it is not a firearm within a second of looking at
it, it is classified as a *replica* or *imitation* firearm.

Let's say you were carrying one of these bad boys for some reason (we'll
talk about why this is a terrible idea in a minute). In most states, you
can carry one of these, but some states do prohibit them like actual
firearms.

*Could you lawfully use that fake gun and point it at someone to defend
yourself?* Of course you can. However, the legal consequences are
*exactly the same* as if you pointed a real gun at someone.

As far as "brandishing a firearm," most states have brandishing laws
which include "replica" or "imitation" firearms, so you're subject to
the same penalties for brandishing a fake gun as you are for brandishing
a real gun.

Pointing any gun (real, fake, BB, whatever, so long as it looks real) at
someone is a crime called "assault." The only difference is that in some
states, you may not be charged with the more severe "assault with a
deadly weapon," although some states do include replica or imitation
firearms in their "deadly weapon" laws. If the state has "assault with a
firearm" statutes, usually replica and imitation guns (designed to look
and feel real) are included, so you would be subject to those.

In other words, **if you're going to point a** ***fake*** **(yet
real-looking) gun at someone, you must meet all the same legal criteria
for being a person who would point a** ***real*** **gun at someone.** In
other words, you must be in fear for your life in order to defend
against the assault and brandishing charges we listed above.

So can you see why doing this would be an *extra-bad idea?*

You have all the intention to use a gun, and you have (hopefully) met
all the legal requirements to be in a condition in which you *can* use a
gun, but you have a non-functional gun. You have all the *intention*,
all the *motivation*, but none of the *ability.* If you actually
*needed* to use a gun at that very point (which would be the only legal
way in which you could brandish or point that gun), you would not be
able to do so.

(EDIT) Here's another reason why this is a bad idea. If you point your
fake gun at someone, that someone has been legally threatened by what he
reasonably perceives to be deadly force. That person can use ***real***
deadly force to counter such a threat. In other words, if you point a
fake gun at someone who has a real gun (either an armed civilian or law
enforcement), they can ***legally*** use that real gun in response. This
is why cops don't get convicted of murder when they kill kids who point
fake guns at them.

My advice: if you've gotten yourself to the point where you feel like
you need to carry a fake gun to defend yourself, it's time to get over
the hurdle and get a real gun and some concealed weapons training and
your permit.
