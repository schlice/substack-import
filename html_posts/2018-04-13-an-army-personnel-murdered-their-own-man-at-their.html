**An army personnel murdered their own man at their camp. Can the police
arrest them and persecute them in civilian court?**

Let's assume for the sake of the question that you are referring to an
army post on US soil.

The answer is **yes**, the police can arrest the murderer, and the city
or county can try him in the civilian court.

This is because the vast majority of military bases are *concurrent
jurisdiction*, where both the local police or sheriff's office
(depending on ownership of the land) and the military have jurisdiction.
There are some exceptions, where the base may be on Federal land, but
the majority of US military installations are on state-owned land.

However, they usually do not. Usually, they allow the military to retain
jurisdiction and prosecute the offender, assuming (as your question
presupposes) that the incident took place on the post.

You'll note that when the military prosecutes the offender, and he
serves his time and is released, the civilian authority can then arrest
the offender and try him *again* in civilian court and send him to
civilian prison, and this is one of the chief exceptions to the Fifth
Amendment protections against "double jeopardy." This would be a very
rare occurrence, and would generally only happen in cases where it was a
very high profile murder on post, or where general opinion was that
justice was not served through the UCMJ.
