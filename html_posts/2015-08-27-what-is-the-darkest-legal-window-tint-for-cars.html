**Content:** [It depends on the state that you register your car in, as
each state\'s rules vary on how much tint you are allowed to have.
Darkness of tint is measured by VLT (visible light transmission).\
\
In Colorado, all windows must be higher than 27% VLT except the front
windshield, which only allows non-reflective tint on the top 4\" of
window. Also, the tint colors of red and amber are illegal. If you have
tint on your rear window, you must also have two functioning side-view
mirrors.\
