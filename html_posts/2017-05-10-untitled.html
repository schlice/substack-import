Awesome comments, thanks for adding them.

I tend to follow the Mike Rowe School of Trades:

I don't think that any one thing is a panacea in and of itself. But to
vaunt one and denigrate the other is a recipe for disaster, and the
Bureau of Labor Statistics numbers which show three million unfilled
trades jobs (yes, some of which are in unions, which unfairly skew the
numbers).

We need to encourage high school students to pursue whatever will make
them happy. If that's a trade, great! If that's a four-year degree,
great! But the "college prep" trend which has eschewed the trades as
"less than" and has helped to create this problem is worrisome, to say
the least.

And I have to say, I love the community colleges. We have done another
smashing job painting *them* as "less than" as well, in favor of the
four-year universities. That needs to change as well.
