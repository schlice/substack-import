**Is intentionally giving someone the Coronavirus attempted murder?**

While cases are currently rare concerning COVID-19, we can use
intentional spread of existing viruses and infections in order to
determine what might happen to you if you know you are infected and you
intentionally put others at risk.

For example, here in Florida, if you have been diagnosed with an STI
(sexually transmitted infection) and you knowingly engage in sexual
relations with someone else without informing them of your infection,
you could be convicted of a crime (criminal transmission of an STI) if
that person becomes infected.

It's not a stretch to see that the same legal principles could be
applied to someone who knows they are COVID-19 positive and attempts to
spread (or succeeds in spreading) the infection with intent to infect
others.

In Texas, an 18 year old woman was arrested and charged with making a
terroristic threat when she claimed on Snapchat that she was COVID-19
positive and was spreading it on purpose. This just occurred the week of
April 6 of this year.

So, to the question, is it possible that intentionally spreading
COVID-19 could be considered attempted murder?

**If someone knowingly and purposefully infected someone else with the
knowledge and intention to cause death, then charges of attempted murder
are not outside the realm of possibility.**

In most cases under most state's laws, COVID-19 would likely fall into
the same category as STIs other than HIV, since it is not a lifelong
illness. Experts suspect that if criminal charges were to be imposed for
knowingly, purposefully or recklessly exposing people to coronavirus,
those charges would likely be categorized as a first-degree
misdemeanor.[\[1\]](#UOEwp){#cite-UOEwp .citation_link} Here in Florida,
conviction of a first-degree misdemeanor brings punishments of up to one
year in jail, and fines up to \$1,000.
