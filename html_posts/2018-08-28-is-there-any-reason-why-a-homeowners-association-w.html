**Is there any reason why a homeowners association would react
negatively to a homeowner with bee hives in their backyard?**

There are several reasons why an HOA would react negatively to a
homeowner maintaining an apiary (bee hives) in their backyard.

In all cases, you must check your Governing Documents to see exactly
what issues your HOA may have with apiaries. All Governing Documents are
specific, and none are exactly the same. I can't tell you specifically
what your HOA may be concerned with, but it may be one or more of the
following:

1.  The bees may be prohibited under the "pets" category of the HOA
    Rules and Regulations. In that case, the R&R may specify what pets
    you are allowed to keep, and what pets are not. In general, where
    pets are limited, they are limited to "common" household pets (dogs,
    cats, birds, etc). "Exotic" or otherwise uncommon pets are generally
    prohibited.
2.  Also common in HOA R&Rs: "nuisance" rules. Anything which may
    constitute a "nuisance" is generally prohibited.
3.  The apiary may be covered as a "business" you run out of your home.
    While generally allowed, the business cannot cause things like
    increased vehicle traffic in the neighborhood, or other nuisances.
    An inordinate amount of bees in the neighborhood might be considered
    a nuisance caused by your business, which might give them pause.
4.  Allergies are a big deal these days. For the safety of neighborhood
    children, the HOA may restrict your apiary so that they can mediate
    the increased risk of bee stings by not artificially increasing the
    number of bees in the neighborhood.

In addition to reviewing your Governing Documents, I would suggest
getting in contact with the Board and pre-approving your apiary before
starting it. If they do allow it, there may be other pre-requisites they
have (i.e. getting industry certifications before starting, etc).
