**Content:** [The short answer is: you can\'t.\
\
In any system as large as the US Justice System, there will always be a
small percentage of people who are falsely accused, and there will
always be a similarly small percentage of people who are actually
guilty, but who get to go free.\
\
No system of justice is perfect, and until our crystal balls arrive from
[[Amazon](https://www.quora.com/topic/Amazon-company)]{.qlink_container}
(mine\'s on backorder), we can\'t predict the future, nor can we see
into the mind of a person. We can only do our utmost to make the system
as fair and impartial as possible. We believe we have done this. There
is always room for improvement, and as we find injustice in the system,
we attempt to work it out. Over 200 years of experience have shown us
what works and what doesn\'t, and we have made tweaks along the
way.]{.rendered_qtext}
