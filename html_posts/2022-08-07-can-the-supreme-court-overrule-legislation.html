In a way, yes.

The Supreme Court's job is to determine ***Constitutionality*** of laws.
So if a law is passed, but that law violates the Constitution, the
Supreme Court can **invalidate** that law.

This is part of our system of **checks and balances** in our system of
government:

See that blue line on the far right: "declare laws unconstitutional"?
That's the one where the Supreme Court places a "check" on the power of
the legislature: they can't pass laws that are unconstitutional.
