You can file a Freedom Of Information Act (FOIA) request with the
department for 911 transcripts. Contact the main number at the
department in question and ask to speak to the FOIA Officer. They will
provide you with the procedure to make your FOIA request. You may also
get the same information (i.e. how to submit a FOIA request) from the
department's website, but if you can't find it, go ahead and call them.

Be aware, however, that depending on your reason for making the request,
the contents of the conversation may be privileged information (i.e. you
are unrelated to the subjects in the call, you are not using it for
media purposes, etc), and may not be releasable. Also, if there are
still open investigations related to the information on those
recordings, they also may not be releasable.

I assume by "audio call" you are referring to recordings or transcripts
of the radio calls made between the dispatcher and the officers. These
days, those communications may be a bit thin for any one particular
incident. Most communications and dispatches go over MDT (mobile data
terminal), and not over voice radio. You may not be able to get that
information, either.

If you are the subject and your investigation is still ongoing, contact
the investigating officer and make your request. Feel free to go up the
chain if you don't get the information you need.

If you're involved in a legal matter (i.e. a lawsuit), your lawyer will
subpoena the information during the discovery phase of the trial.
