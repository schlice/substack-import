**Are there any cases where a woman was charged with neglect for
specifically refusing to breastfeed a baby?**

No. Examples of physical neglect are when a child is not fed repeatedly
or for a long period, adequate health care is not provided by the
parents, the child does not have appropriate clothing and footwear, or
even when parents drive intoxicated with a drug or substance that
endangers the child\'s safety. [\[1\]](#tBhny){#cite-tBhny
.citation_link}

Nothing in the neglect standard *requires* a child to be breastfed.
While breastfeeding within the first two years of life is *encouraged*
due to its positive influence on both mother and
child,[\[2\]](#Ynavy){#cite-Ynavy .citation_link} it is not *required*
to breastfeed a child.

In order to not be neglectful, you simply must *feed* the child. Infant
formula is plentiful, easily accessible, and provides a nutritionally
complete substitute for breast milk.
