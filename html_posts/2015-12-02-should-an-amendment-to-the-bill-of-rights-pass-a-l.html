**Content:** [No, a right does not have to apply to any other right in
order to be passed. An amendment to the Constitution (we won\'t actually
amend the Bill of Rights, since that is simply the first 10 amendments
to the Constitution) stands or falls on its own. There should be no
requirement that it be applicable to any other right already granted by
the Constitution.\
\
The OP then added the following question details:\
*In my view changing the Bill of Rights is a very big deal and should be
done with great care. I have been thinking that a litmus test can be
applied to see if public opinion would support a change to the Bill of
rights if you could apply the basic change to all rights. This is just a
thought, I would enjoy reading good discussions on this idea.*\
\
Perhaps you are unclear on how the Constitution is amended.\
\
In order to amend the Constitution, first someone has to write an
amendment. The amendment can either alter the understanding of an
existing amendment, or propose a new rule altogether. There are two
methods by which an amendment can be proposed:\
]{.rendered_qtext}

1.  Congress can write the amendment. The amendment will have to pass
    both houses of Congress with a 2/3 majority (a supermajority, as
    opposed to \"more than half,\" which is a simple majority).
2.  2/3 of the states, or 34 states, can ratify a *Constitutional
    Convention* whereby they can propose an amendment to the
    Constitution, which can then be submitted to Congress to pass the
    process as listed in Step 1. In the entire history of amendments to
    the Constitution (17 times), the Constitutional Convention has never
    been used.

Once the amendment is approved by 2/3 majority in Congress, it is added
to the Constitution when it is *ratified* by 3/4ths of the states (38
states). This means that all states will have to have statewide voting
to determine whether or not that state will vote to ratify that
amendment. It is likely that states will use a simple majority of state
voters to determine whether or not they will support or reject
ratification of an amendment.\
\
People will all have an opportunity to vote on a proposed amendment.
Their mental machinations to determine whether or not they *should* vote
for or against a particular amendment were never made into law, nor
should they be. How people believe about one particular issue is a
fundamental right of the voter.\
\
That said, I understand what you\'re getting at. Unfortunately, when the
voting rules were originally put into place, the Founders believed that
voters would be *intelligent.* They believed that voters would be
well-schooled on Constitutional issues and fully understand what it was
they were voting for. All too often, however, voters are uninformed,
usually getting their opinions from the particular talking heads on the
little black screen in their living rooms. The colloquial term for these
people is *low-information voters.* Since, by law, you cannot deny any
US citizen the right to vote, there can be no intelligence test to
ensure that people possess a minimum fundamental understanding of an
issue before they vote on it. Therefore, you get what you get. Make sure
if you\'re going to push a Constitutional amendment, your biggest
department in your campaign headquarters is your PR department.
