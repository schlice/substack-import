**Will bringing back mental institutions like President Trump fix some
of the issues going on with the violence?**

It's a start.

But it needs to happen within the framework of a broader improvement
with how we handle mental illness in this country.

The push for deinstitutionalization was not centrally about closing
mental hospitals (although that was the hook they used to get people to
buy in to it). The push for deinstitutionalization was a belief that
*drugs can solve all mental problems*. Politicians along with
pharmaceutical manufacturers (gee, where have I heard *that* song
before) convinced people that mental institutions were no longer needed.
We could treat the vast majority of the mentally ill with drugs,
distributed in neighborhood clinics, not from large, cold mental
hospitals which are understaffed and abuse their charges.

This led to more than just deinstitutionalization. It led to a
de-emphasis on, and a stigmatization of, mental illness as a real issue.
It's just something you can pop a pill and manage; it's not a real
issue.

We need to re-focus on mental illness. We need continuing funding into
mental illness and how these medications actually work. There is much we
do not know, and yet we continue to "throw drugs" at the problem. Many
need help, but the nature of mental illness is such that it causes the
patient to believe that they are perfectly normal. Under our current
system, a person who really needs help can deny that help; they can't be
compelled to seek treatment unless they first bump into the legal system
and are declared "mentally defective." And yes, we do need vastly
improved facilities for mental illness treatment,
