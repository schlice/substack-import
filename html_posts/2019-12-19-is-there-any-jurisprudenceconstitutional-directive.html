**Is there any jurisprudence/constitutional directive allowing the
Speaker of the House to delay articles of impeachment from the Senate?**

No. This is completely without precedent.

The Constitution is silent on the matter of how quickly Articles of
Impeachment should be delivered from the House to the Senate.

We're in completely uncharted territory here.
