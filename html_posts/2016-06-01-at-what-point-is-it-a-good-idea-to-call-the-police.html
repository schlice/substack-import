***At what point is it a good idea to call the police and tell them the
license plate number of a reckless driver on the road?***

As soon as you feel that the reckless driver could be a danger to other
drivers on the road. I imagine that would be as soon as you recognize
that the driver is "reckless," since the very definition of reckless
driving means creating conditions which are dangerous to other drivers.

You will have to tell them some other things as well:

- Your location, what road, what direction, and what mile marker you are
  at
- Whether or not you will sign a formal charge against the driver. The
  police cannot press charges without observing the infraction
  themselves. The witness would have to be willing to sign the
  complaint, which potentially means testifying in court as to what you
  saw.
- Your real name, your real phone number, and (later) your real address.

In Colorado, we have "Safety Enforcement Zones" set up by the State
Patrol where citizens can call a special number from their mobile phones
to report reckless or dangerous drivers.

We have one on I-25, just north of my city. I've used it one time.
Worked exactly as advertised.
