**Are police officers legally allowed to lie when you ask them if
they\'re a cop? Does this rule change in undercover situations?**

This question comes up frequently, but I can't seem to find the old
questions. So let me just quickly answer:

1.  Police are allowed to lie to you. You are allowed to lie to the
    police (unless you're talking to a Federal agent, where lying to
    them is a crime, or if you're lying to aid a criminal). Police are
    under no legal obligation to tell you the truth.
2.  Since police are legally allowed to lie, they are under no
    obligation to tell you they're undercover if they're undercover.
