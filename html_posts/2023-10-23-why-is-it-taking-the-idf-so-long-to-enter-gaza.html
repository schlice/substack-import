In case you were unaware, the bulk of the IDF is *reservists.*

As you know, Israel has *compulsory military service* for two years.
After this, you can transition into the Reserves until you are in your
mid-40s, I believe.

So in order to create this army of over 300,000 troops to invade Gaza,
**the bulk of these people needed to be recalled to active duty.**

This involves ***a lot of work***. They have to be fitted with uniforms,
issued weapons, re-certified on those weapons, the weapons themselves
need to be zeroed, and the newly-reactivated troops need to be issued
everything they need to sustain them in a ground assault, along with
training them on the current situation on the ground and their
engagement plans.

This does not happen overnight. They are indeed moving at breakneck
speed, but again, it is not an instantaneous call-up for the bulk of the
military.

(EDIT) They are also dealing with differing attitudes across the
population. Israelis generally either want to move slowly and
cautiously, or they want to get in to Gaza and finish the job. Really
not easy to navigate.
