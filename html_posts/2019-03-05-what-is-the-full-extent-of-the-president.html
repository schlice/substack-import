**What is the full extent of the president\'s authority when executive
emergency powers are in place?**

It depends.

[[A prior Senate
investigation](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=9092ad&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senate_Report_93-549){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container} had found 470 provisions
of federal law that a President might invoke via a declaration of
emergency. Each one of those provisions of law could activate one of 136
distinct statutory emergency powers which were delegated to the
President.

They don't all become available at one time. You declare a provision of
Federal law that you are invoking, which, along with it, comes a
distinct statutory emergency power.
