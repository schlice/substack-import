<h2>Answer Comment</h2>

**Content:** [The argument you\'re trying to make is that it\'s okay for
an ethically driven pharmacist to dispense Plan B because it\'s not an
abortifactent. So following that line of reasoning, it would be okay for
that pharmacist to dispense Plan B, but not RU-486, which there is no
controversy over; it is absolutely an abortifactent. And the science
still isn\'t settled about whether or not Plan B can prevent an egg from
implanting, so I think the religiously motivated pharmacist may still
have problems with Plan B.\
\
*Honestly, refusing to sell a product that you stock is completely
asinine*\
\
I already said that. Since pharmacists control their own inventories,
someone who stocks something he won\'t sell is an idiot. We ignore the
idiots in reasoned discussion.\
\
*and is entirely harmful in this case to the group you are preventing
access to. It\'s tantamount to theft combined with reckless
endangerment. Pregnancies are dangerous and risky.*\
\
I guarantee you that the VAST majority of people who want the pill want
it not because they are going to DIE, but because the DON\'T WANT A
BABY. And for those with high-risk pregnancies, they\'ll spend their
time in a hospital until their baby is born, or it will be medically
aborted for them, in an \"it\'s either you or the baby\" scenario, which
is not the type of elective abortion we are talking about. AND for those
who are prone to high-risk pregnancy, sex therefore constitutes a
high-risk activity, which they knowingly consent to. To do so without
proper birth control constitutes an even higher-risk activity.\
\
*They\'re expensive. Child rearing is as well. By preventing this access
the site and pharmacist should be responsible for damages.*\
\
No more so than the car dealer can be responsible for the car accident
in which you get yourself into. Good try, though.\
\
A child does not produce \"damages.\" You can\'t equate getting pregnant
to having a fire in your house; THAT is the truly asinine
point.]{.rendered_qtext}
