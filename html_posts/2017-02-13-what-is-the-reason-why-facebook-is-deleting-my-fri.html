Short answer: **Facebook does not delete your friends.**

Longer answer: There are a number of reasons why friends may be missing
from your friend list, and most of them are not nefarious or suspicious.

1.  **You may have been unfriended, or you may have unintentionally
    unfriended someone.** When someone unfriends you, you are not
    notified. The friend simply is removed from your list. You may have
    actually unfriended the person. This can happen unintentionally when
    you remove other friends.
2.  **The friend's account may have been deleted.** If the friend
    deleted his or her account, it will also similarly disappear from
    your friend list. You can search for the friend, but if you get
    nothing in search, the account is either gone or the new account has
    its privacy settings set so that it cannot be found in search.
3.  **Your account may have been compromised.** Facebook says that if a
    large number of your friends are missing, your account has likely
    been compromised. At the very least, you should immediately change
    your Facebook password. For better security, consider using
    **two-factor authentication** either with an authenticator app,
    using SMS, or using the Facebook Authenticator, which is part of the
    mobile app. You can find these settings under *Security* from
    Facebook's settings. Never give out your Facebook password and
    always ensure you are logging in to Facebook\'s main page,
    [[www.facebook.com](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=58131e&url=http://www.facebook.com){.external_link
    rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
    onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
    qt-tooltip="facebook.com"}]{.qlink_container}, to avoid unknowingly
    logging in to a scam website. Don't follow links to Facebook; log in
    yourself and then find what you are looking for. If you are using a
    public computer (such as in an internet cafe or at the library),
    make sure you use "incognito mode" or the "private browsing"
    function (if the browser offers it) so that none of your history is
    saved on the local system, and make sure you log off at the end of
    your session.

But let's assume that none of the above are true, and a friend simply
disappeared from your friend list. Is it true that "Facebook deleted
your friend?" This implies intent on Facebook's part to willfully remove
that friend from your friend list, and with the volume of Facebook
users, it's highly unlikely that they went into your friend list and
flicked a few names off. If none of the other reasons listed fit your
scenario, it's quite possible that there is a bug in Facebook's friend
system that removes friends with no intervention on your part. It would
be worth a call to Facebook Technical Support in such a case.

**TL;DR: It's far more likely that it is a software glitch in Facebook's
software causing your friends to be automatically unfriended than any
malicious intent on Facebook's part.**
