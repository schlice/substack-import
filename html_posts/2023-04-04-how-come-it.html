*How come* it is a sin?

First off, that's like saying, *how come* it's illegal to not drive
through a red light? I mean, there's no cars around, I'm not hurting
anyone, so how come it's illegal?

The answer is **because it is.** You didn't make the law, but you are
bound by the law.

The Bible is the same way. *It is a sin because God said it is a sin*.
God made humans male and female. He made males in male bodies and
females in female bodies. God made males to be attracted to females, to
bond in marriage, and produce children in those marriages. Period. God
did not make males to be sexually attracted to males, and females to be
sexually attracted to females. Doing so violates the natural order that
He created, so it doesn't make sense that He would create people to have
same-sex attractions. It was the introduction of sin into the world
which altered the human condition and introduced these thoughts, not
God. So if you want to blame someone, don't blame God, blame Adam and
Eve. They brought sin into the world, which introduced the possibility
for people to have same-sex attractions.

The Bible is replete with admonitions against homosexual behavior (all
quotes from NIV):

> Do not have sexual relations with a man as one does with a woman; that
> is detestable. --- Leviticus 18:22
>
> If a man has sexual relations with a man as one does with a woman,
> both of them have done what is detestable. They are to be put to
> death; their blood will be on their own heads. --- Leviticus 20:13 ยน
>
> Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their
> women exchanged natural sexual relations for unnatural ones. In the
> same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were
> inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed shameful acts with
> other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their error.
> --- Romans 1:26--27
>
> Or do you not know that wrongdoers will not inherit the kingdom of
> God? Do not be deceived: Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters
> nor adulterers nor men who have sex with men nor thieves nor the
> greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the
> kingdom of God. --- 1 Corinthians 6:9-10
>
> We also know that the law is made not for the righteous but for
> lawbreakers and rebels, the ungodly and sinful, the unholy and
> irreligious, for those who kill their fathers or mothers, for
> murderers, for the sexually immoral, for those practicing
> homosexuality, for slave traders and liars and perjurers---and for
> whatever else is contrary to the sound doctrine --- 1 Timothy 1:9-10

These passages are so clear that they defy reinterpretation. It's
intellectually dishonest to claim that Christians are misinterpreting
the Bible because of some prejudice against homosexuals.

But let's also be clear: while homosexual *temptation* is not a sin,
*continuing* the temptation into lustful thoughts or actions ***is
sinful***. Temptations are exactly that. Allowing your mind to continue
the thought is where the sin takes place.

I must now address the statement about "we're all human and God loves
all of us." This is absolutely true, but think about it. If you're a car
thief, does your mother still love you? Of course she does. But she also
doesn't want you boosting cars. She can love you *while still rejecting
your illegal behaviors.* So the fact that God loves us as a parent loves
a child in no way means that God will excuse sin. This is the source of
the oft-repeated, more-oft-misunderstood phrase, "love the sinner, hate
the sin." Christians do, in fact, love homosexuals, just as they love
adulterers, people who watch porn, and people who stole trading cards
from the neighborhood candy store as a kid (oops, got a little too
personal there). This in no way means that we excuse homosexuality,
adultery, pornography, or petit theft. We confront those sins, just as
we do for any sin, and we plead with the sinner to repent of their sin
and to get right with God. We don't *reject* them because of their sin.
**We** ***love them through their sin.***

We are *all* sinners. We have *all* fallen short of the glory of God.
"As it is written: "There is no one righteous, not even one" (Romans
3:10 NIV). It doesn't matter what our sin is, we are all guilty of sin:
in our thoughts and in our words, in what we have done and what we have
failed to do. We are all sinners. We all deserve hell.

But we are *saved* through the sanctifying blood of Jesus Christ, who
sacrificed himself as a ransom for many. His shed blood washes us clean.

All we need to do is **repent** and **believe**. Repentance is a
*turning away* from sin. Think of doing a 180 and spinning on your heel
and going the other way. That's repentance. It's acknowledging our
sinfulness and a commitment to *sin no more*. Jesus said it every time
He forgave sin: "Go and sin no more." Belief means giving your life to
Jesus, acknowledging that it is only through His sacrifice that we are
saved, and accepting Christ as your personal Lord and Savior.

\

*ยน Remember the context: the book of Leviticus details God's commands
for the Jews, who had literally been slaves for generations and had no
idea how to live in community with each other without some form of
overlord controlling their lives.* ***We do not believe today that
homosexuals should be killed.*** *While homosexuality is a sin, we do
not kill people for committing sins. The rules were different back then.
Jesus literally fulfilled the law so the old law no longer applies.*
