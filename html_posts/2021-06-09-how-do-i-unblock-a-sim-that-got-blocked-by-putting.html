It's unlikely that your SIM was blocked by putting it into another
phone. It's much more likely that the phone you put the SIM into does
not accept the SIM from your carrier.

If, however, your SIM was indeed blocked, you will need to contact the
Customer Service department for your carrier to have it unblocked. There
is no other way to unlock a SIM, as it is the carrier which controls
access to its network through that SIM.

If the phone you put the SIM into is locked to one type of carrier, you
may need to unlock the phone to work on your carrier. When the phone
hasn't been paid completely, carriers will lock the phone to their
network. You can pay a fee to a third-party company to unlock your
phone, or you can wait until the phone is completely paid off, and the
carrier will unlock it for you.
