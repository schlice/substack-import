So the whole idea of this is utterly silly.

First, there is no "possible SCOTUS ruling outlawing gay marriage."
Maybe you're unaware of how the Supreme Court works, but first there
would have to be a law, and someone would have to break that law, and
then that someone would have to challenge the precedent in *Lawrence* or
in *Obergefell*, and that challenge would have to make it all the way to
the Supreme Court.

Justice Clarence Thomas wrote, in his *lone concurrence* on *Dobbs*.
that other substantive due process cases, like *Lawrence* and
*Obergefell*, should be reviewed if they come up. Notice that *no other
Justice joined him in his concurrence*. The idea of reviewing *Lawrence*
and *Obergefell* is even unpopular among the Justices. You'd need four
Justices to even agree to review a case challenging *Lawrence* or
*Obergefell*, and it's unlikely you'd be able to find four Justices that
are even interested in doing so.

Therefore, it's extremely unlikely that a case would ever make it to
SCOTUS to even challenge *Lawrence* or *Obergefell.*

However, somehow, the House saw this as a crisis. They found it
necessary to pass the Respect for Marriage Act. This bill would repeal
the Defense of Marriage Act, portions of which have already been
overturned by the *Lawrence* and *Obergefell* courts. The 267--157 vote
in the House paves the way to enshrine gay marriage in Federal law.

Except for the fact that this law is unnecessary. There is no threat to
gay marriage. This is nothing more than Democrats searching for a wedge
issue during a time when they are so utterly down in the polls and
Biden's approval numbers, and facing a red wave in November.

Some House Republicans labeled this bill as "a solution looking for a
problem." Rep. Mike Johnson, R-La., went further by calling the
legislation an election-year gimmick meant to give Democrats a wedge
issue in face of skyrocketing inflation and President Biden\'s low
approval numbers. \"There\'s not a single Republican even talking about
that or any of these other categories in the law,\" said Johnson, who
serves as vice chairman the House Republican Conference. \"This is
designed to divide the country. This bill is a shameful effort.\"

Additionally, this law would remove the rights of the states to decide
anything about marriage for themselves. And 35 states have already done
so. \"This legislation would reverse the law in 35 states,\" said Rep.
Jim Jordan, R-Ohio. \"In 30 of those 35 states, the people of those
respective states went to the ballot and voted for that .... it would
undo what the people \[wanted\].\"

The bill now heads to the 50--50 Senate, where they currently do not
have the 10 votes they need to overcome the expected filibuster. So
unless something radically changes, this bill is DOA in the Senate.

This bill has virtually no chance of becoming law, but Democrats aren't
concerned about it passing. They're concerned about using it as a wedge
issue during a time when they really don't have much to campaign on.

Original question:

Ahead of a possible SCOTUS ruling outlawing gay marriage, over 150 House
Republicans voted to not protect it. Does this vote reflect the opinion
of a majority of Americans?
