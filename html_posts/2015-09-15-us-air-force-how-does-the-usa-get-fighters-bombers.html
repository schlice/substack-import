**Content:** [For most normal operations, [[Mike
Holovacs](https://www.quora.com/profile/Mike-Holovacs)
]{.qlink_container}is spot on: they fly them there and stop off along
the way, or \"tank up\" while in flight. They will place mid-air
refueling aircraft (i.e. KC-135 or KC-10) on \"orbit\" (flying a roughly
oval pattern in the sky) in strategic locations along the way, allowing
aircrews to stop off and \"get gas\" while in flight.\
\
In certain situations, some aircraft can be loaded in C-17 or C-5 cargo
haulers and be flown directly to their destination, but it is far more
common to simply fly the aircraft directly there.\
\
Also, some aircraft can be fitted with external wing-mounted fuel tanks
to carry extra fuel for long-distance flights.]{.rendered_qtext}
