I understand you're 12, but you came on to Quora to ask a serious
question, so I'm going to give you a serious answer. Understand that
when someone gives you a serious answer, you may not be comfortable with
that answer. You may not even like what I'm about to tell you. **But
it's super important that you listen to it, and if at all possible, do
what it is that I will be asking you to do.**

Ready? Okay, here goes:

**You are not suicidal.** You probably already knew that, but you
probably also needed to hear it. You also said "I sometimes self-harm."
People who self-harm often do it because they want to avoid those
feelings that make you want to commit suicide.

So self-harm is what we would call "a cry for help." It means *I am
trying my very best to avoid suicide or suicidal thoughts, so I
sometimes self-harm.*

Now, what to do about it?

**Get help. Please.**

But don't talk to a teacher. Not because teachers are bad, but because
it's not a teacher's job to help you with this kind of thing. Your
teacher equating self-harm with suicide is exactly the problem that I'm
talking about. In most cases, people who self-harm are actively trying
to deal with the feelings that ***could*** lead to suicidal thoughts,
and the way they accomplish that is
self-harm.[\[1\]](#UPYEu){#cite-UPYEu .citation_link}

The point is: **self-harm is not suicide, but it may** ***become***
**suicide.**

Please talk to a counselor. At your school, you can talk to a counselor
if you have one. You can also talk to the school nurse. If you have
access to your primary care doctor, you can talk to that person as well.
You can also reach out to any of the resources listed in the box on this
page titled "**There is Help**" if you can't talk to a counselor or your
school nurse or your doctor.

But **please, please talk to someone like that who can help you.**

Okay?

Original question:

**I\'m 12 and a teacher accused me of being suicidal just because I have
scratches on my face, arms, and legs. I sometimes self-harm but most of
my scratches are from my 4 kittens. What do I do?**
