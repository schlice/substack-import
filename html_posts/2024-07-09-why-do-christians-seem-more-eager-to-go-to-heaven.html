False dilemma fallacy.

Your question phrases it as ***either*** we angle towards Heaven,
***or*** we focus on improving life on Earth.

¿Por qué no los dos?

It's not *either/or*. It's *both/and*. Christians are ***both*** angling
towards Heaven ***and*** focusing on improving life on Earth. It
certainly doesn't have to be one or the other.

And actually, if you can properly prepare to go to heaven by being a
witness for Christ and by leading others to salvation, it will
automatically make their lives better. So actually, doing the more
important one secondarily causes the less important one to happen all on
its own.

Which would make sense given what you're describing: it appears that
Christians are more worried about eternity than the present. If you give
your life to Christ, your present circumstances will be easier to deal
with because you'll have a whole new perspective. If you don't follow
Christ, then nothing appears to get better here. This is probably why
there is an appearance that Christians care less about this life than
the next.
