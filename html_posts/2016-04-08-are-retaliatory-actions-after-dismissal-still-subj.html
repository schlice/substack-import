First of all, there is little information to go on, but let\'s try to
dissect this clearly hypothetical example, because if this was about a
real person and someone\'s real legal trouble, we wouldn\'t be able to
answer it under Quora\'s TOS.

*Employee dismissed in 2013 after reporting ethics issues,*

So employee was dismissed as reprisal for reporting ethics issues.
Reprisal should also be unlawful under the company\'s policies, and
employee should be able to sue the company for reprisal and get lost
wages and other compensation

*however retaliation continued for the next 2.5 years.*

How does retaliation continue for 2.5 years after an employee is
terminated? Were there harassing phone calls, or did the company have
reason to contact the employee? Were there letters mailed, or did the
company have reason to reach out to the former employee via postal mail?
The employee can sue the company separately for this retaliation, since
he is no longer an employee and should therefore have no reason to
interact with the former company. If the company reasonably believed
there was cause to contact the employee, then there is legitimate reason
for attempted contact to continue. You would have to show clear
malicious intent for a retaliation claim to be substantiated.

The statements about whether or not arbitration is still required is a
point of fact to be determined by a judge. If the judge finds that the
2011 agreement is a continuation of the 2009 agreement, then both are
still in force. If the judge finds that the 2011 agreement is a
*wholesale replacement* of the 2009 agreement, then litigation will be
allowed. There will have to be a determination hearing to find out if
arbitration is required or not.
