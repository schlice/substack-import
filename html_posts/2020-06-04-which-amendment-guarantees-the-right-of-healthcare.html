**Which amendment guarantees the right of healthcare?**

The Constitution does not guarantee the right to healthcare.

Healthcare is a *service*. Guaranteeing a right to healthcare means that
doctors become *indentured servants*. Why? If healthcare is a right,
then no one can deny you access to it for any reason, even if you cannot
pay. That means you never have to pay for healthcare ever, since you
cannot be forced to pay to access a right. Where do you have to pay to
get the right to free speech? Where do you have to pay to get the right
to keep soldiers from quartering in your home? Where do you have to pay
to get the right to not be unreasonably searched?

Doctors attend years of schooling, at their own expense, and further
years of residency in order to become certified to practice healthcare.
Doctors deserve to be paid for their work.

You can try to argue that the Constitution guarantees the right to
healthcare, but you would be wrong. Nowhere in the language of the
Constitution does it say that you have a right to healthcare. You can
try to *infer* a right to healthcare, but you would be wrong.

Now for the part that confuses everyone:

**The Constitution guarantees a right to** ***free access*** **to
healthcare. It does not guarantee a right to** ***access to free***
**healthcare.**

Words matter. There is an ocean of difference between the two.

Yes, the Constitution guarantees that no law can prevent your access to
healthcare. The Commerce Clause likely could be argued to protect your
right to access whatever healthcare you like. The Fourteenth Amendment,
in its equal protection clause, also likely guarantees the same thing.

But nothing in the Constitution guarantees that you can have healthcare
**for free**. Even if you never have to pay *at the time of service*,
you will pay. You may pay through your taxes (as most "free healthcare"
countries do), but you do pay for that service. The Constitution does
not guarantee your right to **free healthcare**.
