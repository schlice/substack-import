**A landscaper did work on my property without my consent, and is now
billing me. What do I do?**

Today in Law 101, we will be discussing *verbal contracts*.

A verbal contract can have the same force of law as a written one, and
you can sue over breach of contract with a verbal agreement just as you
can with a written agreement.

The problem with verbal agreements is one of details. The court has to
be able to extract the key details of the contract, which may be
difficult when the two parties do not agree on what those key details
were. They may not even agree that a verbal agreement existed at all.

The person wanting the agreement enforced now finds himself in the
unenviable position of not only proving that a verbal agreement existed,
but that it contained exactly the key details he is claiming.

This is why landscapers work on written orders. They provide written
estimates, which do not become finalized until signed and returned.
*Then* work can begin. It's more time consuming to do it this way, but
it leads to happier customers, and no misunderstandings about what work
was requested and what work was performed.

The court will also look at whether or not you knew the work was
ongoing. It's a lot easier to claim that you didn't want the work to be
done if you didn't know the work was ongoing. If you knew the work was
ongoing *and you did nothing to stop it* (for example, if one of the
employees spoke to you or someone in your house), you again will have a
difficult time convincing the court that you did not authorize the work
to be completed.
