No.

If you're facing termination without the option of receiving
unemployment benefits, then you are being terminated ***for cause***.
This means you have done something seriously wrong, something which
violated the terms of your employment agreement. Stealing, misconduct,
poor performance, or some other violation of company policy are all
examples of terminations for cause.

Termination without cause means that you didn't do anything wrong, but
you were terminated anyway. Company restructuring which also eliminated
your position, company downsizing, or an economic downturn can all
result in termination without cause.

Termination for cause generally makes you ineligible for unemployment
benefits. Similarly, quitting generally makes you ineligible for
unemployment benefits. Generally, you can only receive unemployment
benefits if you are terminated without cause.

With all this in mind, if you quit in lieu of being fired, it's not
unethical. You're being fired anyway because of something you did wrong.
Quitting in lieu of being fired doesn't change the ethical calculation
at all, other than to publicly admit that you knew you did something
wrong and you quit before the company could get around to firing you.
You will still be listed as quitting in lieu of termination for cause,
if anyone asks your former employer whether or not you left on "good
terms."
