This is more specifically related to Catholic churches, as it is written
dogma for them.

This phrase was first written by Saint Cyprian of Carthage, a 3rd
Century bishop. The phrase is generally accepted as truth in those
churches, namely that the church is necessary for salvation. Catholic
churches and Eastern Orthodox churches believe that outside the church
there is no salvation, because salvation is the church. They also
acknowledge, however, that not all in the church will be saved. But
those *not* in the church (i.e. atheists) will definitely not be saved.

Protestant denominations do not hold this doctrine quite as strongly, as
they debate about what is the meaning of "the church" and what it means
to be "outside" of it.

Original question:

What is the fate of the atheists, following this Latin phrase \"extra
Ecclesiam nulla salus\" which means \"outside the Church there is no
salvation\"?
