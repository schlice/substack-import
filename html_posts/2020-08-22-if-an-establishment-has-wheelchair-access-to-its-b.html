**If an establishment has wheelchair access to its building, but within
that building the access significantly restricts wheelchair patrons,
would it be a good idea to share those concerns with them, publicly on a
web review, or both?**

It is *absolutely* a good idea to share the concerns with them, both in
person and in a public web review.

But I would first share the concerns directly with the general manager /
owner, and see if there is anything they can do. The quality of their
response should weigh into the characterization of the establishment you
choose to make in your web review.
