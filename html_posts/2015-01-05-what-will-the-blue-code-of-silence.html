**Content:** [I added \"Questions That Contain Assumptions\" to the list
of topics for this question, because you clearly assume that all
officers in the NYPD are so vehemently opposed to body cameras that they
will simply not video anything.\
\
I could see that if an officer videoed another officer breaking the law,
there might be some \"technical malfunction\" that caused the video to
be lost or something like that. But I highly doubt it.\
\
Command staffs have to make it clear to officers that videos are
designed to record interactions with the public, not with other
officers. Command staffs also have to make policy that enforces and
upholds this. When this happens, officers will more readily accept body
cameras.]{.rendered_qtext}
