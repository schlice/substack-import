Yes, nationalism and racism are distinct and different. Nationalism is
pride in your nation. Nationalism drives you to defend your own nation.

Nationalism can appear to be racism if you have a homogeneous culture,
but it's not about the race of the person, it's about the national
origin.

Extreme nationalism may be more closely linked to xenophobia than
racism.
