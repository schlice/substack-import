I don't think so.

First, let's clarify something. *Biden* didn't destroy our chemical
weapons stockpile. This is a process which has been going on for
decades, and it just happened to *complete* under Biden's term. The US
and the Soviet Union agreed in principle to destroy their stockpiles of
chemical weapons in 1989, and they signed the Chemical Weapons
Convention Agreement in 1997, which is when large-scale chemical weapons
destruction began.

For decades, the United States has only vowed to use chemical weapons in
response to use by another nation against us, and then proceeded to
build a stockpile of chemical weapons so large that no other nation
would ever dare do so.

But now, we have completely destroyed our *declared* stockpile of
chemical weapons (which, of course, begs the question of whether or not
we have any *undeclared* chemical weapons, but that's another question
for another day). This concludes our responsibilities under the
multinational Chemical Weapons Convention Agreement, ratified by
Congress in 1997.

So the question remains: does this make us less safe as a nation?

The answer is mostly no. Most other major nations have also destroyed
their stockpiles of chemical weapons: Britain in 2007, India in 2009,
Russia in 2017. But according to the Pentagon, chemical weapons have not
been eradicated entirely. A few nations never signed the treaty, and
some that did, notably Russia, appear to have retained undeclared
stocks, which definitely increases the likelihood that we, too, retained
some undeclared stocks.

Also, the treaty did not end the use of chemical weapons by rogue states
and terrorist groups. Forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad of Syria
used chemical weapons there numerous times between 2013 and 2019.
According to the IHS Conflict Monitor, a London-based intelligence
collection and analysis service, fighters from the Islamic State used
chemical weapons at least 52 times in Iraq and Syria from 2014 to 2016.
We know that Saddam Hussein used chemical weapons against the Kurds in
the 1980s. But they were doing that even while we still retained a
massive stockpile of chemical weapons. Their use of the weapons weren't
altered by the fact that we had them.

But does our destruction of our stockpile of chemical weapons make the
United States any less safe? It would only be true if the destruction of
our stockpile would make a rogue state or terrorist group more likely to
use chemical weapons against us. The original thought was that doing so
would cause us to use our chemical weapons against them, but the United
States has not used chemical weapons in warfare since 1918 (note we did
use herbicides like Agent Orange in Vietnam which were harmful to
humans, but not as a chemical weapon against humans). So if it's
unlikely that we would have used them anyway, then their presence or
absence will not change our security status.

And even when we do not use the identical tactics against our enemies
that they use against us (we never hijacked any Middle Eastern airliners
and flew them into Osama Bin Laden's major cities), we still bring
massive force to bear against them, and we still prevail. Any nation
using any weapon of war against our people will incur swift and decisive
retaliatory action. We have never wavered in this commitment.

It is for these reasons that I do not believe that we have become less
safe because of the destruction of our chemical weapons stockpile.
