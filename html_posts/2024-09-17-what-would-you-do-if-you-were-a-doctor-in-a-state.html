You provide the abortion. Yes, there are some anecdotal reports of a few
people who experienced problems getting emergency medical care, ***but
the exception does not prove the rule.***

It is not normally a problem to receive emergency medical care. If you
leave the baby in, they would both die, but if you take the baby out
(and it can't survive on its own) and you save the mother, then you save
the mother. You do everything in your power to save the baby, but if the
baby is not viable and leaving it in will cause the mother to die, you
remove the baby.

In all honesty, this happens so infrequently as to be an outlier.
Usually, if the mother is going to have a prenatal emergency crisis, the
baby is grown enough to be viable and can survive as a preemie.

But again, at that point, if we leave the baby in and they both die, or
we take the baby out and only the baby dies, we save as many lives as we
can.
