So Griswold decided to remove Trump from the ballot on the grounds that
he violated the 14th Amendment, despite the fact that we don't have a
verified definition of *insurrection,* and it hasn't been proven that
Trump engaged in it, whatever it is. Look, January 6th was a nightmare.
It was horrible. It was a riot. But painting it as an **actual attempt
to overthrow the government** is a stretch, even for Democrats. But you
know, never let the facts get in the way of your rhetoric.

But then, the Colorado GOP struck back. In a move that surprised
absolutely no one, they immediately appealed to the US Supreme Court.
While they're waiting, they started making plans to just take their ball
and go home. In other words, they said that if they lose their Supreme
Court appeal, they would cancel their primary, and instead hold a
statewide caucus, essentially bypassing the state voting mechanism
altogether.

Facing the prospect of losing at the Supreme Court (which would
eliminate the possibility of any other state keeping Trump off of the
ballot), and recognizing that they can't stop the Colorado GOP from
voting for Trump, with or without them, Colorado decided to punt and
once again allow Trump on the primary ballot.

It's probably also a move to try to moot the Supreme Court challenge. No
victim, no crime, no standing, right? If Trump is actually on the
ballot, then potentially the Colorado GOP loses its standing to appeal.
However, this was also tried by New York in *NYSRPA v. Breun*, and it
failed, as SCOTUS took the case anyway because they wanted to address
the broader issue. I suspect that the Supreme Court will still take the
case despite Colorado attempting to moot the issue, because this is
happening in other states (Michigan thwarted an attempt to remove Trump
from the ballot, while Maine removed Trump from the Primary *and*
General ballots), and the Court would likely want to avoid a
Constitutional crisis.
