**If a homicide detective wants to question me about a case, can I just
outright refuse to go with him unless he has an arrest warrant?**

Absolutely. You aren't under any obligation to go anywhere with anyone
unless you're being arrested.

However, unlike your question, he doesn't \*need\* an arrest warrant. He
just needs to have a reasonable belief that you committed a crime, and
he needs to be able to articulate the reason for his belief.

In other words, you can either willingly accompany the police to the
station, or the police can arrest you. Other than arrest, you go
willingly, even if they "convince" you that going with them is in your
best interest.

And if you are arrested, I strongly suggest not saying anything at all
until you've had the chance to consult with a lawyer.
