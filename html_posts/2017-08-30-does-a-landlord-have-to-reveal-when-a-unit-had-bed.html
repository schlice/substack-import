[[In most
states](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=4bceec&url=http://www.ncsl.org/research/environment-and-natural-resources/state-bedbug-laws.aspx){.external_link

onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="ncsl.org"}]{.qlink_container}, landlords do not need to
report if a unit has been treated previously for bed bugs.

So how do you know if a unit has had bed bugs before? You can check with
the current tenants, or check with neighbors.

You can also straight up ask the landlord if the unit ever had problems
with bed bugs. Landlords need to answer you truthfully, because ***if
they lie to you*** and the unit subsequently gets bed bugs and you find
out it's been a recurring problem, you have a few options which you can
pursue with a lawyer, such as withholding rent payments, or suing the
landlord for damages. These remedies are legally tricky and carry some
risk, so *make sure you consult with a housing attorney in your area
before you do any of these.*

lawyer; I only play one on the Internet.*
