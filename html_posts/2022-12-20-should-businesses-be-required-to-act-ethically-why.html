What are ethics? Who gets to determine what is ethical?

The answer is that ethics (as opposed to morals) are a system of rules
that define acceptable actions or correct behavior.

In fact, *legislators create ethical codes all the time*. They're called
***laws***.

We have chosen, in this country, to impart ethics to businesses through
the enactment of laws.

If we were to *remove laws*, what would organically spring up in its
place would be the rise of **business groups**. Things like the National
Federation of Independent Businesses, which is not only an advocacy
group, but also helps to define rules of conduct for member businesses.
Without business regulations in place, belonging to one of these
business groups or professional organizations would give you credit
above other businesses. People would look to your business to see if you
were a member before shopping there. We have simply chosen to do this
through law, and we impose these standards on all businesses using the
power of the state.
