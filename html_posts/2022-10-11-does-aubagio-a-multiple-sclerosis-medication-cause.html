The short answer is that it hasn't been fully investigated.

There may be a relationship between taking Aubagio and some periodontal
conditions which may have pre-existed in some patients. This is unclear
at the moment. But the hypothesis today is that the action of
teriflunomide allows certain types of infections to flourish.

This is not uncommon in MS drugs. There are indeed MS drugs which
suppress the immune system in a very specific way which allows some
infections and viral activity to flourish (I'm thinking of Tysabri and
the JC virus). So it is not outside of the realm of possibility that
teriflunomide allows certain endodontic bacterial infections to
flourish, specifically ones that cause pulpitis, and allows other
endodontic infections and periapical reactions to occur unchecked, which
can be followed by teeth loss.

It is imperative, therefore, that anyone starting or taking Aubagio stay
current on their dental health. Checkups and cleanings every six months
should be the minimum. Any endodontic issues should be dealt with right
away, or the risk of tooth loss may be accelerated. Always practice good
oral hygiene, as it is posited by the NIH that "\[p\]oor oral hygiene is
common in MS patients."[\[1\]](#wEHsF){#cite-wEHsF .citation_link} I'm
not sure where they came up with that statistic, but they said it.
