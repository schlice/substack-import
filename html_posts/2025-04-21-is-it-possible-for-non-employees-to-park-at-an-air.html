Long-term parking lots are not for employees. So it's perfectly natural
and normal for non-employees to park at airport long-term parking lots.
There are no flight checks before entering a long-term parking lot. You
are simply charged for your stay when you exit.

Most airport long-term lots limit the amount of time you can park there
to around 30 days without advanced notice. But in most long-term lots
which are rarely full, this wouldn't even be a problem unless the
vehicle was parked there for an extended period (6--12 months).
Ultimately, you pay the fee when you pick up your car, so as long as
there continue to be available parking slots, and you park in the
farthest area away from the airport (so you're less likely to impede a
space needed by the airport for other customers), you could probably
stay in long term parking for quite some time.

As for employees, there is usually a section of parking on the ground
floor of the garage (or just adjacent to the garage) which has its own
gate. Your employee badge gives you access to the garage parking
(through one gate with a badge reader), and then you have to badge in to
the employee parking area. They only check to see that when you badged
in to the paid parking area that you then badged in to the employee
area.

At least at the airport where I worked, they didn't care how long you
were in employee parking, or if you parked in employee parking when you
went on personal travel. They only cared that you weren't taking up
revenue spaces (i.e. once you badged in to ground level parking, you
then continued and badged in to the employee lot). And we had more than
enough room in the employee lot. There were dumpsters and parking
shuttles parked in our employee lot, so space wasn't really an issue.
The employee lot was the farthest lot away from the terminal in that
lot, so it's not like the employees got any great advantage in that
realm. It was still a decent hike from employee parking to the terminal.
