Absolutely!

The GOP needs to get serious about quelling the ridiculous tropes
spouted by gun control advocates, like "more guns equals more crime" and
"to be safer, we need fewer guns on the streets."

They need to get serious about allow more people who are able and
willing to carry firearms to protect themselves so that events like this
will instead read "Crazed gunman stopped by armed citizen before he
could shoot members of the Republican Congressional Baseball team".
