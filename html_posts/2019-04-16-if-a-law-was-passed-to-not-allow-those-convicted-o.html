**If a law was passed to NOT allow those convicted of sex crimes
committed against children out of prison on parole, would you support
it?**

Let's say I'm drunk. I'm doing the responsible thing by walking home,
but maaaaaaaan I gotta pee.

If you've ever been drunk in your life, you know how it is.

It's late at night, there's no one around, and hey, you're drunk, so you
duck behind a building and you whip it out and take a leak.

Except that, unbeknownst to your drunk ass, there's a child watching you
from a second-story window in the apartment complex next to where you're
draining the remains of your beer.

Oops.

You get arrested, charged with contributing to the delinquency of a
minor, and placed on the sex offender registry.

While this particular story is made up, stories like this happen all.
the. time. I have a real problem with the sex offender registry and how
it is handled, but that's an answer to a different question.

OK, back to today's hypothetical.

Under your mandatory sentencing rules (you have indeed committed a sex
crime against a child), you will spend the whole of your prison sentence
in prison. You will not be eligible for parole.

This is why I have never been in favor of mandatory sentencing. I am in
favor of mandatory *charging* (i.e. rules which state that certain
crimes cannot be plea-bargained away; if evidence for the charge exists,
it must be charged), but sentencing is a very nuanced thing.

Besides, I'm not sure I understand the purpose of making someone
convicted of a sex crime serve his entire sentence in prison without
being eligible for parole. Parole is a reward for good behavior while in
prison (in most states; in some states, parole is a mandatory part of
transitioning back to civilian life). This simply removes the
possibility that parole will even be offered, providing even fewer
benefits to the con to behave while inside. This really doesn't do
anything but hurt the prison system.

And unless you can show that recidivism is somehow higher among
criminals who sexually abuse children than other groups (and especially
recidivism *while out on parole*), it's really quite unfair that you
would target only those criminals and not other violent criminals.

I'm not trying to advocate for the literal scum stains who prey on
children. I'm simply stating that the punishment doesn't fit the crime.
