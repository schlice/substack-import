Because the day was also important for one other reason: **it was Donald
Trump's birthday.** Worse than that, someone got the bright idea that
Trump, being the conceited ass that they believe him to be, probably
organized this whole 250th anniversary parade just to throw himself a
birthday birthday at taxpayer expense. Thus, the No Kings movement was
born.

And what better way to celebrate than to have the Democratic Party fund
protests in 19 states specifically against Trump? That's right, the
whole purpose of the protests was to bash Trump...on his birthday.

But Democrats are having trouble getting *anything* to stick to Trump.
Actually, Trump and Clinton are similar in that regard. *Slick Willie,
the Teflon President*. That's what we used to call him, because nothing
would stick to him. Similarly, Democrats can't seem to find anything
that they can get to stick to Trump. It's almost like what Trump said in
the first campaign was true: he could shoot someone stone cold dead in
the middle of 5th Avenue and he'd gain support.

Do they care that they disrespected the Army? HA! They couldn't give a
rat's ass about the Army.

Do they care that they disrespected America on Flag Day? HA! They don't
care about America; they'd rather see America burn because they believe
America was founded on racism and slavery and deserves to be destroyed
and given back to Native Americans or somesuch.

**It's all about Trump.**

But Trump can take it. And while the protestors are busy whining about
Trump, they're not watching what he's doing with his other hand, which
is good for us.
