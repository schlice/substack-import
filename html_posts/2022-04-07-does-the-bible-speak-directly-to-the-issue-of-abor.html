No, it does not. The word "abortion" does not appear in the Bible.

What the Bible *does* speak of is the fact that life begins at
conception (not at first breath, as some abortionists like to quote).
The Bible speaks of God literally forming you in the womb, knowing you
even before you were created.

> I knew you before I formed you in your mother's womb. --- Jeremiah 1:4
>
> For you formed my inwards parts; you knitted me together in my
> mother's womb. I praise you, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made.
> Wonderful are your works; my soul knows it full well. --- Psalm 139:13

If life is literally a creation of God, what right have we to destroy
it? It's clear that God is involved in the formation of new life, and
that life is alive (as we well know today); it is not inanimate, as the
dust of the ground.

Yes, God does kill in the Bible. He killed entire cities, filled with
women, children, and animals. Heck, he even flooded the whole earth and
killed everyone on it.

But every time he did so, it was because he had judged them to be
**evil**.

God was the judge, and the evil person or persons were destroyed. *Have
we done the same with a fetus*? What made the fetus so evil that we
needed to destroy it? Remember, *murder* in the Bible is "killing
without justification." What did that fetus, *created by God's own
hands,* do in order to deserve death? If the answer is nothing, then the
person committing this act is committing *murder*. Killing without
justification.

Abortion proponents who have limited Bible knowledge point to Exodus 21
as their justification for their belief that life begins at first
breath. This same chapter in the Bible authorizes slavery. Are you sure
this is the section of the Bible you want to hold sacrosanct? Remember,
these were the rules that God gave to the people of Israel so they could
create a functioning society. These rules were essentially made
unnecessary by Jesus. We no longer hold to the old law.

And God, as previously mentioned, has no tolerance for those who kill
innocents.
