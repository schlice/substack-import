**Does the right to travel 5th and 14 amendment really mean you dont
need a license?**

No. Not even close.

The federal government is extremely limited in its authority, by
Constitutional design, to essential functions in making the states work
together. But the state government is the main source of governmental
authority. The states make the laws that govern your everyday life.

To that end, while freedom of movement is most definitely a
Constitutional right derived from the 5th and 14th Amendments, as well
as the "privileges and immunities clause," the courts have held
consistently that the federal government does not ***protect*** freedom
of movement. That duty falls squarely on the state, under that same
privileges and immunities clause of the Constitution. The courts have
consistently held that the state is responsible for protecting freedom
of movement. In the same way, subsequent court rulings have found that
states cannot restrict freedom of movement.

To that end, if the state has the Constitutional responsibility to
protect freedom of movement, they also have the concomitant
responsibility to ensure that drivers are duly trained and licensed to
operate motor vehicles in order to effect their Constitutional
responsibility. States are free to license drivers in the way in which
they see fit, and licenses are recognized by other states when those
licenses meet certain minimum standards for driving ability. Since all
states have met those minimum standards, all states recognize driving
privileges from other states. Since the state is the primary protector
of freedom of movement, it falls to the state to ensure the safety of
that movement, and the Constitutional provision of freedom of movement
does not override the state's authority in licensing drivers.
