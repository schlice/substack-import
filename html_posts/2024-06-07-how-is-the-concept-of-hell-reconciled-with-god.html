This is a good question and it deserves a little review and
understanding.

So let's first talk timelines.

Long before God created Adam, He created angels. Angels are messengers,
and worshippers. They work for God, and they worship God. But there was
one angel who was one of the most amazing angels God created. It's silly
to say his voice is "angelic" because he's an angel, but it's just hard
to describe how amazing and entrancing his singing is. Think of the most
amazing singer you can, and then multiply that by ten and you might come
close to how incredible his singing voice is. By the way, if you haven't
guessed yet, his name is Lucifer.

Lucifer decided that he did not want to worship God any longer. He
wanted worship *himself*. Instead of praising God with his voice, he
wanted that praise himself. There was a great struggle in heaven, and
God cast Lucifer out of heaven to the earth, and he took about a third
of the angels with him (the ones who chose to worship Lucifer instead of
God), and they became demons.

For them (Lucifer and the demons), God created hell. It's a place where
God's love does not exist. It is a place of "eternal torment," not a
place of "eternal torture." Living in a place where God's love does not
exist, while being able to see the Kingdom of Heaven, and know that it
was your choices alone that placed you there, would be an endless
torment. At the end of hell, the Bible talks about "the lake of fire"
which will be the ultimate destination of Lucifer (now known as Satan).
*That* place is indeed where souls will suffer for all eternity.

So we need to understand that God created hell and "the lake of fire"
for Lucifer and the demons.

\

Following the events in heaven with Lucifer, God created Adam. Satan was
exceedingly jealous of Adam, because Adam was God's penultimate
creation. God walked with Adam in the Garden every day. Satan did not
like that at all, so he took advantage of Adam and Eve's naïveté and
tricked them into sin. Once Adam and Eve had sinned and introduced sin
into the human condition, they could not enter the kingdom of Heaven.
They had unpaid sin debt, and only those who have no sin debt can enter
Heaven. Therefore, when they die, their new destination becomes hell

\

So some things to take away from this story:

1.  God created hell for Satan and his demons, not for humans.
2.  Adam and Eve made a *choice* to sin. They freely chose to disobey
    God. We do the same, every day.
3.  Our final destination is hell because of that sin.

Sounds pretty bleak, no? Sounds like there's not much we can do to get
out of this.

**But God made a way.**

While we were still sinners, God sent Jesus, the only person ever born
without sin, to take on our sin debt and die on the cross as payment for
that sin. This pays our sin debt and allows us to enter the Kingdom of
Heaven.

(Just as an aside, we know Jesus is God. So it is actually God who paid
for our sins for us. God took that sin debt onto Himself so that we can
be justified and sanctified. Think about that for a second).

\

So back to the original question:

> **How is the concept of Hell reconciled with God\'s love for
> humanity?**

Hell was never intended to be the final destination for mankind. Man's
choice to sin changed his final destination from heaven to hell. And
God, being just, did not stop this, because it was man's own choices
that sent him there.

Usually, at this point, people respond with "Well it was Adam's sin! Why
am I destined for hell?" The answer is that we are responsible for our
own sin, which you and I commit every single day, in our thoughts and in
our words, in what we have done, and what we have failed to do.

> **Is it considered cruel for God to have created such a place?**

Not at all. If you look through that history, God has only responded to
what has happened. God doesn't *send* anyone to hell. People *choose*
hell every single day by not repenting for the sin they freely commit.
God's justice (everyone gets exactly what they deserve) is generally
considered to be very loving. What's more loving is the fact that God's
mercy allowed Him to come up with a plan to save us, and His grace gives
us the gift of salvation when we simply do not deserve it.

In this way, we can choose to love Him or reject Him without violating
our free will, and that is ultimately the purpose of this life: to be
able to make that choice freely, without coercion. God *is* love, and
love can only be given freely, it can never be coerced.
