Florida Statute ยง 800.03 states that a person commits the crime of
"unlawful exposure of sexual organs" by:

> \(a\) Exposing or exhibiting his or her sexual organs in public or on
> the private premises of another, or so near thereto as to be seen from
> such private premises, in a vulgar or indecent manner; or
>
> \(b\) Being naked in public in a vulgar or indecent manner.

The statute goes on to clarify what is **not** "unlawful exposure of
sexual organs:"

> \(a\) A mother breastfeeding her baby; or
>
> \(b\) An individual who is merely naked at any place provided or set
> apart for that purpose.

The statute says that to be convicted, you must be naked "in public" and
you must be naked "in a vulgar or indecent manner."

Paragraph (a) of the first section applies to someone naked on their own
property, so near to someone else's property that they can see you. In
order for your nakedness to be infringing, you must be naked in "a
vulgar or indecent manner."

That term has been defined in case law as well as in standardized jury
instructions in Florida, and the words "vulgar," "indecent,"
"lascivious" and "lewd" all mean the same thing: an unlawful indulgence
in lust or a wicked, lustful, unchaste, licentious, or sensual intent on
part of the person committing the act. [\[1\]](#VOiaI){#cite-VOiaI

Therefore, if there was no "vulgar or indecent" intent on the part of
the naked person, Florida does not treat this as a crime.
