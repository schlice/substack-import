You can sue anyone for anything. The question becomes whether or not you
might be successful.

And in this endeavor, you would not be successful.

First, you said it's a HIPAA violation, and then you said it's a
Constitutional violation. It is neither.

HIPAA is a set of rules that binds your doctor and your healthcare
providers, and governs what they can do with your protected health
information, and how they have to protect it and what they need to do to
share it.

Businesses can make any rules they choose to discriminate which
customers may enter their establishment, unless those discriminations
violate existing laws. For example, you cannot discriminate by age, sex,
national origin, color, or religion, as those are protected by Federal
law. States may add additional characteristics (some states add sexual
orientation for example).

But if I wanted to say that everyone must wear jacket and tie to enter
my business, I can do that, so long as I do it to everyone who enters my
business.

If a business says that only vaccinated people may enter their facility,
so long as the business is not violating state law by doing so (and if
the business is in Florida, they would be), they can do just that. They
can demand your vaccination card to enter or remain in the facility, and
they can kick you out if you don't show it to them.

A Texas restaurant owner kicked me out for refusing to show my
vaccination card? How can I sue him for violating HIPPA laws and
requiring all customers be vaccinated when it's unconstitutional?
