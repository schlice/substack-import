In the United States, we didn't need a law against texting and driving.
We already have laws against distracted driving.

Legislators just wanted to be seen "doing something" about texting and
driving.

It's like if you have a law that says "do not enter this room" and then
you write another law that says, "do not skip into this room." Entering
the room is already illegal; how you enter the room is already covered.

So there really was no need for the texting and driving law in the first
place, which is what tends to confuse people about doing other things.
"Well it says I can't 'text and drive' but it doesn't say I can't 'read
e-mails and drive' or 'play Angry Birds and drive' so I can do those,
right?"

No, you can't. Distracted driving is already a moving violation in
almost every jurisdiction I'm aware of.

So in case you missed it by now, writing a letter while driving is
illegal as it is considered distracted driving.
