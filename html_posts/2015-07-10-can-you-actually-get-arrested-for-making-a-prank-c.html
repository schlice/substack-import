If the called party chooses to press charges, then yes, your friend can
be arrested for verbalizing a threat.

It wouldn't stick, of course, because a crime requires the unlawful act
(the *actus reus)* and the state of mind in which you actually wanted to
do the crime (the criminal mind, or the *mens rea*). Realistically, I
don\'t think he will be arrested. I think it\'s pretty straightforward
that this was nothing more than a prank call, and there was no malicious
intent on the part of the caller.

However, if the called party wants to press charges, the caller can be
arrested.
