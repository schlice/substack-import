**If someone breaks the law in a US national park, how are they
prosecuted (by the federal government, state government, etc)?**

As with all legal questions, the answer is "it depends."

Law enforcement in national parks is a function governed by several
pieces of legislation, and how the National Park Service (NPS) enforces
laws depends on the law broken and the jurisdiction.

**Laws covered in National Parks.** Law in national parks is generally
covered by Title 36, Code of Federal Regulations. The NPS also enforces
United States Code. Title 16, Title 18 and Title 21 of the United States
Code are enforced most frequently.

Additionally, NPS generally also has the authority to enforce any state
law not covered already by federal laws under the Assimilative Crimes
Act, 18 U.S.C. ยง 13. However, by policy the NPS cannot charge violators
with a state offense that has a harsher penalty than an equivalent
federal law already on the books. To that end, if a crime is covered by
a state law and a federal law, NPS will enforce the statute with the
lesser penalty.

**Jurisdiction.** There are several types of National Park Service
jurisdiction. Jurisdiction is set by the enabling legislation for each
individual unit of the NPS and is considered part of the Special
Maritime and Territorial Jurisdiction of the United States. Law
enforcement on NPS lands with exclusive jurisdiction is solely conducted
by NPS Law Enforcement Rangers (field officers) or the US Park Police.
Many NPS units have *concurrent jurisdiction* and share law enforcement
authority with their state and/or local county law enforcement agencies.
Some National Park Service units have *proprietary* or *partial
jurisdiction* where law enforcement authority for certain serious
incidents lies with the state or county. Most NPS units have memorandums
of understanding with outside law enforcement agencies, so that policies
are in place when and if outside agency assistance is needed.

Therefore, depending on which law was violated, which law will be
charged, and which agencies have jurisdiction, either NPS will charge
and prosecute through the nearest US Attorney's office, or NPS will turn
the offender over to state or local authorities who will prosecute using
NPS' evidence through their own District Attorney's
office.[\[1\]](#gFkPd){#cite-gFkPd .citation_link}
