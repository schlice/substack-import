First of all, there are plenty of legal reasons to impeach Biden. For
more, see my previous answer:

[[Bill Stein\'s answer to If Republicans win the House, and perhaps the
Senate, should they impeach Joe Biden? On what charges would be of
greatest
effect?](/If-Republicans-win-the-House-and-perhaps-the-Senate-should-they-impeach-Joe-Biden-On-what-charges-would-be-of-greatest-effect/answer/Bill-Stein?__filter__=5&__nsrc__=notif_page&__sncid__=33043962029&__snid3__=44419617520)]{.qlink_container}

Secondly, I guess it's time for another edition of Constitution 101.

**You don't need a legal reason to impeach a president, because
impeachment is not a legal process.**

Impeachment is a *political* process.

The Framers used the words "high crimes and misdemeanors" because that's
the "level" of crime for which impeachment was to be reserved. It should
be things *akin* to what we would charge *anyone else* with as a crime.
But for a president, we would instead impeach.

Remember what then-Representative Gerald Ford said about impeachment in
1970: \"An impeachable offense is whatever a majority of the House of
Representatives considers it to be at a given moment in history.\"

In other words, the House can literally impeach the President for any
reason they see fit, or no reason at all. But as I said in my previous
answer, Clinton, W, Obama and Trump all committed impeachable offenses,
and only Clinton and Trump were impeached, and Trump not even for the
thing he did that was truly impeachable. Biden too has committed
impeachable offenses.

And if we don't start holding presidents to some standard, then the
office of the President will gain *de facto* power and we will have no
mechanism to stop it.

If you do what you've always done, you'll get what you've always gotten.
