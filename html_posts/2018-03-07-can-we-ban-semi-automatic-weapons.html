**Can we ban semi-automatic weapons?**

It would be very challenging.

We've banned "assault weapons," which is a made-up class of weapons
categorized by cosmetic features. It ran for ten years (1994--2004). It
did **nothing**. It did not reduce crime. It did not reduce shootings.
It did not reduce mass murder. Because it was **100% ineffective** at
doing what it aimed to do, it was allowed to expire.

I struggle to figure out (again) how banning any class of weapons (even
one so broad as semi-automatic weapons) will deter those who choose to
not follow the law.

Indeed, we've already tried to ban things in society before. Remember
Prohibition from your history classes? Ask yourself: did Prohibition
stop alcohol use? Drugs are currently banned. Do those bans stop drug
use?

Why should we believe that another ban will somehow work *this time*?

Finally, how do you classify a semi-automatic weapon? Semi-automatics
can basically be classified as a weapon which fires one shot with every
trigger pull and automatically reloads itself without having to move an
action to load the next round. This encompasses about 95% of all
firearms in the United States, as it encompasses almost all pistols and
rifles available today. Most hunting rifles have to have a bolt cycled
before they can shoot again, and some pistols are classified as
single-action only (SAO), which means that you must cock the hammer in
between each shot (but you can still fire rapidly if you "fan the
hammer" --- it's no less accurate than bump firing, since bump stocks
are on their way out). Nevertheless, "semi-automatic weapons"
encompasses a very broad range of firearms.

Additionally, what do you do about the 200+ million semi-autos out there
now? You can't make their ownership illegal. The Constitution forbids
*ex post facto* laws. You can't seize them from private homes. You can
do a voluntary buy-back, but even the government with its massive
money-printing machines doesn't have enough money to buy all those guns
at fair market value (also required under the Constitution). And since
there is no record of where these guns are, it would be really
challenging to get rid of them all.

I think you would have a very hard time passing a ban on all semi-autos,
and you'd have an even harder time enforcing it.
