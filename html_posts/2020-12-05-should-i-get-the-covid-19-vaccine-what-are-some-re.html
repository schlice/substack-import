**Are there any valid reasons for not getting the covid 19 vaccine?**

*(Remember, this was asked in the MS space, so this answer is specific
to MS patients)*

At this time, we don't know, because we don't have one yet.

But there *may* be valid reasons for not getting one. We can use the
same valid reasons to not get *specific formulations of the flu shot* as
an example.

There are two specific formulations of flu shot: a *killed virus* and an
*attenuated virus*. The killed virus is *inactivated* virus. Inactivated
viruses are made from a protein or other small pieces of a virus or a
bacteria. The inactivated virus is injected into your body, and your
body responds exactly as it would if the virus were whole and active.
You create antibodies to fight off that virus (even though it cannot
infect you), and you store the pattern of those antibodies to fight
re-infection. But it has no chance of giving you the flu, because it's
inactivated. Your body does react as if you got the flu (you sometimes
feel a little feverish or develop some body aches).

The LAIV (live attenuated influenza vaccine) is a spray mist sprayed in
the nose. This virus is live (still capable of infection), but is
*attenuated*, or weakened. It allows people with a normally-functioning
immune system to create antibodies to the flu without getting sick.

The key there is *normally-functioning immune systems*. Certain people
who are on immunosuppressant or immunomodulating therapies should not
take the nasal spray flu vaccine. Also, it is widely accepted that
people with MS do not have normally-functioning immune systems.
Therefore, people with MS should not take the live attenuated flu
vaccine. They should always discuss with their doctor which flu vaccine
is right for them to get, but in most cases, it's going to be the shot.

Depending on how the COVID-19 vaccine works, doctors will have to make
informed decisions based on their patients and what medications they are
taking in order to make a recommendation as to whether or not they
should take the vaccine. Be sure to check with your neurologist once a
vaccine is released.
