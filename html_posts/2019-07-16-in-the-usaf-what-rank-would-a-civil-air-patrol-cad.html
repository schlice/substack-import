**In the USAF, what rank would a Civil Air Patrol cadet be able to
enlist at? Does earning the Spatz award get you higher rank when you
enlist?**

Both questions answered at once:

Any Civil Air Patrol cadet who earns the Mitchell Award can enlist at
the rank of E-3. There's no further special advancement for achieving
the higher Spaatz Award.

Also, you should know that ROTC and USAFA both look very favorably on
Civil Air Patrol experience. Approximately 10% of each incoming USAFA
class has CAP experience.
