**How can the Castle Doctrine be used for self-defense in another
person's home?**

The fundamental principle in the Castle Doctrine is the idea that
**you** feel safe in your own home. You're not defending your *home*,
you're defending your *person.*

Therefore, the Castle Doctrine stems from the doctrine of
*self-defense*. To that end, you can still defend yourself in someone
else's home.

I assume you're talking about the Amber Guyger case, and the Castle
Doctrine applies because she *believed* she was in her own home.
Prosecutors are trying to argue that she shouldn't have been allowed to
defend herself because her belief that she was in her own apartment was
not reasonable.

But that's not what is at issue. What is at issue is ***her actions,***
assuming that she truly believed she was in her own apartment. Since she
did truly believe she was in her own apartment (regardless of how
unreasonable that belief may have been), the Castle Doctrine would still
apply.

(EDIT) The jury did come back and say that it didn't matter whether or
not she believed she was in her own home. Castle Doctrine did not apply
because she was not actually in her own home. She was convicted of
murder in this case.
