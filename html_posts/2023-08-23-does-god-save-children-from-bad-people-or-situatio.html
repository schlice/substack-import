First of all, where did you get the idea that God was supposed to save
anyone from anything?

It certainly didn't come from the Bible. Even the giants of the faith
were not "saved." Stephen was stoned to death. Peter was crucified
(upside-down). Paul was beheaded. In prison. In fact, ten of the twelve
disciples were executed themselves (not counting Judas, who killed
himself, and John who died in exile).

Look at what the Bible says in Paul's letter to the Hebrews:

> Others were tortured and refused to be released, so that they might
> gain a better resurrection. Some faced jeers and flogging, while still
> others were chained and put in prison. They were stoned; they were
> sawed in two; they were put to death by the sword. They went about in
> sheepskins and goatskins, destitute, persecuted and mistreated---the
> world is not worthy of them. They wandered in deserts and mountains
> and in caves and holes in the ground. These were all commended for
> their faith, yet none of them received what had been promised. (v.
> 35-39).

So there's no indication that faith saves you from suffering. In fact,
it seems that the Bible is pretty clear that believers will suffer at
some point throughout their lives.

The point is not that God will spare you from suffering. The *Life
Application Bible* says this about that verse:

> Having a steadfast faith in God does not guarantee a happy, carefree
> life. On the contrary, our faith almost guarantees us some form of
> abuse from the world. While we are on earth, we may never see the
> purpose of our suffering. But we know that God will keep his promises
> to us.

**That** is the answer. While we are still alive, we may never know why
we are going through the suffering we are (or we may never know why God
allows others to suffer). But we do know that God keeps His promises,
and we know that He has good plans for us:

> "For I know the plans I have for you," declares the Lord, "plans to
> prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future."
> --- Jeremiah 29:11 NIV

We may never have answers for why we suffer during this life. In fact,
we may never know the answers to those questions until the day we can
ask Him face to face. But we know that He loves us and He has a good
plan for us, even if we don't know what that plan is.
