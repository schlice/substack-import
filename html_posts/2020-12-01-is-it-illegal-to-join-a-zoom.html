**Is it illegal to join a Zoom?**

No, it's not illegal to join a Zoom. It's not even illegal to join a
Zoom to which you were not invited.

It may violate Zoom's rules, and at worst you may be banned from using
Zoom, but it's not illegal.

(EDIT) Forgot the international aspect.

Zoom is a US company, with servers located in the US. Due to regulatory
restrictions, persons in the following countries cannot connect to Zoom
sessions:

**Cuba, Iran, Syria, North Korea,** and **Ukraine (Crimea region).**

For more information about this, you can refer to the [[US government's
list of sanctioned
countries.](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=f9faa5&url=https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/programs/pages/programs.aspx){.external_link
