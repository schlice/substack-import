**Content:** [Of course. The right course of action would be to go to
the department and file a complaint against the officer.\
\
Your assertion, however, is that police are never held to account by
their own departments, so people have no recourse. I was attempting to
show other methods that recourse can be taken.\
\
The correct course of action would be to collect all the video that was
taken of the incident (because everyone videos cops all the time,
there\'s bound to be at least one other video of the incident) and take
it to the officer\'s supervisor and file a complaint. But you then have
to trust that the department will handle it correctly and discipline the
officer for his violation of protocol.\
\
Do you trust that the department will provide the retaliation you\'re
looking for? Because you\'re not looking for justice. If the officer is
internally disciplined by the department and that\'s it, would that be
enough retaliation for you? It would be just, because the department
would have solved the problem and the officer was held to account for
his actions. But would his discipline have been enough for you? Once
you\'ve exhausted your proscribed actions, now what? Was his punishment
enough for you? If it wasn\'t, then you\'re not looking for justice,
you\'re looking for retribution.\
\
If you want retribution, go to YouTube or the media.]{.rendered_qtext}
