**Does it harm my Dell laptop or battery to charge it for a while
without reaching 100%?**

The answer is "it depends." What it depends on is the battery technology
being used.

Current battery technology in Dell's current line of laptops is lithium
ion. Lithium ion battery tech is a very "clean" charging technology. It
only accepts charge until it is full. There is no "trickle" charging or
any other type of pulse charging that will either make it work better or
worse. Charging to less than 100% also does not harm the battery. All
lithium ion batteries will slowly degrade over time, mostly because of
mechanical degradation of the cells themselves. Over time, the battery
will slowly lose capacity. They don't suddenly die. Runtime gradually
gets shorter as the capacity starts to degrade.

So what can you do to keep your battery alive the longest?
**Environmental conditions** will most directly impact the degradation
within the cells. Literally, the worst thing you can do for a Li-ion
battery is to keep it fully charged in a hot environment.

Lower charge voltages can prolong a battery's life. Charging technology
within the laptop can charge the battery more slowly in order to
preserve its life. Using [[Dell Command \| Power
Manager](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=5446d9&url=https://www.dell.com/support/home/us/en/04/drivers/driversdetails?driverid%3D3n7tv){.external_link

charging circuit, allowing you to set battery charging to "Standard"
(which is the lower charge we are discussing here), and "ExpressChargeâ„¢"
which will temporarily increase the voltage to quickly charge your
battery. ExpressCharge, if the system is powered off, will charge to 80%
in one hour, and 100% within two hours. You can also set "Primarily AC"
if you leave the laptop plugged in most of the time. Primarily AC lowers
the charging threshold, so that the battery never charges to 100%. The
best part? The default setting is "Adaptive," which analyzes the usage
patterns of the system and sets one of the above modes automatically.

Outside of Dell Command \| Power Manager, what you *can* control is the
laptop's temperature. Make sure that the air vents around the laptop are
not obstructed. Snugging in your big, warm blanket with your laptop may
be comforting, but it suffocates your system. A cool laptop prolongs
battery life and is safest for all internal components.

There is no need to disconnect your laptop from AC power when the
battery is charged. As I mentioned, a Li-ion battery cannot accept more
charge after it reaches 100%, so the charging circuit disconnects once
the battery is fully charged. No trickle charging these batteries.

Also, always use a Dell power supply on your Dell laptop. Using
third-party power supplies can charge your battery too quickly, and
forcing more voltage into a battery more quickly can decrease its life,
and can be dangerous for the cells. Absolutely avoid any so-called
"ultra-fast chargers" which claim to fully charge your battery in under
an hour.
