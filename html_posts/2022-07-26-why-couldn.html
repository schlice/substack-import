Because while individual Justices may have liked the *outcome* of the
case (i.e. what it provided), they didn't like the *Constitutionality*
of how it did what it did.

While it provided a result they may have liked, it did it in a wholly
unconstitutional way.

That's why it couldn't be saved. The Court cannot keep a decision on the
books because they like the outcome. They can only keep a decision on
the books if it is Constitutional. And *Roe* was not constitutional
because it was based on a "Constitutional right" which did not actually
exist in the Constitution.

The *right* people to make abortion legal are legislators at the state
or federal level, not the courts.

The Court was right to overturn *Roe*, not because abortion is bad, but
because the courts are not the place to create law. It's up to lawmakers
to make law. And in many states, they have done just that. Abortion is
legal in many states. Many other states have placed *limits* on
abortion, and a few states have banned abortions completely.

Abortion is an issue to be decided by the states. If the people in that
state want abortion, they will vote in legislators who will allow it in
their state. Abortion is not an issue to be decided by the courts.
