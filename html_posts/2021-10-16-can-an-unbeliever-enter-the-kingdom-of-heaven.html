No. The book of Revelation provides the answer to why this is.

When we are all judged, *someone* will have to pay for that sin.

If you are a believer, then it is Jesus who paid for your sin with his
death and resurrection.

If you are not a believer, then you must pay for your own sin.

God does not allow those with sin debt into heaven. He is perfect, and
Jesus is perfect. He expects nothing less from us in his kingdom as
well. He is a just judge, so all sin must be paid for.

The believer has had his sin debt paid by Jesus, and can thus enter the
kingdom. The unbeliever still owns his sin debt, and is thus cast out.
