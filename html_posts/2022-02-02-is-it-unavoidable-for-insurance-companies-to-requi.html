My company already does this. However, it\'s not with COVID vaccines.

If you are a non-smoker, for example, you get a discount on your monthly
health insurance premiums. The more healthy habits in which you partake,
the more discounts you can earn.

So it\'s not necessarily that the unvaccinated will pay more, it\'s that
the vaccinated will pay less. In this way, it is not a punishment for
being unvaccinated, but an incentive to be vaccinated.

The difference is a carrot versus stick difference.
