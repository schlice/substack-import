**Can I sue someone for posting negative things about me and where I
live but not my name?**

In general, no. Freedom of speech and all.

You can't sue someone for saying or posting negative things about you.

You *might* be able to sue someone for **lying** about you. This is an
offense called "defamation." In order to prove defamation, you must
prove four things:

1.  The false statement was made as if it was truth
2.  The statement was published or broadcast somewhere, or at least
    delivered to a third person
3.  The defendant showed, at least, negligence in making the statement
4.  Some harm or damages were done to the person bringing the claim

If you can make all of these claims, you may be able to sue for
defamation. If you think you can, you should talk to a lawyer.
