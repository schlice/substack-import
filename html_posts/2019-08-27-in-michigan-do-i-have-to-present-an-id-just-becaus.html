**In Michigan, do I have to present an ID just because an officer asks
for it?**

Only if you are driving a car or performing some other licensed
activity. If you're driving a car, you must present a valid drivers
license upon demand.

Since there is no requirement for identification at any other time out
in public, you cannot be compelled to produce identification in any
other routine "walking down the street" situation.

Whether or not you are required to identify yourself when a police
officer asks is a different story. If you are just having a general
"how's the weather" conversation with a police officer, you're under no
obligation to tell them anything at all, including your name. Those are
called "consensual interviews" because you are communicating by mutual
consent (like, you know, normal people). If you ever are concerned
whether or not you are being questioned or the conversation is a
consensual interview, just ask if you're free to go. If you are, most
likely your conversation was a consensual interview.

If the police have conducted what is known as a *Terry stop* (named
after the Supreme Court case in 1968 *Terry v. Ohio*), whether or not
you are required to identify yourself is a matter of state law. Most
states have established "stop and identify" laws that state that if the
police are conducting a *Terry stop*, you are required to, at a minimum,
provide your real name and address.

Michigan does not have a "stop and identify" law, so you are not
required to identify yourself even during a *Terry* stop. If you are
engaged in a *Terry* stop, you simply need to say that you want to
remain silent. Just saying, "I wish to remain silent" is enough.
