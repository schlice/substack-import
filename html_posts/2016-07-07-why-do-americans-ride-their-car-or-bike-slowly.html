In the United States, we have very few places which allow speeds over
120 kph (roughly 75 mph). Most places don't allow speeds that fast.

Watch any episodes of *Top Gear* where the presenters shot clips in the
USA, and you'll see them lamenting about how they can't go over 55 mph
on some roads (roughly 88 kph).
