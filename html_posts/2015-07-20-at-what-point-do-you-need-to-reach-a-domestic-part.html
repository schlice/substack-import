**Content:** [Prenuptial agreements can be entered into at any time
before you are married. They come into force at the time of a divorce
from marriage, so as long as you enter into the agreement at some time
before you are married, it is a qualifying prenup. If you enter into an
agreement after you are married, it is called a **postnuptial
agreement**, but it carries the same weight, and still comes into force
at the time a divorce is filed.\
\
Postnups are gaining in popularity, but as a way to save a marriage, not
as a guide for an impending divorce.]{.rendered_qtext}
