Indeed it is. Almost all males\* age 18--25 must register with the
Selective Service System. Citizens are required to register within 30
days of turning 18. Immigrants are required to register within 30 days
of arrival in the United States.

The people in this demographic find out really quickly whether or not
they are registered, because failing to register means that you will not
be eligible for federal student aid. But they've made it really easy:
while you're filling out the
[[FAFSA](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=a7da40&url=https://studentaid.gov/){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="studentaid.gov"}]{.qlink_container}, it allows you to check
your registration status, and optionally allows you to register online
while you're filling out the application.

Also if you don't register, you won't be eligible for federal job
training, or a federal job. You may be prosecuted and face a fine of up
to \$250,000 and/or jail time of up to five years. If you're an
immigrant to the U.S., you will not be eligible for citizenship.

\* As of July 22, 2021, the Senate Armed Services Committee voted to add
language to the National Defense Authorization Act requiring women to
sign up for the draft. They've been working on it since 2016, when the
military opened all combat jobs to women. That year, they created a
commission to study requirements for draft registration. Last year, that
commission recommended expanding the draft to women, as a "necessary and
fair step."

So this may be the year that women are added to the draft.
