The answer to your question can be found in your Governing Documents. In
general, the ARB Guidelines and the Rules & Regulations can be modified
by the Board alone, at any time. Other documents in your Governing
Documents (your Declaration of Covenants, your Articles of Incorporation
and your Bylaws) require different amounts of homeowners to approve in
writing of any changes.

In general, the Board could make a new rule that white rocks are no
longer allowed in landscaping. Even that change, though, would have to
be voted on during a Board meeting. Board meetings are open to all the
homeowners, and you should be notified in some public manner (a bulletin
board, an email, etc). But what do they plan on doing regarding people
who already have white rocks? Are they going to force those people to
replace those rocks with another color?

Legally, they can make you change out your existing rocks with new ones;
they can force you to remove your existing white rocks at your expense
and replace them with rocks of a different color. But that's a pretty
awful move for a Board to pull. There would have to be some really good
reason to make you remove your white rocks and replace them with another
color. They are making you expend money to get that replacement done,
and they should know that this would be a pretty unpopular move,
especially if there are a lot of people with white rocks. I'd want the
Board to explain their reasoning, and it better be something more
pressing than "I don't like the look of white rocks."
