**Content:** [In most states, insurance information is only provided to
the DMV at the time of vehicle registration. So the DMV only knows that
the vehicle was insured at the time that it was registered.\
\
Officers require an insurance card during a traffic stop because they
need to see that the insurance is \"current.\" For the most part,
insurance companies do not routinely provide this information to the
DMV, and this information is not normally transmitted to the officer
when running the plate.\
\
It is the driver\'s responsibility to carry an updated insurance card
for the vehicle to show that the vehicle has active, current
insurance.]{.rendered_qtext}
