**Can Trump pardon Roger Stone after the judge went through Stone\'s 7
felony crimes in her court?**

Yes.

Now that Stone has been convicted and sentenced to 40 months in Federal
prison, the President can pardon him. He'll wait for the judicial
process to move forward, but the President has already characterized
Stone's prosecution as a "miscarriage of justice." We fully expect Trump
to pardon him, or at the very least, commute his sentence.
