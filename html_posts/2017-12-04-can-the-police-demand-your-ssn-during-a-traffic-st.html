As a driver, you are required to give your real name to police, and in
almost all states, failing to provide your real name is against the law.

**Your Social Security Number is not part of the information required
during a traffic stop.**

You are required to give your name and your address. You are required
(if you are the driver) to provide your real driver's license, proof of
insurance, and vehicle registration.

You are not required to answer any other questions.

I'm becoming much more attune to when I should be giving out my PII
(personally identifying information) and when I should not. I was
checking my son into the ER (he's okay now) and they wanted my insurance
card (of course) and my credit card (also, of course), but they also
asked me for my SSN. I said, "Why? You already have my insurance card."
She said, "Yeah, it usually helps if the person doesn't have insurance."
I said, "Well then, let's try leaving it out and see if the system
accepts it, shall we?" And we did, and it seemed to work.
