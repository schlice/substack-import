**I'm scared of having sex with a girl and ends up falsely accusing me
of rape later on. What should I do?**

Um, don't do it?

False rape accusations can ruin your life. Basically, you need to be
such good friends with a girl that you'd probably marry her.

So do that.

Marry her. Then have sex with her.
