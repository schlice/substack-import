**Does Air Force One have an escape pod for the president?**

No. And before you ask, Air Force One doesn't have laser blasters or
rocket pods that they can use to fight aliens.

You can be sure that Air Force One is equipped with ECM (electronic
countermeasures) as well as flare and chaff pods, although the exact
loadout of the aircraft is classified.

But it's an aircraft, and it still has to abide by the fundamental laws
of physics: the heavier you make it, the more fuel you will expend
keeping it airborne. And there is, indeed, a maximum takeoff weight for
a 747. Adding everything you want into an airplane means leaving out
some things that you might need.

The aircraft itself is the escape pod.
