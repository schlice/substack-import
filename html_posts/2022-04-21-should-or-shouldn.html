There's a lot of fearmongering going on right now. It would make sense
to look at the facts.

The Reedy Creek Improvement District is not exempt from property taxes.
Disney is the largest taxpayer in Florida, paying upwards of \$300
million in property taxes to Orange and Osceola counties, and another
\$250 million in other state taxes.

But dissolving the District would revert control of the area back to
Orange and Osceola counties, including paying for fire, medical, and 911
services. OCSO provides law enforcement in the District, but in a
contract deal. Dissolving the District would mean that OCSO would
provide the same service, but with no additional revenue to do it.
County residents could be faced with a tax increase in order to pay for
those services. Disney, as a county business, would be forced to pay
higher taxes, just like all the other residents of Orange and Osceola
counties.

But the move wouldn't be neutral for Disney, either. Along with the
increased taxes that Disney will be forced to pay, Disney allows
construction in the District at the pleasure of the Walt Disney
Corporation. If the District is dissolved, things like construction
permits, zoning applications, and ecological impact fees would all
revert to the respective counties, hamstringing Disney's ability to
rapidly grow.

However, these special districts (there are six of them in Florida which
were created before Florida's Constitution was ratified) are granted to
*corporations*, and these days, Florida generally looks askance at
special improvement districts which were created before the State
Constitution and are not necessarily in line with it, but were
grandfathered in, being granted to for-profit corporations.

In doing this now, legislators in Florida are sending a message to
Burbank: RCID exists at the pleasure of the State of Florida, and it is
by no means immovable. State Rep. Randy Fine (R.-Melbourne Beach) is a
sponsor of the bill, HB3C, which eliminates the Reedy Creek Improvement
District. "Disney is a guest in Florida," he [[said Monday in a
tweet](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=8fa71a&url=https://twitter.com/VoteRandyFine/status/1516417533825454083?s%3D20%26t%3DF0mV1S3erBQRx1kVbfP4fA){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="twitter.com"}]{.qlink_container}. "Today, we remind them."

***So what's likely to happen?***

If RCID is dissolved, it's very likely that Disney and Orange and
Osceola counties will re-negotiate a new special improvement district
agreement that allows Disney to keep its control, but one which is in
keeping with the State Constitution, and (if I was a betting man) one
that keeps Disney's corporate front-office in Burbank out of the
political business of the state of Florida (at least publicly). Saying
that you'll protect your LGBT employees is one thing. Saying that you'll
fight to overturn a duly-enacted Florida state law is quite another.

(EDIT) It appears the Florida Legislature has passed the bill which will
dissolve RCID, and it goes to the Governor's desk for signature. HB3C
says "Notwithstanding s. 189.072(2), any independent special district
established by a special act prior to the date of ratification of the
Florida Constitution on November 5, 1968, and which was not
reestablished, re-ratified, or otherwise reconstituted by a special act
or general law after November 5, 1968, is dissolved effective June 1,
2023. An independent special district affected by this subsection may be
reestablished on or after June 1, 2023, pursuant to the requirements and
limitations of this chapter."

At the same time, Disney has vowed to file a lawsuit against the state,
claiming that Florida is violating the company's First Amendment right
to free speech by the move, and that it violates FS 189.072, which shows
that they're literally grasping at straws. Looks like Disney is going to
have to renegotiate the terms of RCID.
