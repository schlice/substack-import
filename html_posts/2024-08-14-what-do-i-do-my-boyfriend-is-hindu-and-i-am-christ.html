You *leave* your respective families and create *your own* family. Your
marriage is not about them, it's about you.

Nevertheless, which wedding you choose, and which family you upset, is
less important that which **religion** you choose. And ultimately, since
you are Christian, you have undoubtedly heard about being "unequally
yoked," correct?

A **yoke** is a wooden structure used to hook two oxen together. This
way they can pull a load twice as heavy as one ox could pull. If one ox
is significantly stronger than the other, or one ox starts pulling in
the wrong direction, they are considered *unequally yoked*, and they
don't make much progress.

Paul makes the same comparison in the Bible:

> *Do not be unequally yoked with unbelievers. For what partnership has
> righteousness with lawlessness? Or what fellowship has light with
> darkness? \-- 2 Cor 6:14 ESV*

Now I'm not saying that one of you is good and the other is bad, or that
one of you is righteous and the other is lawless. But the point still
remains. If you marry someone from another religion, you two won't be
"pulling in the same direction," so to speak. Uniting a Christian with a
non-Christian is going to make for a very difficult marriage.

So one of you is going to have to change religions. And knowing what you
know about how God has saved you, are you really planning on giving that
up? Is he planning on giving up his faith?

**TL;DR:** I'm not worried about your marriage arrangements or whether
or not you upset your respective families. I'm worried about your
*soul*. So is God.
