This should work for either the Nord N100 or the Nord N10 5G on Metro by
T-Mobile.

First of all, Metro's requirements for unlocking phones for free:

- The device must be purchased from Metro by T-Mobile.
- The device must not be reported as lost, stolen or blocked.
- One hundred eighty (180) days must have passed since the device's
  activation date.

If the above are true, Metro will automatically unlock your device for
you within two business days of all of the above requirements being met,
assuming the device supports remote unlock. Once they do, If the device
does not support remote unlock, Metro will send you a text notifying you
that the device is eligible to be unlocked and provide you with
instructions to complete the unlock.

If you want to unlock your device before the 180 days are up, or if the
device was not originally purchased from Metro, or some other condition
prevents you from remotely unlocking your device with Metro's
permission, you won't be able to unlock the device for free. In that
case, the steps to follow are:

1.  Open the Phone app on your Nord.
2.  Dial **\*#060#** in order to get your device's IMEI number.
3.  Write the number down on a piece of paper or somewhere else so it
    can be referenced later.
4.  Visit the [[MetroPCS Device

    rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
    onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
    qt-tooltip="androidsimunlock.com"}]{.qlink_container} service and
    select your phone.
5.  Enter your phone's IMEI number and complete the checkout process
6.  You might have to wait a bit, but you will receive an email upon
    confirmation that your phone has been successfully unlocked
7.  Insert a non-Metro SIM card
8.  Use the Device Unlock app or Unlock app pre-installed on your device
    and follow instructions on-screen. Select "Permanent Unlock"
9.  If successful, you should see a message saying "Unlock Approved:
    Mobile device is permanently unlocked"

If you have any trouble with this, contact Metro at 888-863-8768. You
may need to contact them if:

- You do not see the apps or settings listed for your device. You may
  need a PIN code for unlock, which Metro's Care team can provide.
- You meet the eligibility requirements but cannot unlock your device.
- You have a device not listed above.
