**If Trump lied to Mueller but is not convicted in an impeachment, can
he still be charged after he leaves office?**

Yes.

A Federal prosecutor would have to bring charges of lying under oath to
a Special Prosecutor against Trump after he leaves office however that
may be (either at the end of his term or by impeachment and removal from
office).

Impeachment and removal or non-removal from office is outside of the
legal process.
