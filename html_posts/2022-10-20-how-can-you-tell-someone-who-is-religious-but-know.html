You wouldn't, unless their "religion" is one that actually believes in a
god, but the nontheist is part of that religion. In that case, you show
them the tenets of the faith in which they purportedly believe, and show
them that their religion actually does believe in the existence of a
god.

In other words, there are plenty of religions which are "religious" but
don't believe in a god. Collectively, they are called "nontheistic
religions." For example, Hinduism does not require strict belief in any
one god. Jainism believes that the universe is eternal and uncreated,
and therefore there is no omnipotent creator god.

So maybe the problem is that this person simply believes in the wrong
religion. Perhaps they need to believe in a religion which has no god.
