Usually it's just to take those complaints with a huge dose of salt.

Boards are well aware of the frequent flyers when it comes to those who
make complaints. Don't get me wrong, the Board will still do its due
diligence in ensuring there is no violation, but it's unlikely that the
Board would take any meaningful action in anything resembling a timely
manner.

The story of the boy who cried wolf would be a useful object lesson
here.
