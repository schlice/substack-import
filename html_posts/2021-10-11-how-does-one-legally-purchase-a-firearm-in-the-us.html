So there are two sets of requirements, Federal and state. State-level
requirements will vary depending on what state you are buying a gun in.

But in general at the Federal level, you must:

1.  be a citizen or legal resident
2.  be at least 18 years old to buy shotguns and rifles or ammunition
3.  be at least 21 years old to buy handguns
4.  pass a Federal background check conducted through the National
    Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS)

*Most* states comply with Federal law in their own gun laws in terms of
sales, but some states have stricter requirements. Be sure to check with
your gun dealer to learn what the laws are in the state in which you
wish to purchase.

If you buy a gun from a lawful gun dealer, you should automatically be
in compliance with all Federal and state laws where you are purchasing.
