Apple does this *every day* to circumvent security holes which allow
people to \"jailbreak\" their iPhones.

\"Jailbreaking\" is a term which describes a method by which people can
circumvent security measures in *their own phones* (which is different
from what the FBI did by the way) so that they can gain access to
certain system functions which Apple has restricted by default in iOS.

In order to \"jailbreak\" a phone, hackers use portions of the iOS which
have weak security, and they use those weak areas to inject system-level
commands which allow ordinary users to \"elevate\" their security
posture, allowing them to run those system-level commands.

It\'s a cat-and-mouse game. Hackers find a vulnerability in iOS, they
exploit it to build a \"jailbreak\" for iPhone users; users jailbreak
their phones using the exploit, Apple publishes a \"patch\" fixing the
security hole discovered by the hackers.

Ultimately, if Apple finds out what the Cellebrite team did to get into
the phone, they will fix that flaw and push out a patch to iPhone 5Cs.
