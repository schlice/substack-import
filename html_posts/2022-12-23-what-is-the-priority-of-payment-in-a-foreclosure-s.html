**Note that this answer varies by state, although it pretty much holds
true across the US. My example specifically applies to Florida, your
mileage may vary. Check your state's laws on Homeowner's Associations to
find how your state handles this.**

Generally, the HOA can still foreclose on a line if a superior mortgage
is present, so long as the mortgage was recorded before the HOA's lien
claim.

That said, **the HOA becomes the first non-mortgage lienholder.**

The mortgage lender gets paid first. Any other mortgages (i.e. if the
house had a second mortgage against it) are then paid.

Any remaining proceeds go to the HOA to satisfy their lien.

Any remaining proceeds are distributed to any other lienholders based on
the order of the recording of their liens.

Finally, once all liens are satisfied and the house is sold, any
remaining profits are distributed to the homeowner.
