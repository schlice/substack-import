An HOA can only demand of its members what it is permitted to demand
either by state law, or within its Covenants, Conditions, and
Regulations (CC&Rs), the foundational documents which establish the
authority of the HOA. The HOA can only demand that homeowners abide by
the CC&Rs.

But here's where people get tripped up. While the CC&Rs can usually only
be modified through an amendment process and a percentage of homeowners
agreeing to those changes, the CC&R usually permits the HOA to create
Rules and Regulations (R&Rs) which assist in the administration of the
rules in the CC&R, and those are created and edited by the Board of
Directors. And you have to follow those rules as well. And yes, the HOA
Board can demand you follow the R&Rs or face fines, liens and potential
loss of your home. Usually, those rules revolve around what the outside
of your home must look like, and who gets to approve those changes.

You can certainly legally challenge those Rules and say that they
violate the CC&R documents, or that they violate state law, but if they
don't do either, and the Board can articulate a valid reason that the
rule in question advances the responsibility of the Board (to keep home
values as high as possible), then the rule is probably not illegal, and
you have to do it.
