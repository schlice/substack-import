**Content:** [Since most modern-day bank vaults are made from
steel-reinforced concrete, I would say that it would be close. The
PGU-14 depleted uranium projectiles fired by the GAU-8 cannon might
penetrate the walls of a modern bank vault.\
\
Modern bank vaults are made from steel-reinforced concrete. The concrete
is extremely strong, but it is thin, usually only about three inches
thick, but it uses steel-reinforcement and special additives to make the
concrete extremely strong. It\'s roughly 10 times stronger than the
18-inch thick concrete that used to be used to make bank vaults.\
\
PGU-14 rounds will penetrate anywhere from 55 to 75 mm of hardened
steel\
\
So it\'s close.]{.rendered_qtext}
