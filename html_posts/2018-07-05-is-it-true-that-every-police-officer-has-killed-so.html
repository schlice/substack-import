**Is it true that every police officer has killed someone sometime in
their career?**

This couldn't be further from the truth.

Just look at the statistics. Police kill, on average, 1000 people per
year. There are between 800,000 and 1 million sworn police officers in
the United States. The numbers simply don't add up.

The vast majority of police officers will never fire their weapons
outside of the range.
