Google is very informative sometimes. Wikipedia, even more so. This from
our friends at Wikipedia:

> The concept of a sovereign citizen originated in 1971 in the [[Posse
> Comitatus
> movement](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=cfee35&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posse_Comitatus_(organization)){.external_link

> qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container} as a teaching of
> Christian Identity minister William P. Gale. The concept has
> influenced the tax protester movement, the Christian Patriot movement,
> and the redemption movement (which claims that the U.S. government
> uses its citizens as collateral against foreign debt).
>
> Gale identified the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States
> Constitution as the act that converted sovereign citizens into federal
> citizens by their agreement to a contract to accept benefits from the
> federal government. Other commentators have identified other acts,
> including the Uniform Commercial Code, the Emergency Banking Act, the
> Zone Improvement Plan, and the alleged suppression of the Titles of
> Nobility Amendment. Some of those in the movement believe that the
> term \"sovereign citizen\" is an oxymoron and prefer to label
> themselves as individuals \"seeking the
> Truth\".[\[1\]](#IeGjR){#cite-IeGjR .citation_link}
