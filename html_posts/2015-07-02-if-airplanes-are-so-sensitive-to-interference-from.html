**Content:** [There are several factors at play here:\

- Aircraft aren\'t as sensitive as most airlines make them out to be.
  Testing this sort of thing is very difficult because of FCC rules and
  the fact that no one wants to be inside an airplane that we blast with
  radio waves to try to make the airplane crash. It would be ideal if we
  take an airplane out to the desert, turn it on, and then blast radio
  waves inside the airplane, but FCC regulations don\'t allow that sort
  of testing anywhere. So we\'re having a hard time actually committing
  the equipment and the airplane to do the test. That said, the airlines
  err on the side of caution and simply disallow the technology that
  they haven\'t fully tested.
- Aircraft are supposed to be shielded against outside radio waves. In
  some cases, the shielding has failed and someone has had a
  transmitting device on and interference has happened. But it\'s not as
  big of an issue as has been made of it. I can guarantee you that on
  every aircraft, there is at least one wanker who simply sets his phone
  on vibrate instead of turning it off, and there is at least one person
  who truly believes that flipping the little switch on the side of the
  iPhone to vibrate actually switches the phone off. So I can guarantee
  you that on every flight, there is at least one person with a phone
  on. It hasn\'t caused any crashes that we know of. It has definitely
  caused interference, but never so much that the aircraft was no longer
  capable of flight.
- There are far more cost-effective and simple methods of crashing a
  flight. Fact is, terrorists aren\'t out there trying to crash planes.
  The 9/11 scenario won\'t happen again, so that avenue (turning
  commercial aircraft into missiles) is closed. A terrorist simply needs
  a Stinger missile and he can shoot down a plane from the ground. No
  need to try to use complex electronics to scramble the avionics from
  the inside; far too complex.
