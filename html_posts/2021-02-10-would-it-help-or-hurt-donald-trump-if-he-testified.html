**Would it help or hurt Donald Trump if he testified at his second
impeachment trial?**

Neither.

No one in the Senate uses that trial to change their opinions. The trial
is for your benefit, and the benefit of the media.

I'm ready to make a wager for you right now: I already knew that the
Senate would vote to grant themselves the authority to hold the trial,
somehow usurping the authority of the Judiciary and declaring that the
trial is constitutional (which they are not allowed to do). At best,
they can declare that they have the authority to try a former president,
which is in essence what they have done, even though (as Trump's
attorneys argued) it amounts to a *Bill of Attainder* and is thus
unconstitutional.

So you'll find a number of Republicans who do not vote to convict simply
because they too believe that it is unconstitutional.

But what you will **not** find is 67 Senators to vote to convict. I
predict that regardless of the "evidence" presented in the "trial," you
will not find 67 Senators to vote to convict Trump.

So because it will neither help nor hurt the President's case for him to
speak, he will not.
