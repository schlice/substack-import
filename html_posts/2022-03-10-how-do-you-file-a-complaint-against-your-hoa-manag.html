In a single family HOA community, it is your Board of Directors which
has direct communication with your HOA management company. I would
suggest starting with the Board.

If you don't get any results from the Board, you can attempt to complain
directly to the HOA management company. Depending on their size,
however, you may not get any satisfactory results.

In that case, you should address your complaint to the state agency
which regulates HOA Management companies. In most states, HOA Management
companies must be licensed by the state, and you can file your complaint
with that agency which oversees these companies.
