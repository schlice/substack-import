**Is it strange for me to think that my litigation attorney is profiting
off all the lawsuits that I had to file through him (all settlements in
my favor so far)?**

**Yes, it is strange.**

Unless you expected your attorney to work for free, he should be
receiving a profit for his work.

You agreed to his level of profit as opposed to yours when you retained
him. Finding it strange that he is actually making the money he agreed
to make is therefore odd.
