I don't like the idea of mandatory gun ownership in the United States
any more than I like the idea that I am required to purchase health
insurance.

Both of them are a bad idea.

We know that eating apples is good for you. "An apple a day keeps the
doctor away." So why don't we mandate that people eat apples?

Because in the United States, we are free to live our lives as we see
fit. This freedom allows us to make choices. Not all choices are good,
and not all are bad. Ideally, you'd like to make far more good choices
in your life than bad ones, but the occasional chocolate binge or energy
drink isn't going to kill you. All things in moderation.

So mandatory \*anything\* is counter to what we believe is foundational
for this country.

I think what we really should do is to *remove as many barriers to legal
gun ownership as we possibly can*, while keeping guns out of the hands
of criminals or the criminally insane. That means: easier licensing,
50-state reciprocity, and forced enforcement of gun crimes against
criminals.
