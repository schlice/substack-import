**Content:** [I think the TrackingPoint system (combination spotting
scope and targeting computer) will make sense for sniper units. They
effectively do the job of the spotter on a two-man sniper team. If the
accuracy of the unit pans out in real world applications, the unit could
potentially allow a single sniper to go out alone and still fire
effectively at long distance.\
\
The system doesn\'t make sense for smaller, shorter-range weapons (i.e.
rifles, handguns, etc). It\'s effectively overkill. It\'s more than you
need on such a weapon.]{.rendered_qtext}
