**Is it legal for a job application to ask about disabilities? I\'m
applying for a bartender position at Sheraton (U.S.) and it lists 18
different physical/mental disability examples.**

This may be an example of Federal reporting on people with disabilities.
It's a little different than the employer specifically asking you about
any disability you may have. Most job applications contain some Federal
reporting, and they often contain a list of examples of potential
disabilities. At the end of the list, they give you the option to say
"Yes, I have a qualifying disability," "No, I do not have a qualifying
disability," or "Decline to Answer."

This is only for Federal reporting of people with disabilities. **At any
time, you can Decline to Answer and it will not affect your ability to
apply for the position.** These questions are for Federal reporting on
the hiring of persons with disabilities, and is not illegal to ask such
a general question. In no way does it have any applicability to whether
or not you receive a job offer. It would be a violation of the Americans
with Disabilities Act for this information to influence your ability to
receive a job offer. You can always decline to answer if you are
concerned about this.

It's similar to the questions regarding your ethnicity. The employer
cannot deny your application because of your race, but the Federal
government reports on the number of minorities who apply for, and who
are accepted for, jobs. Again, you can select "Decline to Answer" and it
will in no way affect your ability to apply for, or be selected for, the
position.

When it comes to disabilities, the employer can tell you the basic
physical and mental requirements of the job, and then they can ask you
one basic question about disability in relation to the job for which you
are interviewing:

> Can you perform the essential functions of the job, with or without
> reasonable accommodation?

That's it. If you answer no, they can probably look elsewhere. But if
you answer yes, they cannot otherwise deny you the position because of
disability.

An employer can require a post-offer medical exam, but it cannot
withdraw the job offer simply because you are found to have a
disability. They can withdraw the job offer **only** if they can show
that you are unable to perform the essential functions of the job (with
or without reasonable accommodation), or that you pose a significant
risk of causing substantial harm to yourself or others.

For example, let's say Sheraton requires a post-offer exam and you are
found to have epilepsy. Sheraton is worried that being around knives and
glassware that you could injure yourself or others. You show that your
epilepsy is well controlled on medication, and you can show work history
which proves that you can accomplish the essential functions of the job.
Sheraton cannot withdraw the offer because of your disability or they
would be in violation of the ADA.
