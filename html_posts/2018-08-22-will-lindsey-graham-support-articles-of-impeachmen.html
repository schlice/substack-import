**Will Lindsey Graham support articles of impeachment based off of his
argument that it's about restoring honor and integrity to the office and
it's not based off of committing any specific crime?**

Only if he's keen on turning the impeachment process into little more
than a Congressional censure.

Weaken impeachments by impeaching actions which are not "high crimes and
misdemeanors" and impeachments become meaningless. The Senate would
never vote to remove a president from office in order to "maintain the
honor and integrity of the office" even if it was fully controlled by
the opposing party.

We don't impeach presidents because we don't like them. We already have
a Constitutional process to remove presidents we don't like: **don't
re-elect them**. Every four or eight years, the political power in this
country changes hands seamlessly and without bloodshed. We've been doing
it for hundreds of years.

Impeaching someone because you don't think he's "honorable" or upholds
the integrity which you (unilaterally) have decided the office *should*
hold is not a valid use of the impeachment process. You either don't
elect him, or you don't re-elect him.
