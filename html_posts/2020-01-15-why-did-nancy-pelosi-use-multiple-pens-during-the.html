**Why did Nancy Pelosi keep switching pens when signing the articles of
impeachment?**

Because she gives those pens out as gifts to the people who made those
articles possible.

As in, this is the pen that signed the Articles of Impeachment which
impeached Trump.

In truth, it's only the fourth time in our nation's history that a
president has been impeached, so whether or not you agree with them,
it's still a historic signing.
