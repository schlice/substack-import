**Content:** [Thanks for the A2A.\
\
If it was a true accident, then the \"victim\" is not a victim of
anything but accidental circumstances.\
\
If there was *negligence* involved in the accident (i.e. someone left a
fully loaded weapon with a safety off out on a table somewhere), you
could make a claim that the gun owner was acting in a negligent manner
and should shoulder some of the cost of the medical care, but a case of
negligence would be decided by the court.]{.rendered_qtext}
