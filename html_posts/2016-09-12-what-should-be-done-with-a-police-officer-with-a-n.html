Let's answer each specific question.

*Is this protected speech?*

This is most definitely protected First Amendment speech. ***That
said***, the department is allowed to regulate how officers appear in
public. Most departments (I found to my surprise\*) allow visible
tattoos while in uniform. Most departments do specify that the tattoos
may not be offensive. While it's clear that this tattoo is not
offensive, I can see how it may be misinterpreted. However, this is a
problem of the department's own making. By allowing visible tattoos,
it's clear that sooner or later they'd run into a problem like this.

*Should be be fired?*

Not only should he **not** be fired, but it would be stupid for them to
do so. Since (as we established already) the tattoo is protected First
Amendment speech, firing him or otherwise disciplining him over it would
be extremely problematic because not only is it protected by 1A, but it
*doesn't actually violate department policy.*

*What if he had the tattoo removed?*

Even *asking* him (as opposed to ordering him) to remove it would be
problematic. As you may know, removing tattoos is a painful process
requiring laser surgery. Since the department is requiring the surgery
for continued employment, does that make the tattoo removal surgery
payable under the department's health plan? If he has to take time off
to recover, is that covered under Worker's Comp?

\* When I was Active Duty in the US Air Force, uniform regulations
required that tattoos be not visible while in uniform. Therefore,
shoulder and torso tattoos were very popular. I hear that this
regulation may also have changed as well...
