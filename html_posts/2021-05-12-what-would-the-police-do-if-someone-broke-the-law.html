One way or another, the police will take everyone into custody. How?
Ultimately, a small group can't overpower the state.

The person's security guards may be able to call for backup, but the
backup will never be able to reach the suspect, as the police will
cordon off the area. Same with helicopter support; the FAA can restrict
helicopter traffic in that area if the police declare a local emergency.

Finally, if the police escalate the issue high enough, the governor (for
whom the state's police ultimately work) can activate the National
Guard. The governor can also appeal to nearby states or the federal
government if the force overwhelms the fully-constituted force of the
state's National Guard. And the federal government can send the US Armed
Forces to assist the state in quelling the insurrection. And before you
tell me that the US Armed Forces can't intervene, read some of the
oldest legislation in the country: the *Posse Comitatus Act* and the
*Insurrection Act.*

In other words, a small group simply can't overpower the state.
