Except that such an act would be in violation of the court order which
says that Apple controls the software, and it only leaves Apple\'s
possession with their permission.

The way this would work (if Apple does it)

- FBI brings phone to Cupertino
- Apple applies patch in Cupertino
- FBI (in Apple HQ) brute-forces the passcode.
- Apple flashes correct firmware on the phone.
- Apple returns phone to FBI.

Many people (yourself included) have confused what Apple is trying to
say is the danger here. The danger is not that the FBI would have the
software, because they won\'t. The danger is that if the FBI can unlock
*this* phone, they will want to unlock many phones in a similar way (all
with valid court orders, of course), and then foreign governments will
be next. Your data\'s insecurity will only be a court order away.
