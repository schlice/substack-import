**Content:** [So here\'s how this particular plea deal worked.\
\
The prosecutor believed he had enough evidence to charge with Murder 1.
Murder 2 is a *lesser-included offense* of Murder 1 (i.e. if you\'ve
committed a crime that meets the standard of Murder 1, you have also
committed a crime that meets the standard of Murder 2).\
\
So rather than go to trial and face the possibility of a Murder 1
conviction which would carry a minimum 58-year sentence, the prosecutor
offered a *plea bargain*.\
\
A plea bargain is a construct of the court system that allows the
defendant to accept a lesser sentence *in exchange for a guilty plea*.
This means that the defendant will plead guilty to Murder 2, and the
sentence has already been decided (30 years). It\'s a win for the
prosecutor because there is no trial, no jury, no waste of the court\'s
time and resources, and it\'s a small win for the defendant who will
only spend 30 years in jail (likely with the possibility for parole)
instead of a minimum 58 year sentence if he was tried and convicted of
Murder 1.\
\
As with any plea bargain, a judge must still accept the deal before it
is entered as a verdict. The trial is then reduced to a single hearing
before the judge, who reviews the terms of the plea agreement and
accepts/rejects them. There have been cases where judges have rejected
plea deals, but those are rare. Usually, judges quickly accept plea
deals.\
\
**Differences in Degrees**\
\
Murder charges vary by state. Some states even name them differently
(i.e. some call it \"Capital Murder\" instead of \"1st Degree Murder\",
some call it \"Voluntary Manslaughter\" instead of \"3rd Degree
Murder\") but in general the degrees are the same regardless of what
states call it.\
\
**1st Degree Murder** involves three elements which must be present in
order to meet the standard of the crime:\
]{.rendered_qtext}

- An unlawful taking of a life
- with malice
- and forethought.\

**2nd Degree Murder** involves only the first two (unlawful taking of a
life with malice). Forethought (planning) is not required.\
\
**3rd Degree Murder** (sometimes called **Voluntary Manslaughter**)
involves only the first element (the unlawful taking of a life). It
involves no forethought, and often results from circumstances that would
\"cause a reasonable person to become emotionally or mentally
disturbed.\" They are sometimes referred to as \"crimes of passion.\" If
you caught someone in bed with your wife and you killed him, this would
be considered voluntary manslaughter.\
\
To provide an example, if you kill someone in a bar fight, it would
generally be Murder 2, but if you had just found out that the person was
having sex with your wife, it might be reduced to Murder 3, or voluntary
manslaughter.\
\
**Involuntary Manslaughter** involves the taking of a life, but usually
through an intentional, or negligent, act which causes death. Drunk
driving would be considered involuntary manslaughter. Note that all
three murder charges include an \"intent\" to kill, whereas involuntary
manslaughter is different as there was no intent to kill. Charges such
as \"vehicular homicide\" and \"causing death by criminal negligence\"
are crimes that in the US would be equivalent to involuntary
manslaughter.
