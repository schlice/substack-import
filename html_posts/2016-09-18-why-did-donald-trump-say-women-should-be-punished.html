Not only did he not say this, but he never had to backtrack.

There was only ever controversy about it because he was *baited into
answering a trick question.* See, Trump's not a politician. He doesn't
know how to handle **bait questions** like a politician would. So the
news reporter baited him into answering a trick question and then used
it to slam him. Classic liberal media trick, and Trump totally fell for
it.

The questioner started off by saying that abortion is legal. Trump
agreed, abortion is legal. The questioner then asked that ***if abortion
was illegal***, would you punish women who get abortions? And Trump
dutifully followed the questioner right into the trap and answered that
yes, we are a nation of laws, and if we decided that abortion was
illegal, I would punish someone who got an abortion.

Boom. Got your sound bite right there. Headlines immediately followed:
"Trump would punish women who got abortions." The *context* of the
question isn't relevant. No matter what the actual question was, the
fact that Trump would actually punish a woman for getting an abortion
(even if it was illegal) was all that was needed.

You can't un-ring a bell. Once that information is out there, no matter
how twisted it is, it's out there. And while it was indeed twisted to
obfuscate the original meaning of the question, the headline is all that
40% of people are going to remember. You'd have to read into the article
in-depth to find the truth, that the questioner had posed a hypothetical
question to bait Trump into making a remark like he did.

And I can tell from the mere existence of this question that the
misinformation sticks in people's minds. I bet this is why they
categorized him as a misogynist with such vigor. They had the quotes in
hand!

But hey, never let the facts get in the way of a good slam against the
other party's candidate, right other answerers?
