**Is there a way to force a home owner association to prove that they
are equally giving people warnings over the same things?**

You can request all of the HOA's documentation on the notices they have
issued to homeowners, as well as meeting notes for all Board meetings,
but finding out whether or not they are providing equal warnings will be
difficult, if there is no record of how the HOA receives notices of
violations.

Secondly, the inequality must be deliberate. If a Board member receives
a notification of a violation directly from a homeowner and then forgets
and does not communicate that to the rest of the Board to send a notice,
is that inequality in warnings?

In our HOA, we have a centralized violation system that records reports
of violations and records what notices were sent and when. The notices
are auto-generated, so they are all recorded and available for homeowner
inspection. We advise our homeowners to report violations directly to
the Managing Agent who administers that system so that the violation can
be adequately recorded. We also advise them that they can talk to
anyone, including Board members, but we recommend that reports of
violations go to the Managing Agent. Email suffices as a way to record
interactions with any of our Board members or our Managing Agent.

If an HOA Board is not being forthcoming with their records, you may
have to involve a real estate attorney in your area who specializes in
HOA law.
