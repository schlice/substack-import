While I don\'t agree with your point about foregoing Miranda, we\'ll
just have to agree to disagree on that point.

We know that the system is adversarial. It was intentionally designed
that way, as adversarial legal systems mostly are present in common law
countries. Adversarial systems are ones in which counsel represents
clients in front of an impartial party. It is different from
inquisitorial systems in use by some civil law jurisdictions, where a
judge does all the questioning.

The police, as agents of the state, are part of the prosecution team.
The suspect, naturally, is a defendant. Therefore, the system is, in
fact, adversarial, and is only non-coersive in the sense that police can
lie to a defendant in order to get him to talk, as long as they are
non-coercive. For example, I can tell you that I found your fingerprint
at the scene of the crime (let\'s presume I did not). It is presumed
that the innocent person would dispute the evidence (\"That\'s
impossible, I was never in that house!\"), while the guilty person would
try to explain it away, or think, \"Crap, they got me\" and try to
explain what really happened.

However, I can\'t tell you that if you don\'t confess, I\'m going to
talk to DHS and make it so you never see your children again, so you\'d
better confess now. That\'s coercion, and would render that confession
useless, since we don\'t know whether or not the coercive interview
techniques actually influenced the plea.

We can overcome some of that bias by asking the defendant to recount
specific details of the crime that were never released outside of the
police investigators. If the suspect knows these details, it\'s a good
bet that he was telling the truth about his involvement.
