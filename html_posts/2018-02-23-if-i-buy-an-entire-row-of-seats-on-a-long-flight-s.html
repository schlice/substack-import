- You don't actually buy "seats" on a plane. You buy a "contract of
  carriage" which says the airline will take you from your origin city
  to your destination city.
- Each contract (affectionately known as a "ticket") needs to be
  assigned to a person. So you can't buy an entire row of seats without
  assigning actual passengers to those seats.
- Additionally, airlines frequently "oversell" airplanes, which means
  that they sell more "tickets" than there are seats on a plane. This is
  generally done because there are always a certain percentage of
  passengers who simply don't show up for the flight.

You check in to your flight and are assigned a seat at check-in. For
most airlines and in most scenarios, this process is "first come, first
served." There are some exceptions, such as frequent flyer status, but
for economy passengers, time of check-in determines who gets assigned
seats. Everyone else who has bought a ticket for that flight gets put on
a "standby" list to see if anyone doesn't show up.

When the airline's appointed time has passed (usually some time before
the flight is scheduled to depart, anywhere between 15 and 25 minutes
before), any passengers who have not checked in are "bumped" and the
airline can assign the remaining seats to other paid passengers holding
tickets for that flight, who are waiting on the "standby" list.

This allows the airline to be as efficient as possible and not fly empty
planes. It also prevents you from buying up a whole row of seats and
putting no one in them.

This means that if you buy a bunch of tickets, it is entirely up to the
airline whether or not they assign you those seats.

(EDIT) The airlines saw my answer and apparently in an effort to make me
look foolish, changed their business model. Okay, they may have changed
their business model to adapt to customer demands and to take advantage
of "better" seats, but whatever.

Now, most airlines allow you to buy *specific seats* on the airplane,
pay for them, and reserve them. So you can, in fact, buy an entire row
of seats.

However, since the airline "oversells" some flights, they can actually
seat people in those seats if they choose, as you must claim your seat
by 15 minutes before the flight or the airline can seat passengers in
those seats. You can't buy a whole row of seats, leave them open, and
then expect that in no way would the airline ever seat someone in those
seats. If there's no occupant of that seat (a cello, a cat, a car seat,
etc), they can seat someone there. At best, they'd refund you the price
of your ticket because they seated someone else there. At worst, you're
out of luck because you forfeited the seat by not having someone or
something in it.
