You can *read* both texts. You can only *follow* one.

Why? **Because the core beliefs they espouse are different.**

There are five main beliefs written in the Christian Bible which are
highly opposed by the Quran:

1.  The Bible states that there is one God in three persons - Father,
    Son, and Holy Spirit. The Quran says that there is only one god and
    that god has no parents, no children, or no equals.
2.  The Bible states that Jesus is the Word made flesh, conceived by the
    power of the Holy Spirit. The Quran says that Jesus was merely one
    of Allah's prophets.
3.  The Bible states that Jesus was crucified and rose from the dead.
    The Quran says that Jesus was not crucified, nor did he rise from
    the dead; Christians were only deceived to believe such claims.
4.  The Bible states that the Holy Spirit is one of the three persons of
    the Trinity. The Quran says that the angel Gabriel is actually the
    Holy Spirit, not God; he is a messenger of Allah.
5.  The Bible records many miracles and hundreds of prophecies. The
    Quran records no miracles or prophecies; the Quran is a miracle in
    itself.

These core beliefs are so diametrically opposed that you cannot believe
both books are true. You can only truly believe in the claims of one
book.
