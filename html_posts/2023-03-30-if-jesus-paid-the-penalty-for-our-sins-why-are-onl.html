Ah, an excellent question. The question is: *to whom is Christ's
forgiveness given*?

The answer is that the forgiveness of sins, by the grace of God, is
**offered** to everyone. *But not everyone* ***accepts*** *that gift.*

To get a gift, two things must happen: 1. someone must offer the gift,
and 2. someone must accept the gift. If 2 happens but not 1, that
doesn't make sense because you don't get a gift that wasn't offered to
you. But if 1 happens and not 2, then the person giving the gift is
standing there, holding a gift, and you don't take it. In either case,
you don't get the gift.

In the case of the unbeliever, it's the latter. Christ stands there,
offering the gift, and the unbeliever does not take it.

Here's another analogy. Let's say you have a curable disease but you
don't accept the treatment. The cure exists and is available for anyone,
but you don't get cured of the disease until you accept the treatment.

**You have to accept the gift of Christ's death and resurrection in
order to be saved by it.**

Unbelievers need the gift before they die. The forgiveness of sins is
only through Christ. Anyone can be in Christ through faith in the
Gospel.

**TL;DR:** The forgiveness is there, waiting for you to accept it. But
you must *believe* it to *receive* it!
