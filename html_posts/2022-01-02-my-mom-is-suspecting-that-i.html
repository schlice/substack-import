Why do you feel like you have to convince her of anything?

Live your life. Let her live hers. If you've told her you are not a
lesbian, that's it. That's the end of it. You can have whatever friends
you like; that doesn't change who you are.

Remember: the problem here is *her*, not *you*. You don't have to do
anything different. It's up to her to fix herself; it's not up to you to
fix her.

Original question:

My mom is suspecting that I'm a lesbian just because of the fact that I
have a lot of LGBQT+ friends. How can I convince her that I'm not?
