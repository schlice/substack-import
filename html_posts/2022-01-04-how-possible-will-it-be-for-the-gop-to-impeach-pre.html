1.  First, they need to win back the House. You only need a simple
    majority in the House to pass Articles of Impeachment.
2.  Then, they need to find an impeachable charge. But after Clinton and
    Trump, what is considered "impeachable" is considerably less these
    days, so this may not be too difficult.

But that said, because of Clinton and Trump, "impeachment" is utterly
meaningless. It's almost a "badge of honor" having been impeached.

It takes the Senate to remove a President from office, and that takes a
2/3 majority of the Senate to do. So even if he is impeached, he won't
be removed from office unless he does something so reprehensible that
even his own party would want to distance themselves from him.
