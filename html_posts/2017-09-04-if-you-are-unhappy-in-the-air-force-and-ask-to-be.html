They would tell you, "Goodbye!"

Look, the military isn't for everyone, which is one of many reasons the
United States doesn't bother with compulsory military service. Some
people simply aren't "suited" for military service. Some people simply
don't make the transition from civilian to military very easily, or at
all. We get that. The military gets that.

Believe it or not, you would not be the first person to ask to leave
after Basic Training. The military has actually dealt with this at least
once. In fact, they have dealt with it *so often*, that it has its own
classification of discharge:

**Entry Level Performance and Conduct Discharge**

> Inaptitude, failure to adapt to the military environment, failure to
> progress satisfactorily in a required training program, lack of
> effort, psychological or stress-related symptoms, lack of
> self-discipline, or minor disciplinary infractions are all examples of
> grounds for this separation. If the member is requesting separation
> for dependency/hardship or conscientious objection, the member may
> receive an entry level separation if the application or request is
> submitted while the member is in entry level
> status.[\[1\]](#GnVkv){#cite-GnVkv .citation_link}

Entry level status means essentially anyone who has been in continuous
military service for less than 180 days.

Separation under this provision is known as an "entry level separation"
and has no characterization (Honorable, General, Dishonorable, or UOTHC
\[Under Other Than Honorable Conditions\]), as there has not been enough
time in service to appropriately characterize the service.
