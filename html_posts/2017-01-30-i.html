First of all, everyone's experience at the Academy is different.
Although many people find it to be extremely difficult, it is
challenging for everyone. I think "absolute hell" is a little bit of an
overstatement of the challenges that you will face during your time at
the Academy. But remember, it gets better the longer you're there, and
nothing lasts forever. It's like Survivor. You need to outlast the bad,
and you'll get to the good. Guaranteed, or your money back.

Here's an insider hint in terms of academics: *they give you more
homework than you can possibly accomplish.* This means you have to
practice some form of time management to get the important stuff done.
It also means you have to determine if there is some homework that you
aren't required to do and that you personally don't need to do. If you
resign yourself to doing every scrap of homework that is thrown at you,
you'll never sleep because there is simply more work to do than can
possibly be accomplished in the time allotted.

Academic Call to Quarters (ACQ) is from 8 to 11 every weeknight. This
time is allotted to ensure that there is nothing that interrupts you for
three hours a night so you can get homework done. Manage your time
correctly, and you can get all of your work done during this window.

While there are some weekend activities (such as Saturday Morning
Inspections, or SAMIs), most weekends are your time. Once any squadron
activities are complete, your weekends are usually yours. Sundays, of
course, are reserved for your faith activities, if you choose.

The pass structure also tells you who will be around and when. Based on
your class, you will progressively get more and more freedom and more
passes. Freshmen will spend most of their weekend time in Arnold Hall,
since off-base passes will be few, and any free time off-base will
probably be spent with your sponsor family. In contrast, seniors don't
spend much of their free time on base, as they focus on transitioning to
life outside of the Academy, as an Air Force officer.

Look, I'm not gonna lie, freshman year will be tough. But you're tougher
than them. Many have gone before you, and some of us have even been
"fortunate" enough to be on the Dean's "other" list, if you know what I
mean. And we \*still\* graduated. A running Academy joke: You know what
they call the last graduate in the Order of Merit? Lieutenant.
