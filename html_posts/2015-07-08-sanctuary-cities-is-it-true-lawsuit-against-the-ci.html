**Content:** [Sanctuary cities notwithstanding, I can see lawsuits
against the city for harm caused by specific people failing for that
reason; lawsuits against police departments alleging specific harms
caused by police action or inaction have failed for similar reasons.\
\
The case law has shown that police have a general duty to protect
citizens, but the police do not have a specific duty to protect any
individual unless special arrangement has been made beforehand, or the
police have you in a custodial situation in which you cannot protect
yourself.]{.rendered_qtext}
