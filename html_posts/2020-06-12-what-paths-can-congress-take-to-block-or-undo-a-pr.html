**What paths can Congress take to block or undo a presidential executive
order?**

Congress can do what Congress does: write law.

Executive Orders are orders for Executive Branch departments which
advise them how to execute laws. Note that Executive Orders are not *new
law*, but they are interpretations of existing law.

So if Congress wrote a law and it was vague, or it allowed the Executive
Branch to use its discretion in how to do something, an Executive Order
can direct Federal agencies to act, **within the law**, a certain way.
For example, if the law provides for prosecutorial discretion, a
president may tell the Justice Department to not prosecute certain types
of criminals, within the bounds of prosecutorial discretion.

Let's say that Congress doesn't like what the Executive Branch is doing
with its discretion, or maybe what they are doing is not what lawmakers
intended. It would be up to Congress to re-write the law on
prosecutorial discretion to make the thing they didn't like unlawful.

It is important to note that this is where Congressional investigations
come from. Congress has the authority to investigate the Executive
Branch to gauge how they are implementing the laws they write, so that
they can change those laws.

At least, this is the way it's supposed to work.

What routinely happens is Congress goes to the courts to try to get an
injunction against the Executive from doing what they are doing, instead
of re-writing their own laws. The Executive often uses Executive Orders
to create new law outside of what Congress has given them. So as usual,
not everything works exactly the way it is supposed to work.

*If you don\'t like what I wrote, tough shit. If my answer is
grammatically low-quality or is un-cited opinion masquerading as fact,
downvote it. If you think I\'m wrong, write your own answer. But Quora
is a question-and-answer site, not a debate site. If you were simply
going to comment to tell me \"ackshually, you\'re wrong,\" then you're
the reason why I disable comments. Well done, Karen. You ruined it for
everyone.*
