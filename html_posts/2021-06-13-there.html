Because physiology isn\'t a choice, and your opinion about sex is not
shared by the majority of humans.

I mean, if it were up to me, I\'d change a lot of nasty things about the
functioning of the human body. But it\'s not.

Look, if you personally find sex disgusting, and you still want to have
a child, then artificial insemination is definitely a path which you
might personally choose. However, deciding this for the entire human
race is a little bit pretentious, don\'t you think?

The vast majority of the human race finds sex pleasurable, and
enjoyable.

In other words, you do you, and let the rest of us do us.
