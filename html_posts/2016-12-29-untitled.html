No one said you must answer your door.

It\'s just odd how the asker is asking, essentially, what did the cop
want, when the way to have determined, quite easily, what he wanted, was
to answer the door.

The asker didn\'t answer the door because the officer didn\'t have the
right to entry without a warrant (or an invitation). But that\'s not a
reason to not answer the door. It may be a reason to not allow entry. It
may be a reason to not open the door. But it\'s not a reason to not
answer the door at all.

The asker should at least be honest with himself/herself and say they
didn\'t answer the door for fear of the consequences.
