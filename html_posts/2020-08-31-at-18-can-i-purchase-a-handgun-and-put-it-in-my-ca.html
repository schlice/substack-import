**At 18, can I purchase a handgun and put it in my car in Wisconsin?**

Let's separate the "buying" from the "carrying in your car" questions.

Under Federal law, you must be 18 to purchase a handgun, but in
Wisconsin, you must be 21 to buy one from a registered dealer. Since
there are no background checks required for private sales in Wisconsin,
you can receive a handgun as a gift, or you can have one transferred to
you by your family, but you can't buy one yourself from a dealer. Even
in a private sale, if you are a prohibited person, it is illegal to buy
a firearm, but the seller hasn't committed a crime by selling the gun to
you.

However, despite what you may have been told, **open carrying in a
vehicle is NOT legal.** It is illegal to transport a loaded handgun
within reach while in a vehicle in Wisconsin without a permit.

So you can open carry while you are not in a car, but you may not open
carry in a car. Before you get in to drive, you must place the firearm
"out of reach" of the driver, so in a lockbox, or in a locked glove box,
or (preferrably) somewhere in the back of the car, like the trunk, in a
lockbox. You want to make extra sure that no one can accuse you of
having a gun "within reach," so even a locked glove box is not a great
idea. Somewhere in the back of the car, where the driver absolutely
cannot reach without stopping and getting out of the driver seat, is the
only way I'd transport a gun in a car.

When you get to where you're going, you may retrieve your handgun and
return it to your holster.
