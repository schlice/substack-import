Wow, a three-fer! Three questions in one!

Okay, let's dive into it.

> **Is there an association with Money and Satan?**

There is an association between money and evil.

> *For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evils. It is through
> this craving that some have wandered away from the faith and pierced
> themselves with many pangs. --- 1 Tim 6:10 ESV*

The implication here is that all wrongdoing can be traced back to an
excessive attachment to material wealth, and aggregating that wealth.

.

> **Why didn\'t Jesus use the money from the money bag Judas carried to
> pay temple tax instead of extracting from a fish?**

The story of the coin in the fish's mouth is an interesting teaching,
but it's more a teaching that was meant for Peter. And it's less about
the coin in the fish's mouth, and more about the interaction that leads
up to it.

The teaching begins when Peter and Jesus arrive at the temple and are
approached to remit the temple tax. The tax collectors came up to Peter
and asked him if Jesus pays the temple tax. Peter basically said "of
course He does," and then went to Jesus to ask about it. Jesus uses the
opportunity to teach a lesson. He asks Peter, "From whom do kings of the
earth take toll or tax? From their sons or from others?" Peter says
"from others." Jesus responds by saying, "So their sons are free."

This is a fascinating interaction. Jesus is comparing Himself and Peter
to earthly kings and their family. Jesus is comparing Himself to an
earthly king, and Peter would be compared to one of His sons. When a
king collects tax, he doesn't collect it from his own family, but from
others. The parallel is to Jesus' Kingdom. Jesus himself is the way to
God (John 14:6) and the true temple (John 2:21). And Jesus' "sons" (His
disciples) are "free" because they are part of His family.

But if they want to pay anyway so as to avoid offense, God has more than
enough resources to supply everything they need. Jesus tells Peter to go
cast a line into the ocean and take the first fish that comes out, and
in its mouth Peter will find a shekel, which Peter is to use to pay the
tax. In this way, Jesus is teaching Peter that they don't need to use
the money in the purse. God will provide everything they need.

> *And my God will supply every need of yours according to his riches in
> glory in Christ Jesus. \-- Phil 4:19 ESV*

.

> **Is it a coincidence that Judas who carried the money bag was the
> devil?**

It would be a coincidence if it were true. But Judas was not the devil.
Judas is Judas, and Satan is Satan. But we are well aware that Judas was
*heavily influenced by Satan*. Satan took Judas' heart. And we are also
well aware that this was **by design**. Jesus needed Judas to do what he
did so that Jesus could fulfill His purpose.

Secondly, Jesus *chose* Judas. It's unlikely that Jesus would choose the
devil to be His disciple.

Yes, Jesus called Judas "the devil." But that word, *diabolos,* also
means "slanderer" and it is used elsewhere in the Bible:

> *Their wives likewise must be dignified, not* ***slanderers****, but
> sober-minded, faithful in all things. \-- 1 Tim 3:11 ESV*
>
> *heartless, unappeasable,* ***slanderous****, without self-control,
> brutal, not loving good, \-- 2 Tim 3:3 ESV*
>
> *Older women likewise are to be reverent in behavior, not*
> ***slanderers*** *or slaves to much wine. They are to teach what is
> good, \-- Titus 2:3 ESV*

So it is just as correct to translate Jesus calling Judas a "slanderer"
rather than "the devil."

Jesus actually called Peter "Satan," but Jesus knew that Peter was not
actually Satan:

> *But he turned and said to Peter, "Get behind me, Satan! You are a
> hindrance to me. For you are not setting your mind on the things of
> God, but on the things of man." \-- Matthew 16:23 ESV*

So no, it doesn't make sense to say that Judas was the devil.
