**My dash cam captured a hit-and-run on the interstate including license
plates. It also shows that I was speeding. If I turn the video in to aid
police, will I get cited for the speed?**

In most cases, no.

In Colorado, a speed violation must be observed by a peace officer in
order to be a ticketable offense. Most states are similar. Therefore,
unless a peace officer saw you speeding, they can't give you a ticket.

In all practicality, you won't be cited for your speed simply because
that's not the case they are after. It would be considered "bad optics"
to cite the person turning over evidence in a crime, as it would
probably not engender much more help from other witnesses.

I think that in all cases, they'd let the speed violation slide so that
they could catch the actual criminal.
