**How do you stop getting prostitution text messages on a Sprint phone?
My daughter keeps getting messages, each from a different number, from
women who tell her they know \"what a man needs.\" Is there a report
option on Android phones for texts?**

Here are a few steps to can text message spam:

> - Delete text messages that ask you to confirm or provide personal
>   information: Legitimate companies don't ask for information like
>   your account numbers or passwords by email or text.
> - Don't reply, and don't click on links provided in the message: Links
>   can take you to spoof sites that look real but whose purpose is to
>   steal your information.
> - Treat your personal information like cash: Your Social Security
>   number, credit card numbers, and bank and utility account numbers
>   can be used to steal your money or open new accounts in your name.
>   Don't give them out in response to a text.
> - Place your cell phone number on the [[National Do Not Call
>   Registry](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=de6d4a&url=https://www.donotcall.gov/){.external_link
>   rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
>   onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
>   qt-tooltip="donotcall.gov"}]{.qlink_container}.
> - If you are an AT&T, T-Mobile, Verizon, Sprint or Bell subscriber,
>   you can report spam texts to your carrier by copying the original
>   message and forwarding it to the number 7726 (SPAM), free of charge.
> - Review your cell phone bill for unauthorized charges, and report
>   them to your carrier.

If you receive unwanted commercial text messages, you can also [[file a
complaint](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=893aaf&url=https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0341-file-complaint-ftc){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="ftc.gov"}]{.qlink_container} with the Federal Trade
Commission (FTC).

The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) also accepts complaints
about [[unwanted text
messages](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=018b4c&url=http://www.fcc.gov/guides/spam-unwanted-text-messages-and-email){.external_link

Here are a few steps to *prevent* text message spam:

- Don't text someone unless you know exactly who you are texting. If you
  send a text in order to get some free thing (a program, a picture, a
  newsletter, etc), or because they promised things like cheap
  mortgages, credit cards, or debt relief services, they have your
  number and can start sending you unsolicited messages, *which may be
  legal because* ***you*** *started the transaction!* This is likely how
  her number made it on to someone's list.
- Treat your cell phone number like it is protected personal
  information. You don't give your Social Security number out to anyone;
  don't give your cell phone number out either. If you end up getting on
  a spammer's list, you may be on it for life. It may then be resold a
  hundred times. Unfortunately, the only remedy in that case would be to
  get a new number from your carrier.
