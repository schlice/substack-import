**How often can a landlord perform compliance inspections legally?**

As often as he gives notice to provide.

Depending on the lease agreement, the landlord must give notice a
certain number of days in advance of a compliance inspection.

So long as he gives proper notice, he can conduct as many as he sees
fit.

Although, at some point, this behavior would border on harassment, since
there isn't a reasonable expectation that something would drastically
change between inspections. At that point, it would be worth contacting
a lawyer about your options.
