Remember that the jobs of the military and the police are vastly
different, and will always be an apples-to-oranges comparison. I am
speaking from both sides of the fence here, so I know.

Cops are trained to shoot until the threat stops. If he\'s still coming
at you, then you\'re not done shooting.

Cops are also not trained in martial arts.

Don\'t forget to account for the criminals who are high on opiates
(which have become incredibly popular here in Colorado, where pot is
legal), or the guy high on crack and heroin who is basically in a rage
and is impervious to pain.
