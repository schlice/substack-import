**Are Republicans glad they worked so hard to keep President Trump in
office so that he could spectacularly bungle the government response to
Coronavirus?**

There are simply so many incorrect assumptions in this question that
it's hard to keep up:

1.  Republicans didn't have to lift a finger to keep Trump in office.
    Democrats are so spectacularly incompetent that they couldn't even
    impeach and remove from office when they had all the evidence right
    there in front of them. Democrats in the House can't find their own
    ass with two hands and a map.
2.  Trump's quick action in closing the border to inbound persons from
    China was the single biggest factor in the slower than average rate
    of infection in the United States, so "spectacularly bungle the
    government response" is *just slightly* inaccurate. To be fair, he
    did make some mistakes, and he did misspeak (on more than one
    occasion) but overall the Federal response has been pretty good. He
    can do more, and should do more (and every expert has unanimously
    said so), but what he has done to date really can't be accurately
    characterized as a "spectacular bungle."
