**Are you allowed to break the window of a car if you see a child left
inside?**

No. You will likely be liable for any damages you cause to the car.

Even in California, they only passed a law in 2017 which states that you
can break into a car to save an **animal**'s life, and the protections
only kick in when breaking into the car is a **last resort** and you
have tried everything else.

So what do you do if you find a car with an abandoned child inside?

1.  Call 911. Do what the operator tells you.
2.  If the car is parked in front of a business, send another bystander
    inside to try to locate the owner of the vehicle.
3.  Don't break the window unless the 911 operator tells you to do so.
