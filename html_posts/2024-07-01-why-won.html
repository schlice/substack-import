It doesn't make sense, right? If this so-called God is so omnipotent and
omnipresent, why didn't He stop these people from suffering? It seems
all so pointless.

To phrase the question in another way: **why do bad things happen to
good people?**

First of all, **if you believe that somehow God is obligated to explain
Himself to us, you ought to do a better job reading the Bible**.

> Truly You are a God who hides Himself. --- Isaiah 45:15

> No one knows the thoughts of God except the Spirit of God. --- 1
> Corinthians 2:11
>
> The secret things belong to the Lord our God --- Deuteronomy 29:29
> NKJV

It appears as if the Bible is telling us we don't have the capacity to
understand God's infinite mind or the plans He has for us. It's
arrogance for us to believe we have the ability to understand the mind
of God. It's like you standing over a pregnant mother's womb and trying
to explain what life is like on the other side, in such a way that the
baby in the womb would understand. That baby simply doesn't yet possess
the capacity to understand. Paul told the believers in Corinth, "Now we
see but a poor reflection; then we shall see face to face. Now, I know
in part; then I shall know fully, even as I am fully known" (1 Cor.
13:12). Paul was basically saying that we may not ever gain full
understanding while we are alive on earth, and we probably need to learn
to accept that.

Secondly, **no one ever said that being a Christian would mean a
problem-free life**. If you've ever looked into any of the lives of the
great men and women of the Bible, their lives were not the most
glamorous. Look at Joseph. His brothers and sisters hated him so much,
they sold him into slavery. When in Egypt, he was thrown in prison,
falsely accused of rape, and threatened with execution. During the
entire ordeal, there is no indication in the Bible that God explained
His plan to Joseph. He was simply expected to live out his life in
less-than-complete understanding, as you and I are. *What pleased God
was Joseph's faithfulness when nothing else made sense*. Stephen was
stoned because he proclaimed God's name. James was put to death with a
sword for his faithfulness. Paul was persecuted, stoned, flogged, and
beheaded in a Roman prison. During their lifetimes, they never knew
God's great plan for them. Jesus said that life wouldn't be easy. He
said, "I have told you these things, so that in me you may have peace.
In this world, you will have trouble. But take heart! I have overcome
the world" (John 16:33).

Throughout the Bible, it tells us not only that bad times can happen,
but that we should ***expect*** bad times to come because they will. Yet
somehow, we still expect God to take away all of our problems, skipping
along ahead of us with his massive Godly leaf-blower, clearing our path
of any trials, hardships, or pain. This causes a great deal of anxiety,
even among long-time faithful, because life is hard.

The Bible tells us to not focus on trying to understand, not to focus on
trying to make all the pieces fit together. "Trust in the Lord, lean not
on your own understanding" (Prov. 3:5). We are not told to not try to
understand, just don't "lean on" your understanding, which means don't
make it an ultimatum. "God, you'd better explain yourself, or I'm outta
here!" That would be "leaning" on your own understanding, and we are
admonished against that.

So what does this all mean? Basically, expect trouble in life, and
expect that there will be situations we do not understand. Faith is the
point at which logic stops making sense. We must have faith that God
will keep His promises, and that everything we go through in this life
has a purpose, even though our minds do not have the capacity to
understand it.
