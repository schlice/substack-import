This is SCOTUS being reasonable.

They found it *reasonable* for healthcare workers to be vaccinated. In
their particular workplace setting, knowing what they will be exposed
to, and knowing who they can potentially infect, it is *reasonable* for
healthcare workers to be vaccinated.

They found it *unreasonable* for the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration to find that COVID-19 is a "workplace hazard" that they
have the authority to regulate, across the board, for every industry, in
every circumstance.

Splitting the decision like this is honestly the most reasonable thing
that SCOTUS could have done.
