**Does it concern you that a U.S. president publicly offered someone a
pardon to commit a crime?**

I assume you're talking about the conversation he had at the border
where he publicly joked with the head of CBP that he should close the
border, and that Trump would pardon him if he went to jail over it.

Everyone had a good laugh over it.

Except Democrats, the media, and apparently you.

Also, do you remember when Trump was talking about Hillary's 20,000
"missing" emails, and he joked that maybe Russia (because they were
supposedly so good at hacking) could find them.

Everyone had a good laugh over that one, too.

Except Democrats, the media, and I presume, you. It even gave Peter
Strzok a good idea to get Trump out of office.

I know, it's hard when your president has a sense of humor. It's hard to
tell when someone's joking and when they're not.

That's okay, we're here to help.
