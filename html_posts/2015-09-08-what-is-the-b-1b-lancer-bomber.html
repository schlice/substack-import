**Content:** [On April 29th and April 30th, 2010, the time-to-climb
records [[were
set](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=80f432&url=http://www.dyess.af.mil/news/story.asp?id%3D123202603){.external_link

carrying payloads of 5,000 kg to heights of 9,000 and 6,000 meters in 4
minutes 47 seconds and 3 minutes 28 seconds respectively; records
previously held by C-17s. The higher speed, service ceiling, and
time-to-climb means that the B-1 is more survivable than the B-52 which
it was intended to replace. It also holds 61 FAI world records for
speed, payload, distance, and time-to-climb in different aircraft weight
classes, so it is no slouch even when not being compared to its
predecessor. In November 1983, three B-1Bs set a long distance record
for the aircraft, which demonstrated its ability to conduct extended
mission lengths to strike anywhere in the world and return to base
without any stops. This is a big deal, as it contributes to the \"force
projection\" mission of the military, and anything that allows us to
project force farther and faster than anyone else is a big win for the
United States.\
