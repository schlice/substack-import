The answer with all things legal is, "it depends." And in most cases, it
depends on the site on which you are creating the account.

Most social media sites allow "groups" to be created. Anyone can create
any group about anyone or anything. Of course, as you rightly stated,
you can't slander (or more correctly, libel) anyone, especially the
person on whom the group is based. You are allowed by the First
Amendment to be disrespectful, but that may violate the site's terms of
service (such as the BNBR policy here).

Sites counter this by using "verified" tags for celebrities and people
who are well-known (i.e. authors, media talent, other celebrities, etc).
They have folks who will verify the authenticity of a famous person and
will then put a little blue check box next to their picture or name.

*This is an example of a "Verified" person. I should hope so, it's*
[[*Jimmy
Wales*](https://www.quora.com/profile/Jimmy-Wales)]{.qlink_container}
*and that is his real account.*

Many sites have policies against impersonating others (such as Quora's
"real name" policy), but again, that is dependent on the site.

Of course, if you impersonate someone in an attempt to get some sort of
gain from the impersonation, that is patently illegal.

Specifically for Instagram, they state:

> - You must not defame, stalk, bully, abuse, harass, threaten,
>   **impersonate** or intimidate people or entities and you must not
>   post private or confidential information via the Service, including,
>   without limitation, your or any other person\'s credit card
>   information, social security or alternate national identity numbers,
>   non-public phone numbers or non-public email addresses.

This means I can't go to Instagram and make an account calling myself
Jimmy Wales and purport to be Jimmy. That would violate Instagram's
terms of service.

You also can't create an account that is actually a trademarked business
name. So I can't create a Coca-Cola Instagram account, as it would be
pretty quickly taken down.

I'd suggest doing this on Facebook, where you can quickly and easily
create a "group" about anything or anyone you like.
