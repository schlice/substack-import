This is one of those items you truly forget you have with you until TSA
finds it.

At one time I received one of these gimmicky folding credit card knives
that looked substantially like this as a free gift:

:::: ui_qtext_image_outer
::: qtext_image_wrapper
![](images/qimg-7a86ccfe8fb4ed2d79d08a61bdf40d61){.landscape
.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed
master_src="images/qimg-7a86ccfe8fb4ed2d79d08a61bdf40d61" master_w="480"
master_h="360"}

The wallet I had it in was one of these metallic wallets:

:::: ui_qtext_image_outer
::: qtext_image_wrapper
![](images/qimg-7a0a0fc3f775ddbdd9c4425755de6b47){.landscape
.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed
master_src="images/qimg-7a0a0fc3f775ddbdd9c4425755de6b47" master_w="350"
master_h="318"}

By the way, these wallets are great if you, like me, sit on your leather
wallet and often break credit cards because the wallet bends.

Long story short, I ping going through the magnetometer. I recognize my
wallet is still on me, so thinking my wallet pinged the machine, I send
it through the X-ray, at which time the metal blade of the knife becomes
fully visible on the screen. It was the knife blade that pinged the
magnetometer, not the aluminum wallet.

Anyway, I told them to throw it away, because it would have cost me more
to send it home than I paid for it (which was nothing).
