So to answer your question, [[the
study](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=f10313&url=https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2819785?guestAccessKey%3D7d568a16-aea5-41e6-bb65-f9c586b2ecb0%26utm_source%3DFor_The_Media%26utm_medium%3Dreferral%26utm_campaign%3Dftm_links%26utm_content%3Dtfl%26utm_term%3D062424){.external_link

onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"

and 2022, infant deaths in Texas rose from 1,985 to 2,240, a
year-over-year increase of 255 deaths. This corresponds to a 12.9
percent increase in infant deaths in Texas versus a 1.8 percent increase
in infant deaths in the rest of the U.S. during the same period. The
study defines infants as under 12 months old.

So there's the answer to the question.

Now, what do you do with this information?

Well, in order to draw a *correct* understanding, you need more
information. For example, one might ask how "infant deaths" is related
to abortion.

Ah, there's the rub. The study goes on to try to interpret the data for
you (which is where the study turns from science to propaganda) and
explains that the reason you see this increase in "infant death" is
because babies with terminal abnormalities are being allowed to be born
and then are dying before 12 months of age, which is classified as an
"infant death."

*Whoa, wait a second. So the only reason it is classified as an "infant
death" is because those babies were not allowed to be* ***aborted?***

Yep, that's right. So let's look at the difference between Texas and,
say, California, when it comes to the same baby, so we can see the
difference:

- California: baby with fetal abnormalities is aborted: **dead baby.**
- Texas: baby with fetal abnormalities cannot be aborted, is born, and
  dies of these fetal abnormalities: **dead baby.**

So the result is exactly the same: a dead baby. But on one hand, it's
called an abortion, and on the other hand, it's called an "infant
death."

Therefore, **the study means absolutely nothing.** Literally, the only
thing that the study shows is that when you disallow abortion because of
fetal abnormalities, some babies will be born and will die before they
turn a year old. That makes the "infant mortality" rate arbitrarily
climb, because those babies are not aborted before they are born. *This
is expected behavior in Texas, this should not be a surprise.*

However, it's the analysis of the study that is more telling. *The
study's authors find that to be a worse crime than abortion, because of
the hardship the family must endure.* The authors posit (without
evidence) that it is easier on the families to simply abort the baby
rather than to allow it to be born and die, so the more moral position
is abortion.

\

But this view is incorrect, because the study is looking at the wrong
data. In order to have answered the correct question, the study's
authors should have investigated the following:

***How many babies with fetal abnormalities were born and DID NOT
DIE?***

The study failed to even address that point.

In other words: in Texas, it's possible that some of those babies may
have survived, whereas in California, that same baby *would never have
been given the chance to try to survive.* Of course, we don't know how
many babies with pre-existing fetal abnormalities survived, because the
study authors did not address that issue.

Anecdotal reports of babies diagnosed with fetal abnormalities being
born and surviving (even thriving) are abundant on the Internet. I'm not
going to speculate why that is, because those are topics for other
Spaces, and in any case, it is not materially related to this question.

But what we *can* say is that, at least in Texas, we give the baby a
fighting chance instead of killing it before it even has the chance to
fight.
