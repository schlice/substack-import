It's not.

At worst, it may cause your phone to charge slower because it is trying
to use energy while it is also charging the battery. But the difference
is so slight as to be mostly negligible. And if it's overnight, what
difference does it make?

Otherwise, there is no harm to the phone by leaving it on while it
charges, overnight or otherwise.
