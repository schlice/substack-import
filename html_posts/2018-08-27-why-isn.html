**Why isn't pornstar Stormy Daniels being arrested for blackmail? If she
had sex with President Trump over 10 years ago, then threatened to
expose this encounter just because he was running for President, isn't
that a crime?**

It is blackmail when **you** **demand** **money** from someone in
exchange for either revealing or not revealing some injurious
information about that person.

It is **not** blackmail when the person *offers* to pay you so that you
maintain your silence. Hush money is not blackmail.

What generally happens in cases like this is a process called "catch and
kill." When word gets out that someone like Stormy Daniels has
information about an affair, a tabloid like the National Enquirer will
mysteriously get paid by some unknown entity, like a shell corporation.
The tabloid will then approach the person and buy the rights to her
story. That contract specifies that she cannot tell her story to anyone,
because the Enquirer owns the rights to that story. The Enquirer has no
intention of publishing the story. But they own the rights to it, so
they can publish it at any time, or even never publish it at all.
