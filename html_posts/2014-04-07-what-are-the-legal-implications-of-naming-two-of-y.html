**Content:** [While there are many practical problems with doing so,
legally there is no problem with naming your two children with exactly
the same name. In the US, persons are identified using ***personally
identifying information*** which includes name, Social Security Number,
address, and birthday. Even if they are twins, they will have unique
Social Security Numbers, so they will still be legally identifiable even
if their names are identical.]{.rendered_qtext}
