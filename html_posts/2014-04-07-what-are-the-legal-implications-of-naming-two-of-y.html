<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [While there are many practical problems with doing so,<br>legally there is no problem with naming your two children with exactly<br>the same name. In the US, persons are identified using ***personally<br>identifying information*** which includes name, Social Security Number,<br>address, and birthday. Even if they are twins, they will have unique<br>Social Security Numbers, so they will still be legally identifiable even<br>if their names are identical.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
