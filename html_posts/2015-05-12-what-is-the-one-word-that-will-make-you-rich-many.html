**Content:** [**SINGLE**.\
\
Don\'t get married. Don\'t have kids. You\'ll be much more wealthy.\
\
But, of course, you\'ll be much poorer in quality of life. Having a
family enriches you in a way that nothing else can.\
\
In truth, there isn\'t one single word you can use that will make you
rich, or everyone would be using it. People that use certain words have
certain attitudes and approaches towards life. So the words are
significant only in how they are applied to life.]{.rendered_qtext}
