**Why do most smartphone apps ask to install updates weekly? I don\'t
have auto-update on. These big updates use up my data.**

For you, leaving auto-update off is important. You can connect your
phone to a Wi-Fi network and do manual updates. This will ensure that
you keep your apps up to date, and ensures that updates only take place
when you're connected to a network using Wi-Fi instead of cellular data.

Wi-Fi does not count against your data usage.
