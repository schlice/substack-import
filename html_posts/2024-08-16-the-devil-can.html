How do you know that your brain is thinking things all by itself?

Neither Satan nor his minions can read your thoughts, true. *But they
can whisper thoughts into your ear, and convince you that they are your
thoughts.*

Remember, the battle is for our minds. Our minds have been conditioned
by the world, influenced by Satan, the puppet-master behind it all.
Think about that: *our lives have been shaped by our enemies!* Our very
belief system has been shaped by our enemies. We've absorbed a whole lot
of lies and half-truths, and those have really affected us.

If you are a child of God, are you dirty or ugly? Of course not! It
isn't true. **It just feels true**. It's a lie that has been reinforced
so many times that it literally has taken a hold of you, and it causes
you to think and act in ways that contradict God's Word.

But can you beat it? ***Of course you can! YOU CONTROL YOU! Satan does
not control you!***

Think of your mind as an airport, and you are the air traffic
controller. A lot of thoughts ask for permission to land, but you have
the ultimate control over which thoughts can land, and which thoughts
get turned away.

So try this practical exercise to help you break those bad patterns of
thought:

1.  **Work out the lie you have been believing.** In your case, it may
    be the bad thoughts about God concerning the things you are
    thinking.
2.  **Say what effect believing the lie has had on your life**. Imagine
    how different your life would be if you didn't think this way. What
    would you be able to do that you currently can't do?
3.  **Find as many Bible verses as you can** that say what is actually
    true and write them down. Google can help you here.
4.  **Write a declaration.** Use this formula: "I renounce the lie
    that..." and "I declare the truth that...". You could also say, "I
    reject the lie that..." and "I embrace the truth that..." or "I say
    no to the lie that..." and "I say yes to the truth that..."
5.  **Read the verses** ***out loud*** **and pray the declaration**
    ***out loud*** **every day for 40 days.** Why out loud? As we've
    already discussed, Satan can't read your mind. Declare the truth,
    out loud, so the demons hear you renouncing their lies. Also
    remember, for a long time, the verses will not **feel** true. But
    remind yourself that God *is* truth, and if He said it, it really is
    true.

(And yes, for anyone who has done the *Freedom In Christ* course, this
sounds an awful lot like stronghold busting. News flash: it is.)
