**Can my sister file a lawsuit against her employer if one of her
managers was sexually harassing her, black mailing her, and threatening
her safety? The employer took action, but can she still receive
compensation for pain & suffering?**

The answer, as with all legal answers, is "it depends."

It sounds like the company already took action, and what she can
continue to do is therefore going to be governed by the details of the
settlement that the company reached. There is a better than average
chance that she signed a settlement agreement (or an agreement which
settles the matter, regardless of what it may be called), and both sides
agreed that the matter was settled. This means that a certain result was
reached. It may not have been the most agreeable, but there it is.

Such agreements may include a phrase that by accepting the settlement,
you agree that the matter is settled, and you will not pursue any
further legal action, either against the company, or against the alleged
aggressor. This is important, because when a company settles with all
parties involved, it is at least partially because they don't want to
have to go through anything public. They don't want to risk their image
by a sex harassment suit going public, so they will do their utmost to
prevent it from doing so.

To that end, she should check anything she signed with regards to the
settlement. She should check for clauses which would prevent her from
taking further action. She will most likely be prevented from further
suing the company, but she *may* still be able to bring private action
against the aggressor. Again, this will all depend on what is in the
settlement agreement.
