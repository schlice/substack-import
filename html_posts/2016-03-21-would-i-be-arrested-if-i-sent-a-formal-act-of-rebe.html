Nope.

You can write whatever you choose to write. It\'s covered by the First
Amendment to the US Constitution. You can claim that you are going to
fail to abide by the law from now on. You can also claim that you are
going to commit crimes.

But if you do, please specify the times, dates, and locations where you
plan on committing said crimes.

So the police can be there to arrest you.

At that point, your speech moves from protected 1st Amendment speech to
a piece of evidence known as \"forethought,\" meaning you thought about
the crimes you were going to commit before you committed them. Depending
on the crime, this may make the crime worse.

For example, if you claimed in your Act of Rebellion that you were going
to kill the first police officer you see, and then when the appointed
day arrives, you do so, you will be arrested and charged with murder.
Your Act of Rebellion will be used as evidence against you in court
showing you had forethought; one of the required elements of murder.

So to summarize, you are allowed to write anything you choose and
deliver it to anyone you choose. If you lie about someone and that lie
harms that person, that\'s called libel, and you can be sued for that,
but if you\'re only sending your Act of Rebellion to the police station,
there\'s not much to worry about in that regard.

Mostly, you\'ll just give the entire police station a really good
belly-laugh. And then they\'ll be there to arrest you when you choose to
\"rebel.\"
