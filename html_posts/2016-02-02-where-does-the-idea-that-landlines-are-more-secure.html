Remember the old Motorola bag phones and flip phones? Those phones were
very simple, audio-only devices (SMS was just coming into fashion at the
time). This was, primarily, because of the technology they used. Those
original phones were ***analog*** radio transceiver devices. With an
analog signal sniffer, you could essentially eavesdrop on any phone
conversation if you could find the right radio frequency. Additionally,
the laws surrounding \"wiretapping\" had not caught up to the new
\"cellular telephone\" paradigm, so it was less clear whether or not
listening in on a cellular call, essentially being \"broadcast\" over
the air was illegal. For this reason, many companies insisted you use a
landline for sensitive communications.

Technology has, of course, progressed. All of the old analog systems
have been replaced with ***digital*** transmission systems. This allowed
phones to become smaller and consume less power, although tower density
had to increase. It also allowed phones to be voice *and* data devices.
If you were to try to sniff a call now, you\'d hear nothing more than
noise, as all transmissions between the phone and the tower are digital.
The digital signal runs through a DAC (digital-to-analog conversion)
circuit so that you can hear it. This has increased security on cellular
calls, as the technology to decrypt an audio signal is not quite as
ubiquitous as the old system. Also, the law caught up with cell phones,
essentially expanding existing wiretapping laws to encompass cellular
conversations as well.
