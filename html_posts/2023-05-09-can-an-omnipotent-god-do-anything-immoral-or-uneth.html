Before we can answer this question, we have to figure out what morals
are and whether or not God can be morally wrong.

So what are morals? In short, morals are the definition of right and
wrong, good and evil. But in order to answer the question about whether
or not God can be morally wrong, we must figure out where the standard
of right and wrong, good and evil comes from.

There must be a single, unchanging source of morality in order to be
able to equally apply it to everything, including God. If you're going
to judge God by what you know to be morals, you have to have a single,
unchanging standard of morals *outside of yourself* which applies to
everyone, including God.

And that is where you run into a problem.

**What meaningful standard can exist as a source for moral truth other
than God?**

In other words, apart from God, it is impossible to have truly
objective, universally-applied morality. To be meaningful, morality has
to be *grounded.* In other words, morality has to be based on some
unchanging standard. Human concepts such as "suffering" or "human
flourishing" are not objective. There is no rational reason for opinions
or subjective ideas to be the source of moral reasoning.

So, the first problem with asking whether or not an omnipotent God can
do anything immoral is that *meaningful moral claims require God to
exist in the first place*. **Labelling anything "good" or "evil"
requires assumptions that lead inevitably to God.**

\

This leads us directly into the next question about whether or not God
can be morally wrong. In order to answer this, we must consider the
first point, that morals themselves come from God. God must exist in
order to have morals in the first place, because when God created us, he
imbued us with morals.

Note that He did not imbue *Himself* with morals. He imbued *us*, His
creation, with morals. We are moral because He made us moral.

God exists *outside of* morality because He created morality.

Therefore, God cannot be moral or immoral, ethical, or unethical. He
created those things and are not limited by them. His actions are not
subject to morality.

If you look at God's actions and view them as either moral or immoral,
you are using the standards He gave you and you are trying to judge
actions which are not inherently moral or immoral. God's actions are
beyond morals, but you are trying to wrongly judge God's actions using
moral standards.

In other words, as an entity outside of the universe, He is not under
the moral law, as He created the moral law. His actions are therefore,
*de facto*, moral.
