No. Being angels, they have angelic minds, and thus when they chose to
rebel, they did so with the full knowledge of the glory of God. In other
words, it was a 100% free choice.

Because humans have *human minds*, not *angelic minds*. They do not have
a full understanding or appreciation of the glory of God, and they have
been corrupted by sin. It is for these reasons that humans have the
*opportunity* to reject sin and accept God whereas the angels did not.

Hopefully you convince them to repent and believe. But everyone opposes
God in some form or another, because we are all sinful and we have all
missed the mark when it comes to God's sovereignty.

What we have that the angels and demons do not: **hope**.
