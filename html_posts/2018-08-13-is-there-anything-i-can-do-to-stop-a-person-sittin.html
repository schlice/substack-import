**Is there anything thing I can do to stop a person sitting in a car on
my street from videoing me working in my yard?**

In the United States, very little. When you are outside of your home,
you have no expectation of privacy. You can be freely videoed and
photographed. Those photos and videos can also be posted on social media
or the Internet in general as well.

In general, those photos or videos cannot be used for commercial
purposes, but beyond that, in general the rule in the United States is,
"if you can see it, you can record it."

There are a few things you can try:

1.  You can call the **non-emergency** number of your local police
    department and report a suspicious person/suspicious vehicle. DO NOT
    expect a quick response. In fact, it will likely be *hours* before
    someone shows up, so this may not be the ideal route to go. However,
    even if they don't show up for hours, it may be a good idea, as your
    complaint is officially recorded when you call the police, even on
    the non-emergency line.
2.  Take pictures and video of the vehicle and its occupant. What's good
    for the goose is good for the gander, so they say. You can take
    pictures and video of the car exactly as legally as they can take
    pictures and video of you. I suspect the driver won't hang around
    for too much longer once you start. Feel free to post those on your
    social media site, your local news channel's Facebook page, or if
    you have a neighborhood community website like
    [[Nextdoor](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=e57ab4&url=http://www.nextdoor.com){.external_link
    rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
    onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
    qt-tooltip="nextdoor.com"}]{.qlink_container} (not a sponsor), post
    it there.
3.  If you're feeling brave, you might approach the vehicle and ask the
    driver if they are lost or if they need something, but remember the
    first point in this answer: it's perfectly legal for the person to
    take pictures and video of you outside of your home.
