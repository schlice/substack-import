**When journalists and other people that aren't government officials are
flying on Air Force One, are they charged for the trip and/or food?**

Yes.

People who fly on AF1 who are not members of the White House staff or
who run the aircraft (i.e. the service staff, the pilots, the AF comm
techs, etc) are charged to fly.

They are charged an "equivalent rate" and it works out to what you would
be charged to fly on commercial transportation, flying a similar route,
in First Class. It's one charge; they are not charged separately for
food, in just the same way that anyone flying First Class on a
commercial airliner is treated.

If you're a reporter, the organization you work for will be billed for
your flight. So yes, every reporter who flies in the press corps on AF1
with the President is charged by the Air Force to take that trip.
