**If I see a bear in my backyard and I\'m between it and my house, what
should I do?**

Go inside.

Black bears are not prone to attacking you without being provoked. That
doesn't mean they're like puppies, but they certainly are much less
aggressive than grizzlies. Just walk backwards, keep your eyes near the
bear (I suggest looking at his feet and not locking eyes with him) until
you get to your house and go inside. They should leave you alone.
Grizzlies are much more dangerous, but follow the same basic rules: make
yourself look big (if you're wearing a coat, open it up and hold it open
like a cape), walk backwards, don't make eye contact (look at the legs
or feet), and slowly but methodically make your way back to your house
and go inside.

Bears with cubs are a whole other ballgame. All momma bears are going to
be protective of their cubs, so if there are cubs in the mix, you
definitely want to back up slowly, not make any threatening moves, but
keep backing up until you get into your house.
