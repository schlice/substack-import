**What kind of technology built for cars would allow me to call for help
if I\'m stranded in a place that has no cell phone reception?**

There is technology available that can help you call for help if you are
in a place with no phone reception. It is not intentionally built for
cars, but it is adaptable to cars.

The technology: **satellite phones**.

Sat phones work nearly anywhere you have a clear view of the sky,
worldwide. Several models of sat phones have car adapter kits which
allow you to mount magnetic antennas on the outside of your car to
improve reception, along with charging the phone and providing accessory
attachment points for things like handsfree speakers and microphones.

Additionally, you can also use technology which is *not* adapted to
cars, from a car. **Personal Locator Beacons**, or PLBs, are small and
portable, and once activated, will transmit an emergency signal which
will guide rescuers to your exact location.
