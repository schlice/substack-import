This sounds less like a question about MS and more like a question about
online dating and when is a good time to tell someone about your
conditions.

As I see it, you have a few choices:

1.  Be completely up-front about it. This would involve putting your MS
    diagnosis in your online profile, and letting the chips fall where
    they may.
2.  Be completely discrete about it. I can't really say how in a
    "completely discrete" scenario you would ever tell your significant
    other that you have MS, so let's just cut to the chase and say this
    option is a really bad idea.
3.  I think the middle-ground here (and perhaps the wisest possible
    choice) is to go on a few dates and see if they appear promising,
    and then reveal that you've been diagnosed with MS, and proceed to
    explain it.

I think that the smartest choice here is to leave it off of your profile
and see how the dates go. If you find someone kind-hearted, open, and
understanding (i.e. someone who is also looking to find a long term
relationship as you are), then the ultimate test will be to tell them
about your diagnosis, explain how it has affected you, and how it will
potentially affect you in the future.

How they react to the news will tell you whether or not you should
continue dating.

I don't recommend putting your diagnosis on your profile. I don't
believe, first of all, that it's anyone's business but yours what
illnesses you have (unless they are contagious --- MS is not). Secondly,
you have MS. You are not *defined by* the fact that you have MS. It's
like "I have thinning hair" or "I have 20 pounds more weight than I
want." Granted, the potential repercussions of MS are more severe than
thinning hair or a little too much weight, but the philosophy is the
same. You have a disease; you are not defined by a disease. You only
confide about your disease when you find someone who is *worthy* of
receiving that bit of trusted information. What they do with it, and how
they handle it, is up to them.

Keep in mind that they may take some time to process the information, as
you did when you were diagnosed. But if they're the right one, they will
accept it and move forward with you.

It won't be easy, and yes some people will not accept you because you
have MS. It's the ugly truth about people. But when the right one comes
along, you'll know. And it will be special.
