**How small are the transistors on the new iPhone? I\'m reading that the
new phone has 6.9 billion transistors. How can you pack 6.9 billion of
anything into a cell phone?**

When you make them as small as a few nanometers, you can cram billions
into a processor chip.

Apple uses a chip manufacturing process called a
"[[7-nanometer](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=92ef45&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7_nanometer){.external_link

nanometer is one billionth of a meter.

Using a 7 nm manufacturing process, Apple's A12 Bionic chip (as is in
the new iPhone XS, XS Max, and XR) can cram in 6.9 billion transistors.
The chip is actually quite amazing, and Apple is the first to market a
chip using the 7 nm process.
