This question assumes that there are civilians in the region called
Palestine who are *not* Hamas-sympathizers and who affirmatively deny
Hamas' leadership and control, and wish to be free.

And if that's what they wanted so badly, *why did they choose to live in
Palestine under the control of the Palestinian Authority?* Israel
already freely takes Arabs from Gaza and the West Bank and allows them
to assimilate into Israel. There are thousands of free Arabs living in
Israel today. They serve in the IDF. They have lives and jobs and
families. And they are notably the only Arabs in the entire region to be
living in a truly free democracy.

If they were truly not Hamas supporters, why did they choose to live
under Hamas' control?

I will not deny that it is possible that such people could exist. But I
think the number is ***much smaller*** than most people believe it to
be.
