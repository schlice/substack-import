**Under what circumstances does a landlord have the right to enter your
apartment without notice (in Colorado)?**

Landlords in Colorado are not required by law to give notice to enter
the unit. This means they can enter at any time, with no notice, for
emergencies, non-emergency repairs, and for showings of the unit to
other prospective tenants.

Rental agencies *suggest* that Colorado landlords give tenants at least
24 hours notice before entering as a courtesy, and more than half of
Colorado landlords surveyed provide 48 hours notice before they enter.
