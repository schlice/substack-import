The process is the same in nearly every state.

If you fail to pay your HOA dues, you will still owe them. Every month
you fail to pay, you will accrue a balance due. Added to that balance
will also be late fees.

When a sufficient amount of money becomes past due (this is different in
every state), the past due account is turned over to the HOA's attorney.
The attorney will attempt to collect the balance, through contact and
negotiation (possibly negotiating a payment plan if the homeowner is
willing). But all the while, missed payments will continue to accrue,
along with late fees, *and now attorney fees*, which get wrapped into
the balance due.

When a sufficient amount of time passes, or when a minimum balance due
is reached (also varies by state), the association attorney will place a
*lien* on the property. In case you are unaware, a lien is a legal
obligation placed against property which is used as collateral, in order
to repay a debt. Since your property is used as collateral in your
agreement with the HOA, the HOA (through its attorney) can place a lien
on the property to recover unpaid debt. The lien gives the lienholder
the right to sell the property if the property owner fails to repay his
debt.

If enough time goes by with the debt still unpaid, the lien can be
*foreclosed* in order to repay the debt. Foreclosure is the process in
which a lienholder exercises the right to sell the property in order to
repay the debt owed. In other words, this means that your house will be
sold out from under you, you will be kicked out of your house, and the
proceeds from the sale will first go to repay the debt you owe to the
HOA and the attorney, and will then go to repay your mortgage holder.
Any remaining proceeds, after the HOA and the mortgage holder's debts
are satisfied, will go back to you.
