**How do I get my official Android 7.0.1 update on my Galaxy S7? I tried
the software update option. It says, "your device is up-to-date". The
model is G930T, Android version 6.0.1 security patch level November 1,
2016 Baseband version, G930TUVU4APK1.**

You should have already received an update from T-Mobile over the air,
but it sounds like the OTA Update software is detecting an issue, or is
experiencing an error.

You can always try updating your software using your computer.

Requirements for updating your phone's software using your computer:

- At least 50% battery charge
- A data connection
- A Samsung USB cable.

Make sure you back up your data prior to completing the update. During
the update, do not:

- Use the device or press any keys.
- Turn off the device.
- Disconnect the USB cable until the update is complete.

**NOTE: You will not be able to place any phone calls during the update,
not even an emergency call.**

To update your software using your computer:

1.  Download and install a revision of Samsung Smart Switch that is
    compatible with your computer from
    [[http://www.samsung.com/us/suppor\...](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=75bb86&url=http://www.samsung.com/us/support/smart-switch-support/%23!/){.external_link
    rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
    onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
    qt-tooltip="samsung.com"}]{.qlink_container}.
2.  Connect the cable to a compatible USB port on your computer.
3.  Connect the other end of the cable to your mobile device.
4.  Allow your computer to install any required drivers for your device.
    This process may take a few minutes.
5.  Open **Smart Switch** on your computer, and allow it to make the
    connection.
6.  If a software update is available for your device, Smart Switch will
    automatically prompt you to update. At any time, you can click
    **Update**.
7.  Click **Update** to begin downloading the necessary files.
8.  Click **OK** to proceed. Your device may turn off and on a few times
    during the update process. Once complete the device will return to
    the Home screen.

If this process fails, or if you have any questions, contact T-Mobile
Customer Support.
