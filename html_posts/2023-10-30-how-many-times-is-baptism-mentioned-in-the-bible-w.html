> How many times is baptism mentioned in the Bible?

The word \"baptism\" is mentioned **22 times** in the New Testament. The
verb form, \"baptize\", is mentioned 10 times, and the action form,
\"baptized\", is mentioned 60 times.

> What is the purpose of baptism according to the Bible?

Baptism is a symbolic gesture, both for your own personal journey and as
a sign to the rest of the world that you believe in the death and
resurrection of Jesus.

Remember: *baptism does not save you*. *Baptism is what saved people
do.*

The Bible commands believers to be baptized. Jesus tells us to do it as
part of what we call the Great Commission:

> *Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the
> name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching
> them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you
> always, to the very end of the age. --- Matthew 28:19--20 NIV*

So at the very least, we are baptized because Christ commanded it.

Beyond that, we believe that Christ followers are "buried with Him"
through baptism, and if we are united with Him in death, we will
"certainly also be united with him in a resurrection like his."

> through baptism into death in order that, just as Christ was raised
> from the dead through the glory of the Father, we too may live a new

Baptism is usually considered the *beginning* of a personal faith
journey for a Christian.
