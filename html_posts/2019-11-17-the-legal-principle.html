**The legal principle \"Ignorantia juris non excusat\" was reasonable
once, but given sheer number of laws it has become unreasonable if not
downright evil. Is there a movement to repeal it?**

First of all, it's a legal principle, not a law, so it can't be
"repealed."

Secondly, are you saying that, simply because the sheer volume of laws
makes it *physically impossible* to know them all, that it's acceptable
to violate the laws you claim you don't know about?

Hopefully you can understand why this would be unworkable in any
reasonable system of justice, because I can merely claim that I was
unaware of the law I violated, and I should therefore not be convicted
of it because I claim I didn't know. Then, the state would not only have
to show that I violated the law (which is objective), but then they
would have to show that I'm lying and that I actually knew that what I
was doing was illegal.

In other words, ignorance of the law is not an excuse because I would
merely have to claim that I had no idea that something was illegal in
order to avoid liability for that particular crime.

The justice system assumes that **for all basic activities that take
place outside your home, you are aware of what is legal and what is
not.** This is a legal principle known as **imputation**. If you intend
on engaging in other than basic activity outside of your home, the
justice system expects that you will study the law as it pertains to
your specific activity, as all laws are published in many different
formats and is accessible to all citizens. For example, if you want to
go hunting, the laws surrounding where you can hunt, what permits you
might need, and what training you will need to accomplish in order to
receive your permits, is all available for you to consume before you
hunt. That you did not know what was legal and what was illegal is not
an excuse when you shoot a deer from your car window, or if you shoot
across a road.

Additionally, the justice system must still balance the fact that you
cannot know all laws at all times with the need for *justice*, meaning
the need for society to hold lawbreakers accountable for their crimes,
whether or not they were aware that the actual act was, in fact, a
crime. The legal system says that if you engage in something other than
basic activity outside of your home, it is your responsibility to know
the law, or learn the law, for your activity in your jurisdiction.
