**What was the point of the 9/11 attacks? Was it just a murder suicide?
I honestly don't really know because I wasn't alive during that time.
RIP to all the victims of the attacks and the family's that have
suffered.**

I remember precisely where I was standing when I watched the second
plane hit the south tower. We all watched it live.

While the north tower was on fire, we were all collectively thinking,
"this could have been an accident. This could have been a really tragic
accident. I know airline traffic over Manhattan is tightly controlled,
but this could have been a tragic accident...right?"

Then, the second plane hit.

As we watched, our minds made that collective leap from "this could have
been an accident" to "this was clearly deliberate." And as the news
continued to pour in, we became increasingly certain that it was,
indeed, a deliberate attack against the United States.

For those of us who watched it, we know precisely why.

But there is now an entire generation of adults who were not alive when
the attack happened.

Take literally five minutes out of your day and watch this video. You
will be glad you did. It speaks to people exactly like you, who were not
even alive when the attack happened.
