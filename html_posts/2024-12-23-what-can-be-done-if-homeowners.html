HOA Board members are only bound by state law and the Governing
Documents. If it's in there, then they must do it. They are only
required to respond when state law or the Governing Documents tell them
they are required to respond.

If you are demanding they respond to your phone calls or emails or text
messages or smoke signals, they are usually not legally required to do
so.

For example, if they contact you and tell you that you are in violation
of a rule, you can respond to that message and explain why you are not,
or you can pay your fine and fix the condition which is violative. If
you explain why you think they are wrong, they may not listen to you,
and if it is something over which they have exclusive control, they are
not obligated to change their findings based on your comments.

Bottom line, check your CC&Rs to see when they are required to respond
to you and when they are not. And if you think they should be more
responsive, don't vote for them next election. Vote someone in who
promises to be more responsive.
