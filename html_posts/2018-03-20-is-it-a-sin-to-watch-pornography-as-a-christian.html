**Is it a sin to watch pornography as a Christian?**

[[John

pointed out in Matthew 5:29 that yes it is, and he's correct. But it's
more than that.

Jesus, in that passage, created a standard that is impossible for anyone
(except for Him) to actually meet. His standards are so high that
without help, it's just impossible to meet those standards.

Which is exactly the point.

The point is that *you can't do it alone.* It is only through God's
grace that you are saved; no amount of action or inaction in your part
will save you. Only God can save you.
