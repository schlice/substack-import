There are a few other answers which talk about the intricacies of
whether or not masturbation is a sin. In my view, it *can* be, and it's
really difficult to do it in a non-sinful way.

For now, let me address the second part of the question. There is a
section in the Bible which refers to man's seed falling to the floor.
But saying that this passage means that man is prohibited from allowing
his seed to touch the floor is a misinterpretation of that passage.

The passage is Genesis 38, but understanding what it means requires an
understanding of the culture at that time. In that culture, if a husband
died without children, the next of kin was sometimes obligated to "go in
to" the widow and produce children. The children would be considered to
be "descendants" of the late husband, and would be raised as such,
taking care of the widow, providing more people to work in the village,
and to potentially continue the family lineage.

Onan failed to keep this tradition. He did "go in to" the widow, but
instead of, er, "finishing the job," as it were, he intentionally
allowed his seed to spill on the ground. He intentionally dishonored the
widow, refusing to carry on his brother's family name, and potentially
left a woman without provision in the community.

It was *this action* with which God was displeased, and he killed Onan
because of it.

Original question:

Is masturbating a sin? If so, isn\'t there a verse in the Bible saying
for the man not to let his seed touch the floor?
