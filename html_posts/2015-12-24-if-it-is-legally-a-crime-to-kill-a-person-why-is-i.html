The simple answer:

Murder is defined as \"the ***unlawful*** taking of a life with
forethought and malice.\" An execution is not murder because the taking
of the life is not unlawful.

Execution is a lawful taking of life because it follows a legal process
documented in state law. Therefore, execution, when conducted by a state
after the state-determined process is completed (in accordance with the
law), does not meet the standard of murder.
