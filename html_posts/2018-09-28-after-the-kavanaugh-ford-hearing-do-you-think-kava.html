**After the Kavanaugh-Ford hearing, do you think Kavanaugh will be
confirmed to the Supreme Court?**

He was going to be confirmed before the testimony.

It is universally accepted that, while she was compelling, there wasn't
enough evidence presented by Dr. Ford to really warrant changing
anyone's votes from yes to no, although apparently some of the swing
votes are still up in the air. Sen. Joe Donnelly (D-IN) announced he
will vote no when it comes to the floor because he stated that the FBI
should have investigated (even though they had no authority to do so).
Donnelly is playing a dangerous game, up for re-election in a state
which Trump carried in 2016, so he will face exposure for that choice.
He believes that the accusation and the fact that the White House
decided not to re-open the background investigation for this issue will
cover him in November. For his sake, I hope he's right.

There are nine other Senators besides Donnelly who are facing
re-election in states carried by Trump, such as Heidi Heitkamp (D-ND),
who could face re-election exposure by voting no, and is already facing
massive pressure in ND from Republicans trying to use this as a wedge
issue with conservative voters.

There are other swing votes that have not yet been announced. Votes from
Sens. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), Susan Collins (R-ME) and Joe Manchin (D-WV)
have not yet been announced. Manchin has been leaning yes since the
hearings, but has not announced.

Finally, Republicans know that if they don't get Kavanaugh confirmed,
they will face a massive backlash for that faux pas in November, and a
loss of the House would be virtually guaranteed, and the loss of the
Senate becomes a distinct possibility. This will weigh heavily on the
minds of Republican Senators, especially the swing Republicans. I'm sure
they are getting a good talking-to at this moment.

Reviewing all of this data, at this moment, it appears most likely that
Kavanaugh will be confirmed. Narrowly, mind you (Republicans only hold a
51--49 majority in the Senate), but he will probably be confirmed.
