The argument against Whitaker\'s appointment is that the Federal
Vacancies Reform Act of 1998 is unconstitutional when it allows other
Federal officials to be temporarily appointed.

The argument says that the Appointments Clause, Article II, section 2
paragraph 2 says that the Senate must "advise and consent" to all
appointments, even temporary ones.

Therefore, the only people who should be appointed, even temporarily,
should be people who have been confirmed by the Senate, like other
cabinet members.

It is a Constitutional question, and SCOTUS should decide it.
