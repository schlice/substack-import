**Who runs over the trial of a president who is no longer in office
since the constitution only stipulates that the Chief Justice must
preside over the trials of a current president?**

You raise an important point.

Who should preside over the trial of a *former president* in the Senate?
**NO ONE! Because the Senate should not try former presidents.**

A "former president" is another word for a "civilian." And the Senate
has no jurisdiction to try a civilian, despite their insistence that
they do.

The Constitution is clear about this point in its prohibition against
**Bills of Attainder**. A Bill of Attainder is a law which charges one
person or a group of people, and declares them guilty without a judicial
trial and the protections of civil rights it affords.

Only Federal officials are bound to trials in the Senate. Civilians have
the right to judicial trial, and all of the civil rights protections it
affords.
