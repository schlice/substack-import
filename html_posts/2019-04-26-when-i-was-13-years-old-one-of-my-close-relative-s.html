**When I was 13 years old, one of my close relative sexually abused me
multiple times, then he grew old and supportive to me and my family
while I was broke, now that my situation has changed, should I Sue him
or forgive him?**

That's not an "either/or."

You can both forgive him **and** if grounds to do so exist (and you are
still legally permitted after so much time), you can sue him. Start by
checking with a personal injury lawyer in your area to see if you still
have standing to sue.

But start with forgiveness. You should not be harboring guilt, nor
should you be harboring ill will. Vengeance belongs to God. Let Him
worry about it. You need to move on with your life. That doesn't mean
you forget what he did and welcome him back into your home and your
life, but it does mean that you remove the anger and bitterness from
your heart. Absolutely forgive him. Seek out survivor groups if you are
sincere in your desire for forgiveness; they can help you navigate your
feelings and reach a place where you're able to forgive.

After you've done so, ask yourself if you've suffered so much that you
think that exacting a monetary penalty is appropriate. If you do think
so, then perhaps a personal injury lawsuit is appropriate. However, it
does sound like a fairly significant amount of time has passed, and in
most states, you don't have more than two to five years to file a
personal injury lawsuit. Remember, in most states, you don't need
actual, physical "injury" to file a lawsuit for assault and battery.

If, *after* you've healed from your forgiveness, you still want to sue,
and you still have standing, go back to your personal injury lawyer and
file that personal injury lawsuit.
