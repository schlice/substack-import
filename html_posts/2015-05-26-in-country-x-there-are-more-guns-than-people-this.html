**Content:** [If you were trying to portray the United States as
\"Country X,\" your maths are wrong. There are estimated to be somewhere
between 270 million and 310 million guns in the US, and the population
of the US is roughly 319 million. So there are likely fewer guns in the
US than there are people. Even though they are close, your portrayal is
inaccurate.\
\
With all those guns in the United States, I would expect to see every
single person carrying one, and yet I don\'t. I hardly see anyone
carrying them openly. Is that because they\'re all concealing firearms
on their person? Not so, as only 4.8% of the population holds a
concealed carry permit.\
\
So all these numbers say is that people in \"Country X\" like to own
guns.\
\
If I told you that the number of hamburgers consumed in \"Country X\"
was 166 times greater than its population, what would that say about
\"Country X?\" In the United States, we consume roughly 50 billion
hamburgers annually. All that really says is the residents of \"Country
X\" like to buy hamburgers. And presumably eat them, but we don\'t
really know that for sure.]{.rendered_qtext}
