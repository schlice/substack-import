The rights of the accused anywhere in the country are the same. The
rights are guaranteed in the Constitution, so it doesn\'t matter what
state you go to. You have the right to a speedy trial. You have the
right to not be a witness against yourself. You have the right to face
your accuser. You have the right to a jury of your peers. Just read the
Bill of Rights, it\'s all in there.

pointed out that the Constitution is the *minimum* standard for the
states to follow. States can impose *greater* protections than provided
for in the Constitution. You can review the Missouri Constitution,
[[Section 01.018(a)1, Rights of the accused in criminal
prosecutions](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=90c0ca&url=http://www.moga.mo.gov/mostatutes/Consthtml/A01018a1.html){.external_link
