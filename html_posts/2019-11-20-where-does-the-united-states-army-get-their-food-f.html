While I appreciate [[Steven L.
Gaudry](https://www.quora.com/profile/Steven-L-Gaudry)]{.qlink_container}'s
reposting of my older answer, it doesn't really apply to this question.
So I\'ll provide a more accurate one.

**Where does the United States Army get their food from compared to the
Air Force?**

All of the military services get their food from the same place: the
Defense Logistics Agency (DLA).[\[1\]](#kyBhB){#cite-kyBhB

Now I bet I can hear the gears turning. If they all get their food from
the same place, then...

**Why is Air Force food so much better?**

There are several reasons for this, but primarily, you need to
understand that while the food is all *sourced* from the same place,
that's about all that the services share. Each service gets to determine
*what it buys, how much it buys,* and *how much of its budget it spends
on food.* Each service spends money out of its own procurement budget to
purchase food, and each service gets the opportunity to determine how
much money it will spend, and on what food items. Basically, all the
services are shopping at the same grocery store, but they don\'t all put
the same stuff in their cart.

Hopefully, that last paragraph told you why Air Force food is better
than the other services:

- The Air Force spends more money on quality food, spices, and sides.
- The Air Force is smaller, and has fewer mouths to feed.
- The Air Force is a younger service, and thus has had the opportunity
  to review the other services and to see what worked and what didn't,
  and adjust accordingly. We did this exercise with *everything* while
  building the Air Force in the 40's and 50's. We put committees
  together and *reviewed how the Army and Navy did it,* and *how we
  could do it better.*

Ultimately though, and this is hard for everyone to hear, but it's the
truth, the reason Air Force food is better than the other services is

- As part of their multi-service review of quality of life, the Air
  Force chose to place a greater emphasis on quality of life than the
  other services. Their food budget proves this. Of course, many other
  things do as well, including things like the quality of enlisted
  housing, and the sheer wealth of services available to Airmen. But we
  were talking about food, and good food means good quality of life,
  happier troops, and ultimately, more productive troops.
