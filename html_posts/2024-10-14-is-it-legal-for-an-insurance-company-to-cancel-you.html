As with all legal answers, this one is the same: **it depends.**

In most cases, insurance companies cannot cancel insurance policies
without providing 30 days written notice. Most states require insurers
to give policyholders a specific period of written notification before
canceling a policy, regardless of the reason, including flood damage.

Each state has different rules about ***how much*** notice must be given
before a policy can be cancelled with a written notice, regardless of
the reason. And yes, a flood can be a factor for your insurance company
to not renew your policy.

Typically though, insurance companies need to provide written notice
before cancelling policies in the middle of the coverage term.
