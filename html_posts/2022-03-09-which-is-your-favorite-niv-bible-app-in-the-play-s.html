I regularly bounce between multiple versions of the Bible. I use ESV,
NIV, and the 1995 version of the NASB.

And my favorite app to do that is
[[YouVersion](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=6ecbdf&url=https://app.bible.com/app-android){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="bible.com"}]{.qlink_container}. Some of the things I love
about it:

- Read yourself, or listen to an audio version of any chapter or verse
  you happen to be reading.
- Easily switch between multiple Bible versions while reading
- Highlight important verses, and save your highlights across YouVersion
  apps
- Add Bookmarks, Highlights, and public or private Notes to any verse in
  the Bible
- Share Bible verses on social media
- Create Bible Images, which are shareable Bible art using stock photos
  or your own pictures
- Built-in community Friends features help you experience the Bible with
  others
- Offline versions allow you to download many of the Bible versions
  directly to your device.

By the way, all of these features are available in all versions of
YouVersion, such as the
[[iOS](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=637399&url=https://app.bible.com/app-ios){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="bible.com"}]{.qlink_container} version, or the
[[Kindle](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=5b4fa7&url=http://www.amazon.com/YouVersion-Bible/dp/B004MC8CA2){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="amazon.com"}]{.qlink_container} version. You can also log
into your account and read in [[a web
browser](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=89cdcd&url=https://www.bible.com/){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="bible.com"}]{.qlink_container} or [[install the app for
Alexa or Google Home
devices](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=70739b&url=https://www.youversion.com/the-bible-app/bible-for-voice/){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="youversion.com"}]{.qlink_container}.
