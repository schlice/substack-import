**Content:** [Essentially, it works out this way:\
]{.rendered_qtext}

- Congress raised your taxes to make healthcare more affordable for
  everyone. They did this by imposing a special tax which you will pay
  if you are not enrolled in an approved health insurance plan.
- You can \"opt out\" of paying this extra tax by buying an approved
  health insurance plan.\

Congress is not \"forcing\" you to buy health insurance. They are merely
raising your taxes. If you don\'t want your taxes raised, you can opt
out of the tax increase by buying a health insurance plan that is
approved under the ACA. Congress has the authority to raise your taxes.
They also have participated in social engineering projects through
taxation for a very long time, so this concept is nothing new.\
\
There was a great deal of controversy over this, since the authors of
the plan and its cheerleader-in-chief \"sold\" the plan to the American
people in a different way, using different plain language, than it was
actually implemented under the new law. This led to a lot of
misunderstanding and disrespect for the new mandates.
