**Content:** [There is no cure for multiple sclerosis. So the short
answer is no, you cannot recover from multiple sclerosis.\
\
Some people have achieved remission to the point where it\'s nearly
impossible to tell that they have MS in the first place. Some people
have a form of MS called \"benign MS\" which exhibits one symptom and
then goes into remission, for as many as 10 years or more.\
\
However, no one has ever \"completely recovered\" from
MS.]{.rendered_qtext}
