(EDIT: This question changed. This is my original answer, which was
geared towards a trained service animal:

> The ADA says that no business can ask you for credentials for your
> service animal. They also can\'t require the animal wear a vest, but
> it is helpful in identifying a service animal, and it causes less
> stress to business owners when they see an animal accompanying a
> person. From court rulings on the ADA, business owners may ask two
> questions about service animals:
>
> \(1\) is the dog a trained service animal required because of a
> disability, and\
> (2) what work or task has the animal been trained to perform.
>
> Businesses cannot ask about the person's disability, they cannot
> require that a disabled person present medical documentation, they
> cannot require a special identification card or training documentation
> (or a vest) for the dog, or ask that the dog demonstrate its ability
> to perform the work or task.
>
> So \"doing it properly\" means that the dog is appropriately trained
> to perform a specific task. If the dog is trained to perform a
> specific task for her, then it is ready to act as a service dog. The
> vest is optional, but it helps alleviate confusion when she is out in
> public with the dog. The ADA also says that the dog is allowed in any
> public place that people are allowed. The dog cannot be treated in the
> same way as \"pets\" are treated by the establishment.

Now, you're asking about "emotional support animals." Emotional support
animals are **not** trained to perform a specific function to assist
with a disability. A trained animal is not an "emotional support
animal," it is a "service animal." The law is very clear about what a
service animal is as opposed to an emotional support animal. To that
end, **emotional support animals are not covered by the Americans with
Disabilities Act (ADA).** They do not have the same rights as service
animals like seeing eye dogs or seizure dogs which have been
specifically trained to perform a *service.* **Emotional support
animals, therefore, are not covered by the same rules as service dogs.
Businesses have the right to restrict emotional support animals from
their premises, although frequently, they do not.**

Keep in mind that businesses retain the right to restrict emotional
service animals at any time, even if they initially allow the animal. At
any time, they can ask you and the animal to leave.
