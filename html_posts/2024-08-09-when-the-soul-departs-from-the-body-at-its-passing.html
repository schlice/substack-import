The Bible describes the sequence of events.

When we die, our soul departs our "sleeping" bodies and goes to be with
the Lord:

> So we are always of good courage. We know that while we are at home in
> the body we are away from the Lord, for we walk by faith, not by
> sight. Yes, we are of good courage, and we would rather be away from
> the body and at home with the Lord. \-- 2 Cor 5:6--8 ESV
>
> I am hard pressed between the two. My desire is to depart and be with
> Christ, for that is far better. \-- Phil 1:23 ESV

But we are also told that, at the resurrection, we will receive
glorified bodies, our souls will be reunited with our new, perfected
bodies, and that will be our existence for eternity in the new heavens
and the new earth (cf Revelation 21--22).

But that's after the resurrection. What happens in the meantime?

When the soul departs the body, the Bible describes a sort of
"temporary" heaven and a "temporary" hell. The Bible describes the rich
man being tormented immediately after death:

> The poor man died and was carried by the angels to Abraham's side. The
> rich man also died and was buried, and in Hades, being in torment, he
> lifted up his eyes and saw Abraham far off and Lazarus at his side.
> And he called out, 'Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus
> to dip the end of his finger in water and cool my tongue, for I am in
> anguish in this flame.' \-- Luke 16:22--24 ESV

So the soul will go to that temporary place, a place of comfort or a
place of torment, until the resurrection. After the resurrection occurs
the judgement.

> And the sea gave up the dead who were in it, Death and Hades gave up
> the dead who were in them, and they were judged, each one of them,
> according to what they had done. \-- Revelation 20:13 ESV

The person will be judged, and in their new glorified bodies will either
go to the new earth, or the lake of fire. These two destinations are
final and eternal. People go to one or the other, based entirely on
whether they have trusted Jesus Christ for salvation:

> And these will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into
> eternal life." \-- Matthew 25:46 ESV
>
> Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life; whoever does not obey
> the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God remains on him. \--
> John 3:36 ESV
