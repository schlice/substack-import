**Do MS patients shout and swear at their partners and children every
day?**

I'm going to take a different tack than my colleagues here and suggest
(possibly incorrectly) that this is happening to you, questioner. And
your question here is to ask if this is normal behavior.

So let's start with the facts. Many MS patients will indeed experience
cognitive issues. In fact, about 65% of people with MS will experience
some [[changes in cognitive
functioning](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=3512f2&url=http://www.nationalmssociety.org/Symptoms-Diagnosis/MS-Symptoms/Cognitive-Changes){.external_link

related to speed of information processing, memory and attention.

In MS, we talk about **cognitive reserve**. Cognitive reserve is the way
which our brains can protect against cognitive decline caused by
anything, from MS to aging.

The good news is that anyone can take steps today to improve cognitive
reserve, and research shows that it does add cognitive reserve, at any
age. Some activities you can participate in in order to improve
cognitive reserve:

- Reading
- Creative writing
- Journaling
- Handiwork
- Board or card games
- Drawing or painting
- Cross word or jigsaw puzzles
- Learning a new language
- Learning to play an instrument

In addition, engaging with others -- in a support group, book club,
fellowship meetings at your church or synagogue, or through [[advocacy
activities](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=9a1503&url=http://www.nationalmssociety.org/Get-Involved/Advocate-for-Change){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"

qt-tooltip="nationalmssociety.org"}]{.qlink_container} -- is another way
to stay cognitively active and enjoy the companionship of others at the
same time.[\[2\]](#skJPb){#cite-skJPb .citation_link}

The bottom line here: if signs exist of cognitive decline, talking to
your neurologist is the first step in getting connected to the resources
and extended care team which can improve overall brain health and maybe
head off some of these symptoms.
