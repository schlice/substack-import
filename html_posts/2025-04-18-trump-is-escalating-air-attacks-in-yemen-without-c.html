Let's start with legality first, then move to how the military executes
attacks.

\

Legality has been a sticky wicket for the last 228 years, and it doesn't
look like it's going to be solved any time soon.

Only Congress can declare war, but the President is the Commander in
Chief of the military. The last time Congress declared war was against
Japan in 1941. Every other operation was done without the US declaring
war.

Congress *tried* to rein the President in with the War Powers Act of
1973. Most presidents have complied with some of it and ignored some of
it, believing it unconstitutionally constrains the power of the
Executive to command the military. The War Powers Act requires the
President to notify Congress within 48 hours of deployment of troops
(which most presidents comply with), and restricts the presence of
troops in country for more than 60 days without an AUMF (Authorization
for the Use of Military Force, which most presidents have roundly
ignored).

The disagreement between Congress and the President has never been
severe enough to make it to the SCOTUS, and that's probably by design.
Congress doesn't want to be responsible for committing troops, and the
president doesn't want to have his ability to use the military as he
sees fit limited.

As of today (18 Apr 25), we have been engaged for **35 straight days**
in air attacks on Houthi targets in Yemen, trying to prevent them from
launching missiles against cargo ships and the US Navy in the Red Sea.
Our strikes target Houthi missile banks, and our B-2 Spirit bombers
(based out of Diego Garcia) have been dropping Bunker Buster bombs on
Houthi dug-in targets. But the Houthis continue firing missiles into the
Red Sea, so our air campaign continues. Additionally, they've already
shot down at least four Reapers, and a fifth was brought down using
other means. A single Reaper retails for \$30 million. So we'd kinda
like to keep those.

You said that there is "little to no concern over civilian casualties."
If that were true, we wouldn't be using precision targeting munitions
delivered by manned fighters from carrier groups. We'd deploy BUFFs and
carpet-bomb the whole place. 35 days of continuous air bombardment would
have a tremendous psychological effect on a population. If you needed to
break a nation's fighting spirit, we can do it.

But because we are not, you must presume that we are not intending
civilians to be in the crosshairs. Any civilian casualties are
*collateral damage*; not intended targets. We always use the best intel
we have to target only military objectives. So we do the best we can,
and try to minimize civilian casualties. And we will continue striking
Houthi targets until the missiles stop.

It's important to note that we have carried out over 500 airstrikes in a
little over a month. But the Saudis have carried out over **25,000**
strikes since 2019. None have yet been able to stop Yemen (an Iranian
proxy) from engaging in continued attacks on targets in the Red Sea.
Shipping has to go around the tip of Africa in order to avoid the Red
Sea, which adds weeks to their journeys and interrupts the free flow of
goods in the region.
