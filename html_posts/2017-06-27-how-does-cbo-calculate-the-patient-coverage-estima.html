The CBO tries to include as many people into their estimates as they
can.

Their estimate of the Senate version of the bill says that 22 million
people will lose insurance if it passes. But the CBO (conveniently)
doesn't mention *why* these people won't have insurance. Would it
surprise you to find out that they won't have insurance because *they
don't want it?* One of the groups they took into account are the people
who will *willingly* cancel their plans *because they don't have to own
plans anymore.*

The House and Senate bills don't have any provisions requiring you to
purchase insurance, so many people will simply not buy insurance because
they don't want it. As a matter of fact, when Obamacare was in full
force, estimates are that around 16 million people bought health
insurance or got waivers just to avoid the tax penalty. A portion of
those simply refused to answer on their tax forms (roughly 4 million)
whether or not they had insurance.

So right away, you will have at least 16 million who won't buy insurance
because they are no longer compelled to do so. That's where most of the
22 million number comes from, not because plans will disappear, or
because people won't be able to afford insurance anymore.
