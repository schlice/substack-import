**Is it illegal to have traffic signs in your house?**

No. But what *may* be illegal is how you came to acquire the signs. If
you took the signs off of the road, that's theft of government property.
Regardless of where you have it (in your house, on your house, in your
car, etc), the theft is still the issue.

I used to have a street sign from New York that read 94th Avenue (in
celebration of my graduation year from USAFA, 1994). I actually got it
from the county, but I didn't steal it off the road. My dad knew a guy
in the County signage shop and he made it for me.
