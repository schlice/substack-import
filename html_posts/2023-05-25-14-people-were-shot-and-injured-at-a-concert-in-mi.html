Of course guns are a common denominator! **Gun crimes** necessarily
involve **guns**. It's in the name.

Just the same:

> 13,384 people died in alcohol-related impaired driving accidents last

and

> Approximately 1500 people were murdered with knives last year. Do you

But you are making the logical leap that because there is a
***correlation*** between the killings, the object which is related is
the ***cause.*** This is a logical fallacy, also known as the [["false
cause"
fallacy](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=22885e&url=https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/false-cause){.external_link

onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"

there is a correlation between events does not mean that the events are
caused by the matching criteria. Just as the car did not cause the drunk
driving deaths and the knives did not cause the murders, the gun did not
cause the killings. It was the *instrument* of the killing, but it was
not the *cause* of the killing. It was common among all the killings,
but it did was not the *cause* of the deaths. A person with the will to
take a life is what caused the death.

Focusing on the instrument will not change the course of the killer.
