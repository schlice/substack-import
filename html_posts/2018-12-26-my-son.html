**My son\'s girlfriend\'s parents are seriously concerned that their
girl is dating a boy from a broken family. What should I do/say to allow
their girl to date my son?**

How does this affect your son? Are they literally forbidding the girl
from dating your son because of bad information? I would think that if I
was going to step in on my child's dating, I'd need some pretty solid
information before I made that move.

And I think that would inform my ultimate decision. I think your best
course of action is to tell your son to move on. If the girl is *that
interested* in your son, perhaps she'll get on board and convince her
own parents to let her date him, since it's her problem, not you son's,
and certainly not yours. If the girl's parents are this controlling
*now*, imagine how they'd be as *in-laws.*

No frackin' way. Tell your son that there are other fish in the sea, and
he should just abide by her (and her parents') decision and not date.
