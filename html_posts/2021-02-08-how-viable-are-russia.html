**How viable are Russia's new bullet proof combat suits?**

[[Russia is building a futuristic combat suit it claims can stop .50
caliber
bullets](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=a91dbd&url=https://taskandpurpose.com/military-tech/russia-sotnik-combat-armor-development/){.external_link

Considering that they are building off of a platform that they have been
developing for decades and is already battle-tested to stop a 7.62 NATO
round, it's certainly possible that they could, within the next decade,
*improve* their current battle armor such that it will stop a .50 BMG
round.

There are always trade-offs when you employ armor. Mobility is one of
them, and thermal issues (both hot and cold) are the other. The US
military has been working on exoskeletons which allow their troops to
move more and carry heavier loads, and their armor solutions have been
lagging way behind. But if they can perfect the heavy lifting
capabilities of an exoskeleton, attaching armor to it would be trivial,
and it could easily handle the additional weight without tiring out the
soldier. Then you can include additional components like heads-up
displays and personal environmental control systems.
