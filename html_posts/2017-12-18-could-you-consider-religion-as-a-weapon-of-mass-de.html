Unless you can somehow manage to cobble a million Bibles into a huge
ball and drop it from an airplane, then it is unlikely that religion
(which is an idea, not a thing) does any destroying of anything.

On the other hand, **people** (in the name of religion) do manage to
destroy lots of things, and kill lots of people. Many major religions
have either done this in the past, or are actively doing it today.

This does not make religion a weapon. It makes religion an *ideology*,
which **people** will follow and cause chaos.

The religion is not the weapon. The people are.
