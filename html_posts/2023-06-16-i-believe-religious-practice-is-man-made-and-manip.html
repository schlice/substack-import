So here's a question. Do you believe in the Bible?

If so, you are a Protestant. The Protestants separated from the Roman
Catholic Church in the 16th century. Protestants have five core beliefs:

1.  *Sola Scriptura*. Scripture alone.
2.  *Solus Christus.* Christ alone.
3.  *Sola fide*. Faith alone.
4.  *Sola gratia.* Grace alone.
5.  *Soli Deo gloria.* Glory to God alone.

The description of these distinctives, from our friends at The Gospel
Coalition:

> *Sola scriptura* is the belief that because Scripture is God's
> inspired Word, it is the only inerrant, sufficient, and final
> authority for the church. *Solus Christus* is the assertion that
> Christ alone is the basis on which the ungodly are justified in God's
> sight. *Sola fide* maintains that the believer receives the redemption
> Christ has accomplished only through faith. *Sola gratia* proclaims
> that *all* of our salvation, from beginning to end, is by grace and
> grace alone. Because of these things, the Reformers held fast to the
> phrase s*oli Deo gloria,* that only God receives glory for our
> salvation.[\[1\]](#YoSgd){#cite-YoSgd .citation_link}

We believe that other religions, which may share some of these core
beliefs, have "gone off the rails" somewhere in their journey, and have
abandoned some of these for other beliefs. We believe those faiths are
therefore practicing an unbiblical version of Christianity.

Welcome to the club. We have donuts and coffee.
