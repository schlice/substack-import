*Sheol* is the Jewish word for "the place of the dead." The same word in
Greek is *hades*. It is the place where souls go when they die. Some
parts of the New Testament say that sheol/hades is where souls go where
they await their final resurrection.

Revelation says that "the lake of fire" is the final destination for
Satan and his demons, and all human unrepentant rebels (Revelation 20:10
and others). It is a place of eternal agony for those who have
affirmatively rejected Christ. Those people will have a temporary home
in sheol/hades, but the lake of fire will be their ultimate destination.
