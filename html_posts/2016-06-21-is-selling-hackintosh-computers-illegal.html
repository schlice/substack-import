Short answer: yes, selling Hackintosh computers is illegal.

Longer answer: The EULA for OS X is very clear on how it can be used:

> The grants set forth in this License do not permit you to, and you
> agree not to, install, use or run the Apple Software on any
> non-Apple-branded computer, or to enable others to do so.

It doesn't matter how you purchased the software (if you purchased it at
all). You don't actually "own" the software. You are not permitted to
run it on "whatever hardware" you like. When you "buy" the software, you
are really just buying the right to use it (a license), and you must
remain in full compliance of the EULA bundled with the software when you
do so. And according to that EULA, it is, for all intents and purposes,
illegal to install on any hardware other than Apple hardware.

The question though was: can you sell it?

If you ask the courts that handled the Psystar case, ruling in favor of
Apple, the answer would be a most definite no.

Psystar was an interesting case. The company actually sold computers
pre-designed to accept OS X as a native operating system. As much as
Psystar tried to circumvent the EULA by proving a bundled copy of OS X
and not actually installing the software itself, Apple's lawsuit was
successful, winning damages and multiple appeals against Psystar, which
has since been permanently barred from selling its Hackintosh
systems.[\[1\]](#SYVFF){#cite-SYVFF .citation_link}

What can happen to you for doing it? Most likely, nothing will happen.
Just like most likely nothing will happen to you if you copy a music
file off of Pandora and insert it into your personal music collection.
But let's look at the unlikely. What could happen? Apple could sue you
for violating the licensing agreement. That amounts to breach of
contract, copyright infringement, breaches of the DMCA (Digital
Millennium Copyright Act), etc. The amount of money it will cost you in
legal fees alone would make it prohibitively costly to sell them.
Additionally, while Apple \*probably\* wouldn't go after you for
building a Hackintosh for your own personal use (they may, and they have
the right to do so, so *caveat emptor*), they are **far** more likely to
go after you if you attempt to **profit** off of the violation of their
EULA. Just as if you rip a song from Pandora, make a million copies, and
sell them, you're more likely to get sued if you attempt to profit from
the theft than if you just build one yourself for fun.

There is a fundamental difference between OS X and Windows. Microsoft is
a software company. They design software which is made to run on a wide
variety of platforms. Apple, on the other hand, is a hardware company
which also makes value-added software to run on its hardware. Its
profits come from the hardware, not the software. This is why Microsoft
Office retails for well over \$100, while iWork can be purchased for
around \$30, IIRC. If you could run OS X on a PC for around \$30 instead
of paying the \$1000 that Apple charges for its hardware, Apple is
losing its primary source of revenue.

So while Microsoft doesn't really care what platform you run their
software on, Apple very much does. This is why it is not legal to run OS
X on any hardware other than Apple-branded hardware.

And I definitely wouldn't sell them.
