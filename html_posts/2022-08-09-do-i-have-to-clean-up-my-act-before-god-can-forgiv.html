**No.**

God will accept you **right now, as you are.** Broken, battered, and at
the end of our rope, not perfect and shiny.

> But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still
> sinners, Christ died for us.\
> --- Romans 5:8 NIV

Jesus didn't come to heal the *well*, he came to heal the *sick*. And
all you have to do is **repent** and **believe**.

It's as simple as ABC:

- **A**dmit to God (and to yourself) that you are a sinner and without
  him you are lost.
- **B**elieve that Christ died as a penal substitute for your sins
- **C**onfess that Jesus Christ is your Lord and savior, and **C**ommit
  to turn away from your old life of sin.

**AFTER** you are saved, God will begin the long work of helping you
clean up your act. It's a lifelong process called *sanctification*. With
each passing day, the old ways will fade away, and you'll learn a new
way to live. It takes effort, but keep it up, because God will never,
ever give up on you.
