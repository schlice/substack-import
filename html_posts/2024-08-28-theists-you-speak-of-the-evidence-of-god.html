Part of the problem is what you will consider "evidence." Are you
waiting for a scientific proof to show that God exists?

If that's the case, you're going to be waiting for a very long time. If
God does exist, then necessarily, He is immaterial and eternal.
Therefore, science will never be able to detect the immaterial. So
you're never going to find one of God's hairs or see one of God's
footprints. Such evidence is not only currently unavailable, but it is
also impossible in principle.

Does that mean it is impossible to demonstrate that God exists? No. It
simply means that science is not the right means, just as a metal
detector is not the right tool to find a plastic cup.

The correct tools, or proofs, are logical proofs found in the discipline
of *philosophy*. Philosophy deals with life\'s most significant issues,
including morality, meaning, and the existence of God. Philosophy
enables us to investigate realities that cannot be perceived through our
senses. Therefore, philosophy offers an excellent method to explore
evidence for the existence of God.

But because these philosophical proofs rely on *inductive* reasoning,
they can never be 100% accurate. They can only be *highly likely*. This
means that these proofs will always leave room for **doubt.**

But here's the secret: ***this is not a bug, but a feature.***
