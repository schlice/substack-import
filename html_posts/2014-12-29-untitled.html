<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: [Because here\'s what\'s going to happen:\<br>\<br>In 6 months, another officer-involved shooting will happen and the<br>officer won\'t have a body camera. The public will scream. \"Obama<br>bought every police officer in the US a body camera after Ferguson! You<br>didn\'t wear one because you\'re corrupt!\"\<br>\<br>Now, you and I know that\'s far from the truth, but John Q. Public, who<br>gets his news from the newspapers and from the mainstream media, isn\'t<br>going to see that distinction.\<br>\<br>And some of the other negatives:\<br>\<br>- People aren\'t going to believe what\'s right there in front of them.<br>They\'ll see it on video, and they still won\'t believe it. It\'s going<br>to do nothing to ease racial tensions.\<br>\<br>- It will start to erode the credibility of officers. An officer should<br>be credible at his word. Once body cameras become ubiquitous, if the<br>camera doesn\'t see it, it won\'t be true. If the camera angle isn\'t<br>just right, it won\'t be true. People will start to rely too much on the<br>cameras to create reality, and actual reality will go out the window.<br>The camera won\'t be able to see everything the officer sees, unless we<br>mount a 360 degree camera on top of his head that is capable of<br>recording 360 degrees simultaneously at 1080p, 60fps.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/What-do-law-enforcement-officers-think-about-President-Obamas-decision-to-federally-fund-50-000-body-cameras-for-police-officers/answer/Bill-Stein<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
