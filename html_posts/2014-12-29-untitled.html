<h2>Answer Comment</h2>

**Content:** [Because here\'s what\'s going to happen:\
\
In 6 months, another officer-involved shooting will happen and the
officer won\'t have a body camera. The public will scream. \"Obama
bought every police officer in the US a body camera after Ferguson! You
didn\'t wear one because you\'re corrupt!\"\
\
Now, you and I know that\'s far from the truth, but John Q. Public, who
gets his news from the newspapers and from the mainstream media, isn\'t
going to see that distinction.\
\
And some of the other negatives:\
\
- People aren\'t going to believe what\'s right there in front of them.
They\'ll see it on video, and they still won\'t believe it. It\'s going
to do nothing to ease racial tensions.\
\
- It will start to erode the credibility of officers. An officer should
be credible at his word. Once body cameras become ubiquitous, if the
camera doesn\'t see it, it won\'t be true. If the camera angle isn\'t
just right, it won\'t be true. People will start to rely too much on the
cameras to create reality, and actual reality will go out the window.
The camera won\'t be able to see everything the officer sees, unless we
mount a 360 degree camera on top of his head that is capable of
recording 360 degrees simultaneously at 1080p, 60fps.]{.rendered_qtext}
