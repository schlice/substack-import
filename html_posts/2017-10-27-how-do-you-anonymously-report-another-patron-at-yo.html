Reporting someone is not difficult --- just call 911. The problem is
staying anonymous while you do it. Here are a few ways:

- Find a pay phone and make a phone call.
- See if there is a public use phone somewhere in the library. Make sure
  you keep yourself covered --- hats and glasses are useful.
- [[Use a disposable phone
