**Should all police officers have a body-camera and dash-camera that is
turned on and recording everything when they are on patrol? If no then
please state why you feel that way?**

Should they? In an ideal world, yes, they should.

Is it the *smartest* and most *fiscally responsible* thing to do? By
far, it is not.

In order to have such a policy, you have to ask yourself:

- How long must you store the evidentiary video (i.e. the video that
  actually must be used as evidence)?
- How long must you store the non-evidentiary video (i.e. the video that
  is not actively part of a legal proceeding)?
- How do you handle FOIA requests for either set of materials?

The first two bullets go directly to **cost**. Server space and drive
space is not cheap. It's also not cheap to hire video techs to work full
time cataloging, backing up, and maintaining all that video. Therefore,
the answers to the first two bullets effectively determine exactly how
much money you spend as a department. For departments with unlimited
budgets, they can indeed do this. But when a department has a fixed
budget, priorities must be made. Do we record and store *everything,* or
just the *important stuff*? It is indeed a trade off. If you really want
the police to record and store everything, be prepared for your taxes to
go up. Not interested in a tax hike? Be prepared for trade-offs.

The third bullet is really important. If I can make a FOIA request for
non-evidentiary video, I can request the police release that recording
where a woman detailed her sexual assault and I can put it on YouTube.
She may feel like her privacy was violated, but ah, too bad, you talked
to the police, and their camera is always rolling. Or worse, replace
woman with child above. Or worse, replace that with an informant who is
rolling over on a gang banger. You really think he'll be willing to talk
to police?

Now ask yourself: *how many women or children or informants will
willingly tell police the truth when they know that anyone could request
that video?*

You've just created a chilling effect on things that people wouldn't
want revealed to the world. You'd basically have to consider every
police officer as a video feed to the Internet, and act accordingly,
even when they interview you. And you won't be able to tell the police
the whole truth if you know that their video feed could someday end up
on YouTube.

If it's not clear from the description, this doesn't help anyone.

It's not smart to have cameras on all the time, or at least to not have
officers have discretion over when they can turn them on and off. Both
from an overall cost and a privacy perspective, constantly rolling
cameras are unwise.
