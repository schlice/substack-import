**Caught neighborhood kids on camera stealing my Amazon package, should
I post the video online and call the police?**

Do these things, in this order:

1.  Call the parents. Show them the video. Insist they talk to their
    kids and get the package back, preferably unopened, but at least
    with all of your stuff in it.
2.  If they don't play ball, go to the police. The police may actually
    help you, since the video clearly identifies the kids. They still
    may not do anything about it.
3.  If neither of these avenues of action work for you, feel free to
    post the video online. Call out the kids and their parents. Don't
    slander them, don't lie about them, and don't tell your neighbors to
    do or say anything to them. Just say very clearly what happened and
    let everyone else draw their own conclusions.

Oh. and then give the police report to Amazon (you'll get a police
report even if they don't investigate) so that they can re-send your
package. This time, send it to a nearby Amazon Locker instead of to your
door.
