**When police are conducting an \'investigation\', can they force a
person to go to the police station & answer questions?**

The only way police can "force" anyone to go anywhere is in custody.
Police can "strongly persuade" someone to come to the station for
questioning, but they can't "force" them to come unless they're in
handcuffs.
