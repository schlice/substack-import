**So my Samsung tablet says the password is wrong so I tried to factory
reset (power, volume, home button) but it just bring me to "warning OS
screen" so I click cancel to continue and it says "downloading do not
turn off target" what do I do?**

You didn't reset it. You put it into DFU or (Firmware Download) mode.
That mode allows you to load a new firmware to your tablet, which is not
what you want.

Try this instead:

1.  Ensure the device is powered off.
2.  Press and hold the Volume Up and Power buttons.
3.  Continue to hold Volume Up and Power buttons until the Android
    Recovery screen appears (about 10-15 seconds) then release both
    buttons.
4.  From the Android Recovery screen, select Wipe data/factory reset.
5.  Select Yes.

If this is not working, we'll need a little more information, like which
specific model of Samsung tablet you have.
