There is no purpose.

In order to ask for forgiveness, you must ask *someone* for their
forgiveness. If you wrong someone, you ask that person for forgiveness.

If you do not believe that God exists, you have no one to whom you are
accountable, so you have nothing for which you need to be forgiven. All
is permissible (or at least all you can get away with).

Of course, if God does exist, then living like He doesn't is probably
not going to be a fruitful way to live, but that's not what you asked.
