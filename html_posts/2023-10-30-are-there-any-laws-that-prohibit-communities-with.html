Since states, counties and cities make laws, it would be impossible for
us to say how any one of those thousands of entities across the United
States may or may not regulate what HOAs are allowed to do.

But in general, the answer is no. States, counties, and cities *usually*
leave HOAs to govern their areas as they see fit in order to accomplish
their stated goals. They generally do not put provisions on what HOA
rules must say and what they must not say. Even here in Florida, the
land where the HOA was born, the strict state laws surrounding HOAs only
say in the broadest terms what rules HOAs cannot make. For example, our
most recent state law change with respect to HOAs stated that an HOA
cannot regulate what cannot be seen from neighboring properties in a
home's back yard. So if you want to install a pool, or if you want to
put artificial turf in your back yard, the HOA cannot regulate that.

If the HOA rule is "no overnight street parking," and the rule was duly
enacted in accordance with the HOA's Governing Documents, then the HOA
is legally permitted to pursue its stated discipline schedule when
homeowners violate those rules.
