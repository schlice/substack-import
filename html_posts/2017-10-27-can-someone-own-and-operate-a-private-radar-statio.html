Short answer is yes, but with many governmental caveats.

The FCC governs transmitting radio base units, so you would have to be
licensed by them in order to operate your radar station. Anything over a
certain transmit wattage is regulated. Very small transmitters are
unregulated (for example, the transmitter which plugs into the cigarette
lighter in your car and allows you to play your phone's music onto a
quiet FM frequency which can be received by your car stereo).

Your radar station would also have to be separately certified for
operation by the FCC. They would have to understand the total output of
the station and on what frequencies so they can understand the overlap
your station may have with other nearby stations. This, by the way, was
the original charter of the FCC, regulating radio and television
stations to avoid frequency overlap.

The parts to build your radar station are not individually regulated.
You can build a radar station, you just can't operate it without the
proper licensing for yourself and certification of the station.
