**What is the highest amount of nicotine content legal in the US?**

Since you're talking about "nicotine content," I can only assume you're
talking about "vape juice," or the liquid used in e-cigarettes or in
vape "mods." This liquid is usually referred to as "e-liquid."

Commercial e-liquid is normally available in zero nicotine, 3mg, 6mg,
12mg, and 18mg, although the highest nicotine e-liquid may reach 36mg.
These numbers are milligrams of nicotine per 1 mL of fluid, so it can
also be expressed as a percentage. For example, 18mg/mL can also be
expressed as 1.8%.
