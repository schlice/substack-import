**Content:** [You want to throw her for a loop? I mean *really* blow her
mind? You want to see the most dumbfounded look *ever* plastered on a
female face?\
\
***Tell her you love her and you forgive her. Tell her you think that
the reason she cheated was because you weren\'t an attentive-enough
husband and you\'ll try to do better.***\
\
She\'ll spend the rest of her days doing one or more of these things
(possibly all of them):\
]{.rendered_qtext}

- Wondering how she was fortunate enough to find such a loving and
  understanding husband and trying to make up for it
- Wondering what\'s really going on inside your head and trying to
  understand it
- Wondering when the other shoe is going to drop and trying to prepare
  for it.\

You\'ll totally break her brain.
