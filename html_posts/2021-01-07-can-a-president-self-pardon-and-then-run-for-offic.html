**Can a president self-pardon and then run for office again?**

Whether or not a president can pardon himself is a legal question that
has yet to be decided by the courts. There is nothing specifically
written in the Constitution which states that a president cannot pardon
himself. Legal scholars are split on whether or not a president can
actually pardon himself.

Whether or not a president can run for office again is governed by the
presidential term limits in the 22nd Amendment. Whether or not a person
can *be* president is governed by Article II of the Constitution: he or
she must be 35 years of age, be a natural born citizen, and must have
lived in the United States for at least 14 years. Even a convicted felon
can hold the office of president. The Constitution does not bar
convicted felons from running for, or holding, the office of president.
