**What was the US Air force programme in the 1950\'s that allowed
applicants with two years of college enter flight school and become
officers if they graduated flight school, or become enlisted men if they
failed?**

I think you'll find this page at Wikipedia illuminating. It was more
than just the 50s; in fact, it ended in the 60s. But it was training
pilots starting in 1907:

The program was modified several times during its existence, but it was
eventually phased out in 1960, a year after the Air Force Academy
started graduating Air Force officers. The Air Force introduced
Undergraduate Pilot Training (UPT) to replace the Aviation Cadet
Training Program, and USAFA, OTS, and AFROTC would supply all of the
students.
