Short answer: it is illegal to fight a police officer who is performing
his duties.

Everyone else answered all the details for you. Even if you are right,
and even if the officer walked up to you, while you were doing nothing
but minding your own business, and simply tried to kill you for no good
reason, you would still be in a position of disadvantage legally because
there are no legal circumstances in which you are allowed to fight an
officer. You might do it to save your life (in your opinion), but
you\'re still going to end up in jail for assaulting a police officer.
By the way, this is why the vast majority of people who fight with
police do it: they really and truly believed they were going to die and
they simply wanted to defend themselves. Still illegal, though.

Regardless, there is no situation in which fighting with a police
officer will end up good for you.
