Short answer is yes.

Longer answer is that the vast majority of work arrangements in the US
are "at-will" employment. You can quit at any time, and your employer
can fire you at any time. Your boss would have to fire you for an
illegal reason in order for it to be illegal. If he literally, on a
whim, just decided to fire everyone for absolutely no reason, it is
legal. it's bad for business, but it's not illegal.

That said, there are a few exceptions to the at-will employment rule.

If you have some form of contract or written agreement that promises you
a job for a certain period of time (and that includes offer letters
which promise continued employment), you may have an *implied contract*
and you may be able to enforce the provisions of that implied contract
in court.

Implied contracts do not need to be simply a document that isn't a
technical contract. They can indeed be verbal --- promises made by your
employer that your employment would be "permanent" or for a specified
time. If your employer boasted about this frequently, even if he never
put it in writing, this could be construed as an implied contract, which
could be legally enforceable.

Also, if there is a standard disciplinary practice in your business
which was not followed, such as problem employees being provided an
improvement plan and a 6-month period to improve before being fired, and
you were not provided such a plan, this could also be viewed as breach
of an implied contract.

Some states recognize what is called a breach of "good faith and fair
dealing." For example, if your employer was firing you all so that he
could hire cheaper labor, or repeatedly assigning you crap tasks so that
you would quit on your own, or misleading employees about their chances
of promotion and salary increases, these could be considered breaches of
good faith and fair dealing. Like I said, not all states recognize this,
and some states require that you have a written employment contract
before you can sue for breach of good faith and fair dealing.

As I mentioned initially, you cannot be fired for an illegal reason.
Some illegal reasons:

- Violations of public policy, such as being fired because you served on
  a jury or as part of the military Reserves or National Guard
- Retaliation, which occurs when you perform a legally protected act
  like reporting an ethics violation to the appropriate authorities and
  you are fired as a result of it (also called *whistleblowing*)
- Discrimination, such as being fired for being too old, or being
  female, or Black, or Muslim.
- Defamation. While defamation lawsuits are separate from termination,
  if you have proof that your termination was due to false statements
  made about you, and your employer knew that they were false (or
  recklessly disregarded the actual truth of the statement), and that
  false statement harmed you (by causing you to lose your job), you may
  have a defamation claim, and that verdict could impact your future
  employment.

If you think you have a claim for wrongful termination, it is imperative
that you consult with an employment attorney in your local area as soon
as possible, or you risk running out of time to file your claim.
