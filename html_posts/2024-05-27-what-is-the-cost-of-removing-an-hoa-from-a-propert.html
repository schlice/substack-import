You can't remove an HOA from your property. It existed prior to your
purchasing the land.

You can potentially dissolve the HOA itself, and since that process
involves attorneys and is quite complex, it is also expensive. You would
also have to have the agreement of a large majority of the existing
homeowners in the community, and there's a fair chance that at least
some of them like what the HOA is doing.
