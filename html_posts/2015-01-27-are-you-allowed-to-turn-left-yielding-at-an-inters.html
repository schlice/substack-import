**Content:** [I have to agree with the other posters, you can\'t make a
left at any red light (unless you\'re on a one-way street turning left
onto another one-way street, but there are still seven states that
don\'t allow this), be it a red ball or a red arrow. So yes, you can get
a ticket even though the light is incorrect.\
\
It\'s unlikely that because the light is incorrect that you\'d get a
ticket for going \*straight\*.]{.rendered_qtext}
