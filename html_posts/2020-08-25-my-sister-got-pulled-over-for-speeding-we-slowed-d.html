**My sister got pulled over for speeding. We slowed down at least 500ft
from the cop. I checked when my sister was slowing down and she wasn't
going over 85 (70mph zone). He gave us a ticket for going 85. What
should?**

The law doesn't say that you only get a speeding ticket if you don't
slow down in time, before the cop sees you.

The law doesn't say that you are allowed to exceed the speed limit
unless cops are around.

The law doesn't say that it's not illegal if you don't get caught.

You were speeding. You got caught.

What should you do? Pay the ticket, and stop speeding.

If you want some advice, don't ever do more than 5 over. 5 mph is within
the limits of the inaccuracy of your speedometer and the inaccuracies
which may be present in any speed measuring device. But hey, that's free
advice, and it's worth every penny you paid for it.

(EDIT) It has been suggested that your question is actually one of
ability of the officer to actually measure your speed accurately at the
distance at which you were located. With traditional RADAR, this might
be true. But with LIDAR, your speed can be measured accurately at a much
greater distance than the 500 feet within which you say you slowed down.
The theoretical range of a LIDAR gun is about 2000 feet in ideal
conditions, but in all practicality, it is generally effective at an
average range of about 1000 feet away.

In other words, if he was using LIDAR, he got your speed at twice the
distance away from him that you slowed down. He saw your speed, and he
even saw you slowed down when you saw him, so not only does he know that
you were speeding, he also knows that you knew you were speeding.

This means you're double-caught. My original advice stands. Pay the fine
and quit speeding.
