**Content:** [Free speech is exactly that. And contributing any amount
of money I choose is part of my right to speak freely.\
\
What the court failed to take into account is the fact that there is a
downside to free speech, and that is enabling censorship by speaking so
loudly that you drown out other free speech. The amount of your free
speech can actually hinder the speech of others.\
