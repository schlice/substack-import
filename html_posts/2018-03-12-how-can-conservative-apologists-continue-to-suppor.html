**How can conservative apologists continue to support the NRA in light
of the organization being beholden to Russian anti-American interests?**

Please cite the mission, vision, or values statements of the NRA that
directly benefit Russia and do not benefit the *actual stakeholders ---
American gun owners.*

**Don't they realize they've taken a 180Â° course change from their
stated values?**

Who exactly has taken a 180 degree course change? The NRA? Again, please
cite the updated mission, vision, or values statements which lead you to
believe the organization has shifted (180 degrees in your words) from
their original values.
