<h2>Answer Comment</h2>

Please don\'t misunderstand, I want you to write your book, and I\'m
genuinely interested. When it\'s ready, I\'ll probably buy a copy
because your story is fascinating already, and I haven\'t even seen the
book yet.

My tone comes across as harsh initially, because I have spoken to *so
many people* who believed they "cured\" their MS or "healed themselves\"
that they have come off of their medications. Almost without fail, they
relapsed, and ended up with more disability than if they would have just
stayed the course. I can see this is not you, so if you were off-put by
my initial tone, I apologize. I also agree, Complementary and
Alternative Medicines (CAMs) are, first and foremost, *complementary,*
meaning they complement traditional medicines. You can\'t eschew one for
the other, you need both.

HSCT stands for [[hematopoietic stem cell
transplantation](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=9a8f9f&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematopoietic_stem_cell_transplantation){.external_link

[[It](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=9a8f9f&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematopoietic_stem_cell_transplantation){.external_link

your own induced pluripotent stem cells to "reboot\" your immune system.
They harvest your stem cells, induce pluripotency, and reproduce them.
Then they use chemotherapy to destroy your bone marrow. Once it is all
gone, they re-introduce your stem cells and re-grow your bone marrow,
thus restarting your immune system from scratch. It is a dangerous
procedure (one has died already), and there are indeed many risks, but
so far, the small study group has seen tremendous success, with 70%
coming completely off of medication with no further indication of MS.
Larger trials are just beginning now, but it shows promise.

Good luck, and keep us posted on the book.
