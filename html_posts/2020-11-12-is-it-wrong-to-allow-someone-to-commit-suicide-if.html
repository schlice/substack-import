**Is it wrong to allow someone to commit suicide if they truly do not
have any will or desire to live or anyone to live for?**

So you asked if it was "wrong" to allow someone to kill themselves if
they truly have no will to live. So in order to determine "wrongness"
without using a religious context, we have to determine if it is right
or wrong to have a will to live. Note that in order to do this in the
way you're asking, we must ignore the religious aspect and focus just on
the morality of allowing someone to kill themselves without
intervention. And before the perfectionists start coming at me in the
comments, I know that without basis, morality is fluid. I'm going to try
to use human physiological traits to indicate the human desire to
continue to live, so gimme a break here.

So here goes:

Self-preservation is nearly a universal human trait. Subconscious action
is nearly always taken to preserve life at all costs. If you cannot
breathe, you will struggle against whatever condition is causing you to
not be able to breathe. Therefore, physiologically speaking, we can say
that people have an innate, inbuilt will to live. Society did not teach
them this. Their parents did not teach them this. They are innately
programmed to continue to live at all costs.

Therefore, anything done to countermand the continuance of your life
would lie in direct opposition to physiology. In other words, taking
your own life goes against how we are built as human beings.

Understanding this, we can also say that a "desire" to no longer live,
or a "lack of desire" to continue living, is also incongruous with how
we are built. Clearly, this would be something caused by invalid
thinking or invalid logic incorrectly influencing our natural desire to
continue to live.

Knowing that someone's desire to terminate their life is unnatural and
violates how we were designed, then yes it would be wrong to allow
someone to terminate their life when they are simply suffering from
invalid logic or invalid thinking leading them to believe that they do
not have a will to live.

**TL;DR:** *A lack of a will to live indicates mental disease and
invalid mental processing. It would be wrong to allow someone to kill
themselves when they are merely suffering from a mental disease. You
should lead them to get help, not assist them in fulfilling their faulty
desires.*
