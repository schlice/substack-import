The question isn't hiring a phlebotomist to draw your blood. The
question isn't also about using your blood for art (although that's an
interesting idea with its own challenges --- we'll get there in a
minute).

The big problem you're going to have is **how to store your blood**.

In the U.S., the collection, testing, preparation, storage and transport
of blood and blood components must comply with FDA regulations and
guidance documents. And blood that is not going to be used for medical
purposes is considered **medical waste** and is a **biohazard**. Blood
is a biohazard because it has the potential to carry contagions which
can infect others. Therefore, blood must be handled in accordance with
its intended use, and storing blood for artistic use is similarly going
to be a problem, both legally and practically.
