Congress can't "guarantee a right to an abortion," because the
Constitution guarantees rights. Laws cannot guarantee rights, as laws
can be overturned by other laws, or by the Constitution through the
courts. Only the Constitution can guarantee rights will not be abridged,
as the Constitution can only be amended by another Constitutional
amendment.

That said, yes, Congress can pass federal abortion laws. While there are
limits to what Congress can legislate, they can certainly put something
together, in the same way that they passed the federal Partial Birth
Abortion Ban Act, which was upheld in 2007. This law was grounded in the
Commerce Clause, so there is a mechanism for a willing Congress to pass
such a law.

Original question:

Could the US Congress have ever passed a federal law guaranting \[sic\]
a woman's right to an abortion? Could they do it now if they were
willing?
