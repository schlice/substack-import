**Can an HOA have more than one treasurer on its board? What are the
pros of having two treasurers?**

Generally each Board position is only filled by one person. Additional
Board members who do not fill a vacant Board position are known as
**Members-At-Large**. They have full voting rights and vote when the
Board must vote on matters before them, but they don't occupy a denoted
seat.

This is all spelled out in the *Bylaws* of the Association. If the
Association's Bylaws allow positions to be filled by more than one
person, they would be known as "Co-Chairs." In this case, you'd have
"Co-Treasurers."

But again, this is only if the Bylaws allow it.
