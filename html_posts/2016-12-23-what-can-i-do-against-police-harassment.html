If you ever believe that police conduct is improper, it is up to you to
report that behavior. You have several options.

1.  You can go down to the local police department in question and file
    a complaint. Be aware that you will have to identify yourself and
    give real personal information (name, address, phone number, SSN in
    some jurisdictions, etc), and provide a written affidavit.
    Investigators will question you. It seems a bit intimidating, but it
    is necessary.
2.  If you don't get anywhere with the local department, your best next
    step is to go to your local media. Most local TV stations have a
    "Call for Action" hotline. Call them, tell them your story. They
    will make some phone calls on your behalf to the department in
    question. If your complaint didn't get any traction, the local media
    sniffing around for a story may prod them into action. You will
    either hear something being done, or you will clearly hear why the
    department believes nothing needs to be done.
