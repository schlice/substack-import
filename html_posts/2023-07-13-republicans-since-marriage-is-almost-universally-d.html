An excellent question! Time for a history lesson.

So marriage has existed for a very, very long time. The first recorded
evidence of marriage ceremonies dates back to about 2350 B.C. in
Mesopotamia. Over the next several hundred years, marriage became a
widespread institution embraced by the ancient Hebrews, Greeks, and
Romans.

In other words, marriage started as a religious institution. As you
noted, "marriages" are performed by a religious figure in a religious
building as part of a religious ceremony. According to the Genesis
creation account, God instituted marriage after the creation of the
first woman, Eve, from Adam, the first man. The first marriage was based
on a covenant promise.

So why is the state involved?

In the United States, the federal government formally recognized
marriage in law for the first time with the passage of the Revenue Act
of 1913. In 1929, all states had laws regarding marriage licenses. In
1933, married women were granted the right to citizenship independent of
their husbands.

The state, in the early 1900s, started licensing and regulating
marriage. They also started performing "marriage" ceremonies of their
own, without a church involved.

So again, why does the state care what churches do? Why does the state
have to *sanction* a church function?

There is one overarching reason why states license marriage: **sex
between men and women regularly produces children.** The reason why
states care about marriage is because of its **generativity**. The state
licenses married couples because it provides an easy way to determine
who the parents of children are. The state has a compelling interest in
ensuring that children have well-known and easily recognized parents,
and even today, most children are born to people who are, indeed,
married.

Once a child is born, if the parents are married, the state *assumes*
that the married couple are the biological parents of that child. They
are called the "presumptive parents." The only way we can conclusively
determine who a parent is is for a person to claim that they are the
child's parent, or for one of the presumptive parents to claim that they
are not the child's parent, and then blood tests ensue. The paradigm of
presumptive parents eliminates the need to do blood tests every time a
child is born in order to establish parental identity. State-sanctioned
marriage provides this.

\

So now that we know why the state stuck its nose into, and co-opted, the
religious institution of marriage, we can look at your question.

You said "Since religion is the real source of marriage (a religious
person performs the ceremony in a religious place as part of a religious
ceremony), how do you get to say that homosexuals can't marry?" Well,
the answer is obvious. Since it's a religious ceremony, the church in
question gets to make its own rules. If that church says that
homosexuals cannot marry, then they can't. It's that simple.ยน

Maybe you were asking why *religious people* tell homosexuals that they
shouldn't get married *outside of a church*. In other words, maybe
you're saying that religious people will frequently say that marriage
doesn't make sense for homosexuals.

And if you look at the (very basic outlined) history of marriage I gave
above, you'd see that the state's interest in marriage has to do with
children being produced by sex between men and women.

***This is a very specific issue which is not something that homosexual
couples have to worry about.***

Therefore, marriage, in a civil sense, makes no sense to the homosexual
couple.

More importantly, allowing homosexuals to marry, when the institution of
marriage doesn't make sense for them, tells the world that marriage is
less about **the needs of children** and more about **the desires of
adults**.

Marriage isn't about recognizing loving relationships. The state has no
compelling interest in recognizing any relationship, let alone loving
ones. If this were the case, then there are plenty of relationships
which should also qualify for marriage that currently do not.

Marriage isn't even about raising children. Because if that's the case,
there are plenty of other family arrangements in which children are
being raised in which marriage should be applied, and it is not.

I will say that the states attached a lot of benefits to marriage in
order to encourage adults to structure their lives in such a way as to
benefit children (who, as we already said, they have an interest in
ensuring are cared for). To that end, marriage is an easy way for
homosexual couples to gain those benefits too, especially if they adopt
children.

Marriage is about generativity, when men and women have sex and create
children. The marriage helps the state presume who the parents of that
child are, and homosexuals never have that problem. Adopting a child
automatically indicates the "parents" of that child. But for born
children, marriage facilitates determining parental lineage.

ยน Some churches do allow homosexuals to marry. See the United Church of
Christ.
