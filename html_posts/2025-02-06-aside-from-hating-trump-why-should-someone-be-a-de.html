This was crossposted in the Republican space, which really doesn't make
any sense, but as a conservative, let me see if I can take a swing at
this. An actual, honest assessment of someone who should remain a
Democrat in 2025.

The main reason to continue to be a Democrat in 2025 is if you believe
that **the answer to the nation's problems is** ***more government*.**

If you believe that the only thing that will bring America back into
economic stability and peace is by adding more government oversight, not
less, you should continue to be a Democrat.

If you believe that expanding the bureaucratic state is beneficial for
the largest amount of people in the country, you should continue to be a
Democrat.

If you believe the Constitution is a "living document" and should be
interpreted based on the "common view of the day," you should continue
to be a Democrat.

If you think that the government should have broad authority into most
areas of your life, because "why not, I have nothing to hide" and it
would stop the crazies (whoever they may be), then the Democratic Party
is for you.

If you think that the government should control prices on goods because
of "evil corporations" who are only out to line their own pockets, then
the Democratic party is for you.

If you believe that the government should silence people who try to
spread "disinformation" on social media, and that we should expand the
use of "fact checkers" to make sure that people only spread "real"
information, then you should continue to be a Democrat.

If you believe that the National Guard has obviated the need for anyone
outside of the government (military, police, or National Guard) to keep
or bear arms, then the Democratic Party is for you.

If you believe that religion belongs confined to the inside of the four
walls of whatever church building you choose to attend (if you want to
continue to waste your time on such ancient and backwards thinking), and
if you believe that if you run a business, you can never allow your
religion to influence how you do business in the public square, then the
Democratic Party is for you.

I think this is a fair assessment based on how conservatives view those
who should remain Democrats.

(EDIT) As I'm seeing comments, I'm thinking of other things that
separate the parties. Here's another:

If you believe that America is *fundamentally evil*, that its founding
documents and our nation's laws and systems of government were founded
specifically to create a white supremacist nation, and that there is no
way for there to ever be equity in this country unless the government
creates and enforces that equity, then you should continue to be a
Democrat.

Similarly, if you don't believe in American exceptionalism, or if
hearing that term causes you to blanch, then you probably should
continue to be a Democrat. If you don't think America is exceptional, if
you don't think America was ever great to begin with, we shouldn't
strive to make America great, and America can never be great unless we
rip it out by the roots and start again, then the Democratic Party is
for you. In other words, if you don't think that America truly was
founded in 1776, but was instead founded in 1619, then you should
probably continue to be a Democrat.

(EDIT 2) By the way, if you are Republican and some of these ideas
resonate with you, ***that's okay!*** Let's talk about it! Let's discuss
what about these ideas you like. Let's discuss the Constitution. Let's
discuss things *respectfully.* We don't need to agree on everything.
That's good and healthy. Having healthy debate and dialogue is vital to
the free exchange of ideas. We're never going to agree on everything.
Patton said, "If everyone is thinking alike, then someone isn't
thinking." Groupthink gets you nowhere, because there is no room for
critical thinking when there is no free exchange of ideas.
