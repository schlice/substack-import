No. An employer cannot deny your request for accommodation by evaluating
your disability. They are not doctors.

But an employer can deny your request for accommodation if it creates an
**undue hardship** on the business. An undue hardship is when the cost
of providing the accommodation is either too expensive or too disruptive
to the organization.

Some things which would be considered an undue hardship include, but is
not limited to, accommodations which:

- Diminish efficiency in other jobs
- Infringe on other employees\' job rights or benefits
- Impair workplace safety
- Cause co-workers to carry the accommodated employee\'s share of
  potentially hazardous or burdensome work

If you feel an employer has unlawfully denied your request for
accommodation under ADA, reach out to your HR team, or consult an
attorney in your area who specializes in ADA employment law.
