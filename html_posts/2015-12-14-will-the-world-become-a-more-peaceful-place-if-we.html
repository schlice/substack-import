The only way that the world would become more peaceful if we could
(somehow) remove all the guns from it instantly would be if the guns
were the cause of the violence. Remove the gun, remove the violence.

However (and gun control advocates often seem to miss this point),
**guns do not cause violence**. Guns are a tool, one of many which could
be used to commit violence. Guns, by themselves, do not cause violence
any more than pencils cause spelling errors or forks cause obesity. You
need a consciousness behind the gun to cause violence.

Therefore, using that understanding, removing the gun will not cause
peace, because the gun does not cause violence. Removing the gun will
remove a tool that can be used for good or for ill. The gun will be
replaced with something else, most likely a sword, a knife, a baton,
pepper spray, Tasers, bow and arrows, and spears.
