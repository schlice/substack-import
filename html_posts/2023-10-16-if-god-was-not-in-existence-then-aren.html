If God doesn't exist, then objective morality doesn't exist either.
Therefore, anything is okay. Marriage is unnecessary. Abortion is okay.
Sex is okay. Murder is okay. Violating dignity is okay.

Remember, we're talking *morally* here. People are free to *legally*
come together and collectively decide that they don't want murder, or
abortion, or sex outside of marriage, if they choose.

But if God doesn't exist, then morally, anything is acceptable.
