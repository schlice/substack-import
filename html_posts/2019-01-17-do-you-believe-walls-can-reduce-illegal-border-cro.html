**Do you believe walls can reduce illegal border crossings?**

It doesn't really matter what I believe about walls and illegal border
crossings. What really matters is what the people on the ground, doing
the business of guarding the border, think.

And overwhelmingly, US Customs and Border Protection personnel believe
that a border barrier can reduce (not completely stop, but definitely
reduce) illegal border crossings.

Additionally, it will allow CBP to focus their spending and their
efforts in *other* areas, like people going over or under the barrier,
or processing entrants at the border checkpoint.
