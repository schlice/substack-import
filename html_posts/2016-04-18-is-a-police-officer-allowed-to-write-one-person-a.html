He is allowed to do so (as he has the authority to make judgment calls
about whether or not a violation should be written), but it\'s not wise.
He could get himself into trouble because of what we call *selective
enforcement*. This is a defense which is often raised by a driver who
claims the officer ignored others around him who were also violating the
same law.

To win with a "selective enforcement" defense, however, you have to take
a huge ­additional step and show that the officer had a specific and
improper ­motive to pick on you. Unless you can prove (not just allege)
that the officer was unfairly targeting you alone, you won\'t be able to
get by with a \"selective enforcement\" defense in traffic court.

The reason is, regardless of what the officer did or did not do with
other motorists, you were actually violating the statute in question,
and the officer did observe you violating the statute. So the presence
or absence of tickets given to other motorists does not change what
happened in your particular case.
