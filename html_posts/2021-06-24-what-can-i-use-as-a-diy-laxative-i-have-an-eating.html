Not sure what you consider a "DIY" laxative. Do you mean something
that's not a medicine, but is still a laxative?

You might consider mineral oil:

But use with caution: as with all laxatives, don't use for more than 7
days without consulting with your doctor. Mineral oil can block other
medicines, and also blocks vitamin absorption, so do not take with food.

Since it can take 6--8 hours to produce a bowel movement, it's best to
take it at night so you give it a full night to work.

Beyond 7 days, you should only use general use laxatives with the advise
of your doctor.

Original question:

What can I use as a DIY laxative? I have an eating disorder and I have
trouble using the bathroom. Don\'t tell me to \"just eat\" that isn\'t
gonna do crap.
