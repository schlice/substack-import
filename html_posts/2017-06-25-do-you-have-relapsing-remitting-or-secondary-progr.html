I have RRMS.

I started on Copaxone, and used it for about seven years. It worked
great until it stopped working. I had a relapse and picked up a new
symptom.

I switched to Tysabri. It worked great. So well, in fact, that over the
18 months I was on it, some of my lesions started to *shrink.* But the
method of administration (infusion) was hard on my liver, which was
already taxed processing depression meds. This altered the levels of
meds between infusions, and sent my mood into a monthly roller coaster.
So we were forced to switch again.

We settled on Gilenya, and while it has caused some GI issues, it has
largely been effective.

Best medicine overall for my MS? **Tysabri**.
