If the person is not in immediate danger, you treat them where they lie.
If you cannot safely treat the person without being in danger yourself,
you either have to divert traffic or move the person. It's very
dangerous to move the person, and you would only want to do so if
leaving them where they are poses more of a risk to their life than
moving them. You risk severely injuring the person by moving them, so
only move them if their life is in danger by leaving them.

Outside of those narrow exceptions, if you can treat the victim *in
situ*, do so. In American first aid, we use the three B's to prioritize
first responder medical care:

- Breathing
- Bleeding
- Broken Bones

We treat breathing before bleeding because the victim will die faster
from not breathing than they will from bleeding out.

Ideally, we make sure that they are breathing and not bleeding to death.
If those two things are accomplished, ideally we *do nothing.* We call
911 and stay on the phone with the dispatcher until help arrives. Keep
the victim conscious and calm. Don't give water other than small sips.
Treat for shock: *If the face is red, raise the head; if the face is
pale, raise the tail.* Don't move the head if the victim is unconscious.
They have to be able to lift their own head. If you raise the head while
the victim has a broken spinal column, you could permanently paralyze
the victim for life. Try to avoid that. But if the victim's pulse starts
to get rapid and shallow, and their face starts to pale, try to calm
them down, and elevate their feet above their heart. Keep any other
movement of the body to a minimum unless the victim chooses to get up
and move.
