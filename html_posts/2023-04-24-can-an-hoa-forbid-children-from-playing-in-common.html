Yes, HOAs can put whatever access restrictions they choose on the common
areas. So long as they do so in accordance with their Governing
Documents, they can indeed impose access restrictions on the common
areas. Usually, such restrictions are at the discretion of the Board of
Directors.

You should also bear in mind that HOAs only carry general liability
insurance on those areas, and that may be insufficient if your children
are injured and you need to collect. In other words, it might be in your
best financial interest to keep your kids out of those areas.

And if the HOA *does* prohibit people from entering those areas and your
children violate the rules and play down there anyway and end up getting
hurt, I doubt the HOA's liability insurance would pay at all.
