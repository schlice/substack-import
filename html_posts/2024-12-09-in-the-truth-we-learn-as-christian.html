You are not alone in your misunderstanding. Many Christians seem to have
missed the memo on judging.

It's funny, because not just 2 John says we need to judge in order to
decide with whom to associate. Even Jesus, right after He talked about
judging in the Sermon on the Mount, went on to tell us that we needed to
judge! He says:

> *"Do not give dogs what is holy, and do not throw your pearls before
> pigs, lest they trample them underfoot and turn to attack you. \--
> Matthew 7:6 ESV*
>
> *"Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep's clothing but
> inwardly are ravenous wolves. You will recognize them by their fruits.
> Are grapes gathered from thornbushes, or figs from thistles? \--
> Matthew 7:15--16 ESV*

In both of these passages, both in revealing the Gospel to those who
just want to use it to tear you down, and being wary of false prophets,
we have to judge them in order to either beware or not cast pearls
before swine. How are we to discern who are the "dogs" and "pigs" and
"false prophets" unless we have the ability to make a judgment call on
doctrines and deeds? Jesus is giving us permission to tell right from
wrong.

In other words, apparently right after He says don't judge, He says *to*
judge.

When we find an apparent contradiction in the Bible, the process to fix
it is exactly the same. Usually, it's because we're not looking wide
enough. In other words, we're probably missing context.

Jesus says, in John 7:24, that we should "stop judging by mere
appearances, but judge correctly." Ah, so there is a *correct* way to
judge? Yes, there is.

Certain types of judgements are not acceptable:

> - *Superficial judgment* is wrong. Passing judgment on someone based
>   solely on appearances is sinful (John 7:24). It is foolish to jump
>   to conclusions before investigating the facts (Proverbs 18:13).
>   Simon the Pharisee passed judgment on a woman based on her
>   appearance and reputation, but he could not see that the woman had
>   been forgiven; Simon thus drew Jesus' rebuke for his unrighteous
>   judgment (Luke 7:36--50).
> - *Hypocritical judgment* is wrong. Jesus' command not to judge others
>   in Matthew 7:1 is preceded by comparisons to hypocrites (Matthew
>   6:2, 5, 16) and followed by a warning against hypocrisy (Matthew
>   7:3--5). When we point out the sin of others while we ourselves
>   commit the same sin, we condemn ourselves (Romans 2:1).
> - *Harsh, unforgiving judgment* is wrong. We are "always to be gentle
>   toward everyone" (Titus 3:2). It is the merciful who will be shown
>   mercy (Matthew 5:7), and, as Jesus warned, "In the same way you
>   judge others, you will be judged, and with the measure you use, it
>   will be measured to you" (Matthew 7:2).
> - *Self-righteous judgment* is wrong. We are called to humility, and
>   "God opposes the proud" (James 4:6). In Jesus' parable of the

>   own righteousness and from that proud position judged the publican;

The context tells us that judging alone is not wrong. But *judging
wrongly* is indeed wrong. And speaking out against sin is also not
wrong. We hold Christians to that standard, and clearly, those who
choose sin over God won't be happy with you pointing out the speck in
their eye. So long as we have removed the plank from our own eye (see
hypocritical judgement above), we can, and indeed are commanded to,
point out the speck in our brother's eye.
