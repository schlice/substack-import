If the goal of the Christian's life were to be more like Christ, then
there would be no difference between someone who is not Christian simply
being a better person, and a Christian.

But the "goal" of the Christian's life is not just to be more like
Christ.

The "goal" (if you want to call it that) is to be *saved.*

Once the Christian is saved, they spend the rest of their lives learning
more about Christ, and becoming more Christ-like. In other words, the
works (being a good person) are the *result* of the salvation. The works
are not the end goal.

The works do not save you. Only Christ saves you.
