**Are you shocked that the Trump administration won\'t meet the deadline
to reunite migrant children with their families?**

Of course not. It wasn't an administration official who set the
timeline. It wasn't even an administration official who came up with the
timeline. It was a judge. A judge who clearly either a) has no idea how
much time it takes to move a child into safe housing, thus how much time
it would take to undo that process, or b) doesn't care. Maybe c) both a
and b.

So, shocking? Nah. What's ***really*** shocking is that this was a thing
in the first place. It's shocking that no one was screaming about the
injustice when the Obama administration was doing the **exact. same.
thing.** with kids who came into this country. He threw them on buses
and planes and shipped them off to foster homes all over the country.
And these were kids who came into the country illegally, with someone
who was not their parent.

It's shocking that no one cares that it was during the Obama
administration that the law was reviewed by the 9th Circus that **forced
ICE to separate parents from children in the first place!** The
proponents of the law said that it was *inhumane* to keep kids in
incarceration. They called it child abuse.

It's shocking that people are so oblivious to the obviously manufactured
media kerfuffle that wasn't a thing until the media made it a thing, and
even well before then, when it was still actually a thing, because the
media didn't report on it, it wasn't a thing to the average American.

It's shocking that people don't care when mainstream politicians call
for the abolishment of a Federal administration office. They'd never
think twice to rail against abolishment of the FCC, or the EPA, or the
Department of Education. But ICE? Which actually protects you and
actually protects the actual border from actual criminals and
terrorists? Yeah, who needs that nonsense? They'd abolish all law
enforcement in this country if they could get away with it, because it's
all corrupt, killing unarmed kids and unarmed blacks. Because racism.
Mmm hmm. Is it out there? I'm sure that it is. But does it constitute
the majority of law enforcement interaction? It doesn't even constitute
a simple majority of law enforcement interactions. It's so insignificant
it barely moves the needle.

Shocking? More like *status quo* from this nation's court system.

*By the way, I'm disabling comments on this one. Too much negativity by
too many ignorant people. I'm not willing to deal with it today.*
