**How is gun violence comparable to drunk driving?**

The only way in which they are comparable is that people die, and the
subject tools (guns or cars) are involved.

That's it.

Everything else about them is different.

First of all, "gun violence" is a stupid term. Gun violence is no
different than knife violence or baseball bat violence or shovel
violence or chainsaw violence. It's all violence. The only difference is
the tool. And gunshot wounds don't demonstrably kill faster or more
certainly than knives or chainsaws. Knives cause far more damage to
human flesh than bullets, and can induce death at least as certainly, if
not more certainly, than bullets.

Nevertheless, despite the stupid term, when a person uses a gun to
commit violence, it is a **deliberate act**. The operator of the gun
physically points it at a human and pulls the trigger. This is an
intentional, purposeful act which has the potential to take a life. In
contrast, drunk driving does not involve someone deliberately getting
behind the wheel and aiming the car at a person. It is an
**unintentional act**.

Additionally, drunk drivers kill *orders of magnitude* more people than
are killed with guns.

Gun violence and drunk driving are *totally different.*
