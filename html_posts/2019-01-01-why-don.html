**Why don\'t we see many bumper stickers on car bumpers anymore?**

Stickers ruin plastic.

It used to be that bumpers were made of steel with a chrome coating.

Stickers were easy to apply, and easy to remove. You could easily and
safely use solvents to remove any sticky residue from the place where
the sticker was, without causing *too much* damage to the bumper itself.

Nowadays, most bumpers are made of plastic covering the impact absorbing
material inside. Putting stickers on plastic is not advised. The plastic
is usually painted, and if you've ever removed a sticker from a painted
surface, you've probably removed some of the paint along with it.
Therefore, placing bumper stickers on modern bumpers is not advised.

Most people these days will apply stickers to the glass, and not the
bumper. Stickers have moved away from the "bumper sticker" shape (since
we don't have to fit them on a narrow bumper) and have taken more
freeform shapes:

It's actually easier to remove stickers from glass without damaging the
material underneath. So this new method is better for the car's finish
than even bumper stickers were.
