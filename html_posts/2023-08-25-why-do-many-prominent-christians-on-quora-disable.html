By answering, I don't claim that I am a "prominent Christian on Quora."
I'd probably rate myself as a "marginally known Christian voice." So
there's that.

I don't disable comments, but I will allow a conversation in the
comments to progress to a point where we have reached the end of
productive discussion, we have all aired our philosophical differences,
and we are adding nothing new to the discussion.

At that point, I will point out that we are doing just that, and I will
end the conversation. I will thank the commenter for contributing to the
discussion, and then end the conversation.

*It is at this point* that I will stop accepting more comments. If the
commenter just can't help himself and feels like he or she must have the
last word, I'll delete the last word and block them.

But I won't take the conversation down.

I want their views to stand. They chose to come into my answer and
challenge my interpretation of Scripture. That's perfectly fine.
Healthy, even. I permit that on my answers; I even *encourage* it.

But at a certain point (the point beyond which we don't add any
additional understanding to the discussion, and we just keep re-hashing
the same points), I cut off that conversation because I simply don't
have the time to spend on comments which no longer enhance the
understanding of either the answer or the comment.

I think that's probably the best, most reasonable middle ground. It's
the best I could come up with anyway.
