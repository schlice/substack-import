**Could Trump stay in power by declaring a national emergency?**

Besides the clear bent which resides in the phrase "stay in power" as if
the presidency is some sort of "constitutional dictatorship," which we
will ignore for now since it was not the focus of the question, the 22nd
Amendment says that a president can only serve two terms. There is no
exception to that amendment. A president can serve in office until his
term expires. Period.
