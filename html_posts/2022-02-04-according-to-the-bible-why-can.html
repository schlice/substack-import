The Catholics teach more about this than the Christians do, so let me
give you the Catholic answer.

The Catechism of the Catholic Church (CCC) teaches that angels are
spiritual beings. They are not bound by time and space, as we are. We
are bound by time and space. We have the ability to "re-think" our
decisions, because we have been given *time* to do so.

Angels, being spiritual beings and not being bound by space and time, do
not have this luxury. When an angel rejects God, it is a definitive,
complete rejection of his sovereignty. There's no going back from that
decision, and they wouldn't want to, anyway.

Original question:

According to the Bible, why can\'t Satan and the fallen angels repent
and be forgiven by God like human sinners can?
