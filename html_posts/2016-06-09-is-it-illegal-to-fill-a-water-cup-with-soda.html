Yes, it is technically a crime. Albeit a small one, petty theft is still
theft.

In Colorado, theft of anything under \$500 is considered a class 2
misdemeanor, the lowest level of theft which can be committed, and is
classified as "petty theft." Punishment for a class 2 misdemeanor in
Colorado is a minimum sentence of three months and a \$250 fine, and a
maximum sentence of 12 months and a \$1,000 fine. (ยง 18-1.3-501(1)(a).)

Pretty amazing that you can be sentenced to three months in jail and
have to pay a \$250 fine for not paying \$1 for a drink cup to use in
the soda machine.
