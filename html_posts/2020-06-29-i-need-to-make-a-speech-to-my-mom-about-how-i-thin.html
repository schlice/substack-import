**I need to make a speech to my mom about how I think that God does not
exist. Can you help me by providing evidence to support this claim?**

No, because you cannot prove the non-existence of something.

For example, I can tell you that purple eagles exist, and you can tell
me that they don\'t. For me to prove they do, I just have to find some
evidence that points to the fact that they do or did exist at some time.
For you to prove that they don\'t, or never did, you literally have to
be able to visit all places at all times to show that there were no
purple eagles there. Clearly, it is impossible to prove that something
never existed or does not exist.

Your best bet is to take another angle. Show that he doesn\'t exist by
trying to argue that the description of God doesn\'t match reality. For
example, if God is infinitely merciful, then why does he allow
suffering? If God is all-powerful, why did he have to send his son to
Earth as a man? Why doesn\'t he simply reveal himself to the world now,
instead of having us suffer through all these false religions and
atheists if they are all wrong?

(By the way, there are excellent answers to all of these questions
already; I\'m just giving you the best options you can to try to make
your case)
