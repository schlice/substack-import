So for those not following the news, SCOTUS ruled 8--1 that a person
under a domestic violence-related restraining order can be barred from
possessing firearms. The justices found that the Second Amendment is not
violated when an individual is disarmed after a court has found him to
pose a credible threat to the physical safety of another.

> **Holding**: When an individual has been found by a court to pose a
> credible threat to the physical safety of another, that individual may
> be temporarily disarmed consistent with the Second Amendment.

Remember that this differs from **Red Flag laws**, where courts are not
involved, and a single party can make an accusation and police will
simply remove firearms. This is a case where a competent court has made
a determination that an individual actually poses a credible threat to
someone's physical safety.

What's important about this case (*United States v. Rahimi*) is that the
defendant does not dispute the restraining order. He was disputing what
he believed was an unconstitutional law in light of the SCOTUS ruling in
*NYSRPA v. Breun*. The complaint says that in light of *Breun,* the
statute which bars someone from possessing firearms is, on its face,
unconstitutional, because the reasoning in *Breun* says that in order
for a statute to stand, it must fit "within our Nation's historical
tradition of firearm regulation."

SCOTUS ruled that the DV statute does indeed fit "within our Nation's
historical tradition of firearm regulation." They also argued that 2A
"is not unlimited\[.\]" (District of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U. S. 570,
626). In discussing whether or not that is the case here, the Court
said:

> When firearm regulation is challenged under the Second Amendment, the
> Government must show that the restriction "is consistent with the
> Nation's historical tradition of firearm regulation." *Bruen, 597 U.
> S., at 24*. A court must ascertain whether the new law is "relevantly

> "apply\[ing\] faithfully the balance struck by the founding generation

> \[The DV regulation\] survives Rahimi's challenge.

So back to the question, what does this mean for victims of domestic
violence? If you go through the proper channels and get a restraining
order, and a court finds a "credible threat to \[your\] physical
safety," state regulations can require that person temporarily surrender
his or her firearms. So you won't be shot by your crazy ex. But you can
still be beaten, kidnapped, raped, and all manner of other terrible
things, so you must do more than just get a restraining order.

Remember, a restraining order is nothing more than a piece of paper. And
[[studies have

about 70% of the time. So absolutely, get the restraining order, but
don't stop there. Protect yourself. Reach out to domestic violence
advocacy groups for assistance. Do the things they tell you. Don't kid
yourself that a piece of paper and your aggressor without access to his
own firearms is going to stop him from hurting you.
