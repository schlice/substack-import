**How do you stop feeling suicidal? I grew up in a Christian cult and I
feel spiritless. Please don't suggest your religious beliefs, medicine,
or counseling/therapy. I have tried them for many years. They are not
for me so simply please respect that.**

You don't feel suicidal. It's not a feeling.

You feel *hopeless*. Your hopelessness is what is leading you to
thoughts of suicide. When you believe that there is no further reason to
live, and when living is too painful to continue, then suicide looks
like the only option.

The problem, of course, is that suicide is not the only option. You just
don't see it. And in order to see it, **you have to be willing to talk
to someone about it.**

You say you've tried counseling and therapy for many years but you still
feel hopeless. I can understand that. The key is to attack that
hopelessness, and help you find hope. You must be able to find the joy
in the small things in life. You must be able to look back and find past
successes in your life, and know that the possibility always exists for
future success. There are a myriad of ways to find hope in your life.

But it sounds like you're not willing to put in the effort required to
do it. *Quid pro quo,* as they say. Or in English, *you get out what you
put in*. In other words, when you put in the effort, you'll see the
results. But you must be willing to try.

At least do this much: before you actually take your life, try calling
for help. There is a box on this page with resources in your area of the
world. Please call or text or whatever you choose to do before you
actually harm yourself.
