Bible translators believed they had a calling to translate the Bible
into as many languages as possible in order to spread the Gospel message
to the entire world. So yes, the Bible writers felt like they *did* have
permission to translate the Bible.

But you didn't ask about translating the Bible. You asked about changing
the name "Yeshua" to "Jesus." Why did they do that?

Well, they didn't really. It just happened as a matter of translation.

First off, the name isn't "Yeshua." It's יֵשׁוּעַ. Can you pronounce that?
Unless you can read Hebrew, no you can't. So a translator will listen to
it in Hebrew and then use the letters of the target language to most
closely match the sounds of what they hear. That's called
"transliteration." In Greek (the language in which the vast majority of
the New Testament was written), the transliteration of יֵשׁוּעַ is Ἰησοῦς
(which would be transliterated as "Iesous." There is no "sh" sound in
Greek, so it was simply replaced with an "s" sound instead.

In Latin, the word Ἰησοῦς would be transliterated as IESVS or "Iesvs."
But the Latin tranlators would often write "IESVS" with a J (instead
writing JESVS) because the "j" in Medieval Latin had the same sound as
the Greek letter "iota," or "I." The "j" in Latin had a "y" sound, just
like the "i" in Greek. The English transliteration of "JESVS" or "IESVS"
(which had the same sound) from Latin became "Jesus."

So there you have it. Well-intentioned translation and transliteration
turned "יֵשׁוּעַ" into "Jesus."

And ultimately, it doesn't matter. What's more important than
transliterating His name correctly is what He did for you.
