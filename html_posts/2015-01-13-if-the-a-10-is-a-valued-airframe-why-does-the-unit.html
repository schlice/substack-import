**Content:** [The A-10 is an awesome aircraft.\
\
However, there are other aircraft in the inventory that can perform the
CAS (Close Air Support) equally as well, but are also suited for other
roles. The F-15 and F-16 can provide CAS, as well as the F-35.\
\
And the Air Force was directed to cut \$10B per year in previously
planned spending over the course of the next five years, thanks to
sequestration. There were losses to the service across the board, but
the loss of the A-10 would be the largest single hit to any one
airframe.]{.rendered_qtext}
