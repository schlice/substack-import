**Content:** [In the military, you are accountable for everything you
are issued.\
\
At the start of your shift as a Security Forces officer, you are issued
from the armorer an empty weapon and a full magazine. Which weapon you
get depends on your post for that shift. If you are receiving a pistol,
you insert the muzzle into the clearing barrel, load the magazine, close
the slide, turn the safety off, drop the weapon in your holster, and
there it rides until the end of your shift. They used to tell us that
your weapon comes out of your holster for one of two reasons: it\'s the
end of your shift, or you\'re going to shoot someone. The \"ready
position\" is thumb break open, hand on backstrap. Air Force security
forces did not \"draw down\" on people. We would gesture with our
non-firing hand, and our firing hand was on the backstrap. I could draw
and fire pretty quickly, so I wasn\'t really worried. If you are
receiving a rifle, you make sure the safety is on and the weapon is
clear, insert the muzzle into the clearing barrel, and close the slide.
You show the CBO (clearing barrel official) that the safety is on and
that the trigger won\'t move, and you can then walk away, inserting a
magazine into the receiver on the weapon. We don\'t chamber rounds on
the M16 for normal duty because it has a free-floating firing pin, and
we\'ve been told that 1 in every 100,000 times you chamber a round, it
will go off. Also, the free-floating firing pin dimples the round when
you close the bolt on one. And the person performing guard duty with a
rifle has enough time to rack a round in place before he needs to fire,
not so with a pistol.\
\
At the end of the shift, if you were carrying a pistol, you return to
the armorer\'s window, apply the safety, remove the magazine and put it
down, insert the muzzle into the clearing barrel, and open the slide
with a hand over the ejection port to catch the round in the chamber.
Once you have verified with the CBO that the weapon is safe and clear,
you can hand the weapon backstrap-first to the armorer, who also
verifies it is safe and clear. You then return the last round to the top
of the magazine and return your two full magazines to the armorer. He
then returns your weapons card to you once you have returned everything
you checked out. For a rifle, you insert the muzzle into the clearing
barrel and remove the magazine, You then rack back the slide, which will
lock open. The CBO verifies the weapon is safe and clear, and you hand
the rifle, butt first, to the armorer, and then hand him your three full
magazines. Occasionally, at the end of our shift, some random people
will need to block their ammo (which I discussed earlier) which sucks
because we really want to do nothing other than leave at that
point.]{.rendered_qtext}
