**Content:** [Thymectomies are not done for MS because the disease
action between the two diseases is different.\
\
Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune disorder in which weakness is
caused by antibodies that block acetylcholine receptors at the
post-synaptic neuromuscular junction, causing muscle weakness. Up to 75%
of MG patients have some form of thymus abnormality; of these, roughly
10% present with thymomas. In cases which are exacerbated by thymus
abnormality, the disease process will generally remit once a thymectomy
is performed. Thus, in some cases, thymectomy is the appropriate
treatment.\
\
Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is also an autoimmune disorder, but the disease
process involves T-lymphocytes attacking and destroying the myelin
sheath surrounding nerve cells within the CNS. The resultant plaques
(scleroses) are areas through which there is decreased signal
transmission speed, resulting in weaker muscle responses than the brain
intended. The thymus has not been shown to be a part of the disease
process; however, research is ongoing and the thymus has not been
completely ruled out. That said, because in most cases the thymus is not
involved in the disease process, thymectomy is not a recommended
treatment course.]{.rendered_qtext}
