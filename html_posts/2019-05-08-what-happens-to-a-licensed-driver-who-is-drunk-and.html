**What happens to a licensed driver who is drunk and is the passenger of
a person with a Learner\'s permit (not drunk) who gets in a car
accident?**

In most states, nothing.

The law in most states does not specify that the licensed adult in the
car be capable of driving the car legally at the time. It simply states
that a licensed adult must be supervising.

To that end, it should be treated like a normal auto accident.
