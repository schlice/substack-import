The source of the information in legislation does not invalidate the
bill. The information from the book may have been used as \"reference
material\" and should be cited appropriately, but there are really no
copyright issues here since the US Government does not publish works for
sale, it writes laws.

I would hope that a simple letter to the Office of the Law Revision
Counsel would correct any oversight in failing to properly attribute the
quote, especially during positive law codification if the bill ever
becomes law and is added to US Code.
