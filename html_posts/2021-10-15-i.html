Wow, there's a lot to unpack here. But let's start with the basics:

*Have you discussed your feelings with your wife?*

The hallmark of a healthy marriage is open communication. I can tell
things to my wife that I wouldn't dare tell anyone else. Not my pastor,
not my parents (if I spoke to them anyway), not my military service
buddies, no one.

Don't be afraid to talk to her. If she truly loves you, then she loves
you for your beautiful soul, not your femur bone.

Think about it. If you got fat, would she still love you? If you lost
all your hair, would she still love you? My guess is that the answer is
most likely yes.

Let's be honest with ourselves: you may never physically be the same man
you were before your accident. But does she love your legs, or does she
love *you*? I think you might be surprised to hear the answer.

Your feelings are natural. Men are supposed to be the head of the
household, the strong leaders who guide their families with a
rock-steady foundation. And your broken leg is making you feel like you
may not ever be able to be that man ever again.

But that's a lie. Your feelings are whispering lies to you, and you're
listening. Don't listen to the lies. You can still be a great husband
and a great father if you gained weight, lost your hair, or if you
aren't physically the same man because of your leg.

I know. I developed Multiple Sclerosis. I thought I'd never be the same
man I was. I thought I could never be a good husband or a good father
with MS. I had those same feelings of inadequacy. But I discussed them
with my wife, and together we worked through them.

I implore you: talk to your wife. Let her know how you are feeling. If
you need to, seek counseling to talk through your feelings.

Suicide is never the answer to any question we may ask ourselves. Your
life is worth more. You are worth more than that. Don't let your fears
lead you down a path that will only hurt your family.

You are loved!

Original question:

I\'ve been nursing suicidal thoughts for quite some now\...I have a wife
and a four year old daughter but ever since I had an accident and
fractured my femur bone\...I feel inadequate and feel like I will never
be the same person my wife and daughter love so much\...is suicide
selfish? Am I being selfish for thinking about taking my life?
