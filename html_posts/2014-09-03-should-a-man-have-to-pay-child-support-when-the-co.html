**Content:** [I have to say I agree with you. If he is too young to give
consent, he is too young to understand and be responsible for the
consequences.\
\
However, let\'s look at this a different way. What if the boy lied? What
if he told the girl he was 18 but he was really 16 (assuming she was at
least 18)? She could still be charged with statutory rape. Should he be
forced to pay child support?\
\
The difference here is whether or not he lied about his age? On the one
hand, he shouldn\'t be responsible, and on the other, he should? That\'s
pretty thin legal ground to base whether or not we should compel the
father to pay child support. He could claim he \"popped off\" (no pun
intended) in the heat of the moment. Would that absolve him of his
liability?\
\
The answer here is that the age at the time of the act is irrelevant;
the father is still the father. I would think that if he were truly the
victim and the mother was charged with, and convicted of, sexual assault
on a minor (i.e. she had sex with him against his will, used drugs to
force an erection, etc), he could be found to be not responsible for the
child. However, in most of these cases, the sex was consentual and while
it may have been illegal for them to do it, that doesn\'t absolve either
of them of the responsibility to take care of that child. Once he turns
18, he can be compelled to provide child support.]{.rendered_qtext}
