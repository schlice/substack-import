<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [I have to say I agree with you. If he is too young to give<br>consent, he is too young to understand and be responsible for the<br>consequences.\<br>\<br>However, let\'s look at this a different way. What if the boy lied? What<br>if he told the girl he was 18 but he was really 16 (assuming she was at<br>least 18)? She could still be charged with statutory rape. Should he be<br>forced to pay child support?\<br>\<br>The difference here is whether or not he lied about his age? On the one<br>hand, he shouldn\'t be responsible, and on the other, he should? That\'s<br>pretty thin legal ground to base whether or not we should compel the<br>father to pay child support. He could claim he \"popped off\" (no pun<br>intended) in the heat of the moment. Would that absolve him of his<br>liability?\<br>\<br>The answer here is that the age at the time of the act is irrelevant;<br>the father is still the father. I would think that if he were truly the<br>victim and the mother was charged with, and convicted of, sexual assault<br>on a minor (i.e. she had sex with him against his will, used drugs to<br>force an erection, etc), he could be found to be not responsible for the<br>child. However, in most of these cases, the sex was consentual and while<br>it may have been illegal for them to do it, that doesn\'t absolve either<br>of them of the responsibility to take care of that child. Once he turns<br>18, he can be compelled to provide child support.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
