**Content:** [I think I\'ll be foregoing the S6 unless I get the S6
Edge, but while it\'s beautiful, I think the lack of a removable battery
is a big hit for me. I bought two batteries and a charger on Amazon for
\$20, it\'s so easy to grab a spare battery and have it in your pocket,
change it out, and be back to working in no time, instead of having a
big power bank hanging off of your device for a few hours so your
battery can recharge.\
\
I guess it just opens the door for battery case makers again, and
assuming the battery case connects via USB, you can also have additional
storage in your battery case, since it does connect via USB to the
phone. So maybe the battery case manufacturer can add additional storage
using USB.]{.rendered_qtext}
