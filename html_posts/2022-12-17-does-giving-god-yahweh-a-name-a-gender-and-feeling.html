The short answer to your question is yes.

The longer answer begins with the question of gender. We didn't give God
a name or a gender. **He did that Himself.**

Moses asked God what His name was, so that when he was addressing the
pharaoh, he would know how to refer to God. And God replied,

> "I am who I am. This is what you are to say to the Israelites: 'I am
> has sent me to you.'"
>
> God also said to Moses, "Say to the Israelites, 'The Lord, the God of
> your fathers---the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac and the God of
> Jacob---has sent me to you.'
>
> "This is my name forever,\
> the name you shall call me\
> from generation to generation." --- Exodus 3:14--15 NIV

"I am who I am" translates through several languages into English as
YHWH. Tough to pronounce, but if you add a few logical vowels (as
referenced by those letters elsewhere in the Bible), you come up with
the closest approximation to a pronunciation: "Yahweh."

\

God doesn't have a physical gender. John 4:24 says, "God is spirit, and
his worshipers must worship in the Spirit and in truth." Nevertheless,
God refers to Himself throughout the Bible using masculine adjectives.
Assigning human characteristics to God is what is known as
***anthropomorphism***, which is simply a way for God to communicate
truths about His nature to people who have limited human understanding.

There are approximately 170 references to God as "father" in the Bible.
One cannot be a father unless one is male (sorry SJWs, but facts are
facts). If God chose to reveal Himself to the world as female, He would
have used "mother" throughout the Bible, but He did not. Christ even
refers to God as father several times throughout His life.

God has feelings, and He revealed those to us as well. Throughout the
Bible, God has displayed:

Nevertheless, you are right that there is a danger in "humanizing" God.
Like Michelangelo did on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, God is
sometimes depicted as a man (sometimes as an old man with long white
robes). While we often use a male human to depict God (as He called
Himself "father,") this could be fraught as it tends to limit God to
human form. God is not human; God is spirit. God is not limited to a
human form, and there is danger in believing that God has human form, as
God would necessarily be limited to the same limitations that humans
have. That said, none of that changes how God chose to reveal Himself to
us.
