In the United States, that would be 100%. You don't keep a salaried
employee employed, consider him innocent, and not pay him for his
eligible time.

But you only tend to see it in the news when it is a police officer
under investigation, so I can understand this concept of "paid
administrative leave" seems like nothing more than a "gift" from a
department "willing to look the other way," but it's nothing of the
sort.

I also don't understand how people think that it's right to not pay
someone who is innocent until proven guilty, is still an employee, but
is simply asked to not perform his primary job function while an
investigation is ongoing. If we don't pay someone, it's either because
they are terminated, or because they have already been found to be
guilty. In this case, neither of those has happened, so we continue to
pay our employees.

If you're innocent (as in "innocent until proven guilty in a court of
law"), the department has no grounds on which to terminate you. But it
would be improper to continue having you work as a police officer while
you are the subject of an investigation. Therefore, you are placed on
leave. This simply means that you don't report to your normal job
location. You may be required to report to the office and be physically
present, or you may be required to remain at home. You may be required
to function as an "office admin," maybe manning the switchboard or the
front desk, as sometimes instead of saying that an officer was placed on
"paid administrative leave," they say he was temporarily reassigned to
"administrative duties." But "paid administrative leave" does not mean
"here's a present for doing wrong" since "doing wrong" has yet to be
determined.

If you are still employed, *you still get paid*. The officer cannot seek
employment somewhere else, since he is still employed by his agency.
These investigations could go on for months, and it's in no way fair to
the officer to keep him employed, consider him innocent, and not pay him
for his time. That would be illogical, and in some cases unlawful in and
of itself.

**TL;DR: Suspending an officer without pay implies misconduct, which has
yet to be determined.**
