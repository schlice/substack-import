OK, looks like I get the minority opinion today.

Let's begin with the fact that I am immunocompromised, and I got
vaccinated. And I still think that vaccine mandates are a terrible idea.

Look, I can see where vaccine mandates might be a good idea. I can
envision a world where mandates might make sense.

**We are nowhere near those circumstances today.**

Vaccine mandates (and their concomitant passports) are highly coercive,
an attempt to restrict the freedom of law-abiding citizens when they
don't follow the state's preferences about how they handle their own
bodies. They take things that were previously basic rights, like going
into public places and flying on airplanes, and turn them into
state-granted privileges when you "toe the line." They divide people
into those who are "good" (by toeing the state line) and those who are
"bad."

However, I'm old enough to remember "my body, my choice" and the
Constitutional decisions from which that phrase grew. Bodily autonomy,
as you probably already know, is a crucial right, and is one that should
only be restricted in the gravest of circumstances.

And if you review the numbers, the circumstances are not nearly grave
enough to override anyone's bodily autonomy.

If the unvaccinated placed large numbers of the vaccinated at risk,
those might be the grave circumstances we're speaking of. However, the
vaccinated are not at risk from the unvaccinated. Vaccines work,
according to the CDC. As their effectiveness wanes, perhaps the
vaccinated may be susceptible to mild disease, but the vaccine
continuously protects against severe COVID, even over time. So
literally, the only people at risk from the unvaccinated are the
unvaccinated.

Certainly, there is an argument to be made about people who cannot be
vaccinated and those under 12. And this is where we have to go back to
weighing the total risk against the damage caused by the deprivation of
rights induced by a mandate.

The risk to children is *ridiculously low*. In the US, there are about
74 million people under age 18. Over the last sixteen months, we have
had a grand total of 362 deaths from COVID in that age range. Similarly,
the numbers of people who can't take the vaccine, or for whom it doesn't
work, is exceedingly small.

Comparatively, the damage done by a deprivation of rights are great.
Forcing people to take the vaccine doesn't really make sense. First of
all, you're only influencing the small amount of people who haven't
taken the vaccine purely out of personal choice. It has no effect on the
people who are already vaccinated or are planning on being vaccinated.
People with religious exemptions are still not going to get vaccinated.
And those who distrust the government already will see this as yet
another reason to continue to distrust the government. So you're really
only targeting a very small portion of society. And do you really have a
greater portion of the population who would get a vaccine instead of
forgoing flying? I know that if people really don't want to be
vaccinated, they'll cancel their plans or postpone their trips. And then
what do we do about emergencies? If my parent is dying, are you really
going to prevent me from flying to their deathbed because I haven't
completed my shots yet?

In other words, the political backlash from such mandates will be
*long-lasting*. The socioeconomic toll will be huge.

It also doesn't square with science. If someone had COVID and recovered,
vaccines for them only carry a minimal benefit, if any at all. And
getting the virus and recovering confers better, longer-lasting
protection from future infection than the vaccine, according to [[an
excellent Israeli
study](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=43e927&url=https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.24.21262415v1){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="medrxiv.org"}]{.qlink_container}. I'd feel safer in a room
full of people who had COVID and recovered than being in a room full of
vaccinated people who never had COVID at all. Additionally, new air
handling procedures inside airplanes change the air in the plane more
frequently than ever, so it's actually safer to be inside of an airplane
than in any other small space.

If you want to be protected against the virus, get vaccinated. You'll be
safe from the vaccinated or the unvaccinated. I continue to hold the
position that vaccines work and they are the right ***choice*** for most
people. It certainly was for me.

But ultimately, they are a ***choice***. Mandating vaccines, even to
travel on airplanes, is not only bad public health policy, it doesn't
really help us much. When you do a risk/reward comparison, I don't
really see that the damage done by deprivation of rights outweighs the
small benefit in coercing people to get vaccinated.

*Sorry, no comments on this one. It's simply too contentious a topic,
and there are too many vaccine-crazy people who would flood my comments
with crap. I just don't have the time or the inclination to argue with
you.*

*If you don\'t like what I wrote, tough shit. If my answer is
grammatically low-quality or is un-cited opinion masquerading as fact,
downvote it. If you think I\'m wrong, write your own answer. But Quora
is a question-and-answer site, not a debate site. If you were simply
going to comment to tell me \"ackshually, you\'re wrong,\" then you're
the reason why I disable comments. Well done, Karen. You ruined it for
everyone.*
