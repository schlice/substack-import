**Content:** [If the murders all happen within the jurisdiction of a
single agency (i.e. NYPD), and the agency is large enough to be
subdivided into precincts, the murder would be handled by the
specialized unit which handles murders: homicide. The specialized
departments are not subdivisions of the agency by geography; they cover
the entire agency.\
\
What becomes interesting is when a murder investigation crosses agency
borders, and even states. My dad was a detective in a precinct in Nassau
County, a suburb of New York on Long Island. He was a \"squad
detective\" which means he was a detective for the precinct, handling
local cases within the precinct which required detectives, but were not
part of a specialized detective unit (i.e. homicide, vice, SVU, etc).
While sitting on the \"squeal desk\" which is little more than a
rotating assignment to determine who gets assigned new incoming cases,
he caught a murder. Because the murder was his case, he was TA\'d
(temporarily assigned) to Homicide to work the murder. It was a very
long murder case which took months to investigate. The suspect traveled
up and down the East coast, committing murders along the way. New York
remained primary on the case, and when the suspect was eventually
arrested in Florida, dad flew down there to pick him up and extradite
him back to New York to stand trial.\
\
New York remained primary, as I recall, because the suspect had killed
more people in New York than anywhere else that he had visited. But he
worked with the detectives in every jurisdiction in which crimes were
committed. They all had claims on the suspect, as the suspect had
committed murders in all of those locations. But usually the
negotiations to determine who will be the primary prosecution for the
case occurs between the District Attorneys of the counties in which the
crimes took place. The DAs look at their evidence and decide amongst
themselves based on many factors (who has the strongest case, who is
willing to extradite, where is public outcry the greatest, who has the
laws to get the outcome the people want, etc).]{.rendered_qtext}
