**Do the people at NORAD really have the time to track a non-existent
Santa?**

Well, yes and no.

Really, we just set the Santa Monitoring System (SMS) to automatic. It
keeps a lock on the sleigh and posts the update to the NORAD Tracks
Santa website, which feeds all of our other systems. It's pretty simple
and doesn't task the systems much.

But should we? It's outside of our core mission of Missile Warning.

We do anyway, out of the goodness of our hearts.
