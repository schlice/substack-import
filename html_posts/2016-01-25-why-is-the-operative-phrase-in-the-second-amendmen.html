The operative phrase is the one that recognizes the right. The prefatory
phrase describes why the right needs to be recognized in the first
place. We can identify the operative phrase when we see the wording
which determines to whom the right belongs: \"the right of the people.\"

The court in *DC v Heller* explained all of this. Reading the *Heller
Law Brief* will give you very good insight into what the court was
thinking.

The court stated that the first part of the Second Amendment is called
the **prefatory clause**. This is the clause which explains the purpose
of the Amendment, the \"why\" this amendment is necessary. The prefatory
clause is \"A well-regulated militia, being necessary to the security of
a free state\". This explains why we have a Second Amendment, but does
not limit or expand the scope of the second part.

The second part of the Second Amendment is called the **operative
clause:** \"the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be
infringed.\"

The *Brief* states it most succinctly: *\"Reading the Second Amendment
as protecting only the right to \'keep and bear Arms\' in an organized
militia therefore fits poorly with the operative clause's description of
the holder of that right as \'the people\'\"*. The phrase \"the right of
the people\" was used three times in the Bill of Rights, and each time
it was used to connote an **individual** right, not a right gained by
membership in a group. The rights are guaranteed to each individual.

That said, the framers saw \"all of the people\" as \"the militia.\"
They didn\'t see \"the militia\" and \"the citizens\" as two distinct
groups. They saw \"the militia\" as every able-bodied citizen who could
point a gun. Therefore, since any person could be called to defend their
country at any time, the right to keep and bear arms should be included
along with that.

So today, since not every person is a member of the militia (in
practice, if not in law), does that mean that the Second Amendment has
no relevance? Not at all. The Second Amendment listed only one prefatory
clause, but there were many that the framers were aware of at the time.
One of them was the \"natural right\" of self-defense, as defined by
Blackstone from England. The framers relied heavily on Blackstone\'s
definitions of \"natural rights\" when writing the Constitution. They
understood that we had a right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of
happiness, not because the government granted those rights, but because
we were \"endowed by our Creator\" with those rights. The militia
prefatory clause was listed because it was the most forefront on the
minds of the colonists. In other words, they were saying \"Since it is
understood that we won this time, but you can be called at any time to
defend this new country, no one will ever abridge your rights to keep
and bear arms.\" There were plenty of other things that were also
understood, but none of those things needed to be listed. The necessity
of a militia was one of many things that precipitated the recognition of
that right.

Additionally, one of the other big contentions during the development of
the Constitution was the creation and authorization of a standing army.
People were (rightly) fearful of a standing army, because of the way
they were abused by the King in England. People really only wanted
armies stood up during wartime. The opposite view held that attempting
to stand up an army at the brink of war was not only foolish, but it
forced you to begin your war with untrained people who lacked the proper
technique and training to properly wage a war. The compromise was to
allow a standing army, but to give the people the right to keep and bear
arms to counter that standing army should the need arise. Additionally,
they passed the *Posse Comitatus Act*, one of the very first laws passed
by the first Congress. That act basically says that the military cannot
enforce civilian law. The military has no jurisdiction over civilians.
Together (the Second Amendment and the Posse Comitatus Act), these two
provisions were enacted to protect the citizens from the army. Today,
the weaponry of the army has far outstripped the weaponry available to
average citizens, but the military lives by the law, and you\'d be hard
pressed to find a Commander-in-Chief who would order the military to
attack civilians because of it. While we don\'t need to repel our own
army, there are plenty of other natural rights for which keeping arms
are nearly a requirement.

The Bill of Rights, therefore, is designed to enumerate the rights that
you already have as a human that the government may not take away. Your
right to self-defense and, by extension, your right to keep and bear
arms, is a natural right which the government did not give you, so the
government cannot take it away.
