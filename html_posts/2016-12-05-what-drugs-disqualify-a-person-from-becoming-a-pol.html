The short answer: recent ones. If anything comes up on your drug panel
when you get your inprocessing physical, you're gone.

The longer answer: every department has its own limitations. Also, every
department understands that people are human, and that college-age kids
experiment. Heck, President Clinton smoked pot (but he didn't
inhale...yeah right).

If you tried basic rec drugs as a kid, but you did what the vast
majority of normal people do and never touch the stuff again, you should
be fine.

If you were using anything illegal last week, you're pretty much not
going to get in.
