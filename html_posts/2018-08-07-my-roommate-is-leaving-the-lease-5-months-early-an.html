**My roommate is leaving the lease 5 months early and already submitted
her 30 day notice. Our landlord says she's not legally obligated to pay
for rent after her 30 days. Is this legal?**

Most leases in the United States have a clause called "joint and
several" when it comes to multiple renters. This means that the whole
group, or each person on the lease, is fully responsible for the entire
lease, and if one person does not pay, then the other person is
responsible for the remainder of the bill, or they can all be evicted
together or separately.

If the landlord is allowing your roommate to leave the lease early, and
you are not able to pay the whole amount of the lease on your own, you
have two options:

1.  Get a new roommate really quickly
2.  Talk to the landlord yourself and leave the lease.

But under most circumstances, yes this is legal, and you'll be
responsible for the full lease payment for the remainder of your term.
