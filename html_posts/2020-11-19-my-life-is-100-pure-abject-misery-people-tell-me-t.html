**My life is 100%, pure, abject misery. People tell me that God has a
blessed plan for my life. Am I justified in punching them in the face?**

I know, right? Who the heck are they to say that some God somewhere has
a great plan for me, when my life is nothing but sadness and misery? Is
this the "great plan" he has for me? To live in misery? What a joke!

I will tell you that punching them in the face, while offering some
temporary relief for your frustration, won't make you any less
miserable, and may actually lead to *more* misery (i.e. you might get
the shit beat out of you and/or you might land yourself in jail).

But let me ask you a question: *just because God has a plan for you,
where did you get the idea that this plan involved you being happy? Do
you know what his plan for you is?*

Because I certainly don't. None of us do.

So let's ask another question: *Where did anyone, ever, get the idea
that God having a plan for us, or even us being Christian, included us
being happy?*

In other words, God has a plan for your life. This much is true.

You're also depressed. It certainly sounds like this is true as well,
although I certainly am not qualified to make that diagnosis.

Those two are pretty much unrelated.

If you're depressed, get help. This is something we in the United States
are really, really bad at. There is a stigma around getting yourself
mental health counseling, but there shouldn't be. Get yourself some good
quality psychiatric help. The medications have come a long way from
Celexa and Prozac.

On a totally different thread, God has a plan for your life. You may
never know what it is. Heck, you might go your entire life and die
without ever knowing his plan for you. The Bible tells us that even some
of the giants of the faith lived their entire lives without ever knowing
God's plan for them. Look at Joseph. He was hated by his brothers, sold
into slavery, imprisoned, falsely accused of attempted rape, and
threatened with execution. There was no indication that God had
explained to Joseph all of the reasons why he had to go through all of
that, or what would eventually be done with his life. **He was expected,
as you and I are, to live out his life one day at a time in something
less than complete understanding. What pleased God was** ***Joseph\'s
faithfulness when nothing made sense*.** In other words, it's one thing
to believe in him and be faithful when everything is going your way. But
when everything is coming your way because you're going the wrong way on
a one-way street, it's much harder to be faithful. It pleases God when
we are faithful *despite* our lack of understanding.

We know that life won\'t be smooth sailing. Where did we ever get the
idea that it was? Jesus told His followers to anticipate suffering. \"I
have told you these things, so that in me you may have peace. *In this
world, you will have trouble. But take heart! I have overcome the
world*.\" (John 16:33). Paul wrote, \"In all our troubles my joy knows
no bounds. For when we came into Macedonia, this body of ours had no
rest, but we were harassed at every turn\--conflicts on the outside,
fears within\" (2 Cor 7:4-5). Peter said, \"Dear friends, do not be
surprised at the painful trial you are suffering, as though something
strange were happening to you. But rejoice that you participate in the
suffering of Christ, so that you may be overjoyed when His glory is
revealed\" (1 Peter 4:12-13).

Get yourself some help first. When you can start to feel better, then
start to look in to God's plan for your life.
