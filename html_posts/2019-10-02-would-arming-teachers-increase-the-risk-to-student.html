**Would arming teachers increase the risk to students? Why or why not?**

I'm going to buck the apparent trend and say no.

First of all, ***NO ONE IS SAYING THAT WE WOULD BE FORCING TEACHERS TO
BE ARMED.*** There are currently 22 states in which teachers ***may***
be armed if they are qualified and permitted in their county of
residence. Never once has anyone even *entertained the idea* that we
should ***reuquire*** teachers to be armed. Never once.

To that end, any teacher who ***chose*** to arm themselves would be
required to pass all state and county requirements for obtaining a
concealed weapons permit. This includes all required safety courses and
background checks.

Thankfully, we already have teachers who do have their concealed carry
permits in their counties. They are currently prohibited from carrying
their lawfully permitted handguns in school because schools are a
gun-free zone.

Any other teacher who then ***chose*** to take the time (and use their
own personal funds) to obtain a concealed carry permit would be allowed
to conceal a firearm while at school.

Second, the law is ***extremely*** clear when it comes to a concealed
firearm. ***NO ONE WILL EVER SEE THE CONCEALED FIREARM UNLESS YOU ARE
DRAWING IT IN ORDER TO FIRE.*** That's the point of a "concealed"
firearm: *no one knows you have it*. I've seen some answers saying that
this would increase risk to students because a teacher may be
"improperly handling" the weapon. ***WRONG***. Handling a concealed
firearm is a violation of law and would cause the holder to lose his CCW
permit. Some are also saying that a student could find a firearm in a
classroom. ***WRONG****.* Firearms remain concealed on the carrier at
all times. The law is very clear: in order to remain a "concealed
weapon," it must never come out of concealment unless you intend to use
it. Some states clarify that "accidental exposure" of the firearm does
not constitute "brandishing," but this doesn't relieve the holder of the
responsibility to keep their firearm concealed.

So is there a risk that a teacher who is also a concealed carrier might
inadvertently discharge a firearm? Yes, of course there is, there is
always a statistical non-zero chance that a holster may fail or that a
teacher may improperly holster their weapon in the morning. But there is
nothing special about a school which makes this any more or less
possible than when that same teacher goes back to their home and arms
themselves before going out anywhere else in public. That same teacher
runs exactly the same risk of inadvertently discharging a firearm (which
is so ludicrous a thought that I'm surprised I'm actually typing it)
***inside*** the school as they do ***outside*** the school.

So sure, overall, the risk of a firearms discharge in a school increases
slightly when we allow more firearms to be present inside the school.

But when we weigh the slight increase in risk to students by having more
lawfully permitted concealed carriers in the school against the massive
benefit of potentially stopping a mass shooter in their tracks, the
benefit clearly outweighs the risk.

mass shooters (who may be crazy but are far from stupid) will most
definitely think twice before walking into a school to shoot it up.
Until we can do better at preventing firearms from entering a school
building, increasing security inside the building is the best way to
stop mass shootings in schools.
