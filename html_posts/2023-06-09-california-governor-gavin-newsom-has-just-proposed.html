The beauty of Constitutional amendments is that you need **broad
consensus** across the country in order to get them entered into the
Constitution.

First, you need to get a **supermajority of Congress** to pass a Bill of
Amendment. That means you would need broad consensus in Congress to pass
the Bill, as it must pass with 67% of each House approving. You could
talk about an Article V Convention, but that has never been done before
in the history of the nation. You would need 34 states (2/3 of the
states) to agree to convene one before it would even happen.

Second, you have to have 3/4 of the states (38 states) agree to
***ratify*** that amendment in order for it to become part of the
Constitution. This means that 38 states must ratify the amendment. Or
said another way, only 13 states need to reject ratification in order
for that Constitutional amendment to fail.

So once again, this is nothing more than a grandstanding display. His
28th Amendment proposal isn't going anywhere but onto the pages of
clickbait media.
