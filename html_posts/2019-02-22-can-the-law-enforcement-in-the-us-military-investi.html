**Can the law enforcement in the US military investigate off base, even
if it\'s miles away, especially if it has to do with an abuse of
military equipment?**

Yes, military investigators will work closely with state and local law
enforcement if they have to investigate a case outside of a military
base. However, they don't need to get permission from anyone to pursue a
case.

Similarly, military police can follow a suspect off base if that suspect
is fleeing, and their authority to effect that arrest will follow the
suspect. It is called the "hot pursuit" rule.
