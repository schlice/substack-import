**If you get \"swatted\", the 911 call that generated the SWAT response
was unlawful. Does that mean you have the right to resist an unlawful
arrest?**

We have said it many times on Quora. Only a judge can determine if an
arrest is unlawful. Judges are involved *way, way after* the actual
arrest takes place.

An arrest is *presumed to be lawful* if the police officer is acting
under color of law, and he has probable cause to effect an arrest. That
makes the arrest, *de facto*, lawful, until a judge says that it is
otherwise.

And even if the SWATting occurred, the arrest would still be lawful
because the police only have to meet the probable cause standard at the
time that the arrest was made. Using that standard, the arrest itself
was still lawful, but the state would not press charges since you were
the victim of an unlawful 911 call.

Therefore, since only a judge can determine if an arrest is unlawful,
you have no right, under law, to resist the actions of the police. Do
what they tell you, and "tell it to the judge."
