We're not talking about breathing in toxic gases. Breathing in inert gas
"tricks" the body into thinking that it is still breathing air, but the
oxygen content of the air decreases. When humans feel *suffocation*,
it's due to a rise in **carbon dioxide**. But simply breathing in inert
gas (which is usually odorless and tasteless) instead of oxygen will
cause *asphyxiation* (death from lack of oxygen) without feeling the
traumatic effects of suffocation.

The victim will simply get sleepy and will lose consciousness,
eventually asphyxiating. Loss of consciousness in an oxygen-deprived
environment typically occurs within one minute.

Several states in the United States have authorized nitrogen
asphyxiation as an alternate method for capital punishment, although no
state has actually used it yet.
