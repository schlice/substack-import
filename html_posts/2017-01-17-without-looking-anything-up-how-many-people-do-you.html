It's okay, no need to look anything up.

**The average American cop will kill zero people in their career.**

Compared to the ***millions*** of interactions between the police and
the public, the number of people killed by police, which is somewhere
around 500, still means that the average police officer will not shoot
anyone during the course of their career.
