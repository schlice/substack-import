**How would you react if a cop took you to jail but you were falsely
accused?**

I would not:

- scream and cry like a baby.
- try to punch the cop or otherwise resist arrest.
- answer any questions whatsoever without a lawyer present, except for
  demographic questions like my name, address, and date of birth.

I would:

- quietly do whatever I was told except for answering questions.
- mount a vigorous legal defense at trial.
- waste a monumental amount of time and money doing so.
- look for any and every way possible to recoup my costs in my legal
  defense, such as filing lawsuits for defamation, pain and suffering,
  false arrest, etc, whatever causes could legally be supportable.
