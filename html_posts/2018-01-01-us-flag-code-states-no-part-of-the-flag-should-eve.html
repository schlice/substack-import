The short answer is no, a flag decal is not subject to this portion of
the flag code. Similarly, people wear flag patches and flag pins and
flags embroidered on their jerseys for baseball and soccer and all sorts
of sports, and none of this is in violation of the flag code.

If the flag code was actually enforceable (see other answers about why
it is not), *this* would actually be a violation of that portion of the
flag code:

:::: ui_qtext_image_outer
::: qtext_image_wrapper
![](images/qimg-ab81cda3c13f4f14e7467df1dfa126d9){.landscape
.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed
master_src="images/qimg-ab81cda3c13f4f14e7467df1dfa126d9" master_w="300"
master_h="300"}

BTW, I have nothing against Kid Rock. But this particular American Flag
Poncho would be a violation of the flag code. Notice how **the flag
itself** is being used as a piece of clothing. This is what the flag
code is referring to.
