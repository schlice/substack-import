These answers are all correct, to a degree.

The bottom line is that you will be handcuffed whether or not you agree.
In general, it works this way:

1.  I ask you to do something
2.  I tell you to do something
3.  I make you do something.

The "do something" can be anything from putting your hands behind your
back to moving to a particular location or anything else which I may
need you to do. If I am placing you under arrest, you will be
handcuffed.

So I will first *ask* you to place your hands behind your back. If you
refuse, I will then *tell* you to place your hands behind your back. If
you still refuse, I will *make* you put your hands behind your back,
which will usually involve some form of control technique such as a
wrist lock (which incidentally also involves some pain), at which point
I will apply handcuffs anyway. So not only did your polite refusal get
you nowhere in terms of not getting handcuffed, now you're handcuffed
and in pain.

The only time I would not handcuff you behind your back is if you are
physically incapable of putting your hands behind your back (perhaps
because of an injury or a defect related to your arm), and I would belt
you and cuff you wherever I was able. Bottom line: if you're riding in
the back of the car, you're handcuffed.

The short answer: don't refuse the order of a police officer who is
performing his duty. You won't get far.
