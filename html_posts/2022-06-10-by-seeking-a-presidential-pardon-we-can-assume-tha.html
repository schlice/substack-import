Actually, maybe.

In the landmark case *Burdick v. United States, a* grand jury was
investigating whether any Treasury Department employees were leaking
information to the press. George Burdick, city editor of the New York
Tribune, plead the Fifth and refused to reveal the source of his
information. He was handed a pardon by US President Woodrow Wilson in a
bid to force him to testify (because the Fifth Amendment does not apply
if the person is immune from prosecution). Burdick refused to accept the
pardon, and refused to testify. He was fined \$500 and thrown in jail
until he testified.

The Supreme Court ruled that a pardon can be rejected. But of note to
this question, the opinion in that case stated that a pardon carries "an
imputation of guilt and acceptance of a confession of it." In other
words, the Supreme Court, in the text of their opinion on *Burdick,*
stated that accepting a pardon can be viewed as an acceptance of guilt
and a confession, since rejecting a pardon is a way to retain your Fifth
Amendment rights against self-incrimination.

However, it is important to note that whether or not accepting a pardon
is an admission of guilt has never actually been decided by any court.
It's simply written in the text of the opinion in a case which was
unrelated to that question.

No. And whether or not they will be criminally investigated will hinge
on whether or not they are alleged to have committed a crime, not
whether or not they asked for a pardon. *Seeking* a pardon is different
from *receiving* a pardon, which is also different from *accepting* a
pardon. Seeking a pardon is not an admission of guilt. Receiving a
pardon is not an admission of guilt. *Accepting* a pardon *may* be an
admission of guilt.
