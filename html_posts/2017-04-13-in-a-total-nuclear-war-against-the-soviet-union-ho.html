As we learned from the [[History Channel
episode](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=c30842&url=http://www.history.com/shows/modern-marvels/season-3/episode-9){.external_link

onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="history.com"}]{.qlink_container} on us (as part of their
*Modern Marvels* series), Cheyenne Mountain was never designed to take a
direct hit from any nuclear weapon. We know that a direct hit with a
kiloton-sized weapon (which was all that was available when the Mountain
was built) would have at least collapsed all the tunnels, effectively
destroying the facility, or at least rendering it completely
inoperative. A direct hit by today's megaton-sized weapons would turn
Cheyenne Mountain into Cheyenne Valley.

We know the former Soviet Union was targeting all the military
installations in Colorado, but NORAD was definitely high on the list.
What we learned *after* the collapse of the Soviet Union was that the
missiles that they *did* have (which were greatly exaggerated) would
have been mostly inaccurate. There's a fair chance that a kiloton weapon
would have *missed* the Mountain, a fully-survivable scenario. Megaton
weapons? Less likely, but if it wasn't a direct hit, it *might* have
been survivable. However, we never based any of our mission parameters
around surviving an attack. We had the capability and the resources to
do so, but our mission directives never specified that we had to survive
an attack in order to complete our mission.

For this reason, our entire mission is complete in under 10 minutes,
from observance of missile launch to notification delivered to the
National Command Authority. Missile flight time from the former Soviet
Union to Cheyenne Mountain is about 30 minutes. We would continue
providing updates on the missile to the NCA, continually narrowing the
impact zone as the missile got closer to its target. We used to say that
our job was done in 10 minutes, and you can spend the next 20 minutes
bending over and kissing your ass goodbye.

It's just something you live with when you work in a place like NORAD.
If you've done your job correctly, you get to tell the President that
you're about to die.
