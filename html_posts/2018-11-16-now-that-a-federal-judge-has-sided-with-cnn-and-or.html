**Now that a federal judge has sided with CNN and ordered the White
House to reinstate Jim Acosta\'s press pass, how will President Trump
retaliate?**

First of all, it's a temporary restraining order. The case hasn't been
heard yet.

Second, it's a restraining order on ***5th Amendment*** grounds, not 1st
Amendment grounds. Basically, the judge said that Acosta has a 5th
Amendment right to to due process when his hard pass is to be revoked,
and the White House didn't give it to him, so for now, he can have his
hard pass back.

Finally, how will Trump respond? Hopefully it's simply by not calling on
Acosta in the press room until after his actual hearing.
