**Content:** [I think you\'re trying to ask if making such a statement
would be considered inflammatory and could contribute to a rape.\
\
Is it considered inflammatory? Absolutely. This sort of inflammatory
speech is definitely not covered under First Amendment free speech
protections in the United States.\
\
I think you\'d be hard pressed to find a rapist who claims, \"I heard
someone shout FHRITP and I thought, \'Hey, that sounds like a great
idea\' so I raped her.\" However, even if you did, the statement didn\'t
drive the rapist to do what he did. He made the decision to rape all on
his own, regardless of where he gets his influences from. No one
convinced him to rape.\
\
Here\'s an example. If I walked past a Lamborghini and I said, \"Hey,
great car, someone should steal that,\" and then the car gets stolen, am
I liable for theft? The answer is no, as I did not do anything to
further the theft, aid or abet the thieves, or plan the theft, so I
can\'t be considered an accessory to the theft.\
\
Clearly, shouting FHRITP is different than saying \"Someone should steal
that car\" as it is inflammatory speech, but the legal concept is
similar. Simply stating that someone should do something illegal is not
tantamount to inciting a crime. Additionally, simply stating (or
shouting) FHRITP isn\'t tantamount to telling anyone to rape, because if
you FHRITP with consent, it\'s certainly not illegal as long as both
parties consent. You could be promoting consentual sex, not rape.\
\
Therefore, the actual words aren\'t anything other than inflammatory
speech. Any conduct that follows from the speech is not caused by the
speech itself.]{.rendered_qtext}
