In government employment, it operates very much like union workers do,
but without the actual union. They cannot work overtime if there is no
overtime funding available. They must be approved for overtime, and if
overtime is not approved, they leave when the clock says to leave.

It also takes an Act of God and Congress to fire someone from a
government job. Unless you've killed your co-workers in the office, it
is a cumbersome process to remove a government employee from his or her
job. You must show a consistent pattern of failure to achieve results
(over a number of performance reports over a number of years) before you
can be fired, and usually you are just relocated to another department
because it is easier.
