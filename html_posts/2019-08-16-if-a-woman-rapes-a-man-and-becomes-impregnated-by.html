**If a woman rapes a man and becomes impregnated by him lawfully, what
would his obligations to the child be?**

He pays child support until the child turns 18.

*WHAT??? THAT'S SO WRONG! HE WAS RAPED! WHY DOES HE HAVE TO PAY CHILD
SUPPORT???*

You're all spun up about this because you have the wrong idea about
child support.

Child support is not a punishment for an aggressor, or a way to enrich a
single mother.

**Child support is about the child.**

The state mandates child support. Child support amounts are determined
by the state using a formula. Child support is not imposed by a court.
The state has a compelling interest in caring for children, and both of
the people who created that child are responsible for financially
supporting the child. *How* the child was created, and *under what
conditions* that child were created, are the realm of the courts.

If you think this is wrong, you might consider having a law passed in
your state which raises taxes so that a rape victim does not have to pay
child support. Then the parent can apply to the state for child support
from them instead of from the victim. In that way, everyone pays, not
just the victim. Maybe that seems more fair to you. Maybe your state
agrees.

So far, no state has decided to pass such a law.
