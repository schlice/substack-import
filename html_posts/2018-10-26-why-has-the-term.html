**Why has the term "nationalist" been redefined, and why is it simply
being accepted? It isn't hard to qualify it with "white" if that's what
someone is trying to say, without losing the original term & its
meaning.**

This is an excellent question, and one which bears examining.

The answer to your question is that the term "nationalist," like many
other terms, is being redefined for political gain.

If your opponent declares himself a "nationalist," then it makes sense
to confuse your audience by conflating "nationalist" (an arguably
neutral term) with "white nationalist" (an arguably racist term). Then
you can point to your opponent being a "nationalist" and claim that he's
a racist, because you've successfully conflated "nationalist" and "white
nationalist."

This has just recently been done with two other terms: "immigrant" and
"illegal immigrant." An "immigrant" is something we like, while an
"illegal immigrant" is something we don't like. You can say that you are
anti-illegal immigrant until your opponent attempts to redefine
"immigrant" to include "illegal immigrant" and now if you oppose
illegals entering the country, you're "anti-immigrant."

See how that works?

If you can conflate and confuse, you can distract your base from the
real issues. When you don't have an actual, articulable platform to run
on, confuse your base with terminology.

Classic political strategy.
