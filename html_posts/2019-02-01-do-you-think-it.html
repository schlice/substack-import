**Do you think it\'s important for every American who cares about the
Constitution and the 2nd Amendment to learn about Shay\'s Rebellion and
the consequences of this event? Do you think most Americans understand
it?**

Most Americans don't understand it because history is so poorly taught
in American schools. But I digress.

*Shay's Rebellion is not an argument against the 2nd Amendment.*

That is the classic trope of *going to the extreme to avoid the middle.*
It's like explaining that abortion kills hundreds of thousands of babies
every year in the United States and you reply, "tell that to a woman who
has been raped." That a woman was raped does not change the fact that
hundreds of thousands of babies are killed out of convenience. You
cannot use the rape argument to justify the killing of hundreds of
thousands of innocent babies out of convenience.

In the same way, you cannot use an example of an insurrection which was
quelled by the government as an argument that the millions of gun owners
who successfully defend themselves against crime every year should not
have that right. In fact, the 2nd Amendment lives right alongside the
Insurrection Act, which permits the government to quell insurrections.
That's a little strange, considering that the 2nd Amendment exists, in
part, as a bulwark against tyranny. However, an insurrection against a
non-tyrannical government must still have a legal method by which that
insurrection may be quelled.

And in no case does an instance of insurrection relate to the right of a
person to own and carry a firearm for his own self-defense and the
defense of his family, nor does it negate the necessity to guard against
tyranny. Sure, while a revolution might look like insurrection,
attempting to overthrow a *legitimate* government is far different than
attempting revolution against a *tyrannical* one.
