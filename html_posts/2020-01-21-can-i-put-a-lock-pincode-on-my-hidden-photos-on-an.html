**Can you put a lock pin/code on your hidden photos on an iPhone?**

Natively? No.

But you can use a third-party application to hide and encrypt photos. As
an example,
[[â€ŽGalleryVault](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=1400a7&url=https://apps.apple.com/us/app/galleryvault-hide-photo-video/id899163792){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="apple.com"}]{.qlink_container} is an app I use on Android
(the link is to the Apple Apps store for the iOS version) to secure
photos that I don't want others to see.

No, it's not porn.

I will often use WhatsApp to communicate sensitive information since it
is encrypted. But once the photo lands on my side, that photo is
unencrypted in my photo gallery. If I want to keep the photo, I will
transfer it into GalleryVault to secure the photo so that I can keep it
safe while it's in my phone itself.

Additionally, you can also set up Pro features (for a fee) such as
removing the GalleryVault icon, hiding it in plain sight within a
"GCalculator" app, and even using a special code to open a "bare"
version of the app with nothing inside it, so that you demonstrate
plausible deniability should you be forced to unlock your Gallery Vault.
It will store both photos and videos as well as documents, and also has
a camera app so that photos and videos you take will be stored directly
in the vault, skipping your phone's Photos storage. As if that's not
enough functionality, it will also allow you to use the native sharing
features of most apps to share photos and videos directly into the app's
secure storage, and more Pro features like Cloud backup and sync mean
that you'll never lose your encrypted photos
