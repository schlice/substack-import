First of all, the PP loan forgiveness you're talking about is actually
the "PPP" or the "Paycheck Protection Program" which happened early on
in the COVID pandemic. It was intended to help small businesses to be
able to stay afloat and continue to pay their employees.

The White House isn't calling it out because it was a loan forgiveness
program, because clearly they are different (one is to businesses to try
to keep them in business and paying employees during COVID, the other is
a naked vote-buying gift program to college students who were
irresponsible and bit off more than they could chew). The White House is
calling it out because *some Republican lawmakers are also small
business owners, and benefited from the PPP program.*

In other words, the White House is doing the ol' "I'm rubber, you're
glue" thing and trying to reflect the criticism back on Republicans when
they criticize Biden's "payment for future Democrat votes", er, "early
Christmas present for the lazy", er, loan payment on behalf of
taxpayers.

This isn't a comparison between Democrat and Republican loan forgiveness
programs. This is a bald-faced *ad hominem* attack on Republicans who
own small businesses.

If you really think you can compare the two, I've got a bridge in
Brooklyn to sell you.

Original question:

Do you think the Republicans will start to complain about the public
exposure of their own PP loan forgiveness when they ranted about the
Biden's student loan program?
