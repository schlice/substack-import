**Content:** [I\'ll make the assumption that you\'re talking about armed
drones like the Air Force flies. If that\'s the case, and drones start
getting used against civilians, then the government has already declared
martial law and has essentially stopped following all rules.\
\
And the states (along with the National Guards of those states) are on
their own. So it would become a war between the combined forces of the
National Guard vs whatever members of the military were willing to fire
on American civilians (the amount of which would be very low). That
drone would be one Stinger missile away from not flying any
more.]{.rendered_qtext}
