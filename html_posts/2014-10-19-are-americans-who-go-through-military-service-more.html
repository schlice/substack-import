**Content:** [Depending on how you interpret your question, you\'re
either correct in your assumption, or you\'re way off base.\
\
Assuming that you think that the military would be a precursor to gang
membership, not likely. Break the rules in a gang and you are beaten
half to death as your \"don\'t-do-it-again\" warning. Do it again and
the gang finishes the job. The discipline in a gang is far more brutal
than the discipline in the military. If someone joins the military and
then decides, \"yeah, this just isn\'t enough discipline for me, I\'m
going over to a gang,\" that\'s not a result of a failure of military
discipline.\
\
If a military member moves to a gang, it\'s more likely that he has a
connection with someone already in the gang, and they bring him on board
with lures of money or prestige in the community. You don\'t get many
blind converts directly out of military service who just got bored with
the discipline in the military.\
\
You may have also meant that the military can be an alternative to
joining a gang. While this also sends the wrong message about the
military, it is true that the discipline offered by the military is an
alternative to the discipline offered by a gang. That said, the military
is not the \"national halfway house\" that you make it out to be. If
your choices are \"gang or military\" you\'re going to be very
disappointed with the military. Gang service is very selfish; gang
members are out for themselves or for the betterment of the gang.
Military members have a service ethic (a \"heart for service\") that
gang members do not. Military members willingly put themselves in harms
way to defend the freedoms that you and I enjoy on a daily basis. The
world is a much safer place because our military is on watch. The
military person gives his life in the defense of others, and in defense
of the Constitution. They are out there protecting and defending our way
of life. This is a far different motivation than a gang which is out
there defending their own \"honor\".\
\
So while it\'s true that both the military and a street gang are groups
that use discipline and promote discipline, they are for starkly
different reasons and one has far more altruistic motivations than the
other.]{.rendered_qtext}
