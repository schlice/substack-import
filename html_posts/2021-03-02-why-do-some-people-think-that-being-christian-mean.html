**Why do some people think that being Christian means you get to ignore
all the bad things that you have done? Or that it makes you more
virtuous? Like it's not really a good defense. It doesn't automatically
make you a good person.**

So there's two things we need to explore here: the state of your past
sins, and the difference between salvation and sanctification.

Yes, people sinned before coming to know Christ. Does accepting Christ
as your savior and asking him to come in to your heart make those sins
disappear? No, they happened, and the past can't be undone. **But Christ
paid for those sins with his blood,** so as far as God is concerned,
it's almost as if those past transgressions have been wiped away.

Think of it this way. When we die, we will stand before the throne and
be judged for everything we have done in this life. When we all die and
we stand to be judged, the sins we have committed will need to be paid
for. For those who have not accepted Christ, *they* will have to pay for
their sins themselves, which means eternal separation from God. In the
case of the believer, Christ has already paid for those sins with his
blood. Believers will stand before the throne, therefore, and be
*rewarded* for their good deeds in life, not judged for their sins.

So while "ignoring" what you did in the past doesn't help with never
doing them again, it's important to know that Christ already paid for
them, so they should no longer factor in to your life.

Becoming Christian by accepting Christ as your savior is an
instantaneous process. Salvation is a "one and done" kind of thing. Once
you are saved, and Christ has paid for your sins (past, present, and
future), you are saved. You can't be "un-saved."

But on that day begins another process by which God slowly works in you
to make you more like him, a little bit each day. That process is called
*sanctification*, and it takes a lifetime of work. It may never be
complete until we stand before him after we die. So becoming a Christian
doesn't instantly make you a good person. God does that, slowly, over
time.

Remember, *salvation* is instantaneous, *sanctification* takes a
lifetime of God's effort in your life, and you working to become a
better Christian.
