It's funny that most of the answers miss the point.

As you know, morals are **learned**. Children start learning morals
early, with some research suggesting seeds of morality emerge as early
as age 5. However, the ability to fully articulate and understand
complex moral themes develops more slowly, possibly around ages 9-12.

Moral development is a continuous process that evolves throughout
childhood and into adulthood.

But here's the kicker: with *billions* of people all over the earth
developing morals *completely independently* and sometimes in remote
corners of the world, somehow **stealing is still wrong and is still
immoral.** Additionally, rape is wrong everywhere, as is murder. Those
are all, universally, wrong.

***How is that possible?***

How is it possible that billions of people, all over the world, in
vastly different cultures and regions and social norms, have all somehow
magically developed this moral code which says that stealing, rape, and
murder is wrong? Sure, we know that it is, but why?

In order for this miraculous feat to be true, ***there must be a
standard of morality that applies to all people, and it must be
programmed into us at birth.***

It can't be something learned, because we all grew up differently, in
different cultures, in different parts of the world.

It can't be dictated by society, because same reason: we all grew up in
different societies.

It has to be greater than humanity, and it has to be inbuilt into
humanity. This isn't something that can be random. This isn't something
that random chemical interactions can produce. It is far too intricate
and complex for random mutations to accidentally throw together.
Darwin's theory of evolution does not adequately address how this can
happen. **This is clearly a function of intelligence.**

Therefore, our shared moral code points strongly to the fact that **we
have been designed by an intelligent designer.**
