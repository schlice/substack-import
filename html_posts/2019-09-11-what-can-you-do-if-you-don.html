**What can you do if you don\'t want to sign a mandatory arbitration
clause in a cellphone or other utility contract (requiring disputes be
handled this way)?**

You don't sign the contract.

**Is there an alternative besides not signing up for the service?**

Of course. There are always other carriers, right? Especially for
utilities in your community, right?

That would be normally true, if they all didn't do it. And they all do.

Until the FCC gets off of its collective bums and forces carriers to no
longer include forced arbitration clauses in their contracts, this
practice will continue. But in some cases, courts have looked
disfavorably at those clauses, finding that they unreasonably restricted
consumers' right to get viable relief. In the Cingular Wireless case of
2007, Washington State allowed customers to file a class action lawsuit
because it found that the forced arbitration clause was "grossly unfair
and blocked the customers from obtaining meaningful relief."
