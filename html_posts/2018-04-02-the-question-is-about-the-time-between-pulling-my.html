**The question is about the time between pulling my car over and before
the police officer approaches me. What would be the appropriate/safest
way to retrieve my registration and insurance info from the glove box
while the officer approaches my car?**

If you can get the paperwork before the officer approaches your car, get
it and have it ready. If you can't get the paperwork before the officer
approaches your car, *don't*.

When the officer asks for it, tell him it's in the glove box and ask if
you can get it. Then do what he tells you to do.

Easy peesey.
