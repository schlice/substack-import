First, tell me where you got your magical powers of mind control which
are so powerful that you can **make** someone do or think something they
don't want to do or think. You are quite the wizard!

But that slight bit of hyperbole should illuminate my point: **you don't
actually** ***make*** **anyone else do anything or think anything**. You
have no control over your mother. Unless you're actively trying to
coerce her into doing your bidding which is invoking a nascent tendency
towards suicide, then how she reacts is her problem, not yours. You have
needs, and being able to discuss those needs is critical.

If your mother cannot discuss your needs in a rational manner without
feeling like she wants to commit suicide, **she needs help**. And if she
would *like* you to consult with her before you start making decisions
on your own, without her input whatsoever, then she had better think
about getting herself some help to control her suicidal tendencies.

You asking this question tells me that *you need her*, not just for
someone to bounce ideas off of, but as someone whose judgement you
respect, and likely because you love her, too, and you want what's best
for her.

Remind her that you do not control her, she controls her, and she needs
to get those issues taken care of so that you can talk to her.

Original question:

Every time I (rationally) raise an issue with my mum she plays the
victim and tells me that I make her suicidal. It's so upsetting. How
should I react?
