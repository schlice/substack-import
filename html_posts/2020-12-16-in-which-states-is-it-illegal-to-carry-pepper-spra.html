**What states is it illegal to carry pepper spray?**

None. Pepper spray can be purchased and carried in all 50 states.

There are, of course, some variations in specifics in the states, but no
outright bans.

> - California: As of January 1, 1996 and as a result of Assembly Bill
>   830 (Speier), the pepper spray and Mace programs are now
>   deregulated. Consumers will no longer be required to have training,
>   and a certificate is not required to purchase or possess these
>   items. Pepper spray and Mace are available through gun shops,
>   sporting goods stores, and other business outlets. California Penal
>   Code Section 12400--12460 govern pepper spray use in California.
>   Container holding the defense spray must contain no more than 2.5
>   ounces (71 g) net weight of aerosol spray. Certain individuals are
>   still prohibited from possessing pepper spray, including minors
>   under the age of 16, convicted felons, individuals convicted of
>   certain drug offences, individuals convicted of assault, and
>   individuals convicted of misusing pepper spray.
> - Massachusetts: Before July 1, 2014, residents may purchase defense
>   sprays only from licensed Firearms Dealers in that state, and must
>   hold a valid Firearms Identification Card (FID) or License to Carry
>   Firearms (LTC) to purchase or to possess outside of one\'s own
>   private property. New legislations allow residents to purchase
>   pepper spray without a Firearms Identification Card starting July 1.
> - Florida: Any pepper spray containing no more than 2 ounces (57 g) of
>   chemical can be carried in public openly or concealed without a
>   permit. Furthermore, any such pepper spray is classified as
>   \"self-defense chemical spray\" and therefore not considered a
>   weapon under Florida law.
> - Michigan: Allows \"reasonable use\" of spray containing not more
>   than 18% oleoresin capsicum to protect \"a person or property under
>   circumstances that would justify the person\'s use of physical

>   Restricted to no more than 0.67% capsaicin content. It must be
>   purchased in person (i.e., cannot be purchased by mail-order or
>   internet sale) either at a pharmacy or from a licensed firearm
>   retailer (NY Penal Law 265.20 14) and the seller must keep a record
>   of purchases. The use of pepper spray to prevent a public official
>   from performing his/her official duties is a class-E felony.
> - New Jersey: Non-felons over the age of 18 can possess a small amount
>   of pepper spray, with no more than three-quarters of one ounce

>   self-defense. However, Texas law otherwise makes it illegal to carry
>   a \"chemical dispensing device\".[\[1\]](#vIyjK){#cite-vIyjK
