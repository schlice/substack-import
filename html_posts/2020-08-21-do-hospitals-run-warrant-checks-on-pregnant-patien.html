**Do hospitals run warrant checks on pregnant patients? Misdemeanor
warrants felony warrants?**

No. Hospitals are not the police. Hospitals have no compelling interest
in determining whether or not a patient has any outstanding warrants.

Just as my dentist doesn't care whether or not I have any outstanding
warrants, neither does my doctor or the hospital.
