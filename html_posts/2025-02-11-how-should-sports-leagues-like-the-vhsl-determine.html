Any "transgender policy" designed to protect the integrity of female
sports need only specify that participants must have been recorded
female at birth on their original birth certificates. Or, if no birth
certificate listing sex is available, biology, not an individual's
feelings, will determine whether the participant would be allowed to
compete as a male or a female.

This is because, as we know, biology is real, immutable, and binary.
This should not be a controversial opinion at this point.
