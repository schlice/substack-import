Whether or not you are required to "ride the lightning" in training is
entirely up to the department with which you are training. Some
departments require everyone who will carry a Taser to ride the
lightning, some do it "voluntarily," and others will accept prior
certification. There is no one standard, and there is no overall
requirement.

If I received a taser exposure during security training and have my
certification, do I need to receive a second exposure if I go into Leo
training?
