**Can the police search your car without a warrant if you refuse to show
your driver's license?**

As with all legal questions, the answer is "it depends," and it depends
on the status of your license.

**Simply failing to present your license is not grounds to search your
car.** However, depending on the status of your license, it *may* be
grounds to arrest you. Laws differ in every state, so check your state's
laws before thinking you can leave your license at home the next time
you get in your car.

Driving without being in possession of your license, or driving on an
otherwise valid but expired license, is usually just a traffic
infraction. However, if you're driving and you never had a license in
the first place, or if you are driving on a suspended or revoked
license, in most states that's a misdemeanor traffic offense. In other
words, if you are driving without having your valid license in your
possession, or if you let your otherwise valid license expire, it's a
fine. If you're driving on a suspended or revoked license, it's jail
time.

You can be arrested at the scene. If you are, your car will be
impounded. Your car will be searched incident to the impounding, to
catalog all of the items found in the car.

That's pretty much the only way your car can be searched without a
warrant simply by refusing to show a driver's license.
