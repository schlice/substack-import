False comparison.

First, "love the sinner, hate the sin" is not a quote from the Bible,
but the idea is correct. I answered that separately.

[[Bill Stein\'s answer to Is \"hate the sin but still love the sinner\"
truly biblical? in Christians &
Christianity](https://christianschristianity.quora.com/Is-hate-the-sin-but-still-love-the-sinner-truly-biblical-1)]{.qlink_container}

The upshot of that is God can perfectly love and hate a person at the
same time. This means He can love him as someone He created and can
redeem, as well as hate him for his unbelief and sinful lifestyle.

We, as imperfect human beings, cannot do this; thus, we must remind
ourselves to "love the sinner; hate the sin." But how do we do that? We
demonstrate our love for sinners by treating them with respect (1 Peter
2:17), praying for them (1 Timothy 2:1), and sharing the gospel with
them. We demonstrate our hatred for sin by identifying sin for what it
is, abstaining from it, and decrying it as incompatible with God\'s
character. Sin should not be tolerated or dismissed; it should be hated.

\

As for your second question, "sin" is not a "thing." It can't be sent
anywhere. Sin is a state of disobedience to God's word. Sin is,
literally, "missing the mark."

A sinner is someone who sins. But the person going to hell is the person
who knows God's commands and *actively ignores them* in their sin.

Finally, you asked about believers marrying unbelievers. I answered that
separately.
