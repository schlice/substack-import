**Do churches receive federal funding in the U.S.?**

The answer is no, churches do not receive federal funding.

For those who believe that tax exemption is some kind of "government
benefit," you would first have to believe that the government *owns* the
money, and through their benevolence, churches are *permitted* to keep
it.

That's not how taxes work.

Government shall make no law concerning the establishment of religion,
so says the 1st Amendment. Courts have long recognized that "the power
to tax involves the power to destroy[\[1\]](#gxsko){#cite-gxsko
.citation_link}" and with this in mind, churches are not taxed. Taxation
exerts too much control over churches.
