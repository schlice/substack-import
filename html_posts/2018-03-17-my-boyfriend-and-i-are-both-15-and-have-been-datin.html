**I'm 15 and my parents recently found me and my boyfriend (almost 16)
of a year & 5 months have had oral sex. They have Christian morals and
they've basically banned me from seeing him. When I try to talk it out
it ends in a fight. What can I do?**

What can you do? Nothing. You are a minor. Your parents are in charge of
you until you turn 18. That means they set the rules. They can literally
send you to school, bring you home, and lock you in your room in all of
the in-between time until you turn 18. Additionally, what you're doing
may be illegal where you live. Some states don't consider sex between
two minors as statutory rape, but some do (I know Utah and California
do, off the top of my head). Nevertheless, while you are a minor living
at home, your parents make the rules.

So if your parents' rules say no sex until you're married, or no sex
until you're 18, you're going to either have to abide by their rules, or
be sneakier and better at lying to them.

I'm not going to tell you what I think you should do because that's not
what you asked. You didn't ask for my opinion about your activities, and
I'm not going to give it.
