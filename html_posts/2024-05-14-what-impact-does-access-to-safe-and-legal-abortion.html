It is difficult to assess the actual hard numbers, and there is far more
nuance than it may initially appear.

The WHO estimates that 13% of maternal mortality is due to unsafe
abortion, but challenges with measurement and data quality still exist.
As far as we can reliably determine, no systematic assessment of the
validity of studies reporting estimates of abortion-related mortality
exists.

Additionally, many of the factors that made unlicensed abortions unsafe
in the past have since been rectified. In other words, even unlawful
abortions (colloquially called "back-alley abortions" in order to
inflame the reader) have gotten safer.

Finally, some abortion options which are "generally considered as safe"
are *massively increasing* the harms done to women, and in this case I
am primarily referencing **abortifacient drugs.** It is estimated that
about 50% of abortions in the United States are done chemically. Ever
since COVID, abortion activists have used the smokescreen of the
pandemic and social distancing to increase the penetration and
availability of mail-order abortifacient drugs such that in many cases,
a doctor's visit and pre-abortion evaluation is no longer necessary to
obtain them. This is immensely dangerous, as when these drugs are used
improperly (i.e. when an ectopic pregnancy exists, or the patient is
post-10 weeks pregnant), the drugs can induce incredibly bad outcomes,
such as internal bleeding and death. Think about that for a second. All
you'd need to do is improperly calculate the beginning of your pregnancy
and you could die by taking these drugs. ER visits from pregnant women
taking abortifacient drugs received through the mail have *spiked*. All
of this is to say that not all access improvements have reduced unsafe
abortions.

This is why it is very difficult to come up with solid numbers.
