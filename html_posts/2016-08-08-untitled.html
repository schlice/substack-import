True, it was closer to 13,000 shootings.

And if we break it down further, the majority of those (around 8,800)
were criminals shooting other criminals during the course of criminal
activity (i.e. gang violence, drug deals gone bad, etc).

The more we break it down, the more we find that if you're a good person
and not involved in criminal activity, the likelihood that you will be
shot in random violence is really, really low.
