**Is it legal for the company (for my own safety) to allow her to
transfer to a closer proximity to me?**

To answer your specific question, yes it is perfectly legal to allow her
to transfer closer to you. It's even perfectly legal for them to seat
her directly adjacent to you as well.

It's not smart, it's not ideal, but it's not illegal. It just seems like
they are setting themselves up for failure here, but it's not my
company.

Anyway, what to do about it (in order, move on to the next one if you
get no results):

- Complain to your manager
- Complain to HR
- Follow [[Joel

  suggestion and file a complaint with the EEOC for creating a hostile
  work environment.

Just remember, the more noise you make, the more **you** will be seen as
the problem, not her. Make sure you do these in order, and make sure you
document the conversations (i.e. date/time, what was the result, etc).
