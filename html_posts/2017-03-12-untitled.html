You are fortunate. I continually find issues related to how my parents
raised me, that affect me today. Physically, emotionally, spiritually,
I'm continually dredging things up that can be related back to my
childhood and the environment in which I was raised. I have lower GI
issues, and I am learning that many of the negative emotions which are
tied to those issues can be traced back to my feelings about my
childhood.

Let alone the criminal activity. That one should be the big disqualifier
right there. Yeah, I know, the dichotomy. But it's really not. The same
qualities which make one a good cop also make one a good criminal. All
you need is a lack of a suitable moral compass, and away you go.

I try to be a better parent than my parents were, but it appears I'm
also hampered as a parent by the habits which I was taught as a child.
It's a constant struggle.
