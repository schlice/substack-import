It sounds like you're asking whether or not it's okay if you missed the
light but then slowed down as soon as you noticed the light. Perhaps
you're asking whether or not it's okay to *start* slowing down after you
pass the light.

In either case, according to most vehicle and traffic laws in the United
States, you are required to slow down *before* you enter the school
zone. Once you enter the school zone, you should already be at the
prescribed speed (usually 20 mph).

Whether or not you will be ticketed is up to the officer stopping you.
If he saw that you were slowing down, he might give you a warning, but
school zones are the number one area where "children vs car" accidents
occur, and cracking down on speeding in those areas is a top priority
for law enforcement. I personally wouldn't expect much leniency, even if
you did finally notice and start slowing down.
