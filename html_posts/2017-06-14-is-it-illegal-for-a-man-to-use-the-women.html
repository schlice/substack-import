Currently, as of today (14 June 2017), it appears that Michigan does not
have a state law which allows persons to use a bathroom based on their
gender identity. They're working on one, but it's not law yet.

If you're a student, the Michigan Board of Education recently approved a
measure which directs districts to allow transgender students to use
bathrooms or locker rooms that match their gender identity, although
private accommodations should be made for all students upon request. The
new rules also direct schools to enact polices that protect LGBT
students from harassment and to designate a staff member who can provide
LGBT-related support to students who request it.
