**Content:** [There are many reasons the homeless population has
skyrocketed in this country since the 70s:\

- [[Deinstitutionalisation](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=57d7ab&url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/deinstitutionalization){.external_link

  onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
  qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}: Some studies state
  that up to one third of the homeless population is comprised of people
  who were displaced from state mental institutions when they were
  closed down.
- Drugs: We\'re seeing the effects of the legalization of marijuana most
  notably in our homeless population. [[Legal marijuana drawing homeless
  to
  Colorado.](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=6f1547&url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/legal-marijuana-drawing-homeless-to-colorado/){.external_link
  rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
  onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
  qt-tooltip="cbsnews.com"}]{.qlink_container} We\'re seeing huge spikes
  in the 18-25 year old homeless population, who come to Colorado with
  big ambitions of \"smoke pot. And probaly need to find some work to
  pay for the pot,\" but minimum-wage jobs are not plentiful, and with
  the new influx of people into the state, the ones that do appear are
  quickly filled.
- Rising home prices: Normally, you would think that a rising economy
  and rising housing prices would be a good thing. That is, until you
  can\'t afford to live in your home any longer. While the economy of
  the state is doing well, the number of affordable homes in the state
  is dwindling.

I\'m sure there are many more reasons, but these are just a few off the
top of my head.
