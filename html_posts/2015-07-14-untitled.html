**Content:** [Nah, 99.4% of statistics are made up on the spot anyway.\
\
See, statistics can say exactly what you want them to say.\
\
That\'s the point.\
\
Statistics are useless. Relying on statistics to get your information
will only get you in trouble. Remember the global warming hockey stick
chart? Totally bogus. But based on real statistics. Just a very, very
small view of them. Statistics can say whatever you want them to say,
either prove, or disprove your assertions.\
\
Ultimately, I\'m going to believe what I want to believe, and you\'re
going to believe what you want to believe, and we\'ll find whatever
\"experts\" we can to back us up.\
\
I\'m not here to try to convince you of anythnig. Nor am I here to try
to change you. You certainly can\'t change me.]{.rendered_qtext}
