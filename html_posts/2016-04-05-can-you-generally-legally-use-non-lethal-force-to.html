answered, so I really don\'t need to add anything.

I will only say that the point of his which must be emphasized is the
**reasonableness** of the response. Since you can respond to a
non-lethal threat with a different type of non-lethal response (i.e. you
can respond to a violent person with a Taser), the question of fact for
the jury to decide is whether or not the response was \"equivalent\" and
whether or not the \"reasonable person\" would believe the response to
be \"equivalent.\" The reasonable person test is the one which needs to
be passed.
