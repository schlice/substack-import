It's not. Stem cell research is legal in the United States, however,
there are restrictions on its funding and which stem cells you can use.
And the other problem: in order to harvest embryonic stem cells (ESCs),
the fetus must be destroyed. As you may be aware, destruction of a fetus
is currently a hot topic in the United States.

The final problem: ESCs have yet to be proven to treat any condition
successfully, while adult stem cells (with induced pluripotency) have
been used for decades to successfully treat a wide variety of diseases
and conditions.

Therefore, the lack of usability of ESCs coupled with the controversy
surrounding destroying a fetus make harvesting ESCs difficult at best.
