**If your line manager is sharing private emails to the rest of her
staff that she has had with a colleague, how do I tell her she is wrong?
I'm still on probation and don't want to upset her for fear of losing my
job.**

You don't. You mind your own business, keep your head down, and keep
your job.

Just tell yourself, "Not my monkey, not my circus."

Now, you might send an anonymous note to her supervisor and advise
him/her of what's going on, because it might be a violation of company
policy. Let her supervisor handle it.

Beyond that, "not my monkey, not my circus."
