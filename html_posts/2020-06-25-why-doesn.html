**Why doesn\'t Trump just resign and let Pence take over and then have
Trump run everything from behind the curtain?**

If the problem was Trump, then that would be the easy solution, wouldn't
it?

However, **the problem isn't Trump. Trump is a** ***symptom*** **of the
problem.**

It's iceberg theory. Getting rid of Trump won't fix the underlying
problem that created the conditions which allow for a Trump presidency.

The problems began long before Trump, and long before Obama. To be fair,
both Obama and Trump are symptoms of the problem.

Even if Trump stepped down and allowed Pence to become President for the
next few months (or even if he did it in January right after he is sworn
in for his second term), people will still be fighting with each other.
Cops will still be evil, and Antifa and BLM will still be a thing. Not
having Trump as president won't magically make any of this go away.

This is a problem a long time in the making. And it's a problem that is
going to take a similarly long time to fix. But at the rate we're going,
it doesn't seem like anyone wants to fix it. Why not? Easy: because they
*benefit* from it.
