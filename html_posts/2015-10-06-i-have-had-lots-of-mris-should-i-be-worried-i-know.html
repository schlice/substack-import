**Content:** [I too have had \"lots\" of MRIs. High-field MRIs. Of my
brain. Every year for the past 8 years; some years saw more than one
high-field MRI of my brain; for example, if I was changing medications,
or if I was having a relapse or flare-up.\
\
To the best of our knowledge, there are no adverse side-effects from
exposure to high-strength magnetic fields. There are definitely some
other side effects though.\
\
As you already know, any metal in your body can be affected by the MRI
scanner. Some older tattoo dyes had metal flakes in them, and have been
indicated as potentially being affected by the MRI. Any metal you may
have in your body (i.e. clips from surgeries, pacemakers, some
chemotherapy drugs, implants, etc) need to be indicated to the techs
performing the scan.\
\
Also, some people have had an adverse reaction to the contrast dye
(gadolinium) which is administered during some scans. Most people don\'t
have any reaction at all. If I remember correctly, it\'s like 1 in
10,000 people will react to gadolinium. All of my scans use Gd for the
second half of the scan. For me, active MS lesions will show up bright
white in a certain scan when exposed to gadolinium. The neurologist uses
this information to determine if any lesions are active, or if they are
older and inactive. So I get 20 minutes or so of non-contrast scans, I
get pulled out of the tube, get a shot of Gd in my arm, and go back in
the tube for another 15-20 minutes of enhancing scans.\
\
But other than the secondary side effects, there are no known long-term
health risks associated with being exposed to high-strength magnetic
fields.]{.rendered_qtext}
