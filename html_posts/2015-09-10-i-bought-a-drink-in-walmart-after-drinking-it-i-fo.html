**Content:** [Short answer: not much.\
\
Longer answer: In order for you to have a claim, you have to show some
harm was caused by the expired drink. Without harm caused, you might be
able to bring the receipt and the bottle back to Walmart, and they may
credit you for the drink.\
\
If there was harm caused, you might be able to make a claim for damages.
So using a very hypothetical example, if you drank an expired
dairy-based drink and you develop a Salmonella or E. Coli infection, you
should save the bottle and the receipt. Put the bottle in the
refrigerator to preserve it at the same state it was when you finished
drinking it. Bring the bottle to the doctor so they can test the
remaining contents (if you didn\'t rinse it out, then there is still
residue inside the bottle).\
\
If the contents contain the bacteria, and it\'s the same bacteria with
which you were infected, you would have to prove that the bottle was the
same one you bought, and you were infected by that drink.\
\
There are lots of problems here, though:\

- There\'s little proof that you were infected by that specific drink,
  although the fact that the bottle and you are infected by the same
  bacteria is probably close enough.\
- There\'s no way to prove that you didn\'t introduce the bacteria into
  the open bottle\
- There\'s no proof that the bottle and the receipt match other than the
  UPC code, which is the same for all of that product. In other words,
  you could have bought the product twice: once a month before, and once
  currently (when your register receipt shows you did), and you\'re
  holding the old product bottle and the new receipt.

So is it likely that you can successfully bring a claim from nothing
more than an expired drink bottle? No, not very likely. But if you can
show harm was caused by the expired drink, you might have a claim.
