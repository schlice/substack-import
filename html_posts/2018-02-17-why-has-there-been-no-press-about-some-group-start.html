**Why has there been no press about some group starting a drive for a US
constitutional Amendment to limit the right to bear arms? Has anyone
started the process with any success?**

This has not been done because there is no political will to do so. The
vast majority of Americans do not want to limit the rights of tens of
millions of law abiding citizens because of the bad actions of a few.
The United States was built on individualism and freedom, and having
access to tools which can defend your own life is of paramount value in
this country.

The vast majority of Americans are keenly aware that the gun is just a
tool. The gun does not drive people to commit murder. Granted, easy
access to guns is a factor, but it is not the driving motivation. Take
the gun away and the killer will switch to another tool. Terrorists have
used **pressure cookers** to kill and maim. Terrorists have used
**trucks** to kill people, and terrorists have used **airplanes** to
kill people. The tool should not be at issue.

The vast majority of Americans know that limiting **guns** does not
limit **crime**. Addressing the root causes of bad behavior are
paramount.

The vast majority of Americans who own legal guns never commit crimes
with their guns. Hundreds of millions of guns are currently sitting
quietly in home safes, not shooting anyone. We don't punish the gun for
the crimes of the criminal.

The vast majority of Americans know that adding *yet another law* won't
stop someone from killing. You do know that murder is already illegal,
right? So what law can you add that will stop someone from murdering,
when murder is already illegal?

So no, the Second Amendment is not going anywhere, any time soon.
