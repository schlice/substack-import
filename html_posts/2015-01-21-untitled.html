**Content:** [Hmm, I don\'t see any particular line of reasoning as
offensive; if it\'s reasoned discussion, it should have no offensive
content in it.\
\
I don\'t take offense at your reasoning, it is what it is. I noticed
that I said at least once in my answer that guns were designed to kill
people; that\'s not accurate. Guns are designed to kill. People,
animals, it makes no difference. Guns are not designed to punch holes in
paper. That\'s how you practice punching holes in people and animals. I
find it illogical reasoning when people say that guns ownership is only
valid because people only use them to plink targets. Some guns are
specifically modified to be used as competition target guns. That
doesn\'t change the fact that it\'s a gun and is primarily designed to
punch holes in people and animals.\
\
We, as a gun enthusiast crowd, have to accept the fact that the primary
purpose of the invention of the gun was not to punch holes in paper.
There are far more efficient tools we can use to punch holes in paper.
Guns were designed to punch holes in people and
animals.]{.rendered_qtext}
