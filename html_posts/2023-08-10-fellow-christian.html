Well, from your question, you seem to indicate that being
"works-focused" is not how God wants us to be. Therefore, as a
Christian, I want to live in the way that God wants me to live, which
from your question would be not works-focused.

To use my own understanding instead of how you worded your question, I
believe in *sola fide*, which means that we are saved by faith alone. We
are not saved by faith plus anything. We are not saved by faith plus
works. We are not saved by faith plus membership in the right church. We
are not saved by faith plus eating a wafer of bread and drinking from a
cup of wine every week.

The Bible makes it clear that it is faith alone which saves you. *Sola
fide* is a key difference between not only Protestants and Catholics but
between biblical Christianity and almost all other religions and
teachings. All other religions are founded on human achievement, but
biblical Christianity is unique in that it is focused on what God has
accomplished through Christ\'s finished work, not on anything that
humans have done. "Now when a man works, his wages are not credited to
him as a gift, but as an obligation. However, to the man who does not
work but trusts God who justifies the wicked, his faith is credited as
righteousness\" (Romans 4:4-5). The Bible teaches that we are saved by
God\'s grace through His gift of faith (Ephesians 2:8--9), not by our
own works as most faiths and cults instruct their followers.

*Sola fide*---the doctrine of *justification* by faith alone apart from
works---is simply recognizing what is taught over and over in Scripture:
at some point in time God declares ungodly sinners righteous by
*imputing Christ's righteousness to them* (Romans 4:5, 5:8, 19). This
happens without any works and before the individual actually begins to
become righteous (a process we call *regeneration*). This is an
important distinction between Catholic theology that teaches righteous
works are meritorious towards salvation, and Protestant theology that
affirms the biblical teaching that good works are the *result* (and
evidence) of a person who has been *justified* by God and *regenerated*
by the power of the Holy Spirit.

Let's repeat that last line in another way: *good works are a result of
God's grace; God's grace is not a result of good works.*

That's not to say that people who are not saved do not do good works;
they absolutely can, and very often do. It *is* to say that those good
works do not *earn* you God's grace. It is *faith alone* which earns you
that grace. It is *faith alone* that justifies you.
