You also stated that this was in the United States.

If this were true, you would be a victim of discrimination based on a
disability. The specific statement \"I believe I was labeled with some
form of non-physical disability and was underpaid and denied funding
opportunities in graduate school and work\" is discrimination based on
disability, and is in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act.
You should contact a lawyer who is specifically versed in the Americans
with Disabilities Act to see if you have a case.
