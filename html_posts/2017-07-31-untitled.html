I'm going to put my skeptical side away and side with you and believe
you when you say you don't sell drugs.

What he's trying to do is his job. He's trying to arrest you for selling
drugs. If you go see him, he will arrest you. Don't let his assurances
to the contrary dissuade you. He wants to arrest you, because that's his
job. He's trying to get you to willingly show up at the police station
so they don't have to get warrants and go through all the other legal
channels to extricate you from your home. They'd rather have you come
down to the station yourself so they can arrest you peacefully and
without needing a warrant. He won't tip his hand and show you his cards.
He won't show you the video until you are at the station and they can
arrest you.

Maybe they have a video, which would be enough to arrest you, but the DA
may have told them that they don't have enough evidence to make a charge
stick. If they have enough evidence to arrest you but they haven't put
out a warrant yet, then this may be why.

Regardless, if they have a video or audio recording which purports to
show you selling drugs, you need a lawyer. Don't wait until you get
arrested. Get a lawyer now. Work with your lawyer so that you can be
*ready* for when you are arrested, if they actually decide to arrest
you.

By the way, this is the only way you get a lawyer to actually show up in
a short amount of time when you get arrested: you have to pre-arrange
this with your lawyer, so that if you are arrested, you will be able to
make a phone call and your lawyer can meet you at the police station.
Otherwise, it could be days before your lawyer can actually get to you,
and you can sit in jail for that time. They don't even have to charge
you formally for 72 hours and they can hold you in jail. So you will
have to go find a reputable defense attorney and put him or her on
retainer. That means you'll have to pay out of pocket for that retainer.

But however you decide to handle it, I would not go down to that police
station. Because I know that if I did, I'd be arrested.
