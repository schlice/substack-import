**What would be the resulting effects if police officers were required
to keep video footage of everything they do on a daily basis in a public
database?**

It would be an absolute nightmare.

First of all, you'd have to edit out all of the parts of the video which
*can't* be made public, for various reasons. For example, if the video
is being used in an ongoing legal procedure, the video is evidence and
is protected. Only after the trial is concluded could the evidence be
released.

After the editing was done to remove the items which, by law, can't be
publicly presented, you'd have a pretty boring compilation of officers
driving cars or filling out paperwork. Not sure that's really worth your
time, or your desire to watch the police that closely.

Not to mention, your taxes would triple.

In order to store 100% of the video of an officer's shift, we're talking
about 8 hours of video per officer per shift. Let's just assume we have
a small-ish department, and you normally staff 10 officers and a
supervisor. This equates to 33 cameras x 8 hours of video = 264 hours of
video ***per day.*** That's 7920 hours of video per month.

We'll take the Axon Body 2 camera specifications as our baseline, so we
can collect some numbers. From Taser's specs, the specs for recording,
depending on resolution:

:::: ui_qtext_image_outer
::: qtext_image_wrapper
![](images/qimg-bff1e67626a99e9566031135b2d7f3c0){.landscape
.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed
master_src="images/qimg-bff1e67626a99e9566031135b2d7f3c0" master_w="379"
master_h="62"}
:::
::::

Therefore, if you go with Taser's recommendation of running at 720p (low
HD resolution; you get decent images but you don't consume the space of
1080p), each camera will use 2.7GB per hour. That means, for a typical
day of 264 hours of video, you will need 712.8 GB of space per day. In a
typical month, you're looking at 21.3 TB per month.

Then how long do you plan on storing that video? Three months? One year?
If you store the video for three months, you'll need over 64 TB of
space. If you plan on storing the video for a year, you'll need over 256
TB of space. Reducing the quality of the video starts to reduce the
effectiveness of the camera recording.

And this doesn't even factor in *evidentiary* recordings. This is only
for *administrative* recordings. Evidentiary recordings may have to be
stored for longer.

While storage prices have definitely gotten cheaper, storage is not
free. Not to mention that you will have to hire some new video admins to
curate all of the officer's video, remove and catalog the segments of
video which must be kept for evidence, and maintain the online catalog
of video. Storage admins are not cheap, even on a government salary.

It would be better to make policies telling officers what they were
required to record, and slamming them if recordings ever went "missing".
