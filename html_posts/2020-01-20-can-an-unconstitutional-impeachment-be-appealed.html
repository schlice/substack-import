**Can an unconstitutional impeachment be appealed?**

Appealed to *whom*?

In other words, what is the organization that is above the Congress
which oversees impeachments?

The Constitution says that the House has the *sole* authority to
impeach, and the Senate has the *sole* authority to remove from office.
This means that ***there is no one else***.

Are you thinking maybe the Supreme Court? The court deals with *law*,
and this is a matter of *politics*. The court does not handle matters of
politics. Remember that impeachments are matters of politics.

Are you listening to Trump's legal team who claims that the impeachment
is "unconstitutional?" They're discussing the theory behind the phrase
"high crimes and misdemeanors," and they are claiming that Trump's
actions do not rise to that standard. They're calling the bending of the
original meaning of "high crimes and misdemeanors" a "dangerous
perversion of the Constitution." This may or may not be true, but the
truth is that, regardless of what any legal scholar will tell you, high
crimes and misdemeanors are anything that a majority of the House says
they are, since there is no legal definition for what constitutes "high
crimes and misdemeanors." The House has voted and said that Trump's
actions *did* rise to the standard of high crimes and misdemeanors, and
now it's up to the Senate to determine if the standard set by the House
is enough to remove the President from office.

So even if you could claim that Trump's actions didn't actually rise to
the standard of "high crimes and misdemeanors" as the House said they
did, what do you do? Your only option is to amend the Constitution and
make it more clear what actually constitutes high crimes and
misdemeanors for future presidents.

So can an unconstitutional impeachment be appealed? No, because as long
as the Constitutional process is followed, there is no such thing as an
"unconstitutional" impeachment, and there's no one to whom you can
appeal. The House followed its own rules and its Constitutional dictates
and passed Articles of Impeachment. Period. End of story. That makes it
Constitutional.
