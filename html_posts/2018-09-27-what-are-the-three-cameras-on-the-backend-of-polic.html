These systems scan and capture the license plates of vehicles all around
the patrol car throughout the shift. as well as the date and time, and
the GPS location. The license plates are uploaded into a database, which
can then be referenced to show patterns of movement, show whether or not
a vehicle was near a crime scene, or show vehicles which may be
associated with each other.
