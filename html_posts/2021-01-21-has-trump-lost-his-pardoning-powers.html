**Has Trump lost his pardoning powers?**

Today is January 21, 2021. Trump lost his pardon power when he left the
Presidency under normal Constitutional process at 12:00 PM EST on
January 20, 2021, and Joe Biden was sworn in.

He retained all of the rights and privileges of being President up until
that point.
