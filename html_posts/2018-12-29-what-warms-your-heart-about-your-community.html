**What warms your heart about your community?**

For all of its faults (and there are many), *my community* *loves its
public servants.* Our hearts collectively break when any officer is shot
or killed, but it hurts that much more when it's one of our local
officers or deputies.

Here's the forinstance I'll give you: in early August, Officer Cem Duzel
of the Colorado Springs Police Department [[was shot in the
head](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=dfb9bd&url=https://gazette.com/news/colorado-springs-police-officer-wounded-in-shootout-is-stable-but/article_4b627cb0-981b-11e8-9486-e38a04dfbe55.html){.external_link

]{.qlink_container}and lived. The outpouring of support for Officer
Duzel and his family was
[[immense](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=0aae25&url=https://www.krdo.com/news/springs-police-thankful-for-birthday-cards-to-cem-duzel/800784165){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="krdo.com"}]{.qlink_container}.

For example, one of our residents who plays in a band [[held a benefit
concert](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=f6ed96&url=https://gazette.com/news/benefit-concert-sunday-to-raise-money-for-injured-police-officer/article_a19be23e-c2a4-11e8-ab07-232f08f5c48c.html){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="gazette.com"}]{.qlink_container} to help pay for Officer
Duzel's rehab costs, which will be fairly significant.

Word of our city's generosity reached far and wide, [[drawing some
celebrities to stop
by](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=cd0878&url=https://koaa.com/news/covering-colorado/2018/08/24/the-hulk-visits-colorado-springs-police-officer-cem-duzel-in-the-hospital/){.external_link

Warms my heart.
