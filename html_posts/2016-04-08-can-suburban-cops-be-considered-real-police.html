You raise a valid question. I mean, how does a county sheriff\'s deputy
from middle-of-nowhere, population 12 plus a few cows relate in
experience to a big-city cop like NY or LA or Chicago?

In experience, they don\'t even come close.

But are they *real*?

Well, they fill a real need, and they provide a real service. Their oath
of office is the same. Their commitment to serving their community is
the same. Their willingness to take a bullet for you is the same.

So are they *real* police? In every sense of the word, ***yes.***
