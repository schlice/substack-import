Hey, them chairs were harder to fly than you think. Tilt controls,
lumbar support, you could catch a finger in one of those things!

In all seriousness, I had seen an old Army doctor about something (I
honestly don\'t remember what) and he asked me what I did, so I was
describing my job in NORAD, and when I was done, he said, in all
seriousness, and this is a quote, "So, basically you fly a desk."
