**Content:** [Tobacco is not part of the war on drugs because it is not
illegal. The question is: should it be?\
\
If we determine what should be illegal based on how **damaging** it is
to your body, alcohol and tobacco should be highly illegal, along with
most illegal drugs. Marijuana shouldn\'t really be on the list, as it is
more helpful than hurtful.\
\
If we determine what should be illegal based on how **addictive** it is,
the marijuana should not even be on the list, but many other drugs,
including tobacco and alcohol, should. Nicotine is more addictive than
cocaine.\
\
If we determine what should be illegal based on whether or not it has
any **medicinal benefit**, then marijuana, cocaine, and opium should be
off the list. Nicotine should definitely be on this list.\
\
But in the United States, we don\'t determine what is illegal by any of
those factors. It\'s done by politicians, political agendas, and big
business, not common sense.]{.rendered_qtext}
