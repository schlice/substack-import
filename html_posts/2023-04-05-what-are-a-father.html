It depends on the state.

In most cases in most states, if the parents are married, the husband is
considered to be the "presumptive father" if a child is produced during
his marriage, and he owes child support.

If the parents are not married, either the mother or the father can
allege that the man is the father, and he is considered the "putative
father," and he owes child support.

In either case, the man can relieve himself of the responsibility of
paying child support by filing a Request to Establish Paternity. In
other words, the man can request a paternity test by filing with the
court. The specific form is different in each state, but the result is
the same: a man who doubts whether or not he is the father of a child
can file for a paternity test. In most states, this cannot be blocked.
In fact, in some states, the man can make this request before child
support is ordered.

If the man is determined to not be the father, he owes nothing.

TL;DR: Denying paternity counts for nothing until a paternity test is
done. If court-ordered child support is in force, a man denying
paternity must still pay until a paternity test is requested and
performed and paternity is established.
