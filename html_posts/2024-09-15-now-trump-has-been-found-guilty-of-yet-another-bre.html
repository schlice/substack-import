First of all, Trump has not been found guilty of using someone's music
without their permission. The issue is that the artists don't even know
how their music is licensed, and they have no personal control over who
gets to purchase a license.

Artists license their music to a collective licensing company like
[[**BMI**](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=2e9079&url=https://www.bmi.com/licensing){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="bmi.com"}]{.qlink_container}. The artist gets paid, and BMI
handles providing the license for that music.

When Trump holds a convention in a venue, it is the *venue* who
contracts with BMI to license the music.

So there are literally two layers between the artist and the RNC: the
collective licensing company, and the venue. Trump doesn't usually
choose the bumper music; usually the details are hammered out when the
RNC contracts with the venue to host the event. The venue provides the
music, and it's all contracted and perfectly legal.

The event happens, and suddenly basement-dwellers start railing away on
X about how some artist "endorses" Trump because his music was played
during a Trump rally.

The artist, to avoid losing face, gets his lawyer to gin up a cease and
desist letter, but in doing so, this violates the terms of his agreement
with BMI.

So the cease and desist letter goes out to the RNC, the RNC reaches out
to the venue, the venue reaches out to BMI, and BMI reaches out to the
artist, just to let them all know that the artist gave blanket
permission to license their music to anyone who meets BMI's standards to
be a customer (and that's just about anyone, including convention and
concert venues), and the artist got paid for the use of that music. If
they had specific restrictions they wanted to place on the use of that
music, they needed to do it when they negotiated their contract with
BMI, not after.

And the bottom line is that **they got paid** for that use. And now they
want to complain?

Second, Trump hasn't committed any felonies while he was in office,
despite what New York wants you to believe. But "totally honest and
upstanding?" What absolute moron would ever think that any political
candidate has *ever* been "totally honest and upstanding?" You couldn't
name one if you tried.

Politics is a messy, dirty business. And no one in it is completely,
"totally honest and upstanding." Sorry, not a single one. And if you
think they are, you have been hoodwinked. You've been lied to.

Look, that doesn't mean we don't call out injustice when we find it.
It's just that we don't expect our politicians to be angels. We expect
them to have **good policy**. We know they are flawed, as all of us are
flawed. We call out the flaws when they are within the politician's
control to address, but we don't throw out the baby with the bathwater.
Politics isn't a popularity contest. We don't vote for the "nicest"
candidate. That's not how life works. If you think that, you probably
should move out of your parent's basement and join the real world before
you comment about how real life works.
