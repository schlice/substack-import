**Would you have to change the Constitution to make DC a state?**

**Yes.** There are several sections of the Constitution which must
change in order to make Washington D.C. a state.

- Article I Section 8

This section reads:

> The Congress shall have Power\... To exercise exclusive Legislation in
> all Cases whatsoever, over such District (not exceeding ten Miles
> square) as may, by Cession of particular States, and the Acceptance of
> Congress, become the Seat of the Government of the United States\....

This essentially means that Congress controls the area which houses the
seat of government. Congress can delegate some of its powers to the
local mayor, but it always retains the final authority.

But the Supreme Court has *also* ruled that this means that giving D.C.
its own statehood (and thus its own authority) would be abrogating this
power which the Constitution assigns to Congress.

- Article IV, Section 3

This section says that new states can only be made out of the areas of
old states with the permission of the legislatures of those states and
Congress. The land for DC came from Maryland, so you would need
Maryland's permission to turn DC into a state, right?

Some argue that you don't, because Maryland already gave it up. They
argue that in Maryland's land use agreement, there were absolutely no
conditions placed on the use of that land.

However, that same land use agreement also says that the land was given
\"pursuant to the tenor and effect of the eighth section of the first
article of the constitution of the government of the United States."
Maryland, therefore, did not give the land to become a new state, but to
house the seat of government *outside* of the control of a state.

- The 23rd Amendment

This one is going to be tough to argue against. It says:

> The District constituting the seat of government of the United States
> shall appoint in such manner as the Congress may direct: A number of
> electors of President and Vice President equal to the whole number of
> Senators and Representatives in Congress to which the District would
> be entitled if it were a State, but in no event more than the least
> populous State\....

It's literally right in the text. It grants DC the number of electors
for President and Vice President to be the number of Congressional
representatives that DC would have ***if it were a state***.

In other words, the Constitution recognizes clearly that DC was never
intended to be a state. It's really tough for Congress to pass a law to
make DC a state when the Constitution refers to it "as if it were a
state."

So yes, at the very minimum, a Constitutional amendment would be
required to make DC a state.
