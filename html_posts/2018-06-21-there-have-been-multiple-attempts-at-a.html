**There have been multiple attempts at a \"good\" immigration policy. In
the end there is always outrage (some times more than others).
Crowdsourcing here... what would make an actual good immigration policy
that is both fair and compassionate?**

To be honest
[[Ollie](https://www.quora.com/profile/Ollie-Townsend-III)]{.qlink_container},
you don't want what's fair. Because what's fair has to be fair for
everyone. "Fair and compassionate" do not make great immigration
policies. They make great "open border" policies, and that's the exact
opposite of an immigration policy. A good immigration policy is
inherently "unfair" because not everyone gets to come in. That is the
textbook definition of "unfair."

"Fairness" really means being fair to the immigrant, **and** being fair
to the American citizens, either born or naturalized. You have to
balance both of their needs.

To that end, a good comprehensive immigration policy would include
**all** of the following:

- **Get rid of multiculturalism.** This is another sham of a program
  foisted upon the American people by Progressives, and it is ruining
  this country, creating more division instead of more unity. We must
  re-establish the fact that the United States is a *sovereign nation*,
  we have a *national identity*, and we have our own view of how to live
  in the world, different from that of other countries, ***and that's
  not a bad thing!*** We need to return to the "Great American Melting
  Pot" concept of naturalization. Require immigrants to learn English.
  Require immigrants to pass a basic primary school US history test.
  Require immigrants to swear allegiance to the United States and its
  Constitution. In case you're unsure of what the "Great American
  Melting Pot" is, those from my generation learned a lot about the
  country from *Schoolhouse Rock*. Heck, I memorized the Preamble to the
  Constitution solely from Schoolhouse Rock. Anyway, here's "The Great
  American Melting Pot:"

- **Fix the immigration system**. If it takes decades to become a
  citizen, people are going to look to other means to enter the country.
  We must reduce the amount of time it takes to complete the immigration
  process. Part of this is communication with other countries, and their
  willingness to hand over information about their citizens who want to
  emigrate. If they don't do it within certain timeframes, we should be
  cutting off immigration from that country, plain and simple. Let
  immigrants argue with their host countries about sending information
  faster. But one way or another, we must shorten the amount of time it
  takes to become a citizen.
- **Fix the border**. We must do everything we can to eliminate illegal
  immigration. This includes preventing illegal aliens crossing into the
  country across the southern border.
- **Keep better track of visa holders.** The other big source of illegal
  immigrants is people who overstay their visas. We need to do a better
  job of integrating those systems which track visa holders with our law
  enforcement systems and other systems so that we can catch them
  quicker and repatriate them appropriately.
- **End birthright citizenship**. The practice of birthright citizenship
  is not part of the Constitution; it was established by law. This
  should be overturned. You should only become a born citizen if you are
  born to citizens. Being born to illegal aliens in-country should not
  entitle you to automatic citizenship.
- **End businesses hiring illegals.** If the system to track illegals is
  broken, fix it. We should be able to identify whether or not a person
  is legally in this country. This takes the incentive away from someone
  wanting to illegally stay in this country and being able to find work.
  If you're an employer and you're paying an illegal under the table, we
  shut down your business, period. Come down hard on employers hiring
  illegals.
- And on that note, **END SANCTUARY CITIES.** Anyone at any level of
  government harboring known illegals should be dealt with harshly. I
  have no problem withholding Federal funding for cities which refuse to
  follow the law. This is yet another incentive for illegals to come
  into the country: a great place to stay where they know they won't be
  deported. It's like another country inside of the US. This practice
  must end, and it must end quickly.
