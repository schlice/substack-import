Ah yes, another Levitical law question bring asked of Christians who are
no longer under the old laws.

Let\'s see...(thumbing through index of standard answers)...ah, here we
are: Biblical Laws.

The Bible contains three types of laws: ceremonial, civil, and moral.
Let\'s elaborate:

**Moral Laws**. These laws, such as the Ten Commandments, are seen as
reflecting God\'s eternal character and are believed to be binding on
all people, including Christians.

**Ceremonial Laws**. These laws dealt with religious practices like
sacrifices, purifications, and the observance of holy days within the
Old Testament covenant. They are understood to have pointed to Christ
and were fulfilled by his death and resurrection. Therefore, these laws
are not binding on Christians.

**Civil Laws**. These laws were specific to the nation of Israel and
dealt with matters like social order, criminal justice, and property
rights. They are considered to be temporary and not binding on
Christians, if they were specifically related to the functioning of the
nation of Israel, since God was creating a nation out of a group of
people who were multi-generational slaves and did not know how to govern
themselves.

The laws about clothing were intended to separate the nation of Israel
from all of the other nations, causing Israel to be set apart among the
nations. Dictating customs of dress was one way that God separated the
Israelites from the other nations around them. This is yet another
example of laws which only applied to the Israelites of the day, and do
not apply to Christians in the modern day.

That doesn\'t mean that the laws are not descriptive of the time in
which they were written. But just because they were *descriptive* does
not mean that they are *prescriptive*. Something can exist in the Bible
without it relating directly to us.
