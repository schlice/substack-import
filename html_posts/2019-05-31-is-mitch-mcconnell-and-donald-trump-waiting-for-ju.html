**Is Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump waiting for Jutices Ruth Ginsburg
and Stephen Breyer to die so they can be replaced by Conservative
judges? They should be reminded that they themselves are not young
anymore and be careful what they wish for.**

Of course they are!

That is, they are indeed ***waiting*** for RBG or Breyer to die or
retire so they can replace them with Conservative judges. I'd even go so
far as to say that they ***hope that another vacancy happens during
Trump's term with a Republican Senate.***

But we should draw the distinction at wishing for an opening, and
***wishing for someone to die***.

I'm relatively sure that neither Trump nor McConnell is actively wishing
for anyone to die.

They're hoping that another opening on the court turns up, but no one is
hoping for anyone to die.
