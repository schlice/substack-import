**If Kavanaugh is confirmed, does the American public have any legal
course of action to have Kavanaugh removed?**

1.  Federal judges as well as Supreme Court judges are subject to
    impeachment. The Constitution grants the House the power to impeach
    \"The President, the Vice President, and all civil Officers of the
    United States.\" Federal court judges and Supreme Court justices are
    agreed to be civil Officers of the United States, and are subject to
    impeachment. The process for impeachment is the same for a Supreme
    Court justice as it is for the President: the House of
    Representatives must pass Articles of Impeachment, and the Senate
    must have a trial to vote to remove that person from office.
2.  A Supreme Court justice is not the President and so is subject to
    criminal indictment. If evidence exists of a crime which a Supreme
    Court justice is alleged to have committed, that justice can be
    indicted, which would probably lead back to #1 (impeachment). Dr.
    Ford can go to Maryland and file charges of sexual assault against
    Kavanaugh if she chooses; there is no statute of limitations on
    sexual assault in Maryland.

However, you asked the question about the "public" having any recourse
to having him removed, and the answer to that is **no**. The President
appointed him, and if he is confirmed, he will have been appointed with
the "advice and consent" of the Senate, in accordance with the
Constitution. The Constitution provides no injunctive relief for a
SCOTUS justice you don't like.

In order for "the public" to have some recourse to remove a SCOTUS
justice from the bench, you'd have to amend the Constitution.

The whole point of lifetime appointments is to avoid politics and the
political cycle influencing the court and its opinions. Allowing people
to remove SCOTUS justices undoes that idea.
