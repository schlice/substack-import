**How are police body cameras not full of inane, unremarkable footage of
the officer idly driving, sitting around, eating, using the restroom,
etc.?**

Because in most departments, officers have the ability to stop and start
recordings.

On the most common Body-Worn Camera (BWC) system in use today, the unit
continually caches 30 seconds of video when the camera is not actively
recording. Once the officer presses the record button (or moves the
record switch), the 30 second cache is "pre-pended" to the video. The
cache has no audio, it's just 30 seconds of video. Then after 30 seconds
of silence, the moment the officer pushed the button arrives, and the
audio starts.

If the department is an "always-on" department, then all of the video is
recorded. The officer can push the "record" button which actually
inserts a marker at that point in the video. Later on, when the video
has been loaded into the department servers, the video tech can jump to
the mark to see a recorded incident. A great deal of useless video gets
discarded after the amount of time the department has designated for
non-evidentiary video.

The reason why it is different between departments is cost. It costs
money to store all of that video on servers. The actual act of storing
the video does not cost money, but the storage arrays on which the video
is loaded do cost money, and the maintenance of that video and the
systems on which it is stored is not cheap, and requires full time video
techs in the department to manage it (since most departments opt not to
store that video off-site). So the limiting factor is the storage system
on which the video is to be stored, how much space it has, and how much
video is to be kept for how long.
