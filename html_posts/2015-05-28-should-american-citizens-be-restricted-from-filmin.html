**Content:** [The idea behind the bill is to prevent people from
interfering with police officers while recording and to set standards
that prevent confrontations between police and people recording cops
doing their jobs.\
\
It\'s not intended to protect any police privacy. Police have no more
privacy when they are doing their jobs as anyone else on the street.\
\
It\'s not intended to prevent people from filming police officers.
Nothing should ever prevent that.\
\
The whole idea behind the bill is to codify a safe distance at which you
can film a police officer while he is in the course of doing his job. 25
feet is about a car length-and-a-half away. As [[Cliff
G.](https://www.quora.com/profile/Cliff-G-13)]{.qlink_container} notes,
the law likes objective standards like \"25 feet away\" better than
subjective standards like \"interfering with the execution of his
duties\" which can be interpreted differently by different people. You
can still get an effective video from 25 feet and be sure to not be in
the way of an officer. If you\'re 25 feet away, there can be no doubt
that you are doing nothing more than recording and you are not trying to
interfere with the officer doing his job.]{.rendered_qtext}
