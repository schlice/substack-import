Because a "sophisticated being created in the very image of God" also
has free will.

Additionally, temptation is not a sin. Even Jesus was tempted, and He
lived a sinless life.

The serpent *deceived* Eve by tempting her. It's a common tactic used by
Satan all the time.

But while *temptation* is normal and expected, *acting on temptation* is
abnormal and unexpected (when that temptation leads us to sin).

Eve sinned because she was na√Øve. She believed that the promise of
knowledge was better than believing God's promises.
