Faith and belief are related. You need some level of faith to reach
belief, because none of the things we believe in religion can be
positively identified by science. So instead, we deal in logic,
probability, and rationality. Therefore, we have a certain set of facts,
which only takes us so far because there is still a gap between
observable fact, and belief. It is faith which fills that gap.

So can you believe in God without having faith in God? The question
becomes: *why* do you believe in God? What exactly do you believe in?
You probably believe in the observable facts that our universe had a
beginning, and thus had a beginner. So you know, intuitively, that God
exists. So you do believe in God.

But you don't have *faith* in God? You don't have faith in *what* about
God? Do you think he won't keep his promises? He hasn't failed us so
far. What makes you believe he won't continue to keep his promises?

It's really challenging to believe in God, which requires faith, and
then state that you don't have faith in God.
