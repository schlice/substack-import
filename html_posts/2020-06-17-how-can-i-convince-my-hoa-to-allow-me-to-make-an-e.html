**How can I convince my HOA to allow me to make an extension to my
residence driveway to accommodate for a wheelchair for my wife? They
denied my request.**

Let them know that Federal law already allows you to extend your
driveway to make it accessible for a wheelchair and an HOA rule
preventing this is in violation of Federal law. You were simply advising
the HOA that you were making these changes, not seeking their approval.

Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, Title II of the Americans
with Disabilities Act, and the Architectural Barriers Act all mandate
accessibility standards for those in wheelchairs. Local ordinances
(including HOA architectural rules) cannot limit what Federal law
allows. They can make it *more* accessible, not *less.*

That said, there are some changes they *can* mandate. For example, they
can tell you that if you have two entrances to your house (a garage
entrance and a front entrance) you have to put the ramp on the garage
entrance. That would be a restriction they can make since you have two
front-of-house entrances.

Unless they can show that your driveway is already accessible enough for
a wheelchair, they can't deny your change. If your driveway, for
example, is wide enough for two cars, they can deny your request and say
that your driveway is already wide enough to accommodate one car and a
wheelchair load/unload zone; you don't have to be accommodated in order
to fit two cars side by side as well as loading/unloading space for a
chair.

However if you only have a single-car driveway, you can extend it to add
a loading/unloading pad for the wheelchair.

Hope this helps.
