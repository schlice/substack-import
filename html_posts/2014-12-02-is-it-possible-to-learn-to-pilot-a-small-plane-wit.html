**Content:** [You may be able to learn some of the visual cues using
flight simulator software, but without a force-feedback yoke you\'ll be
missing out on absolutely all of the feeling that the controls provide
when you fly.\
\
And you\'ll also miss out on all the \"seat of your pants\" flying that
only real flight can provide. Once you start flying into thermals and
the plane starts reacting in ways that the software doesn\'t teach you,
you\'ll understand that you can only gain that experience actually in a
seat in an airplane.]{.rendered_qtext}
