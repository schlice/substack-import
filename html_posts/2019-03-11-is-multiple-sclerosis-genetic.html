**Is multiple sclerosis genetic?**

Not 100% genetic, but there is a genetic component to it.

Statistics show that the chance of the average person in the United
States developing MS is about 1 in 750. But close (first-degree)
relatives of people with MS, such as children, siblings or non-identical
twins, have a higher chance, anywhere from one in 100 to one in 40.
It\'s not all genetic, though, and you can see this through the
\"identical twin\" example. If one identical twin has MS, the other twin
(who has the identical gene structure as the twin) has only a 1 in 4
chance of developing MS. If it were all genetic, the unaffected twin
would have a 100% chance of developing MS instead of the 25% chance they
exhibit today.
