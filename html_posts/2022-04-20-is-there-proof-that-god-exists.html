Of course there is. Ample evidence of God's existence is available to
anyone *willing to believe.* **** But God has left just enough ambiguity
so as to not compel the *unwilling*.

This is for a very important reason: God has given you *free will*.
You're not really acting under your free will if God compels you to
believe. This, by the way, is why God might not reveal himself as
overtly as some might like. I read a Quoran say that he wants God to
just please write on the clouds, "I exist, ffs". But God's not going to
do that.
