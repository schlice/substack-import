**Content:** [The legality or illegality of police actions in any case
is not a matter of \"letter of the law\" with a bright-line definition.
This is a point of fact to be determined by a jury. It is up to the
police to determine if the suspect is threatening, or if the suspect is
a danger to himself or others.\
\
If the suspect refuses to drop his weapon, he is already a threat
because he is refusing to follow orders. Police likely already have him
at gunpoint, so the situation is tense. Any false moves by someone
brandishing a weapon could result in that person being shot by police.
The officer simply needs to believe tha the suspect is raising the
weapon towards them, and they will fire. This would be, generally,
legal. But again, this is a point of fact to be determined by a jury, if
an investigation was warranted and charges were filed. In this case,
it\'s highly unlikely that charges would be filed, as the non-compliant
suspect was wielding a firearm and pointed it at a cop. That\'s the best
way to get yourself dead. Don\'t listen to the cops, and then point a
gun at them.]{.rendered_qtext}
