We already have it, it\'s called an
[[*inquest*](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=805146&url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inquest){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}. It\'s handled by a
coroner. And it shouldn\'t be judicial. Most inquests are
quasi-judicial, or non-judicial. But their outcomes function much as the
outcome of a grand jury in some areas of the country, while others are
more judicial, making the accused liable for arrest.

In some jurisdictions, an inquest can be called by a formal request by
the public. We should expand the use of the inquest in cases where there
is great public interest in the actual cause of death.

Your assertion that the grand jury system is broken is also an
indication of public distrust of anything that is not done in full
public view, even though the Supreme Court has already validated, on
several occasions, the validity of the privacy of a grand jury.
