Now that *Dobbs* has been repealed and the Supreme Court has determined
that abortion is not a Constitutional right and is not under federal
control, there is little that Trump could do to restrict abortion,
despite the fact that he said he is uninterested in doing anything more
than giving states control over their own abortion policy. I think we're
pretty safe in assuming that no further abortion restrictions will be
forthcoming from the federal government.

But let's assume he was lying, and he really wants to invoke a 100%
abortion ban. *How could he do it?*

- He could try to convince a Republican-led Congress to pass a national
  abortion ban, although such a ban, being deeply unpopular, probably
  would not pass. Members of Congress are still beholden to the people
  who elected them, and those people don't want to see a full national
  ban.
- He could try to have the Attorney General enforce the *Comstock Act*
  against mail-order abortifacients, which currently make up around 50%
  of all abortions.
- Finally, he could encourage Congress to pass a Constitutional
  amendment enshrining "fetal personhood," which would give legal
  protections to fetuses in the womb.

He can't do any of these on his own; he would need assistance from
people who also believe that abortion should be restricted for everyone.
And none of this really speaks to whether any of these methods are
*legal* or would survive any legal challenges.
