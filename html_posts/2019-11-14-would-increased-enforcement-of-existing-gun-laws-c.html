**Would increased enforcement of existing gun laws create reductions in
US gun crimes?**

Yes, in general. But while *Project Guardian,* the program proposed by
the Attorney General, is functionally workable, it is not necessarily
the "right" way to go about it.

First, let's provide a little background. When a person is charged with
a gun crime, it is usually in conjunction with another crime (i.e. drug
trafficking, robbery, etc). Prosecutors will *very frequently* plea
bargain the gun charge away in exchange for cooperation on the main
charge. And criminals know this. They will often agree to increased
cooperation in exchange for dropping the gun charge.

So when we talk about "enforcing existing gun laws," this is
specifically what we mean.

We also know that while criminals may be misguided and often have moral
failings which prevent them from fully appreciating the harms they
cause, they are often not stupid. If they knew that they'd go to jail
for a minimum of five years **mandatory** just for doing the crime *with
a gun*, they'd seriously think twice about doing the crime with a gun.

Project Guardian is one of [[a number of Federal
programs](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=7b09bb&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_violence_in_the_United_States%23Gun_buyback_programs){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"

qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container} over the years which
encouraged cooperation between Federal, State and local law enforcement
to bring Federal gun charges against criminals who use guns in the
commission of violent crime.

From the quoted article:

> As part of the program, U.S. prosecutors will coordinate with state
> and local law enforcement officials to consider potential federal

We know this works. [[Project
Exile](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=d23bb1&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Exile){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container} proved that this strategy
of Federal gun charges and working with state and local officials to
bring those Federal charges works. Richmond (where Project Exile was
tested) saw some of the largest decreases in gun crime ever:

> During the first year of Project Exile (1998), homicides in Richmond
> declined 33%, for the lowest number since 1987, and armed robberies
> declined 30%. In 1999, homicides declined another 21%.
>
> By 2007, homicides in Richmond were down to 57 compared to 122 in the
> year before Project Exile[\[1\]](#qBHuQ){#cite-qBHuQ .citation_link}

While it is true that violent crime was declining in the United States
during that same time period, Richmond's decline was so sharp and so
sustained that it is generally presumed to be a result of Project Exile.

Ideally, states should be enacting rules similar to what the Feds are
doing: mandatory sentencing, no plea bargaining of gun charges,
mandatory charging of a gun crime when a gun was used to commit a crime,
etc. These should be implemented by all of the states individually.
Until that eventuality comes to pass, however, this program will have to
do. And it's a great start and a good way to get the states acting in
the right direction as well.
