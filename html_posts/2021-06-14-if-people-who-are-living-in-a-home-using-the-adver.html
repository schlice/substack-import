Side-step the entire process and file for eviction.

So long as adverse possession hasn't kicked in yet (as [[Cliff
G.](https://www.quora.com/profile/Cliff-G-13)]{.qlink_container}
mentioned, it takes upwards of 7 years, and you indicated that someone
is living in the house for only around 2 years), you or your fiancee are
still on the deed, so you can begin eviction procedures.

(EDIT) You commented on Cliff's answer and said something about Phoenix,
so I'll presume you are in Arizona. Arizona has one of the shortest
adverse possession claims periods, requiring the adverse possessor to
continuously possess the property for two years before they can make a
right of possession adverse possession claim.

Also, while you have a cause of action for trespass, the statute of
limitations for trespass is also two years.

You must act quickly or adverse possession may kick in, and they may be
able to file for right of possession by adverse possession.

If you lose your adverse possession claim, investigate the money order
fraud. If they fraudulently paid a government agency using fraudulently
obtained money orders through misrepresentation, contact the police and
investigate that. It's a long shot, but perhaps the tax payments can be
invalidated along with the adverse possession.

While I understand your issues, if possession has been continuous by the
adverse possessor for two years or more, you may still be able to regain
possession of the property before they file for right of possession, but
you must seek the advice of an attorney. Contact the state bar
association to help you find an attorney who will help you. You can also

yet.
