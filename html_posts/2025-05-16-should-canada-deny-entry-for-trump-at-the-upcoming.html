They are well within their rights to do so, but it certainly wouldn't be
a *wise* thing for them to do.

Yes, he is *technically* a convicted felon. But at the same time, the
United States places no restriction on the ability to occupy the Office
of the President based on felony conviction status.

So Canada, legally, under their standard immigration law, could deny
President Trump entry into their country because of his felony status.

But *should they*? It's against their own best interest to do so.

TL;DR: ***Can*** they? Yes. ***Should*** they? No.
