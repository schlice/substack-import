The problem we're having is one of ***perspective.*** Basically, we're
discussing things that police "unlawfully" do at the scene, but we're
using the wrong perspective. The reason is that *we cannot determine the
lawfulness of an action at the scene*.

**While a cop is performing his duty, everything he says is a lawful
order until a court proves that it is not.** Only a court can determine
whether or not a police officer's actions are lawful. You can't. I
can't. Even a lawyer at the scene can't. So up to that point, you have
no choice but to presume that the officer is acting lawfully. Why must
you do this? Because presuming anything else may lead you to actively
resist complying with the officer's directives. Resisting a police
officer because you believe what they are doing is unlawful will only
get you more "attention" from the police (or worse) because you're
resisting. At the scene, the officer is in charge. Let them do what they
do. Then talk to your lawyer and let the system figure out if what the
police did was actually lawful or not.

They can confiscate your phone, but they can't force you to unlock it.
You'll get it back eventually. You've seen how difficult it is for the
police to get into a locked phone. They need a warrant, which means they
need real evidence to show that there is evidence of a crime on that
phone. This does not happen to "innocent" people.

They can confiscate your camera, but did they "unlawfully confiscate
your camera?" We don't know. It's up to a court to decide, not you.

They can arrest you, and then the court gets to determine whether or not
that arrest was unlawful. Police don't "unlawfully arrest the innocent."
Police make an arrest based on the best evidence they have at the time,
and the court makes a determination whether or not that arrest was
lawful.
