I'd do what I was told to avoid being *summarily shot*. One of the perks
of martial law: no habeas corpus.

Some of the things that will probably happen if martial law is enacted
in the United States:

- The suspension of the Constitution, probably starting with the first
  and second amendments.
- Confiscation of firearms; it has happened and it will happen again.
- Suspension of habeas corpus: imprisonment without due process and
  without a trail.
- Travel restrictions, including road closures and possibly even
  quarantine zones.
- Mandatory curfews and mandatory identification.
- Automatic search and seizure without
  warrant.[\[1\]](#fiPrW){#cite-fiPrW .citation_link}
