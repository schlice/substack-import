**Content:** [Whether or not the officer was justified in beating you is
a matter of fact to be determined by a court. The officer would have to
show you were resisting arrest, and all attempts to get you to comply
were failing. Whether or not you were legally justified in fighting back
is also a matter of fact that is to be determined in a court.
Self-defense is an affirmative defense under the law to the charge of
assault.\
\
As a matter of *law*, there are no laws that I know of that allow you to
legally assault a police officer, regardless of the reason. In fact,
assaulting a police officer is usually considered *aggravated* assault.\
\
What this means is that you can attempt to defend yourself if you
believe you are complying with the officer\'s directions and the officer
will not stop. Be aware of a few things, though:\
]{.rendered_qtext}

1.  If the officer sees your attempt at self-defense as continued
    resistance to arrest, your actions will only cause him to continue
    attempting to cause you to no longer resist. In other words, if he
    was beating you, seeing you attempt to defend yourself will probably
    just make him keep going.
2.  Then, after you\'re done being beaten, you will be arrested and
    charged with whatever you were going to be originally charged with,
    *and* you will also be charged with aggravated assault. You will not
    only have to defend yourself against the charge of whatever it was
    that the officer was arresting you for in the first place, you would
    also have to defend yourself against an aggravated assault charge.

Best bet: cover up in the fetal position until the beating stops. If the
officers try to move you, grab your hands and cuff you, go limp: let
them move you. It\'s not likely you will be beaten while others are
trying to cuff you, as their attempts to beat you would likely intersect
with the officers trying to cuff you, so they\'d be hurting each other.
