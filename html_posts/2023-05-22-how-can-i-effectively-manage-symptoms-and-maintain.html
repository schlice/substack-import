This is exactly why we visit our neurologists regularly. We manage the
disease and maintain a good quality of life.

So what will you and your neurologist do?

- Manage the disease. You'll keep tabs on the disease progress, and make
  sure the disease is progressing as slowly as possible. You'll do this
  by using diagnostic tools like the MRI and neurological exams to check
  the progress of the disease, and you'll control its progress by taking
  one of the approved MS therapy drugs.
- Maintain a good quality of life. Learn what you can and can't do.
  Don't push yourself so hard that you hurt yourself, but exercise as
  you can. Be cautions of overheating, as heat is the enemy of MS.
  Remember: *progress, not perfection.* Give yourself some grace; MS is
  insidious and it tries to keep you from moving. Don't let it win.
