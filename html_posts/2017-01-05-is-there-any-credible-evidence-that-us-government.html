There is as much "credible evidence" that the US government regularly
hacks into Russia as there is that the Russian government hacks into the
US.

But let me reassure you right now. **Yes, we are hacking into Russia.**

Oh, and also, Russia is hacking us.

The Chinese are hacking us.

We are hacking the Chinese.

We are hacking the North Koreans.

The North Koreans are hacking us.

Every country with an intelligence-gathering capability is attempting to
get intelligence from wherever they can, including computer networks.

That said, please don't believe the media spin. Remember, they're trying
to sell airtime/newspapers/etc. Whatever story they can concoct that has
even the slightest bit of truth to it, no matter how much they must
embellish that truth, will be written.

In this case, it's all second-hand, third-hand accounts that even
acknowledge that the Russian government had no involvement with the
actual hack. Who is "Russia?" Russia's a pretty big place, you know. Is
it the Kremlin? Is it the KGB? Is it the GRU? Is it a Russian civilian
hacker group? Just saying "Russia" doesn't mean that the Kremlin
directed it, or that Putin had any knowledge of it, or that he even
sanctioned it.

Second, what does "hacked the election" mean? Did they tamper with
voting machines? That's been checked and found to be inaccurate. Did
they engage in voter suppression through hacks? Nope, no evidence of
voter suppression has even been attempted to be shown, and voter
suppression through the Internet is a tough thing to do. So what are
they purported to have done? Apparently, they hacked the DNC and
released the emails to Wikileaks.

And to that I say, **so what?**

Because if Edward Snowden can "hack" the military (which essentially he
did by taking information which he did not have the rights to --- hacks
don't have to be computerized, mind you) and release them to Wikileaks
and be heralded as some sort of cult hero, then Russia (even if they
did) can do the same thing to a private organization (not the
government) and release those to Wikileaks and suddenly they're
demonized for it? It's all very Machiavellian, if you ask me. Which you
did.

And how is this any different from the DNC hacking the election? Because
it has been shown that they did this as well! Remember how they
intentionally made it so that Bernie Sanders had no chance of winning
the primary? This is ***direct election tampering*** (because they are
actually interfering directly in the election process), not Russia
releasing emails from a private organization to another private
organization. It's all the same, and if one's okay, then so is the
other.

Either denounce them all, or denounce none. One or the other.
