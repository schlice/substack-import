***BE AWARE, we are talking about letting police into the COMMON AREA,
not into any one INDIVIDUAL APARTMENT. This is an immensely important
legal distinction.***

\

Legally, the gates of a gated complex define the area managed by the
Homeowner's Association, or the boundaries of area controlled by the
owners of an apartment complex.

**Your legal rights begin at your apartment door, not the complex
gates.**

There are virtually zero legal ramifications of letting an *on-duty
police officer* into the gated area of your complex.

Now, letting them into an *actual apartment* has a whole other set of
issues that could present themselves, especially if it's not your
apartment.

But if you're legally allowed to be in that gated area (and you are
because you rent an apartment), you have the legal authority to let a
police officer into that same common area. If you may admit a guest into
that area. you may admit a police officer.

The only time I could see any sort of issue is if there is a paid
security guard who is supposed to control access and he or she is not
there, but even then, if you can let friends and family into the gated
area, there should be no problem letting police in either.

If you're really worried, call 911. Ask them if any officers have been
dispatched to your apartment complex, because there's some "shady
looking cops asking to gain entrance" into the gated area of your
complex. If they tell you yes, you *must* let them in, or you could be
charged with obstruction of justice.

Original question:

**A couple of cops asked me if I can let them into the gated community
of my apartment complex where I\'m renting an apartment because an
\"alarm went off\". Should I let them in? What\'s the best thing to do
in this situation?**
