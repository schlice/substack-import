**Content:** [Health insurance, as an industry, will become a thing of
the past. People employed with the health insurance industry will have
to find more meaningful employment in some other industry. Perhaps they
could remain in insurance, but move to other companies like Allstate
that provide other types of insurance like home or auto.\
\
Part of the reason that this has not yet happened in the US is because
health insurance is big business, and health insurance lobbies in
Congress are very powerful. They understand that single payer will kill
their industry.]{.rendered_qtext}
