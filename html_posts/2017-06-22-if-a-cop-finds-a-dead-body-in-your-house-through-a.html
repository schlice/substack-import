So I'm curious how, in your hypothetical situation, the officer came to
be inside your house.

Did the officer break in? Did he hold you at gunpoint?

Or did he knock on the door and you let him in?

The difference is important.

If you let the officer in, and he sees the dead body on the floor (i.e.
he doesn't have to touch anything or move anything in order to see the
body), it is covered under the *plain sight* doctrine. Anything that is
in plain sight when the entry was legal is admissible.

Now, if the officer forced his way into your house, there would be only
one circumstance under which the dead body would be admissible: the
forced entry was under *exigent circumstances*. This means that, through
evidence (hearing screams or cries for help) or prior knowledge, the
officer reasonably believes that a person's life is in imminent danger,
or someone is injured and requires assistance. That belief must be
reasonable in order for the exigency to be valid. If the officer enters
under exigent circumstances and sees the dead body, it would also be
admissible.

Any other warrantless search that found the body would render the
evidence inadmissible, under the *fruit of the poisonous tree* doctrine.
This says that if the initial entry was unlawful, any evidence
discovered during the unlawful entry would be inadmissible. The only
possible counter to this would be the doctrine of *inevitable
discovery*, which says that because of another investigation or
preponderance of evidence that the police legally acquired unrelated to
the unlawful entry, the discovery of the body was going to happen
anyway.
