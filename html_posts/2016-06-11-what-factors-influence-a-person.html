Let me answer your second question first: *Does the military even
suggest one branch over the other based on a recruits personality,
skills or background?*

No, they do not. What branch you choose is entirely up to you.

This is what our recruiting office area looks like here in town. I'm not
sure if you can see the doors, but there is an office for each service,
plus the Air Force Reserve. Which door you walk into is entirely up to
you. Each service has its ups and downs, so depending on what you're
looking for in a military career will determine which door you enter.

Many times, which branch you enter is based on which branch your
relatives were in. Generally, experiences of relatives will strongly
influence or dissuade decisions about entering any particular branch.

Some people have preconceived notions about each branch, what they do,
how much they value their people, and the sorts of jobs and experiences
you may have in that particular service. Those sorts of ideas about what
each service does, and what you might like (or more appropriately, not
like) to do weigh heavily on decisions about which service to join. Each
service has a "culture" that is a good fit for some, and clashes with
others. Finding the culture you like and the one that suits you the
best, are also big motivating factors.

Most folks do like to pick their careers before they start; some people
simply walk into the recruiting office and say they'll do whatever the
service needs them to do. Recruiters love those people, by the way, but
they are the exception rather than the rule these days. Some services
are more flexible in terms of allowing you to pick your own career field
than others; for example, the Army and the Navy are far more flexible in
terms of allowing you to pick your own career field than the Air Force
or the Marine Corps.

The Air Force is the youngest service in the bunch. It's coming up on
its 75th anniversary, where the other services have been around no fewer
than 150 years apiece. This is sometimes a motivating factor, as the Air
Force is less encumbered by "tradition" and "the way things have always
been done" as some of the older services. The Air Force is also unique,
in that if you're enlisting in the Air Force, you may be a part of a
flight crew, but you won't be flying the plane. Only Air Force officers
fly planes. So the one service that is centered on missions off the
ground doesn't let enlisted personnel actually fly planes. Sometimes,
that's a dichotomy which is too much to wrap your brain around. Too bad,
because the jobs the enlisted force does in the Air Force are not only
sorely needed, they are highly technical and vital to accomplishing the
mission. Being the "stick actuator" is not always the job to have.
Besides, of the entire officer corps, only around 13% of them actually
fly planes. So even among officers, there are very few actual flying
jobs. Their scarcity makes them coveted, but UAVs are changing that
somewhat. Some people who were formerly not pilot qualified can now fly
UAVs.

The decision about which service to join may also hinge on ASVAB scores.
Each service has a low threshold below which you will not be accepted
into that service. Based on the technicality of the jobs in that
service, the Air Force has historically demanded the highest ASVAB
scores, followed closely by the Navy, and then the Marine Corps, and the
Army traditionally has accepted the lowest ASVAB scores. This "natural
selection" has also influenced the "types" of people who end up in each
service; this is where the perception that people who are just slightly
smarter than a bag of rocks end up in the Army. Note that this is just a
perception; the Army has some extremely talented and motivated
individuals, but the bottom of the ASVAB score range typically fuels
those negative perceptions about each service.

Ultimately, the decision about which service to join is a very personal
one. The service has to be the right "fit" for the person, and different
personality types and personal motivations will find homes in different
services.
