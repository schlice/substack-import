Hate crimes are stupid.

Attacking someone is already illegal, and yes, attacking someone is bad.

But now if you attack someone *and you had certain thoughts in your head
at the time*, somehow it's ***extra bad?***

So we're the thought police now? We've literally criminalized certain
thoughts.

How foolish as a society are we?
