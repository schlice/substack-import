**President Trump is threatening to cut federal funding to several
cities where BLM demonstrations are happening. Can he legally do this?**

No. He knows this. But many in his base don't, so if it gets him brownie
points with them, he'll say it anyway. He cannot "cut funding" to
existing Federal programs because something unrelated happened.

However, he ***can*** offer Federal grant money to states which behave
the way he wants. In other words, he can offer Federal grant program
money to states which crack down on violence erupting from protests. And
if a state does nothing to stop violence from protests, that grant money
would be unavailable to that state.

But can he "cut federal funding" to states which don't act the way he
wants? No, he can't do that. Plenty of court decisions have already
affirmed this.
