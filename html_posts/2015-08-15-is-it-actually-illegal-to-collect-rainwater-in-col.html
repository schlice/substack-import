**Content:** [It is.\
\
Unless you have a well.\
\
In that case, the law says that you can collect your own rainwater,
because you were going to pump it from the ground anyway.\
\
If you run off of a city water system, it is technically illegal to
collect rainwater yourself. I don\'t suspect someone is going to come
searching your backyard for water tanks, though.]{.rendered_qtext}
