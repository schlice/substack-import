In 2008. there were roughly 800,000 sworn peace officers in the United
States.[\[1\]](#UimgO){#cite-UimgO .citation_link} That same year, there
were 140 officers who died in the line of duty, of all causes. This
computes out to 17.5 deaths per 100,000 officers

This means that your risk of dying, that year, was 0.0175%.

Compare this to other occupations:

You can see where that 17.5 lies on the chart, under "police and
sheriff's patrol officers." Also note that in any given year, almost
half of the line of duty deaths were caused by car accidents, either
while the officer was driving, or while the officer was at the side of
the road outside of his/her vehicle.
