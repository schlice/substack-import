Normally, 18650 batteries do not contain internal overcharge or thermal
protection. It's up to the device in which it is being used to provide
that protection. Devices which can charge those batteries will generally
include some form of overcharge cutoff, and devices which draw on those
batteries can sometimes include a thermal switch. In the vaping world,
you would find these protections in "regulated" mods.

This is why mods which are "unregulated" can be dangerous. That lack of
regulation means that it comes down to the resistance in the build which
determines how much power is drawn from the battery. Appropriate
resistance will not draw more amperage than the battery can handle, but
this requires regularly testing the voltage produced by the mod and the
resistance in the build.
