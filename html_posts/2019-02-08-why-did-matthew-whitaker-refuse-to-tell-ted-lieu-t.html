**Why did Matthew Whitaker refuse to tell Ted Lieu that the U.S.
Constitution does not say the Sitting President can not be indicted?**

He's not there as a Constitutional scholar. He's not there to provide
Constitutional insight. That's the Supreme Court's job. Because he is
testifying as the acting head of the Department of Justice, he can only
give answers in accordance with his job. And it's not his job to
pontificate about the Constitution.

He's there as acting head of the Department of Justice. Therefore, he
provided established Department of Justice guidance that it is their
opinion that a sitting president cannot be indicted.
