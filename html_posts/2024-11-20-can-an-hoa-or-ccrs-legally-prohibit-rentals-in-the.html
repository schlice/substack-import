Yes.

HOAs can prevent rentals for a variety of reasons. The neighborhood may
choose to favor long-term residents over temporary residents. They may
also believe that when the owner lives in the house they own, they take
better care of it than someone who does not own the house they live in.
There could be a variety of reasons that an HOA may choose to prohibit
rentals. The bottom line is that yes, the CC&Rs of a HOA-controlled
neighborhood can prohibit rentals.

Normally, what they do these days is prevent *short-term rentals* like
AirBnBs or VRBOs. They may say something like rental contracts must be
for a period of no less than six months. They may even make owners
submit a copy of the rental agreement to the HOA for approval before it
is signed.
