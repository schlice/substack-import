This is a really good question, because everyone who believes in a
religion believes that *all other religions* are wrong. If I'm a
Catholic, I believe that others who are not Catholic are not going to
Heaven. If I am a Muslim, I believe that others who are not Muslim are
not going to Heaven. This is a necessity of most religious belief: the
belief that you are right, and others are wrong.

So if we're simply basing our response to this question on what we
*believe*, then there is no right answer, because **everyone believes
their religion is the right one.**

But is there anything about Christianity that distinguishes it from all
of the other major world religions? That's what we should focus on.

So here's a few things which differentiate Christianity from all other
world religions, and which might make you consider the truth of
Christianity over all the others:

- In Christianity, God is understood to be both *just* and *merciful* at
  the same time. While this paradox seems at an initial reading to be
  insurmountable, the Christian God manages it. Other world religions
  show their god *dismisses* justice in order to show mercy (therefore,
  their gods are not just), but the Christian God does not. Justice
  should demand that you pay a price for your sin, but mercy should
  demand that you do not. How does the Christian God pull this off? He
  uses what we call a *penal substitution*. Someone else pays for your
  sin. **He does**. That's right, God pays for your sin. In no other
  religion in the world do you find God paying the price for your sin.
  God sent his son Jesus to be the blood offering which pays for your
  sin. Jesus took the penalty for your sin, which allows God to admit
  you into Heaven. *By His wounds, we are healed.*
- In other world religions, you must *do something* in order to gain
  access to a higher plane of existence, or into their afterlife. In
  other words, you must *earn* the blessing of that god. Christianity is
  the only world religion in which the something *has already been done
  for you*. Christ died on the cross to atone for your sin. That debt
  has been paid. He died *once*, for *all*. That gift rests at your
  feet. All you need to do is *accept it*. This is where the phrase *You
  were bought at a price* comes from.\
  \
  "Do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit who is
  in you, whom you have received from God? You are not your own; you
  were bought at a price. Therefore glorify God with your body." --- 1
  Cor 6:19--20 NIV\
  \
  In other words, in all other world religions, *you* search for *God*.
  In Christianity, *God* searches for *you*.

These are just a few of the major distinctions between Christianity and
all other world religions. There's a reason we're so different, and that
reason is worth investigating.

So how can we be sure that our religion is the right one? It's the one
that makes the most sense, and it's the one that fits the totality of
the evidence the best.
