**Content:** []{.rendered_qtext}

Article I, Section 5, Paragraph 2 (emphasis mine):

"**Each House may determine the Rules of its Proceedings**, punish its
Members for disorderly Behaviour, and, with the Concurrence of two
thirds, expel a Member."

The Senate Rules allow the Senate Majority Leader to set the calendar
and determine what bills will be brought before it. The Senate decided
this as a group, and since the Senate can set its own rules about how it
will operate, this is patently Constitutional.

If the Senate voted to vest the entirety of their power in the Senate
Majority Leader, including their actual votes (which would have to be a
unanimous vote, as is any Rule suspension or change), then the Senate
Majority Leader could then vote on behalf of the Senate, and that vote
would carry the full weight of the Senate. Yes, this would be
Constitutional, since it does not violate any text of the Constitution.

It would be stupid, and it would never happen, but if it did, it would
be legal and Constitutional.
