**What do you think of William Barr saying that obstruction details will
not be redacted when he releases the Mueller report?**

Despite what the nay-sayers are predicting, Barr has shown, at least up
to this point, that he is going to follow the law when it comes to what
information is being redacted.

Don\'t forget that he is not doing this redaction in a vacuum. He is
working with Mueller\'s team to accomplish it.

And if something is redacted that has no business being redacted, I
fully expect Mueller\'s team to be front and center in calling that out.
I will take as highly suspect any media report which says anything like
"some members of Mueller\'s team mentioned to some other people at a
party that Barr redacted too much" or anything like that. That sort of
crap is bona fide 100% fake news.

But if the redacted report drops and within hours, Mueller is in front
of cameras saying that this version is not what they agreed to, *then*
it\'s time to question Barr\'s ability to fairly execute the law. Not
now.
