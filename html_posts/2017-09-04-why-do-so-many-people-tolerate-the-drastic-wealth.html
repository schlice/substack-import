**Because wealth inequality is a good thing.**

Without it, we wouldn't have most of the nice things we have today.

John Tamny is Director of the Center for Economic Freedom at
FreedomWorks; Political Economy Editor at *Forbes*; Senior Economic
Advisor to Toreador Research & Trading; Author of *Popular Economics;*
senior fellow in economics at Reason Foundation, and editor of
[[RealClearMarkets.com](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=af31e2&url=http://RealClearMarkets.com){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="realclearmarkets.com"}]{.qlink_container} (RCM). Suffice it
to say he knows a thing or two about economics. Listen to him describe
wealth inequality and what it does for everyone:

I bet Tamny makes more than me.

(EDIT) Since Michael Dell is mentioned in the video, I should add that I
work for Dell.
