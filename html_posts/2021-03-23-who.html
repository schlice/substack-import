**Who\'s the liar? Biden, or Democrat Rep Cuellar, Cuellar says migrants
are being released into US without notices to appear in court.
(Cuellar\'s district are border towns filled with hispanics) Someone is
lying, who is it?**

I don't know if you put much stock in the media these days, but this
story was all over the national news.

[[https://www.nbcnews.com/politics\...](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=9c0af7&url=https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/immigration/amid-surge-border-agents-rio-grande-valley-now-releasing-migrants-n1261720){.external_link

Yes, the crisis at the border (caused by Biden) is so bad now, that
migrants are being released into the country without court dates.

So I'm not sure who is lying, but this is what is happeneing.
