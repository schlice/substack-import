The short answer is **yes**, the Condo Association can indeed install
VIDEO cameras in a clubhouse that is used for residents to hold private
parties and other celebrations. Cameras can be installed in all common
areas, for the protection of those areas. Cameras cannot be installed in
any areas in which there is a reasonable expectation of privacy (i.e.
locker rooms, bathrooms, etc).

**Yes**, the Board of Directors can view those recordings. The Board is
the responsible party for protecting the facility.

Whether or not the recordings can include **audio** depends on how the
cameras are being used, and in what state the camera is installed. The
differences we're talking about are the differences between **two-party
consent** states and **one-party consent states**. Rather than go into
that legal distinction, in this case, the way the cameras are being used
means that **no parties to the conversation have consented to audio
recording, so audio cannot be recorded in a clubhouse.** For nearly all
cameras available on the market today which include microphones, they
have the ability to disable that microphone on their recordings. If your
Condo Association is recording audio, this needs to be addressed ASAP,
and that practice must be stopped.

While you don't have to install signage in most cases, it is definitely
advisable for the Board to do so. Not only does it deter unacceptable or
illegal activity, it advises homeowners that they are entering an area
protected by video surveillance, and gains tacit consent to monitoring
by entering the space. Basically, it means that once you agree to enter
the space, you consent to being recorded.

Original question:

Can a condo association install audio /visual cameras in a clubhouse
that is for residents to hold private parties and other celebrations.
And can any of the board members view these recording or are these only
available to Police?
