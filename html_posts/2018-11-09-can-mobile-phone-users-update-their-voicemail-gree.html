**Can mobile phone users update their voicemail greetings without
cellular service?**

If you're talking about updating voicemail greetings from the mobile
device without connectivity to the mobile network, the answer is no.
Voicemail is a remotely-hosted feature, not resident on the mobile
device. It requires connectivity to the mobile network in order to make
changes.

Some carriers allow you to log in to your voicemail from anywhere, not
just from your mobile phone. This means you can use any method to
connect to your voicemail (i.e. a traditional landline), interrupt your
voicemail greeting, enter your PIN, and you can listen to your messages
and manage your settings, including your greeting.
