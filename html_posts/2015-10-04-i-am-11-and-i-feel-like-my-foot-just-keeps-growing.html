heart. She may have been trying to make you feel better at the time.\

However, there isn\'t some magical \"kill switch\" in your body such
that when you first start mensturating, you\'ll stop growing. When you
stop growing, you stop growing. Your menstrual cycle has no impact on
whether or not you stop growing. At 11, you probably still have some
growing left to do before you\'re done.\

This is an average growth chart for females through age 20. As you can
see beyond age 11, you\'re still, on average, growing. Your growth slows
starting at around age 14, and usually ceases completely by age 21.
These are averages, and they are completely unrelated to your menstrual
cycle.
