Of course truth matters! Many of us are ignorant and apathetic about
truth---but not when it comes to money, medicine, or other tangible
items. We care *passionately* about those things. But many people are
ignorant and apathetic about truth in morality and religion (we know
you're not, because you're taking the time to read this answer). Are
they right, or does truth in morality and religion really matter?

It **does** really matter. How do we know? First, even though people may
claim that truth in morality doesn't matter, they don't really believe
that, especially when someone treats *them* immorally. For example, they
might claim that lying isn't wrong, but just watch how morally outraged
they get when you lie to them (especially if it's about their money!).

We often hear that "it's the economy, stupid!" But just think about how
much better the economy would be if everyone told the truth. There would
be no Enrons or Tycos. There would be no scandals or scams. There would
be no burdensome government regulations. Of course the economy is
important, but it's directly affected by morality! Morality undergirds
virtually everything we do. It not only affects us financially, but, in
certain circumstances, it also affects us socially, psychologically,
spiritually, and even physically.

A second reason truth in morality matters is because success in life is
often dependent on the moral choices a person makes. These include
choices regarding sex, marriage, children, drugs, money, business
dealings, and so on. Some choices bring prosperity, others result in
ruin.

Third, all laws legislate morality. The only question is, "Whose
morality will be legislated?" Think about it. Every law declares one
behavior right and its opposite wrong---that's morality. Whose morality
should be legislated on issues such as abortion or euthanasia? These are
issues that directly impact the lives and health of real people. If it's
morally wrong to kill innocent people, shouldn't that truth be
legislated? Likewise, whose morality should be legislated on other
issues of public policy that may affect your life, health, or finances?
The answers we legislate can dramatically affect every citizen's life,
liberty, and pursuit of happiness.

There's no doubt that what we believe to be true about morality directly
impacts lives. Did it matter that the United States Supreme Court (as
reflected in the 1857 *Dred Scott* decision) believed that blacks were
not citizens but the property of their slave owners? Did it matter that
the Nazis believed the Jews were inferior to the Aryan race? Does it
matter today what we think about the moral status of people in other
racial or religious categories? Of course! Truth in morality matters.

What about truth in religion? That truth can impact us even more
profoundly than truth in morality. If the Bible is true, then everyone's
eternal destiny can be read from its pages. On the other hand, if the
Bible is not true, then many Christians are unwittingly wasting a lot of
time, money, and, in some cases, even their lives by preaching
Christianity in hostile territories. Either way, truth in religion
matters.

It also matters if some other religion is true. For example, if the
Qur'an is true, then I'm in just as much eternal trouble as my
non-Christian friends. On the other hand, if the atheists are right,
then we might as well lie, cheat, and steal to get what we want because
this life is all there is, and there are no consequences in eternity.

But forget eternity for a minute. Consider the temporal implications of
religious teachings around the world. In Saudi Arabia, some
schoolchildren are being taught that Jews are pigs and that non-Muslims
(infidels) should be killed (while, thankfully, a majority of Muslims do
not believe that non-Muslims should be killed, militant Muslims teach
that type of Jihad straight from the Qur'an). Is it really true that
there's a God up there by the name of Allah who wants Muslims to kill
all non-Muslims (which probably includes you)? Does this religious
"truth" matter? It does when those kids grow up to fly planes into
buildings and blow themselves up in populated areas. Wouldn't it be
better to teach them the religious truth that God wants them to love
their neighbor?

The Saudis may be teaching that Jews are pigs, but in our country, by
means of a one-sided biology curriculum, we teach kids today that
there's really no difference between any human being and a pig. After
all, if we're merely the product of blind naturalistic forces---if no
deity created us with any special significance---then we are nothing
more than pigs with big brains. Does this religious (atheistic) "truth"
matter? It does when kids carry out its implications. Instead of good
citizens who see people made in the image of God, we are producing
criminals who see no meaning or value in human life. Ideas have
consequences.

On the flip side, Mother Teresa helped improve conditions in India by
challenging the religious beliefs of many in the Hindu culture. The
Hindu belief in karma and reincarnation leads many Hindus to ignore the
cries of the suffering. Why? Because they believe that those who suffer
deserve their plight for doing something wrong in a previous life. So,
if you help suffering people, you are interfering with their karma.
Mother Teresa taught Hindus in India the Christian principles of caring
for the poor and suffering. Does that religious idea matter? Ask the
millions whose lives she touched. Does the religious teaching of karma
matter? Ask the millions still suffering.

The bottom line is this: regardless of what the real truth is concerning
religion and morality, our lives are greatly affected by it today and
perhaps even in eternity. Those who cavalierly say, "So what? Who cares
about truth in morality and religion?" are ignoring reality and are
blindly skating on thin ice. We owe it to ourselves and others to find
the real truth, and then act on it.

So of course the real truth matters to Christians. We literally stake
our eternity on it.
