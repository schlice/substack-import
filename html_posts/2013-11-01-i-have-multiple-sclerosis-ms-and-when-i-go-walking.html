**Content:** [I don\'t let my mind wander. It\'s too little to be out on
its own.\
\
Anyway, when I am walking, I thank God that He has given me one more day
of free mobility. I park in the far away parking spaces and walk \--
because I can. I go on walks with my wife because she still kinda likes
me and puts up with my crap. I try not to think about the day when I
won\'t be able to walk. I try to stay positive. It\'s not always easy.
But you will fail 100% of the time if you don\'t try.]{.rendered_qtext}
