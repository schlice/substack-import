What would happen is that "may issue" laws in any state in which they
exist would immediately become unconstitutional, and would effectively
become unenforceable. The state would be required to replace the "may
issue" laws with laws which comply with the Constitution, laws which
complied with the Supreme Court's ruling. These would, in essence, be
"shall issue" laws.
