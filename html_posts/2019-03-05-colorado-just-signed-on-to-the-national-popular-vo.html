**Colorado just signed on to the National Popular Vote Initiative. Do
you agree with this?**

The National Popular Vote (NPV), at best, is a potentially legal (but
probably not) end-run around the Constitution. At worst, it's a
flaunting of the law to bypass the design the framers instituted without
following the Constitutional process, and an outright denying of the
will of the people.

The idea is to convince the states to assign their electoral votes to
the winner of the "national popular vote," which really doesn't exist
today. I mean, we can track how many people voted for which party in
each state election, but we don't have a national election. We have 51
state elections. We have 51 elections because it decentralizes control
over elections, a key benefit of the Electoral College.

There are many problems which are caused by a national popular vote.
First though, could you imagine this system having been in place in
2004? Could you imagine California willingly handing over its electoral
votes to a Republican? The "other foot" test (coined by Harvard Law
Professor Emeritus Alan Dershowitz) applies here: if the shoe is on the
other foot, would it still be acceptable? If a Republican wins the
popular vote, will you still go along with the policy? I doubt New York
would calmly give all of its electoral votes to a Republican without a
riot on their hands.

Additionally, each state's electoral code is different from every other
state. There are different rules about everything, from early voting to
absentee voting, to felon voting and qualifying for the ballot. A
state's election code only applies to that state. Thus, the election
code in California only applies to California voters. A vote passed in
California has no effect on a vote cast in Texas.

However, under NPV, a vote in California will affect the outcome of the
vote in Texas, thus denying at least one of these states their state
sovereignty. The existence of a different election code in one state
will now always affect a voter in another. Why should a voter in New
York get more or less time to vote than a voter in Texas? Why should a
voter in Colorado get to do a mail-in ballot while a voter in Florida
must physically attend a polling place if they are able? Why does one
state use paper ballots and another use electronic machines? Every one
of these differences between states represents an opportunity to file a
lawsuit claiming unfair treatment. The list of possible complaints
caused by differences in state election codes could go on forever.
