Short answer: **yes, absolutely.**

Longer answer: While [[Mark
Werner](https://www.quora.com/profile/Mark-Werner-4)]{.qlink_container}
addressed the public's view of "the system," I would like to address the
damage done to the legal system as a whole by this entire debacle.

First, read my[ [answer to Death of Freddie Gray (April 2015): What\'s
the likelihood that the Baltimore police officers will be convicted of
murder and/or
manslaughter?](https://www.quora.com/Death-of-Freddie-Gray-April-2015-Whats-the-likelihood-that-the-Baltimore-police-officers-will-be-convicted-of-murder-and-or-manslaughter/answer/Bill-Stein)]{.qlink_container}

I wrote that answer less than a month after the now-infamous "rush to
judgment" by Baltimore City State's Attorney Marilyn Mosby. Consider
this quote from my previous answer:

The real problem with what happened is that this prosecutor buckled
under mob rule. She issued **murder** charges within hours of the
officers' arrests, *just to stop rioting mobs*. We predicted
(accurately) that not only would the officers be acquitted, but even if
they were guilty of some crime, the prosecutorial overreach exhibited
here will have negated any opportunity for a jury to even hear those
potential charges.

Murder is a serious offense to charge someone with, and as you can see
by the reviews of the Michael Brown and Eric Garner cases, is not
something to be taken lightly. Even if a prosecutor believes he or she
can make a murder charge stick, especially with something as
high-profile as one of these cases, you bring it to a grand jury to make
**absolutely sure** that you do have enough evidence to even charge
someone with murder. Again, Michael Brown's case review: 108 days. Eric
Garner's case review: 140 days. Freddie Gray's case review: **four
hours**. Which one of these is not like the other?

There is simply no way that even a legally-uneducated observer could
look at this case review and honestly believe that a thorough vetting of
all available evidence was done in four hours. She didn't even
***have*** all available evidence in four hours.

And true-to-form, one by one, the officers are being acquitted, or being
found not guilty of murder.

Perhaps if she would have done, oh, I don't know, ***her job***, she
would have found cause perhaps to levy a charge of voluntary
manslaughter, or even involuntary manslaughter for a participating
officer, if they did do a "rough ride" with Mr. Gray (which is still not
clear whether or not it actually occurred, and at this point we will
probably never know). What ***is*** clear is that these officers are not
guilty of **murder**.

Now, on to your question.

**Are there broader societal implications of the not guilty verdict in
the trial regarding Freddie Gray's death?**

1.  **Prosecutors who try to re-make the legal system into something
    akin to mob rule will find themselves not only losing cases, but
    also losing their jobs**, mostly because they are failing to do
    them. And with people rioting when they find an outcome they find
    unpleasant, or not in keeping with the narrative they are trying to
    further, prosecutors will be faced with these decisions more
    frequently now than ever before. Prosecutors must hold firmly to the
    principles of law and proper jurisprudence in order to win cases,
    not to appease rioters.
2.  **There will be a distinct "chilling effect" in law enforcement.**
    This is not specifically tied to Baltimore, but more to the
    after-effect of movements like "Black Lives Matter." [[Heather
    MacDonald](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=ccb575&url=http://imprimis.hillsdale.edu/the-danger-of-the-black-lives-matter-movement/){.external_link
    rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
    onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
    qt-tooltip="hillsdale.edu"}]{.qlink_container} coined it "the
    Ferguson effect." The kinds of proactive policing activities that
    occurred during the 1990s and 2000s which caused violent crime to
    drop over the last two decades have already started to decline in
    urban areas. Police still respond to calls for service when there is
    already a victim, but things like discretionary stops in high-crime
    areas are way down. This, in turn, has led to **the first sustained
    violent crime spike in twenty years**. Murders are up nearly 17% in
    the nation's 50 largest cities. As one example, in Chicago,
    pedestrian stops are down 80% and shootings are up 90% in statistics
    taken through March of this year.
3.  If we don't get a president into office who will strongly denounce
    violence against police officers, and take steps to mitigate that
    violence (ex. Texas made crimes against police officers "hate
    crimes"), I'm afraid that the dangerous rhetoric spouted by
    movements like BLM will only make the problem worse, and the media's
    amplification of such slander will make the problem worse by orders
    of magnitude.
