Well as a Christian, I'm not sure where you get the idea of *vileness*,
*selfishness*, or *hate* from, but I will tell you that Christians **are
indeed intolerant towards those who don't agree with them**, and I think
you are conflating *intolerance* with *hate*.

***WHAT?????? A CHRISTIAN JUST ADMITTED THAT CHRISTIANS ARE INTOLERANT
TOWARDS THOSE THAT DON'T AGREE WITH THEM???????***

*Mind. Blown.*

Does the American Academy of Pediatricians admit anyone who is not a
pediatrician? Does the plumber's union admit postal workers? Every group
which has a core set of beliefs does exactly the same thing, and they
are intolerant of anyone who does not believe as they do.

Churches are no different. As you may have heard, a church is not a
building. A church is a group of people who share similar beliefs. This
is no secret. In fact, in order to become a member of a church, you
usually must assent to a set of beliefs, normally in writing. This means
that the church, while open to *visitors*, accepts only those who
believe as they do as *members*.

This means, if you follow the logic, churches are *intolerant* towards
those who do not believe as they do. They do not tolerate unbelievers
becoming members. They **love** everyone, but they do not **tolerate**
membership by those who do not share their beliefs. And as I mentioned,
the church absolutely welcomes visitors. Even if you don't believe, stop
by, listen to the music and the message (even an unbeliever can get
something positive out of the message), have some free coffee and donuts
and experience some really nice fellowship (friendly conversation).
There are worse ways you could begin a Sunday.

In short, **we love everyone, but only believers can become members.**

It seems, though, you somehow equate religious intolerance with hate. It
only works in one direction: sure, even hate groups are intolerant, but
not all groups which are intolerant are hate groups. Every group is
intolerant of those who are outside of the group, but not all groups
which do not tolerate those from within the group are hateful.

Okay, time for the hard conversation. Let's apply this to the real world
rather than the theoretical. As an example, let's talk specifically
about a gay man. Let's ask some questions:

- Can an openly gay man attend church services?
- Can an openly gay man join the church?

To the first question, **can an openly gay man attend church services**,
the answer is ***YES!*** Unequivocally yes. Please come! We'd love to
meet you and share our diabetes-inducing sugary sweets along with a
great message of hope and salvation. God loves you and so do we!

But now to the next question, **can an openly gay man join the church?**
Now, it gets a little more challenging. Church membership includes
believing in the same doctrine as everyone else, and the Bible clearly
states that homosexual activity is a sin. Knowingly living in sin is not
what a Christian does. If you know the Bible, then you know that
homosexual activity is sinful. While we are all sinners, we all strive
to *not* be sinners. That means we work towards recognizing our sin and
**repenting of** (turning away from) our sin. In order to become a
member of the church, you too need to repent of your sin, and that means
not knowingly continuing in sin.

And yes, that is *intolerant*.

But it is not *unloving*.

We indeed love that man and want the best for him, but the loving thing
to do is not to allow him to knowingly continue living in sin. It would
actually be unloving to allow him to knowingly continue living in sin,
as it could affect his eternal future.
