**Are there odds on President Trump resigning like Nixon? If so, what
are they?**

The odds are so good, they're not worth your money.

***There is a 100% chance that Trump will not resign.*** And you can
take that one to the bank. In fact, if there is a bet going that he will
resign, you could take the "long odds" and bet against it, and make a
ton of holiday cash.

Nixon resigned because he was facing certain conviction in the Senate.
Trump, on the other hand, is facing certain acquittal in the Senate (if
the Articles of Impeachment ever make it there, which I'm starting to
have my doubts). So there is absolutely zero reason for him to resign.

And understanding his personality as I do, even if he was facing the
possibility of being removed from office, he'd fight it.
