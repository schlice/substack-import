DVI is video only. Your TV has to have an audio input that matches (in
protocol) with an output on the laptop. So what you use is dependent on
what your laptop can send audio with.

Most laptops have a 3.5″ headphone jack. TVs usually accept 3.5″ in when
used in conjunction with a VGA port, the pair usually labeled
"Computer\" or similar.

If you hook up the DVI cable to the TV (if you have a DVI in), there
should be a similar digital audio input to match the digital video. You
may have an optical audio port input, but whether or not your laptop
provides an optical audio out is a toss-up.

If your laptop has an HDMI port, that would be easiest, as HDMI is a
single cable which passes digital audio and video.

Basically, it's an exercise in matching up laptop outputs with TV inputs
and seeing what will work.
