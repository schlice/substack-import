Varies by state, but in most states:

- Speeding is not a \"prosecutable\" offense, as it is a moving
  violation, not even a misdemeanor. Most moving violations are punished
  with fines and \"points\" against your license. Accumulate enough
  points, and you can lose your license. Be aware, there are a few
  moving violations which are misdemeanors, such as reckless driving or
  reckless endangerment. Depending on what is involved, those might rise
  to the level of a felony.
- In most states, moving violations must be \"observed by a peace
  officer\" in order to be issued. Which is why red-light cameras have
  required law changes in many places in order to come into existence.
  In some cases, one peace officer can observe the offense, and a second
  peace officer can issue the ticket with the first peace officer as the
  complaining official.
