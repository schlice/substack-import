**How about a 100% firearm background check? One could go to a FFL to do
a transfer, or could get a \$10 federal license that allowed them to buy
any legal weapon in any state. What do you think?**

It's the equivalent of what Illinois does with their FOID (Firearms
Owner ID) card system. Every gun owner must have a FOID card, and then
transactions are very simple: you confirm that the FOID card is still
valid, and away you go.

Expanding the system nationally would work if you had a simple web-based
method to check whether or not the card was still valid. Once the check
is complete, you get a transaction ID which proves you did the check,
and you're off to the races.

The system must be available, and the system must also default to
approve (like our current system) or the government could institute a
*de facto* gun ban by simply crashing the system. So if the system is
unavailable for X amount of time, you can legally presume the card is
still valid.

No need for a FFL for every transfer.
