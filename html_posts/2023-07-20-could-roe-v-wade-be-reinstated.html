Not from the Supreme Court. That ship has sailed. Essentially, that's
like asking if the Court would ever reinstate the 3/5 Compromise or Jim
Crow. The Court has corrected a bad ruling, and barring something that
has never happened in US history, we're not going back. Abortion is not
a right in the Constitution, period. That error has been corrected.

Maybe there will be a new ruling, with new facts and new circumstances,
which legalizes abortion nationwide under a different Constitutional
provision, but the court will never reinstate the ruling of *Roe*.

But something *Roe-*like can be passed at the state level, and some
states do indeed have similar *Roe-*like laws, in that they permit
abortions. Or, a Constitutional amendment could be passed that makes the
right to an abortion Constitutional.
