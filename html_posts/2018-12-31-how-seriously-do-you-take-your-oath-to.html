**How seriously do you take your oath to "support and defend the
constitution of the United States; against all enemies foreign and
domestic?**

I take my oath so seriously that while I have been relieved of my post
on Active Duty, I have never been relieved of my oath. As far as I am
concerned, I've not been relieved of that particular duty. I will
continue to support and defend the Constitution, and I am still prepared
to give my life in its defense.

**For officers, what does "without mental reservation, or purpose of
evasion" mean to you?**

The full sentence says, "I take this obligation freely, without any
mental reservation or purpose of evasion." Therefore, mental reservation
or purpose of evasion are modifiers to the first part of the sentence.

To that end, "mental reservation" means I'm committed to my oath (which
may be why I take it so seriously) and I do it consciously, without any
doubts about what I'm doing, and "purpose of evasion" means exactly what
it says: I take the obligation because I want to, not because I'm trying
to evade some other responsibility.
