The problem with images, especially of God, is that when we worship
using images, we mentally limit ourselves to that image. We think of God
as nothing more than an old man with a white beard in a white robe. And
that *limits* God in our mind.

This is a practice known as *anthropomorphism,* or the attribution of
human characteristics to God. However, God is not limited by a human
body. So if, when we worship God, we think of this, we too
subconsciously limit ourselves, and limit our understanding of God.

I wouldn't not paint a painting of God because it might limit someone
else's worship. Let each person worship in the manner in which they see
fit. What people do with your art is not your concern, unless you are
intentionally trying to lead them astray.
