**What conclusion do you think the US Justice Department investigating
itself will come to?**

The same conclusions that it comes to every time; however, I think you
mischaracterize the DOJ Office of the Inspector General when you say
that the Department is "investigating itself."

The [[USDOJ Office of the Inspector
General](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=f02640&url=https://oig.justice.gov/){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="justice.gov"}]{.qlink_container} (DOJ OIG) was formed by
statute and is an organization which is "part" of the DOJ, but does not
report to it. The Inspector General (IG) does not report to the Attorney
General; the IG reports directly to the President. The IG is appointed
by the President and the nomination is confirmed directly by the US
Senate. Therefore, the IG is outside of the framework it is
investigating.

To that end, any investigation done into fraud, waste, abuse and
misconduct in the DOJ has the best chance of being neutral and fair.
