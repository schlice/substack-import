**When marijuana is legalized in a state, why do people who are in jail
for marijuana related crimes not released from prison?**

First of all, a point of clarification. Since marijuana is illegal at
the Federal level, states don't actually "make it legal," since this is
unconstitutional. What states do is *change the state-level punishment*
by essentially removing the state-level punishment for violating that
Federal law altogether. So long as it is the state processing that
crime, then there is no punishment.

Anyway, there are several reasons why people who are currently in prison
aren't automatically released:

1.  The Constitution has a restriction (Article I, Section 10, Clause 1)
    on *ex post facto* laws. These are laws that *retroactively* changes
    the status, or consequences, of a law before it was enacted. It
    could either make the punishment more severe, or less severe, for
    crimes which were previously committed. Therefore, the legalization
    of marijuana doesn't change what happened to people who were already
    convicted.
2.  Punishments for any crime are given at the time that the case is
    prosecuted, and generally it means that if a law exists at the time
    you committed the crime, that's the law you are prosecuted under.
    Even if *the next day* the law were to change, you are still subject
    to the law on the day you committed the crime.
