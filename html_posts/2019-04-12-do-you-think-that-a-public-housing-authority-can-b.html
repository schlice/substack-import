**Do you think that a public housing authority can be sued if a person
is murdered on the property?**

Of course they can.

Just because they're not actually criminally responsible for the murder
doesn't mean that they are completely free from any culpability. For
example, the facility still must provide basic security measures like
lockable doors, and if they failed to do this, they can still be held to
account for that failure. If they have a lockable lobby which is only
accessible to tenants, and someone besides a tenant gained access to
that lobby, they can be held responsible for that failure.
