**Content:** [While I agree that it\'s horribly insensitive and
personally offensive to me, I wore the (real) uniform to protect the
rights of those who want to wear (fake) uniforms.\
\
It reminds me of Voltaire\'s quote: \"I disapprove of what you say, but
I will defend to the death your right to say it\".\
\
You\'ve crossed the line from free speech to fraud when you attempt to
gain some form of benefit by wearing the uniform. If you wear a uniform
to get 10% off of your latte and you were never in the military, you
deserve to be arrested for fraud.\
\
Starting in 2014, Colorado driver\'s licenses now include a \"Veteran\"
designation if you choose. You have to bring the standard military
discharge form (DD-214) which every service member receives upon being
discharged from the armed forces to DMV to have the tag applied to your
license. Since I am a disabled veteran and left the service before
serving long enough to retire, I no longer have a military ID card. The
veteran tag on my license helps, as I am definitely a military veteran,
albeit not retired.]{.rendered_qtext}
