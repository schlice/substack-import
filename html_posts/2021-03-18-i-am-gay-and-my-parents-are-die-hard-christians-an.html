**I am gay and my parents are die-hard Christians and are against gays.
How do I tell them?**

I'm going to add to [[Dan
B](https://www.quora.com/profile/Dan-B-1472)]{.qlink_container}'s
perfect answer about coming out (even though I probably should leave it
alone, but it's weighing on me) and address the other side of what you
said.

You said that "your parents are die-hard Christians and are against
gays." This statement is an oxymoron.

**If your parents were actually die-hard Christians, they would not be
against gays.**

Why do I say this?

- Show me where in the Bible it says to love your neighbor as yourself
  **unless they're gay**.
- Show me where in the Bible it says, about anything, to hate your
  neighbor if he is a sinner.
- Show me where in the Bible it says that it's up to you to judge people
  for their actions.

In fact, the **central message of the Bible** contradicts this. The
Gospel. The Good News.

What is that good news? ***While we were still sinners****, Christ died
for us.* (Romans 5:8)

While we were sinners. *We.* Not you, not me, not him over there,
**we**. We are **all** sinners. We have all fallen short of God's
expectations for us. Every single one of us, including your die-hard
Christian parents. Not one of us measures up to God's standards.

Jesus laid out God's standards during his famous Sermon on the Mount.

> You have heard that it was said to the people long ago, \"Do not
> murder,\" and \"anyone who murders will be subject to judgment.\" But
> I tell you that anyone who is angry with his brother will be subject
> to judgment ... You have heard that it was said, \"Do not commit
> adultery.\" But I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully
> has already committed adultery with her in his heart. --- Matthew
> 5:21-22, 27-28 (NIV)

Wow. Anyone who is angry with his brother? Anyone who has ever had a
lustful thought? Doomed! We're all doomed! Me especially, I'm doomed
like a hundred times over!

Well, yes. *Apart from God*, we are all doomed. The point Jesus was
trying to make is that there is no way that any of us can meet that
standard without God. We are *all* sinners. But Jesus paid for our sins
with his death and resurrection.

And what are we commanded to do in the meantime?

> "Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the Law?"
>
> Jesus replied: "'Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with
> all your soul and with all your mind.' This is the first and greatest
> commandment. And the second is like it: 'Love your neighbor as
> yourself.' All the Law and the Prophets hang on these two
> commandments." --- Matthew 22:36--40 (NIV)

Love your neighbor. Not "Love your neighbor unless he is a sinner." Not
"Love your neighbor unless he is gay." Not "Love your neighbor unless
you disagree with his lifestyle." Love your neighbor. I see a period at
the end of that sentence, not a comma. There is no but. Just love.

Your parents should love you, period. Because unless I missed it, that's
what the Bible commands.

And I'll be so bold as to say that if they don't love you because you
are gay, they are not the Christians they believe themselves to be.

**I am Christian. And I love you.**

Period.
