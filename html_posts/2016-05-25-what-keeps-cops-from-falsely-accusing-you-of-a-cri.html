I suppose any government employee in any position could lie and cause
you great angst in your personal and professional life. I assume you're
asking the question specifically about the police because they normally
bring the lawless to justice, and it seems quite unfair that they might
bring a law-abiding citizen into the justice system when they did
"nothing wrong." By the way, walk into the jail and ask them by a show
of hands how many of them didn't do what they were accused, tried, and
convicted, of doing. You won't see a single hand not raised. Is that
truly possible? Could everyone in jail have been falsely accused? No,
it's exceedingly unlikely.

So what checks and balances keep cops from falsely accusing you?
**Nothing**. Nothing prevents a police officer from falsely accusing
you. Nothing prevents a police officer from planting evidence, or
railroading you into the system. Nothing at all.

That said, what checks and balances exist in ***the system*** to prevent
innocent people from going to jail?

1.  The court system. You (hopefully) would hire defense counsel if you
    were arrested and charged with a crime, and your lawyer will help
    you sort it out. It would definitely be an interesting first
    meeting: "I know every defendant tells you he didn't do it, but in
    my case, *I really didn't do it."*
2.  The fear that if the officer was caught, he'd not only lose his job,
    but he would face personal liability for false arrest and many other
    charges, charges against which the department would not defend him.
3.  Personal integrity of police officers. I can bet by the simple fact
    that you're asking this question that you don't put a lot of stock
    in the fact that police officers do, in fact, have personal
    integrity. But whether or not you believe it is not what determines
    fact. The vast majority of police officers are honest, hard-working
    people who want to keep you safe and want to see the bad guys go
    away for a long time. Departments do their best to ensure that the
    people they hire have personal integrity. The background
    investigations that officers go through rival what people go through
    to get access to DoD Top Secret information (I should know; I
    completed both processes). Occasionally a bad seed slips through,
    and people do change over the years. I would never be so naive to
    think that it wouldn't happen. It does. As [[Brian
    Jones](https://www.quora.com/profile/Brian-Jones-116)]{.qlink_container}
    mentioned, when we find the bad seeds, they are dealt with as
    quickly as possible. No department wants that kind of publicity.
4.  ***Reality***, which is much more mundane than what you see in the
    movies or can create in your imagination. In a similar question
    where the questioner asked something like "what's to stop a police
    officer from lying about the speed I was doing," the question
    becomes ***why?*** Why would an officer *need* to lie about what you
    were doing? If he sits there for another five minutes, he's
    guaranteed to see another speeder. Why does he need to fabricate
    charges against you? Unless you knew the officer and he had some
    sort of personal vendetta against you, having an officer lie and
    fabricate charges against you is just seriously unlikely. There are
    plenty of bad guys to catch out there. He doesn't need to make
    anything up about you.
