**Content:** [It appears that either the law didn\'t apply, or the
redneck gun nut you speak of broke the laws.\
\
How will \"more laws\" have stopped him?\
\
Name one law that would have stopped the racist redneck gun nut you
speak of. There is no law that would have stopped him, as he already
quite possibly broke laws to do what he did.\
\
By passing more laws, you are, in effect, \"doing something.\" However,
passing more laws won\'t actually \"accomplish anything,\" like
preventing more racist redneck gun nuts from actually obtaining guns
(by, oh, breaking the law) and continuing to do what they do.\
\
If you\'re more interested in \"doing something\" than \"accomplishing
something,\" then you should leave the law-making to the big
boys.]{.rendered_qtext}
