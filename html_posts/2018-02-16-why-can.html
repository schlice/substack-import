**Why is the US government reluctant to implement gun restrictions (if
gun control has failed)?**

The government is not *reluctant* to implement gun restrictions. It is
*prohibited* from doing so by the Second Amendment which, in part,
reads:

> *...the right of the People to keep and bear Arms shall not be
> infringed.*

So while they may *want* to implement restrictions, they cannot.

That doesn't mean they don't try, though. And that's only *Federal*
restrictions. Many *states* still have repressive gun laws which haven't
been challenged or repealed yet, even though the Second Amendment has
been incorporated to the states with the *Heller v. DC* and *MacDonald
v. Chicago* Supreme Court cases.
