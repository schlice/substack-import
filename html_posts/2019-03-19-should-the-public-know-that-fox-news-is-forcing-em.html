**Should the public know that Fox News is forcing employees to sign
non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) to prevent them from revealing that the
network refuses to report some negative news about Individual Number
One?**

Your question is slightly incorrect, and missing a lot of detail.

First of all, not just Fox News has employees sign NDAs. [[NDAs are
ubiquitous across
media](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=6d564e&url=https://www.cjr.org/watchdog/journalists-nda-nondisclosure-harassment-metoo-newsrooms.php){.external_link

are both necessary and evil, both allowing business to keep company
confidential information secret, while simultaneously creating the
environment in which things like sexual harassment can occur unchecked.

Secondly, **NDAs are perfectly legal**, as private businesses are not
covered by the First Amendment. While the First Amendment prohibits
*government* from making a law regarding freedom of speech, it says
nothing about whether or not a private company can make rules which
silence certain speech. This is why NDAs are legal. A private business
(in this case, a news organization) can decide whether or not they want
to air a particular story, and they can force their employees to not
discuss matters of business decisions about what stories they run while
they are employed, and for a time after. The article you quoted seems to
gloss over the fact that NDAs are common in business, allowing them to
keep insider information confidential.

That Fox News scuttled stories in order to protect the President from
fallout during an election should be no surprise to anyone. Every major
media outlet has done the same thing. Indeed, the Stormy Daniels saga is
the story of a media outlet purchasing the rights to a story and then
*not* running that story, in a media practice called "catch and kill."
Fox directed the journalist in question, Diana Falzone, to not run a
story on Daniels. The New Yorker alleges that [[Fox did this to protect
the
President](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=9a9a03&url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/03/11/the-making-of-the-fox-news-white-house){.external_link

Deferential treatment of politicians has been the dirty little secret of
the mainstream media for the past ten years, but has become overtly
partisan over the last two. The media treated President Obama with kid
gloves during his entire presidency, either fearing the fallout from
negativity against the nation's first black president, or covertly
working to keep his record as flawless as possible. Your level of
conspiracy will determine which you believe is true.

You'll also note that the NDA Falzone signed allowed her to discuss the
issue with the government because, like most NDAs, it has an exception
for government investigations.

The larger question, of course, is whether or not media outlets should
be allowed to make journalists sign NDAs in the first place. Some argue
that NDAs allow media outlets to function more like campaign
organizations than journalists, and the public should hold campaign
organizations to a different standard than media outlets in terms of
what we believe about their message.

On the other hand, most NDAs are actually unenforceable in court.
Especially in the case where a company is doing something illegal,
existing law protects those employees. Whistleblower statutes allow
employees reporting illegal behavior to be protected from retribution,
and other existing laws limit the things to which two parties in a
contract may agree. Often, if a suit is filed alleging NDA violations,
the employer will settle out of court, because they know that their
contract likely will not hold up to legal scrutiny.

Enforceable or not, the NDA creates the environment of secrecy backed by
the threat of a potential lawsuit.

So, to answer your question: **should the public know about NDAs? Yes.**
There's a lot of things that the public should know about. Should they
be allowed to continue? Yes, because they do allow for companies to keep
*some* secrets. However, ***employees, even more than the public,***
should know what existing law says, and that they can safely report
illegal behavior without fear of reprisals.
