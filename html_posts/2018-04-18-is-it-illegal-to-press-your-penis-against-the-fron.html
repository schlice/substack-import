**Is it illegal to press your penis against the front window of your own
house?**

As with all legal questions, the answer is "it depends."

And in this case, it depends on three things:

- Your age
- The state in which your front window is located
- The current state of your penis

In most states, display of genitals is considered to be "indecent
exposure." Many states have multiple statutes at different levels of
offense. For example, Colorado has a Petty Offense called Public
Indecency and a Misdemeanor called Indecent Exposure. Colorado does
**not** consider simple nudity to be either. The exposure must be done
in a way designed to sexually arouse someone else in order to be
considered indecent. For example, you would have to be touching yourself
"in a lewd manner" (according to the statute) for the exposure to be
indecent. The statute for Public Indecency also includes "a knowing
exposure of the person's genitals to the view of a person under
circumstances in which such conduct is likely to cause affront or alarm
to the other person." Pressing your penis against a window might
qualify. Simply being naked inside your home might not.

This leads in to the second point. If the penis is erect, you are likely
in violation of the indecent exposure law, which says that a person is
guilty if he or she "knowingly exposes one\'s genitals in view of
another in a way likely to cause alarm or offend with the intent to
arouse or to satisfy the sexual desires of anyone."

So the takeaway here is that in most circumstances, in most states,
pressing your penis up against your front window (presumably in full
view of the outside) is most likely in violation of one or more of your
state's indecency statutes. Even in states as permissive as Colorado,
you can still be charged. And if you happen to expose yourself to a
child, you're now "contributing to the delinquency of a minor" and now
you're a registered sex offender. Well done, penis presser. Well done.
