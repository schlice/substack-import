[[Hate Parking Tickets? Fixed Fights Them In Court For
You](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=3f6fef&url=http://techcrunch.com/2014/01/15/fight-parking-ticket-fixed){.external_link

According to this article, Fixed is a company that will fight tickets
for you. It\'s a San-Francisco startup, and apparently they are using
the \"logic\" that says that parking rules are so convoluted that you
can very easily be issued an erroneous ticket.\
\
The article also says that it\'s entirely possible that the city council
could kill a business like Fixed by simply saying that only you or your
lawyer can appeal your parking ticket.\
\
Since parking tickets in big cities are handled by a parking authority
and not the courts, unless you fail to pay your tickets, your case
doesn\'t go in front of a judge. Your request for appeal goes in front
of a parking authority employee.\
\
Most locations don\'t have big-city issues like San Francisco where
parking is handled by a parking authority. Smaller towns have parking
handled by the local police, and they\'re not going to be as lenient as
a clerk at the parking authority.\
\
Additionally, you can really only get away with saying \"I didn\'t know
I couldn\'t park there\" only once. After that, they\'re going to stop
granting your requests for dismissal of your ticket.\

I don\'t see the business taking off. It has a very self-limiting
market, and repeat customers won\'t get their tickets expunged so the
company will get nothing for all its effort. Business model doesn\'t
work, IMHO. If I was in VC, I\'d walk away from this
one.]{.rendered_qtext}
