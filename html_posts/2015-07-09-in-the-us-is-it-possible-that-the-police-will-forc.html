**Content:** [In interrogation techniques, we know that when you apply
too much pressure, people will say anything to make the pressure stop,
including incriminating themselves. So being \"overly coercive\" is
illegal because it is usually ineffective at actually getting the truth.
We prefer the truth to a lie just to make the questioning stop.\
\
There are much better interrogation techniques which can be employed
which are far more successful at actually extracting the truth than
coercion.]{.rendered_qtext}
