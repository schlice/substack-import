Yes, recent Supreme Court actions suggest a significant shift that
appears to negate Congress\'s choice of agency bipartisanship and
independence, in favor instead of the "unitary executive" theory which
posits that the Constitution supports the idea that Congress cannot
unduly limit the President's authority to remove executive officers.
This more "strict constructionist" Court seems likely to continue to
advance the "unitary executive" theory.

Historically, the Supreme Court\'s 1935 decision in *Humphrey\'s
Executor v. United States* established a precedent that limited the
President\'s power to remove commissioners of independent agencies. This
ruling held that for agencies performing quasi-legislative or
quasi-judicial functions, Congress could insulate their members from
at-will presidential removal, requiring \"for cause\" removal (e.g., for
inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance). This was seen as crucial
for maintaining the independence and non-partisanship of these agencies.
That said, while these agency heads were indeed insulated from removal,
their appointments were seen as politically biased to begin with

However, recent Supreme Court rulings, particularly those involving
President Trump\'s removal of appointees from the National Labor
Relations Board (NLRB), the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB), and
most recently, the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), have
chipped away at this long-standing precedent.

On July 23, 2025, the Supreme Court \"greenlighted\" President Trump\'s
ability to remove three Democratic appointees from the CPSC, despite a
federal judge having previously reinstated them based on *Humphrey\'s
Executor*. This followed similar decisions in May 2025 regarding the
NLRB and MSPB.

The key takeaway from these recent decisions, particularly as expressed
in dissenting opinions, is that by allowing the President to remove
commissioners for reasons like political affiliation, the Court is
indeed \"negating Congress\'s choice of agency bipartisanship and
independence.\" The conservative majority on the Court has repeatedly
sided with the view that the Constitution grants the President broad
executive authority, including the power to fire agency officials
without cause, even for agencies that Congress intended to be
independent.

This trend reflects a strengthening of the \"unitary executive" theory,
which posits that the President has sole authority over the executive
branch and that Congress cannot unduly restrict the President\'s power
to remove executive officers. While *Humphrey\'s Executor* distinguished
between \"purely executive officers\" (removable at will, as established
in *Myers v. United States*) and those with quasi-legislative/judicial
functions, the recent rulings seem to be narrowing or even overturning
that distinction, particularly for multi-member independent commissions.
