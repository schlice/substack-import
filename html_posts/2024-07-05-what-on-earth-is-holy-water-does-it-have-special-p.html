The Bible does not describe "holy water" in the way Catholics use it
today. There are a few references in the Bible to water which might
describe what today is called "holy water," but they are pretty vague
and don't really apply especially strongly to the water itself.

- Matthew 3:11 talks about \"baptizing with water for repentance," but
  nothing in the text even hints that the water itself is holy. Baptism
  is symbolic in that it represents following Christ through His death,
  burial and resurrection.
- You *might* draw a parallel to Levitical law (cf Leviticus 15, 16,
  and 17) wherein unclean things were ritually cleaned with water before
  they could be touched. But again, the *water* is not holy in that
  regard. The water is merely used for purification.

The modern use of holy water came into vogue in about the ninth century.
Today, holy water is permanently ensconced at the entrances to Catholic
churches, and congregants use the water to bless themselves as they
enter. Priests use holy water to bless the congregation using a device

there isn't really any Biblical reference to it, especially in the way
it is used today.

**TL;DR:** The Bible does not talk about the use of holy water anywhere,
in any form. The Catholic use of holy water is unbiblical. The Bible
does not tell Christians to use holy water for anything.
