**If I overhear co-workers having a conversation about sexual content on
another co-worker\'s Instagram (not in her presence) , does this count
as sexual harassment? She had explicit Boudoir photography.**

In general, such talk violates company harassment guidelines, and is by
itself reportable directly to HR. Just by you overhearing their
discussion, they have committed the harassing behavior.

If you were an exceedingly nice person (and assuming your workplace also
explicitly bans this behavior), you could approach them and advise them
that such talk is unacceptable under HR rules and they need to stop. You
are under no obligation to do so, especially if they are making an
uncomfortable work environment for you. If you do, and they do not stop,
don\'t bother with any other intervention, go straight to HR. They will
be out the door by the end of the week.

In this day and age, companies don\'t take kindly to harassment in the
workplace. It\'s as close to zero tolerance as you can get. Companies
don\'t want the liability or the bad press of harassment lawsuits, so
they nip that in the bud right quick.

Oh, and tell the other girl to clean up her IG, as that too can get her
fired. People have been fired for less.

Note that not all companies share the same policy on workplace
harassment, so YMMV. Check with HR if you have questions. My employer
has a very strong workplace harassment policy, and we fight hard to make
a safe, inclusive workplace for everyone.
