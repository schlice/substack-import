What "rights" do you think you should be exercising? Are you possibly
referring to your "right to self defense" when a police officer orders
you to do something you don't want to do and he (appropriately)
escalates his use of force and you use your "right to self-defense" to
defend yourself? Do you feel it's okay to "defend yourself against the
police" when you "did nothing wrong?"

> *Shouldn\'t there be a compromise between the anti-police rhetoric and

Oh, but there is. It's called the courts. In fact, that's the only
"compromise" between anti-police hate speech and the idea that police
doing their jobs are always right. The court gets to determine who is
right.

When a police officer is performing his or her duties, you do not have
the right to resist him or her. Period. Before you get all butthurt that
you can't defend yourself, the key here is "when a police officer is
performing his duties." That means that in very specific situations, you
do have the right to defend yourself.

*See? I can defend myself against that bastard rogue cop who isn't doing
his job!* Not so fast, cowboy.

***How do you KNOW he is not doing his job?***

Aye, there's the rub. There is only **one group** who is authorized by
law to determine whether or not a police officer was actually doing his
job. That group is **the court**. Not you, not even the police
department, technically. It's the court. When you go to court, the
police officer will stand in front of the judge and will explain himself
(the only time he is required by law to do so) and the judge will
determine whether or not he was following the law. There is *no other
time* when anyone gets to make that determination.

*Okay, so what does that mean to me?*

It means that *at the scene*, you must presume the officer is acting
lawfully. Once you leave, you and your lawyer will review the
circumstances and will then try to show the judge that the officer was
not acting lawfully, and if they find that he was not, the case against
you gets thrown out, you go free and you file a big fat juicy lawsuit
against the department and make all kinds of paper.

But until then, you have to do what that officer tells you to do.

Alternatively, instead of fighting and making a problem worse, you could
always simply refuse to follow his order. If the court finds that he was
acting lawfully, you will be charged with failing to follow the lawful
order of a peace officer (or whatever it is called in your
jurisdiction). But you knew that, because you knew that only the court
could determine whether or not he was actually acting lawfully, and you
could potentially be refusing to obey a police officer who was acting
lawfully. You run that risk when you refuse an order. You'll probably be
arrested when you refuse. That comes with the "refusal" territory. Be
polite, do not resist arrest, and you will be fine.
