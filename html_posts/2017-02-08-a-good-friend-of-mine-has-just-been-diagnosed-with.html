We've answered this question multiple times on Quora. Did you use Quora
search? I'll admit it's not very good, but try it sometime.

Your friend will be going through some very heavy emotions. It's the
same set of emotions (the stages of grief) one goes through when someone
close to you dies. There's rejection, anger, compromise, and eventually
acceptance. Those emotions all happen, but they don't happen at any
pre-defined pace. In other words, it's different for everyone. With MS,
there are lots of "if only" mental exercises you go through. "If only I
would have done X differently, I wouldn't have MS." "If only I hadn't
smoked in my late teens, I wouldn't have MS" (that was mine, by the
way). But then comes compromise. "Maybe if I do X, I can get through
this." Such as, "Maybe if I walk a mile a few times a week, I can
improve my overall health and it will all be manageable." "The MS pills
aren't so bad, I can take a pill a day." Or for me, when I started an
only injectables were available, "My seven-year old neighbor is diabetic
and gets insulin shots three times a day; my medicine is only once a
day. If he can do it, so can I." And then you accept that "you have MS,
but MS does not have you." In other words, MS is just one of the things
that make up who you are; it does not define you.

You should be there for your friend while they go through this emotional
roller-coaster. It's important to remember that while MS represents a
significant change to life and how you plan on living it, *it doesn't
represent a death sentence.* You cannot die from MS. You can die from
complications from severe, long-term untreated MS, but MS itself is not
fatal.

Make sure that through the grief and anxiety, your friend makes an
appointment with a neurologist if they haven't done so already. That
diagnosis should be delivered or confirmed by a neurologist. While there
is no cure for MS, your friend will need to start on one of the approved
MS therapy drugs. There are plenty to choose from, but they all
basically do the same thing: slow down the progression of MS, and reduce
the severity and duration of relapses. It's important to start on one of
the approved MS therapy drugs as soon as possible. This is the
"conservative" approach: to "conserve" as much brain matter as possible,
because once it's damaged, it doesn't come back. Depending on neural
load, some reserve neurons can wire around the damaged areas, but that
reserve load is a fixed quantity. The current theory is that once that
reserve load is depleted, relapses gain more permanence and do not remit
as easily (or fully). Therefore, we want to save as much brain matter as
possible.

In short, *just be a good friend*. Be the ear to listen, and be the
shoulder to lean on, while your friend goes through the stages of grief
which, while painful to watch (and even more painful to go through
yourself), are necessary to the healing process.
