The actual problem here is that **not everyone who calls themselves**
***Christian*** **is actually saved.**

A Christian who has been saved cannot lose his salvation. Most, if not
all, of what the Bible says happens to us when we receive Christ would
be invalid if salvation could be lost. Salvation is the gift of God, and
God's gifts are "irrevocable" (Romans 11:29). A Christian cannot be
un-newly created. The redeemed cannot be unpurchased. Eternal life
cannot be temporary. God cannot renege on His Word. Scripture says that
God cannot lie (Titus 1:2). God will "give you a new heart and put a new
spirit in you; I will remove from you your heart of stone and give you a
heart of flesh." (Ezekiel 36:26 NIV). That new heart can *only* love
God. If that is true, seeing a Christian living in sin and hypocrisy
might cause us to question whether or not that heart has actually been
changed.

More evidence of the same thing is found elsewhere in the Bible. The
Bible says unequivocally that a true Christian will not live in a state
of continual, unrepentant sin (1 John 3:6). The Bible also says that
anyone who departs the faith is demonstrating that he was never truly a
Christian (1 John 2:19). He may have called himself Christian. He may
have been religious. He may have attended church, said the prayers, and
sang the songs. He may have put on a good show, *but he was never born
again by the power of God.* The redeemed of God belong "to him who was
raised from the dead, in order that we might bear fruit for God" (Romans
7:4). Nothing can separate a child of God from the Father's love (Romans
8:38--39). Nothing can remove a Christian from God's hand (John
10:28--29). God guarantees eternal life and maintains the salvation He
has given us. The Good Shepherd searches for the lost sheep, and, "when
he finds it, he joyfully puts it on his shoulders and goes home" (Luke
15:5--6). The lamb is found, and the Shepherd gladly bears the burden;
our Lord takes full responsibility for bringing the lost one safely
home.

> By their fruit you will recognize them (Matthew 7:16).

A good tree will not produce bad fruit. A bad tree will not produce good
fruit. So if you see good fruit, you know it comes from a good tree. A
person who calls themselves Christian who lives a sinful and
hypocritical life is likely not saved, despite his belief that he is.

**TL,DR:** A so-called Christian living in sin and hypocrisy may not
necessarily be saved in the first place.
