That is not what the Supreme Court said. If you're going to ask a
question, at least ask the right question.

Neither business in question (*Masterpiece Cake Shop* or *303 Creative*)
has ever refused service to an LGBT customer. Ever. You may be confusing
"refusing to speak a message with which they disagreed" with "refusing
service to an LGBT customer."

In *Masterpiece*'s case, Jack Phillips never refuses to serve anyone.
He'll sell a rack cake to anyone for any reason at any time. Lorie Smith
will create websites for anyone, regardless of their race, sex,
religion, or sexual or gender orientation.

What they *will not* do is be forced by the government to speak a
state-approved message with which they do not agree.

The case proves that the First Amendment not only protects your right to
speak, but it also protects your right to *not* speak.

If the cake shop or the web designer were actually refusing service to
LGBT people, then you'd have to show where the LGBT person entered the
store and asked for a cake with absolutely zero message and zero
meaning. Just a cake. Or just a website for a generic business, not for
a gay wedding, and was denied simply because they were LGBT. **This
never happened.**

Businesses can still not refuse service to LGBT customers if the state
has decided that sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI) is a
protected class. It is not protected at the federal level but some
states have added SOGI as a protected class. But business owners cannot
be forced to speak state-approved messages with which they disagree.
Jack Phillips cannot be forced to use his artistic talents to design a
cake for a gay wedding, and Lorie Smith cannot be forced to use her
talents to create websites celebrating gay weddings. The First Amendment
protects their right to not speak messages with which they disagree.
They'll make any other cake or any other website, but not those. The
state cannot tell them that they must design cakes celebrating LGBT
events or risk losing their business license.
