In our department we are authorized to use one of these two types of
handcuffs: chain linked

:::: ui_qtext_image_outer
::: qtext_image_wrapper
![](images/qimg-56f691259e3e95c29c29712f569bc45b){.landscape
.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed
master_src="images/qimg-56f691259e3e95c29c29712f569bc45b" master_w="399"
master_h="364"}

or hinged:

:::: ui_qtext_image_outer
::: qtext_image_wrapper
![](images/qimg-d1cf223c88ae4d8f48f54364acf141d3){.landscape
.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed

I actually prefer the hinged cuffs because when they are applied they
offer some of the benefits of the UK speed cuffs (i.e. some rigidity
during transport, wrists cannot turn independently, etc), while offering
some of the ease of application (i.e. nearly one-handed application,
which is helpful because you can control the suspect with one hand and
apply the cuffs with the other), and they still fold in half for easier
carry.
