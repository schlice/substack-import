**Can you resist a citizen arrest?**

Sure you can! You can resist *any* arrest! Although I'd advise you to
not resist the arrest of a peace officer. Not only does a peace officer
in uniform acting under color of law have a presumption of lawful
action, they have *numbers* that you don't have. They can bring
overwhelming force in a very short amount of time. In short, you won't
win.

Regardless of who is making the arrest, what happens later depends
entirely on **whether or not the arrest had merit.**

*If it did*, then you'd still be arrested for the original charge, and
you'd also have a resisting arrest charge added.

*If it did not*, you would be filing charges against the person who
arrested you for unlawful detention, and if it was a citizen's arrest,
you'd be adding assault to that list as well. If they moved you from the
location of the incident, you'd also be adding kidnapping.
