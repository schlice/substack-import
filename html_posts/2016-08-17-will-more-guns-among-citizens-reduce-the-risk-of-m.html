Short answer: no.

What more guns among citizens ***won't*** do is ***increase*** the risk
of mass shootings. The converse (more guns reduces risk of mass
shootings) is not always true.

It may be possible that one armed person might be able to offer some
level of resistance to a mass shooter when they were expecting none.
This may dissuade the shooter from continuing.

*But remember, this is not why citizens are armed.* ***This is why the
police are armed****.*

Citizens are armed so that they can defend **themselves** or their
families. Citizens are ***not*** armed to be quasi-police and try to
take on every moron with a gun. It might be nice if an armed individual
used his training to try to stop a mass shooter, but it is by no means a
requirement. More power to him if he believes in his training enough to
try to intervene, but we are not asking this of concealed carry holders.
