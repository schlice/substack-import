<h2>Answer Comment</h2>

**Content:** [Can you please provide a list of these rights? Reason
being: I want to write a single contract that confers all these
\"rights\" on any couple and sell them to homosexual couples. I\'ll
totally make bank! You\'ll get all the rights without messing with the
state! Two signatures, and a notary stamp. \$99.99. (and I\'ll even
throw in the notarization for free)]{.rendered_qtext}
