Well, if you say it like *that...*

Sure, saying it like that certainly makes it sound like we can't trust
the Bible. I mean, it's thousands of years old. It's not one book, but
66 books, which were written by no fewer than forty different authors,
on three different continents, *in three different languages,* over the
span of 1500 years. How can you possibly trust such a collection of
works?

The short answer is that there are characteristics of these works which
clearly indicate **divine intervention** in their writing. In other
words, we know that the Bible is the *inspired word of God.*

Among all of that diversity in those writings, there is **unity** in the
message of the Bible. In other words, those books written over all that
time and all that space do not contradict one another. That central
message of the book is unchanged over all that time. And the book
contains no errors in historical or scientific information.

There is no possible way that humans could have accomplished such a feat
alone. If you think it is possible, I would challenge you to go into any
library anywhere in the world and select 66 works written by no fewer
than 40 different authors in no fewer than 3 languages written over the
span of 1500 years, and show that there is complete unity between them
and no errors of fact or historical information. Clearly, such a feat
would be impossible for humans to accomplish on their own.
