The short answer is **no,** we should not take the KJV as "the official
word of God," but not necessarily because of anything special regarding
the KJV.

The longer answer: there are two reasons why the answer is no:

- There is no one *best* translation of the Bible, but some come closer
  to the original words than others.
- The KJV has some well-known translation errors which have caused a
  great deal of confusion to believers.

**There is no one best translation of the Bible.** For completeness,
let's discuss how we translate the Bible, and why there are differences
in methodology when we do translations.

First, not all languages are created equal. Hebrew, as a language, has
fewer words than English, so each word has multiple meanings. So a
word-for-word translation would actually translate the word, but the
sentence may not convey the same meaning, because the author writing in
Hebrew may have meant one of the other meanings of the words. We have
exactly the opposite problem when translating from Greek. For example,
our word "love" in English has no fewer than *six* different words in
Greek. So when we say "love," which one of the six words in Greek are we
referring to?

Therefore, when doing a Bible translation, there are three different
philosophies that the translator can follow:

- Word-for-word
- Thought-for-thought
- Paraphrase

Each philosophy has its own advantages and disadvantages. Word-for-word
translations translate the words accurately, but sometimes miss the
thoughts. When you move up a level to thought-for-thought translations,
the translator will read an entire sentence in the source language and
then write it in the target language. It may not preserve the original
words, but it preserves the original thoughts. A paraphrase translation
doesn't worry about retention of words or thoughts, but it intentionally
*re-states* the paragraph, often adding many words in order to fully
describe what the original author was trying to say.

Here's a handy chart you can use to see where the various translations
land on the scale, from most word-for-word accuracy, to most
understandable in terms of what the author was trying to say.

According to this, the most accurate word-for-word translation is the
New American Standard Bible (NASB), followed closely by the Amplified
Bible (AMP).

**The problems with the KJV.** The main problem with the King James
Version of the Bible is that the manuscripts the translators were using
were very few in number and contained many copy errors.

We need to understand that while these translations were being created,
we were continually finding more manuscripts, and so our ability to
error-check them continually improved over time. This means that older
translations of the Bible contain more errors than newer ones, since we
had fewer manuscripts at the time that some translations of the Bible
were being written.

Since the production of the King James version, many more manuscripts
were discovered which allowed us to error-check the earlier manuscripts
and come to better consensus as to the original text. This lack of
abundant manuscripts at the time of KJV's creation has induced some
well-known issues with its translation, including the false inclusion of
[[1 John
5:7--8](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=342adb&url=https://ehrmanblog.org/problems-with-the-king-jame-version-what-were-the-translators-translating/){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="ehrmanblog.org"}]{.qlink_container}, which ended up being
included in the Latin Vulgate, and the KJV, but not later translations.
Another well-known issue with KJV is [[*the translation of the word
rasah in the Ten
Commandments*](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=9da804&url=https://www.gotquestions.org/you-shall-not-kill-vs-murder.html){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="gotquestions.org"}]{.qlink_container}. KJV translates the
word as "kill" and renders the Sixth Commandment: "Thou shalt not kill,"
but this translation of that word does not match the context nor the
usage of the word throughout the rest of the Bible. Subsequent
translations correctly translate the word as "murder" and the
Commandment is rendered: "You shall not murder."

We do not consider any one specific translation of the Bible to be the
"gold standard" of God's Word. The gold standard is the very first
writing, the majority of which have been lost to history. The best we
can do is to reconstruct the actual words from manuscripts, and the more
manuscripts we discover, the better we can reconstruct and error-check
the original text, and the closer we come to a true representation of
the original text.

The KJV has some well-known errors, and was produced at a period of
history when the quantity of manuscripts, and the overall quality of
those manuscripts, was low.

In other words, there are better translations. I would not rely on KJV
as my sole source of Biblical understanding.
