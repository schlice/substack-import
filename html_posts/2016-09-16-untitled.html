I actually *expanded* the scope beyond what the question asked, and what
the candidate mentioned in his ad, which was "terrorists." Of the
limited terrorist acts we've had in the United States which involved
guns, they were all legally acquired, with appropriate background checks
already having taken place. Major Hasan (the Fort Hood shooter) was an
active duty Army officer.

He wasn't really talking about gun violence when he referenced
background checks, which was what the question asked.
