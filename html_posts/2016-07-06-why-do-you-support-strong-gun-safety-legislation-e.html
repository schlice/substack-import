I support actual "gun safety" legislation. Universal background checks
don't make anyone safer. Nearly every mass shooter passed all his
background checks; mandating more background checks won't make anyone
safer.

I would support background checks for all gun transfers so long as we
can simplify and expand NICS, which will take many many federal dollars,
so I don't see it happening. Passing yet another cost on to gun owners
is also not the right thing to do, as you yet again limit access to guns
to the people who can afford all the government requirements.

I support licensing guns in the same way we license drivers. Make
easily-accessible testing, make inexpensive testing, make licenses valid
in all 50 states, etc.

Despite the home security argument, I support safe storage requirements.
You may believe differently, but I believe technology has come far
enough that you can nearly instantaneously get into your gun safe; fast
enough that you can safely arm yourself within seconds, and still keep
your gun out of the hands of criminals and the untrained/unauthorized.
Mandating safe storage will also help to further separate legal and
illegal gun transactions, and mandatory theft reporting will clearly
show when a gun goes from legal to illegal. It will also prevent most
guns from becoming illegal guns through theft. I think government should
be (partially, at least) paying for gun safes in homes. I remember the
last time we tried this; it was never mandated and they included enough
funds to provide free cable locks for long guns. What a waste. If you're
going to fund it, do it right.
