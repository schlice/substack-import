Wow, this really is an excellent question! I mean, if God makes you do
something, doesn't this mean you don't have free will? How can you have
free will if you are forced to do what God wants you to do?

Let's look at the technicality first. **We absolutely have free will.**
For example, Jonah did have free will, because Jonah chose to disobey
God. But that wasn't your question. You contrasted Jonah's free will to
obedience to God. While it's true that you can be disobedient to God
while exercising your free will, you can also freely choose obedience to
God's callings. So free will and obedience are not complete opposites.
You can exercise your free will by freely agreeing to follow God's call
on your life. In other words, "free will" is not "the opposite of
obedience."

What you instead mean by "free will" is "making my own choices, separate
from what God wants for my life." But *the very fact that you can do
this* ***proves*** that you have free will. If you had no free will, you
wouldn't be free to disobey God in the first place. Just ask Adam and
Eve. When they committed the world's first sin, they were exercising
their free will.

> **Does the story of Jonah show that God does not care about Jonah\'s
> free will?**

Far from it. The story of Jonah, just like the story of Adam and Eve,
shows that *God loves you* ***so much*** *that He is willing to let you
make choices which are clearly not good for you.* God's plans are for
our good (Jeremiah 29:11). He has "plans of fullness, not of harm" for
us. God's plans will never hurt us, and like the old saying goes, *if He
brings you* ***to*** *it, He'll bring you* ***through*** *it.* Often,
when we receive a call from God, we don't want to do it because we are
fearful that we will be hurt or that we will fail. But we were not
created with a spirit of fear. We were "fearfully and wonderfully made"
(Psalm 139:14) with a spirit of "power, love, and a sound mind" (2 Tim
1:7).

By the same token, *God is not going to alter His plans just because you
are fearful.* It is not up to God to change His plans to accommodate
you. It is up to you to acknowledge God's sovereignty and accept that
God will get you through whatever it is that He is calling you to do.

> **What about the free will of the people of Nineveh?**

Oh, they exercised their free will, all right.

> *Now the word of the LORD came to Jonah the son of Amittai, saying,
> "Arise, go to Nineveh, that great city, and call out against it, for
> their evil has come up before me." \-- Jonah 1:1--2 ESV*

The people of Nineveh were "evil," which means that they *actively
disobeyed God.* This wasn't just accidental, random sin. This is
**active, willing disobedience** which says, "I know what is right. I
know what God wants me to do, **and I am going to do the opposite, to**
***spite God***."

To that end, what we're saying is that **the people of Nineveh
absolutely had free will,** and they used it to actively oppose God's
good plans for them.
