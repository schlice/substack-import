**Content:** [The 9mm is only better because the ammunition is far more
readily available worldwide than 10mm ammunition. Walther and Glock are
both great manufacturers, and their weapons are top-notch. The only
reason I prefer the 9mm is the fact that the ammunition is more readily
available.]{.rendered_qtext}
