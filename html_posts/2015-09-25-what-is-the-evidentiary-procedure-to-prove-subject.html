**Content:** [*Original question: What is the evidentiary procedure to
prove subjective intent?*\
\
There is no evidentiary procedure to prove subjective intent. There is
only evidentiary procedure to prove objective intent.\
\
In contract law, subjective intent will only prevail over objective
intent if that personal meaning was known to the other party. Hidden
beliefs or reservations are usually not taken into account when the
other party knew what the intent was.\
\
Usually, the objective intent (such as a signed contract) will prevail.\
\
*Updated question: What is the evidentiary procedure to prove subjective
intent in Criminal Law?*\
\
The \"reasonable person\" standard is what is normally used in most
court systems in the world to determine intent.\
