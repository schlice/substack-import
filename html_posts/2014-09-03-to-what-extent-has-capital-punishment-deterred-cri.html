**Content:** [No, my belief about the death penalty remains unchanged:
we should not have it.\
\
The risk of killing someone who might potentially be innocent is too
great of a risk to take, in my opinion. And the death penalty, in its
current incantation, does not deter anyone from committing crimes they
were going to commit anyway (Dude, don\'t do that, you\'ll get the
chair!). There are decades of legal challenges that have to be waded
through before someone can be put to death, and the possibility of being
released on a technicality is great, because the burden on the state is
so high.\
\
Life without the possibility of parole is a better punishment. Remove
the individual from society. If, in 20 years, some technology comes
along that can prove someone\'s innocence (like the story you quoted),
all the better.\
\
I understand this will increase the prison population, I get that. It\'s
a small price to pay in my opinion.\
\
EDIT: If we can remove one of the largest sources of the prison
population from prison (drug offenders), we can afford to keep \"real\"
criminals in prison longer. See [[What do police officers think about
legalizing drugs? Would it make their jobs harder or
easier?](https://www.quora.com/What-do-police-officers-think-about-legalizing-drugs-Would-it-make-their-jobs-harder-or-easier)]{.qlink_container}
for a great discussion on why it is so futile to keep these people in
prison.\
\
The major reason we have drug addicts in prison is because the medical
community doesn\'t treat drug addicts as patients. It doesn\'t yet fully
recognize that addiction is a disease and that addicts are patients. It
still contends that addiction is a choice and that addicts are bad
actors, leaving the problem of addicts to the legal system instead of
the medical system. Once that hurdle is overcome (we start treating our
addicts as patients rather than inmates), we can alleviate a major
burden on the criminal justice system, and keep the real criminals in
prison.]{.rendered_qtext}
