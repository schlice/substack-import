<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [No, my belief about the death penalty remains unchanged:<br>we should not have it.\<br>\<br>The risk of killing someone who might potentially be innocent is too<br>great of a risk to take, in my opinion. And the death penalty, in its<br>current incantation, does not deter anyone from committing crimes they<br>were going to commit anyway (Dude, don\'t do that, you\'ll get the<br>chair!). There are decades of legal challenges that have to be waded<br>through before someone can be put to death, and the possibility of being<br>released on a technicality is great, because the burden on the state is<br>so high.\<br>\<br>Life without the possibility of parole is a better punishment. Remove<br>the individual from society. If, in 20 years, some technology comes<br>along that can prove someone\'s innocence (like the story you quoted),<br>all the better.\<br>\<br>I understand this will increase the prison population, I get that. It\'s<br>a small price to pay in my opinion.\<br>\<br>EDIT: If we can remove one of the largest sources of the prison<br>population from prison (drug offenders), we can afford to keep \"real\"<br>criminals in prison longer. See [[What do police officers think about<br>legalizing drugs? Would it make their jobs harder or<br>easier?](https://www.quora.com/What-do-police-officers-think-about-legalizing-drugs-Would-it-make-their-jobs-harder-or-easier)]{.qlink_container}<br>for a great discussion on why it is so futile to keep these people in<br>prison.\<br>\<br>The major reason we have drug addicts in prison is because the medical<br>community doesn\'t treat drug addicts as patients. It doesn\'t yet fully<br>recognize that addiction is a disease and that addicts are patients. It<br>still contends that addiction is a choice and that addicts are bad<br>actors, leaving the problem of addicts to the legal system instead of<br>the medical system. Once that hurdle is overcome (we start treating our<br>addicts as patients rather than inmates), we can alleviate a major<br>burden on the criminal justice system, and keep the real criminals in<br>prison.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
