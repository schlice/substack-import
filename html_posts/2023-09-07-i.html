*Homeowners* do not form HOAs. *Developers* implement HOAs in the
neighborhoods they develop.

They do this because they want to maintain the look of the neighborhood,
as usually the pre-designed look of the neighborhood is one of its key
selling points. Also, a high-value neighborhood allows the developer to
sell other high-value neighborhoods by pointing back at the
neighborhoods they've already developed.

So if you build a 200-home neighborhood in a craftsman or farmhouse
style, someone changing the fa√ßade of their house to beach coastal would
definitely look out of place, and would cause nearby houses to lose
value, causing the neighborhood as a whole to lose value.

So developers will implement HOAs to keep the overall look and feel of
the neighborhood that they designed so that they can use the
neighborhood as a reference neighborhood when the build and sell other
neighborhoods.

\

But HOAs benefit homeowners as well, even though some people vehemently
oppose HOAs "telling them what to do" (even though government zoning
rules already tell them what to do, but whatever). Homeowners benefit
from a neat, well-kept neighborhood and home values which remain as high
as possible. And homeowners do not have to deal with "that neighbor" who
paints their house electric blue, or who has six cars on their front
lawn, only two of which have wheels, or the one who has trouble with the
days of the week and puts their trash at the curb the day after trash
collection, leaving it there all week until the next collection, and who
thinks that cutting grass is for someone else, instead leaving their
lawn to become a jungle of tall weeds. Those things reduce the values of
neighboring homes (since no one wants to live next door to that). HOAs
address that.

Also, the neighborhood can benefit from *amenities* like pools and
clubhouses, and HOA dues fund those amenities.
