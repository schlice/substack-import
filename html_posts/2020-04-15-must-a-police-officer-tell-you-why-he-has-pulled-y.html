**Are police required to tell you why they pull you over?**

In most states, there is no legal requirement for the police to tell you
why they stopped you. Their legal requirement is to tell a **judge** why
they stopped you. They tell you out of courtesy.

Legally, they are only required to ensure you are a licensed driver and
that your registration is valid and that your insurance is up to date
(requirements for those things vary by state).
