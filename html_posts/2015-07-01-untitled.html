<h2>Answer Comment</h2>

**Content:** [\"Making\" new jobs is never a problem. I can make new
jobs all day long. However, this new job is a government job, and that
means the money for the salary comes from the taxpayers. Since that
money is severely limited, both by law and by necessity, the city
council has to increase the amount of money they give to the police in
their budget. When the police ask for a budget increase, how we\'ll do
you think that\'s going to go over in city council? Right, not so well.\
\
I\'m all for creating new highly paid technical jobs. But it\'s up to
taxpayers to foot the bill, and if taxpayers say no to the increase, you
don\'t get your cops into cameras.\
\
And then people will say, \"But Obama *gave* you the cameras. Why are
you asking for tax increases to pay for them? Stupid greedy
police.\"]{.rendered_qtext}
