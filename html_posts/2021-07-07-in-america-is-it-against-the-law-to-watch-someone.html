*(US answer only)*

There is no "duty to intervene" law in the United States when it comes
to suicide. The only laws that might apply are for certain categories of
people who are "mandatory reporters" who learn of someone's desire to
commit a crime, or to harm themselves, and are required by law to report
that. Some mandatory reporters might be doctors, teachers, mental health
professionals, etc.

And again, this only applies if you "watch" and do nothing. If you did
*anything at all* to "encourage" or "assist" the person in their
suicide, then you can be held criminally and civilly liable for the
death.

But to answer your specific question, it is not against the law to watch
someone commit suicide and not intervene to stop them.
