**How can\'t license, patent, and copyright exist in socialism?**

Because Socialism is the political philosophy which states that the
means of production, distribution, and exchange are owned or regulated
by the community. This also means that everything you produce is owned
by the community, not you. There is no private ownership of anything.

Therefore, since you don't own your creative ideas, you cannot patent or
copyright them. You cannot license out your ideas to others to use,
because you do not own those ideas.

In Socialism, everything is produced by the cooperative efforts of
people, so there is no "individual ownership" of anything.
