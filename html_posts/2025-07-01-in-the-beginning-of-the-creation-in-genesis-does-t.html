Some symbolism does equate heaven and earth as head and body. In the
creation account of Genesis, the phrase \"heaven and earth\" is a way of
referring to all of creation. While heaven is the space of God and earth
is the space of humanity, these spaces are not always separate, and
there\'s a biblical theme of God bringing them back together. Some
interpretations see a connection between Christ being \"the head of the
body\" (referring to humanity) and the idea of \"new heaven\" as the
head and \"new earth\" as the body united in Christ.

No.

Eve is a created being, just as Adam was a created being. This means
they have absolute beginnings. So no, Eve did not "exist" as Christ
existed before He took on flesh.
