**Can an HOA board legally vote on matters that they are personally
involved in? I believe my service animal was illegally evicted from my
home. What can I do to get him back home? Can I appeal their vote?**

Most of the answers have touched on the first part of your question:
since Board members are residents too, they can indeed vote on matters
that they are personally involved in.

The second part of your question pertains to service animals. While most
answerers are discussing ADA, it doesn't really apply when it comes to
housing.

The actual authority is in the Fair Housing Amendments Act (FHAA). It
carries roughly the same weight as ADA, but some different
responsibilities.

- Landlords can ask to see proof that a service animal is trained before
  providing protected benefits.
- Landlords can ask to see proof of a qualifying disability and proof
  that a service animal is warranted before allowing a service animal in
  a unit or neighborhood which has animal or breed restrictions.
- Reasonable accommodations to a tenant could not impose an undue
  financial burden or require a fundamental alteration to underlying
  function.

Notify your HOA that your service animal was unfairly denied under Fair
Housing Act laws, and that you will be pursuing legal action if they do
not immediately reverse course and allow your animal.
