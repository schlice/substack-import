**If a person falls to the floor, and does not have a heartbeat for two
hours, they would be declared dead. As a pro-life individual, how is
this different from a week-old fetus?**

Because the person "falling to the floor" without a heartbeat wasn't
violently torn apart by medical tools or vacuumed off of the sofa and
deposited on to the floor in a heap of goo.

For a fetus, the person falling to the floor without a heartbeat would
be the equivalent of the fetus dying in the womb through no fault of
anyone and with no intervention by anyone. It's a condition we call
"stillborn."
