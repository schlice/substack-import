**Content:** [First of all, the concept of a personal thermonuclear
device is ridiculous. We already have the most efficient tool for
killing a specific individual available to us.\
\
Individuals do not have the right to kill mass quantities of people.
Governments sometimes believe that they do (or at least be able to
defend themselves against others who believe they do), which is why they
have tactical nukes.\
\
Since individuals aren\'t killing mass quantities of people,
thermonuclear devices for individuals do not make logical
sense.]{.rendered_qtext}
