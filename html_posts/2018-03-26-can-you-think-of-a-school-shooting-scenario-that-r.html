**Can you think of a school shooting scenario that requiring clear
backpacks would plausibly prevent?**

When you think that it's okay for clear handbags (and no X-ray machines)
to be acceptable when entering an airport, then it will be acceptable
for securing a school.

We've been successfully creating gun-free areas (in the business, called
"sterile areas") in airports for decades. Have you ever been to a
courthouse? Have you ever entered a government building? Have you taken
a tour of the White House? You virtually cannot get guns into those
places.

Why is securing a school seemingly so difficult?

It's because ***there is no will to do it***. Parents, ***DESPITE
PARKLAND***, still cry, "Schools are not jails! We don't want our
students going to school in a jail!"

So until people get over themselves, nothing will change.

And no, clear backpacks won't do anything other than to make money for
the clear backpack industry.
