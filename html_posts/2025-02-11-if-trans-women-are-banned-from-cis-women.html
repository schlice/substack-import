It's not complex at all. I don't understand why we make it so complex.

If you want to participate in gender-separated sports, you participate
as the gender recorded on your birth certificate at birth. If a birth
certificate doesn't exist (or there is question as to whether the gender
was correctly recorded at birth), then **biology** determines your
gender for the purposes of participation in sports, not personal
feelings.

That said, the problem of intersex people is a much harder problem to
tackle, *but a much less pressing issue for protecting the integrity of
women's sports.*

Also note that this courtesy is limited. I will only tolerate hateful
behavior for a limited time before I am done wasting my time (and yours)
and will just delete the whole thing. Plan accordingly.*
