Oops, you made a typo in your question. Let me fix that for you.

**Why are** ***FOREIGN ACTORS*** **calling in bomb threats to schools
and municipal buildings in Springfield Ohio, what are they trying to
accomplish with these violent acts?**

There. Fixed it for you.

And it's happening because JD Vance called out the very real problem of
the influx of mostly temporary Haitian immigrants in Springfield.

According to the AP (not known to be very right-leaning), here's what is
happening there:

> Springfield shed manufacturing jobs and its population decreased
> significantly as a result toward the end of the last century. But the
> city has made a concerted effort to lure employers and Haitian
> immigrants have helped meet rising demand for labor in factories and
> warehouses. Word spread, and Haitians began arriving in greater
> numbers over the last few years.
>
> Haitians in Springfield and elsewhere came to the U.S. to flee
> violence in their home country. Many Haitians are here under a federal
> program called Temporary Protected Status, which allows them to
> temporarily live and work in the U.S. because conditions are
> considered too dangerous for them to return to
> Haiti.[\[1\]](#Sqqhb){#cite-Sqqhb .citation_link}
