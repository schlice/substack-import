**Why does the media continue to focus on gun control when most of the
recent shooters have been on psychiatric drugs?**

You have two questions here:

- Why does the media focus on gun control
- Do recent shootings have a correlation to psychiatric drugs?

To your first question, the media focuses on gun control because it
sells. It makes them money. When they focus on guns, people
watch/listen/read. When people do that, the media outlet gets more
money. This really isn't that difficult.

To your second question, there may be a ***correlation*** between mass
shootings and psychiatric drugs. I am reasonably certain this is what
your article is pointing out.

However, let's not confuse ***correlation*** with ***causation***. Just
because there is a correlation between mass shootings and psychiatric
drugs does not mean that there is a *causal link*. In other words, there
is no evidence that psychiatric drugs cause mass shootings.

For example, there is a positive correlation between US crude oil
imports from Norway, and drivers killed in collisions with railway
trains.

Should we conclude that in order to reduce the number of deaths caused
by collision with railway trains that we should reduce US crude oil
imports from Norway? Of course not. That is because *correlation does
not imply causation.*

Similarly, while there may be a correlation between mass shooters and
psychiatric drugs, this does not mean that those mass shootings were
caused by the drugs.

If anything, it points out the fact that these people were under the
care and guidance of physicians who could prescribe them psychiatric
drugs. That's all it indicates.

However, were the people in counseling? Were they making progress?
Psychiatrists (physicians who specialize in mental diseases and
conditions) don't often perform counseling; that is usually left to
counselors. Counselors and psychologists (PhDs in mental diseases and
conditions) cannot prescribe psychiatric medications. And ne'er the
twain shall meet. Yet another problem with our mental health system in
America. The people who prescribe the drugs don't do the counseling, and
vice versa. Unless there is tight coordination between the two (and in
most cases, there is not), it is highly unlikely that one knows much
about what the other is doing, or why.
