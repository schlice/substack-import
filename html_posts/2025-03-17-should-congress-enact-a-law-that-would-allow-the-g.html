There are really no Constitutional restrictions barring Congress from
declaring war against anyone, except for the one where Congress cannot
declare war against a state within the US. So long as the entity is "a
foreign entity," Congress can declare war against them.

So an NGO? If that NGO is outside the United States, there would be
little question whether or not Congress could declare war against them.
If that NGO was *inside* the United States, the boundaries get a little
fuzzier. Since the only restriction against declaring war would be
against a US state, then declaring war against an NGO *might* be
Constitutionally permissible.

Finally, I'm not sure a **law** would overcome the **Constitution**. I
think you'd need a Constitutional amendment, if it was found to be
unconstitutional, to permit Congress to declare war against an NGO
within the United States.
