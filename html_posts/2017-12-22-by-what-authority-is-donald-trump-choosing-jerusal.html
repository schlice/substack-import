**By what authority is Donald Trump choosing Jerusalem as Israel\'s
capital?**

Trump is not *choosing* Jerusalem. Congress *recognized* Israel's
sovereign right to name their own capital city in 1995, when they passed
the Jerusalem Embassy Act. Trump is merely fulfilling **the law** which,
incidentally, **three presidents failed to fulfill:** Clinton, Bush 43
and Obama.

If Congress has heartburn with this, they should repeal their own law. I
doubt this will happen though.
