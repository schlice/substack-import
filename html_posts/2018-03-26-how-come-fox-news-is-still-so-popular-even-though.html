One of the things Fox has done effectively is to separate their two
programming branches: **opinion programming** and **news programming**.
The other networks haven't even attempted to do this.

What Fox has *not* done well is to distinguish the two to their viewers.

I would like to see Fox improve this. I would like to see them change
their scroll somehow, to indicate that the currently airing program is
coming from the Opinion Programming department or from the News
Programming department. While they do an admirable job keeping the two
separate, they do not do a very good job at identifying which
programming department is currently airing a segment.
