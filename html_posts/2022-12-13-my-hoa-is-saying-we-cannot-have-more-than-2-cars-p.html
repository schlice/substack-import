First of all, the answer is in your Governing Documents.

Secondly, the HOA cannot tell you how many cars you can *own*. But they
can tell you how many cars you can *park in the neighborhood*. Perhaps
you have small streets with little on-street parking. Whatever the
reason, if your Governing Documents allow the HOA to control how many
cars each household can park in the neighborhood, then it's legal.

Again, for reference, they are not telling you how many cars you can
*own*. They're simply telling you how many cars you can *park in the
neighborhood*.

Note that they usually do this by telling you how many cars can be
parked in your driveway, and that in order to fill your driveway with
cars, you must first fill your garage with cars. Note that it's not
telling you that you must ***only*** put cars in your garage. It's just
that if you're going to complain that there isn't enough room in your
driveway for all your cars, your garage must be full of cars before you
can make that claim.

And finally, as part of a very controversial topic, **yes**, the HOA can
tell you where and whether you can park your cars, even on a public
street. Now I know you may believe that the HOA cannot issue you a fine
for parking on a public street. If you're going to bounce into the
comments and yell at me and tell me that there is no way the HOA can
issue you a fine for parking on a public street, **read this first.**

- First, ***all states and all HOAs are different.*** Some states do not
  permit HOAs to fine homeowners for parking on pubic streets. ***BUT
  MOST DO***. And I can assure you, from personal experience as a Board
  member in two states: **courts routinely rule these fines are valid.**
- Second, ***the HOA is not giving you a state, county, city, or town
  parking ticket***. The HOA is giving you ***a fine for violating HOA
  rules.*** You can violate HOA rules **anywhere** within the purview of
  the HOA: on a private driveway, in a designated parking space at the
  clubhouse, on private property or on HOA-owned property, and even on a
  public street inside the HOA. The HOA has broad statutory authority to
  enforce its rules within its ***entire area of purview.*** Clearly,
  this fine would not be reflected on your state driving record, because
  it's not a government parking violation. It's a violation of HOA rules
  only.

You are welcome to believe that the HOA does not have this authority.
You are, of course, welcome to test this theory at any time. Here's how
you must do it:

1.  Live in a community with an HOA whose Governing Documents contain a
    "no street parking" rule.
2.  Violate this rule. The only way you can challenge the legality of
    the rule is to become a victim of it. It's called *standing.*
3.  When you are fined, sue the HOA and make your claim that the rule in
    question violates state law because the HOA cannot fine you for
    parking on a public street.
4.  *Be prepared to lose.* I'm not saying you will lose, but you must be
    prepared to lose. That means you have to be prepared for what will
    happen if you do lose: you will owe not only your HOA fine (and any
    late fees), but you'll also owe attorney's fees and court costs.
    Depending on your state, you may also have to pay *the HOA's court
    fees and attorney's fees as well.*

I'm certain that some of you still want to go to the comments and tell
me that the HOA simply doesn't have that authority. Unless you are in a
position to test this theory yourself, please save it. None of us can
tell whether or not any particular Governing Documents in any particular
state has unlawful rules in them. The only way to determine if any
particular rule is lawful is to violate it and then challenge its
legality. I will delete any further comments regarding legality of
parking.

Let me give you an example. Let's say the HOA has a rule that you have
to bring your trash cans in within one day after trash is collected. But
your trash can is sitting near the curb on a public street. Can the HOA
fine you for having your can *in a public street?* Yes, of course they
can. *But it's not an HOA trash can, it's a city trash can, on a
city-owned street! The HOA can't fine me for leaving it on a city
street!* Well, yes they can, because you violated the HOA's rule.

Where and when the HOA tells you that you can have your cars is exactly
similar. Just because the city allows you to park on the street does not
mean that the HOA cannot be ***more*** restrictive.
