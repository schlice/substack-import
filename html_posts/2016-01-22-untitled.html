<h2>Answer Comment</h2>
<div>

**Content:** [Because police are not a government-provided security
force. They are, instead, law enforcement. This means that the police
are there to enforce the law (which implies that the law has already
been broken). That the police protect you *from* crime is ancillary and
only if they have the means to do so.\
\
The 14th amendment guarantee that the government cannot take life,
liberty, or property without due process of law does not place a
requirement on the government to protect those same
rights.]{.rendered_qtext}
