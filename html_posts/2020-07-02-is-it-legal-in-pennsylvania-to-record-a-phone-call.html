**Is it legal in Pennsylvania to record a phone call that does not
include the other persons consent, BUT it does not record their voice?
In other words, only my side of the conversation is audible.**

*(NOTE: IANAL and this is not legal advice)*

Since you are only recording yourself, you're not really recording a
phone call. Recording a phone call implies that you record both sides to
the conversation. So in my opinion, this recording would be just fine,
as long as you cannot hear the other party on the recording.

Do be aware however that Pennsylvania is an "all-party" state. In order
to record a phone call, all parties to the call must be aware and agree
to the recording.

Some people like to comment. Some people like to engage with me in a
civil manner, and I did kinda miss that\...a little. But do not
misunderstand, I take this step very cautiously. My mental well-being
isn\'t worth your harassing, inane behavior. If you don\'t like what I
wrote, tough shit. If my answer is grammatically low-quality or is
un-cited opinion masquerading as fact, downvote it. If you think I\'m
wrong, write your own answer. But Quora is a question-and-answer site,
not a debate site. If you are simply commenting to tell me \"ackshually,
you\'re wrong,\" don\'t be surprised if I quietly delete your comment.
Put anything vaguely harassing in there, and your deletion will be
followed by a block and a mute. I will do this immediately and with no
compunction. You have been warned. Be nice.*
