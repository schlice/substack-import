No.

Emotional Support Animals are not the same as Service Animals.

Service animals are usually dogs which are specially trained to do work
or perform tasks which assist a person with an ADA-recognized
disability. Some examples may be seeing eye dogs, or seizure dogs.

Emotional Support animals are not specially trained, but that doesn't
mean they don't provide a benefit. They provide comfort to people with
certain medical conditions, such as anxiety, depression, learning
disabilities, attention deficit disorder, chronic stress, and
postâ€‘traumatic stress disorder. To have any recognized ESA at all, you
must have a doctor's prescription for one.

That said, ESAs are not treated the same as service animals. Service
animals are allowed anywhere that people are allowed, and businesses
cannot deny entrance to a person with a service animal. ESAs are not
afforded the same treatment, and businesses can choose whether or not
they will allow ESAs into their establishments.

Housing also presents differences between the two. Landlords cannot
discriminate against a person with a service animal, since they are
legally allowed to be anywhere a person can be. ESAs, however, can only
live with their owners in "no pet" housing when there is a valid
doctor's prescription. ESAs can be restricted from any other housing
arrangement, including visiting a "no pet" building.
