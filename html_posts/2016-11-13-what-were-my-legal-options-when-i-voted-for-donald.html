None. Zip. Zilch. Zero. Nada.

Once you cast your vote **and it is counted**, it\'s over. Your vote is
permanent.

Some localities allow you to change your vote up to the time the polls
close, some do not. Regardless, once the polls close, the decision is
final. The tribe has spoken, so to speak.

Vote smarter next time.
