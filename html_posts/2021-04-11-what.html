A great website exists called
[[biblehub.com](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=b242a6&url=http://biblehub.com){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="biblehub.com"}]{.qlink_container} where you can look at the
various translations of the Bible side by side. So if you want to pull
up the King James Version and compare it to the Greek version, you can
do that. Whichever translations you wish to view, you can see them all
there. It\'s a great way to see how the older texts were translated into
what we read today.
