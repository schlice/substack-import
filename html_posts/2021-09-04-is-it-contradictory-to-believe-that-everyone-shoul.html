Not at all.

You can believe that vaccination is the right choice for most people,
but still believe that people have the right to choose for themselves
what is best.

The big kicker: **simply believing that vaccination is the right choice
for most people does not mean that you can force people to get
vaccinated.**

**It also does not mean that you have the right to exclude those people
from society, or deny them essential services.**

This is where the majority of people fall down when they are comparing
the ability of a person to decide for themselves whether or not
vaccination is appropriate.

*If you truly believe that people have the right to choose for
themselves, then you have no right to exclude them from any facet of
society because of their choice.*

Don\'t get me wrong, businesses still have the right to determine which
patrons come into their establishment. And if the business (except in
Florida) wants to restrict patrons in their business to people who are
vaccinated, they can do that.

But you can\'t deny hospital beds to the unvaccinated. You can\'t deny
ambulance service to the unvaccinated. You can\'t deny any
taxpayer-funded service from the unvaccinated.
