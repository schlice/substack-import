**Content:** [Fantastic question! There are many great resources you can
use to find out everything you want to know, and not the least of these
is your local police department. No one wants more than to see you own,
carry, and use a firearm safely and legally than the police. So check
their website; they probably have links to the pertinent laws in your
jurisdiction about ownership, carry, and storage of firearms.\
\
I would suggest taking a firearms course from a nationally-accredited
instructor. Whether you like their policies or not, the NRA has a list
of over 97,000 instructors and range safety officers, more than 5,700
coaches, and more than 1,800 training counselors. [[Check out their
