<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Fantastic question! There are many great resources you can<br>use to find out everything you want to know, and not the least of these<br>is your local police department. No one wants more than to see you own,<br>carry, and use a firearm safely and legally than the police. So check<br>their website; they probably have links to the pertinent laws in your<br>jurisdiction about ownership, carry, and storage of firearms.\<br>\<br>I would suggest taking a firearms course from a nationally-accredited<br>instructor. Whether you like their policies or not, the NRA has a list<br>of over 97,000 instructors and range safety officers, more than 5,700<br>coaches, and more than 1,800 training counselors. [[Check out their<br>website](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=0f5e7e&url=http://training.nra.org/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="nra.org"}]{.qlink_container} for more information.\<br>\<br>EDIT: This is a better link for where [[NRA<br>Instructors](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=7ea809&url=http://www.nrainstructors.org/searchcourse.aspx){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="nrainstructors.org"}]{.qlink_container} can be found near<br>you.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
