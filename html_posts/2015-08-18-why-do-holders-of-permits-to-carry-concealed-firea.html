**Content:** [If I want it known that I am armed, I will open carry.
Then you can take one look at me and know that I am armed. I don\'t need
a permit for that in my state.\
\
If I ***don\'t*** want it known that I am armed, I will conceal. And
I\'m good at it. I have not yet been identified by anyone as a concealed
carrier. Even in situations where my gun has inadvertently \"printed\"
(i.e. shown through my clothing), I wasn\'t ever identified as a
concealed carrier.\
\
And that\'s the point.\
\
Concealed carry, as has already been pointed out several times here, is
exactly that: concealed. The only time you should ever know that I\'m
carrying is when I tell you. Other than that, it\'s a secret. It\'s
supposed to be.]{.rendered_qtext}
