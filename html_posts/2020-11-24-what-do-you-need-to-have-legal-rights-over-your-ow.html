**What do you need to have legal rights over your own painting or
instrumental?**

(US answer only)

Technically, you need *nothing*. Your original works are protected from
the moment you create them and record them in a place where others can
perceive them.

However, in order for that protection to be *recognized*, you must file
for a copyright. A fully-filed copyright is needed to initiate legal
actions against those who might try to duplicate your original works.

Take a look at the [[U.S. Copyright
Office](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=49661f&url=https://www.copyright.gov/index.html){.external_link

qt-tooltip="copyright.gov"}]{.qlink_container} to find out how to
register a copyright.
