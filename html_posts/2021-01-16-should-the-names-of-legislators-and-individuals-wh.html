**Should the names of everyone who is issued a permit to carry a
concealed firearm be published each year so that everyone knows whom to
avoid?**

I have a better idea.

If you think that so many people agree with you, you should easily be
able to lobby your state's representatives (who, clearly, must also
agree with you) to make open carry legal.

Then, you don't need to waste your time publishing anything. You can
tell who is carrying, because you can see their gun, right there on
their hip. Then you can avoid that person.

Simple.

So with that in mind, ask yourself this question: *why don't more states
allow open carry?*

I mean, just look at Florida. Concealed carry permits are cheap and easy
to get, but open carry is 100% illegal. Why is that? Perhaps because
Florida allows people to *conceal* the fact that they are carrying?
Perhaps because some people are uncomfortable around firearms?
***Perhaps because people not breaking the law have not given up their
right to privacy?***

You may be willing to give up other people's right to privacy, but they
are not.
