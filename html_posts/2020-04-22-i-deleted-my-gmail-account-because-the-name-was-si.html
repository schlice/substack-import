**I deleted my Gmail account because the name was silly. Will anyone
still be able to see the address?**

No. Once the address is deleted, it no longer exists as an account or an
address. Anyone trying to send email to that address will get a bounce
message stating that the address in question does not exist.

That said, any emails you sent using that account will still exist, and
will still have come from
\<silly_name\>@[[gmail.com](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=fe8b21&url=http://gmail.com){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="gmail.com"}]{.qlink_container}, and that won't ever change.
