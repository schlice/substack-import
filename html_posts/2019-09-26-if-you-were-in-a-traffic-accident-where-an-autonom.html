**If you were in a traffic accident where an autonomous system
controlling another vehicle was either primarily or secondarily a fault
in the crash, who would you sue and who would you work to have thrown
out of public office for creating this issue?**

Current autonomous driving systems require a human in control at all
times who can step in and override the system if something fails. So
currently if someone had their Tesla on autopilot and caused an
accident, you sue the driver, even if the driver was not physically
controlling the vehicle.

In the future, driverless vehicles will have to become far more robust
before we will ever let them out on the roads. Vehicles must learn to
communicate with each other, and any disconnected vehicles will be
avoided like the plague. We will have to determine how to determine
fault when driverless vehicles are part of auto accidents before we let
them on the roads. Once we do this, we'll be able to successfully find
fault when a driverless vehicle is involved in a crash.
