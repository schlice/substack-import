**Content:** [For your convenience, I added \"Hypothetical Scenarios\"
to the list of question topics, as this is an absolutely hypothetical
scenario.\
\
The law provides no exceptions to assault (or assault and battery). Any
exception you can think of would be an affirmative defense to the
charge, not an exception to the law.\
\
So to answer the specific question, if a police officer asks you to
punch them and you do, they can arrest you for assault (and usually
assault on a peace officer is an aggravating circumstance).\
\
You can then use \"he told me to hit him\" as an affirmative defense.
You would have to prove that he told you to hit him. I hope one of your
friends was recording the whole thing. Ultimately, I don\'t know how
much difference it would make in your sentencing.]{.rendered_qtext}
