If you feel you are in danger, you are well within your rights to grab
your phone and call 911. Stay on the phone with the 911 dispatcher, and
keep walking. If you're within walking distance of a police station, go
there.

Some other things you can do:

- Move to the other side of the street
- Change directions once you've crossed the street
- Circle one block over and over again
