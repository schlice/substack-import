**Does the Americans with Disabilities Act prevent an employer from
being fired if their Tourette syndrome causes them to use profanity on
the job?**

The Americans with Disabilities Act prevents employers from terminating
employees specifically because they have a disability, Instead, it
requires employers to provide *reasonable accommodations* to employees
with disabilities.

It does not require that the employer change his or her business in an
*unreasonable manner*. For example, it does not require that the
employer spend inordinate amounts of money to accommodate the employee.
It does not require the employer to change business practices or change
how they conduct business.

In this case, the employer could rightly be concerned if the person with
Tourette's Syndrome were in a customer-facing role. Profanity in a
customer-facing position would not be ideal. If this business did not
have any positions that this person could do which were not customer
facing, the employer could probably not find a position this person
could perform, and could reasonably terminate that employee.

If the employer had a non customer-facing role in which they could place
the employee for which he is qualified, he could place the employee in
that role.

**TL;DR: Under certain conditions, the employee can be fired and it
would not violate the ADA.**
