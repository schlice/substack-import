**Can the Democratic party successfully bring suit against the
Republican party for gerrymandering thus denying Democrats their right
of association?**

Either party can sue for gerrymandering. The problem: *it's very
difficult to tell actual gerrymandering (illegal) from genuine
redistricting (legal).*

Essentially, it's really easy to say what districts *should not* look
like. Some of the worst gerrymandering is easy to spot.

Some states attempt to do this by taking redistricting out of the hands
of politicians. Colorado *literally did this Tuesday.* We voted for
amendments to our state Constitution which takes redistricting out of
the hands of politicians and gives it to an independent commission which
is made up of 12 members: four from the state's largest political party,
four from the state's second largest political party, and four
independent members. They will draw boundaries for both Congressional
districts and State Congress districts (two separate Amendments were
passed for that: Amendment Y and Amendment Z). According to our new
Constitutional amendment, "\[t\]he redistricting commission should set
district lines by ensuring Constitutionally guaranteed voting rights,
including the protection of minority group voting, as well as fair and
effective representation of constituents using politically neutral
criteria."

But lawsuits about gerrymandering rarely yield results, since it is very
difficult to spot actual gerrymandering except in the worst cases.
Gerrymandering is difficult to separate from legal and necessary
redistricting without resorting to simply removing the political
motivation altogether.
