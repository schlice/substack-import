Because the seller broke a Federal law, and so the Federal government is
pressing charges.

Henry \"Michael\" Williams didn't violate any laws with the sale, but he
did violate the law which says that convicted felons cannot own
firearms. He is being charged with unlawful possession of a firearm,
which he was not allowed to own. This is the gun he sold to Malik Faisal
Akram.

The sale itself was not illegal, but the seller was not eligible to own
the firearm he sold, so that is the charge he is facing.
