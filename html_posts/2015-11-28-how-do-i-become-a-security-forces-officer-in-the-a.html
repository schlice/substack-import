**Content:** [You will go through OTS as normal (OTS stands on its own,
as it is the commissioning source). Once you are a commissioned Second
Lieutenant, you will attend Air Force Security Forces Academy at
Lackland AFB in Texas. This 80 day course covers standard law
enforcement topics as well as specialty training such as convoy defense,
missile security, and capture and recovery of nuclear weapons.\
\
From there, you will proceed to your first duty assignment and be
immediately put to work.\
\
You can go on to specialty training after that.\
\
Talk with your recruiter about this if you want to learn
more.]{.rendered_qtext}
