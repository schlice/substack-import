Abortion remains one of the most contested moral and ethical dilemmas in
modern society. To those of us who hold a pro-life stance, abortion is
not simply a choice that a woman makes, it is the termination of an
innocent human life. The act itself is inherently evil because it
disregards the fundamental right to life of an unborn child.

The moral argument against abortion is deeply rooted in the belief that
life begins at conception. **Science confirms that a unique human being,
with distinct DNA, is formed at fertilization.** This is well-known, and
unsurprisingly, well-accepted scientifically, a fact that pro-choice
advocates must ignore to make their case. From that moment, the fetus
embarks on a journey of development, forming vital organs and systems
necessary for survival. To terminate that process is to intentionally
end a life that, given the chance, would develop into a fully realized
human being.

Moreover, the ethical consequences of abortion extend beyond the unborn
child. Abortion undermines the sanctity of life, promoting a culture
where convenience and personal autonomy overshadow responsibility and
the protection of the most vulnerable members of society. *When life is
treated as disposable, it sets a dangerous precedent for how society
values human existence.*

Religious and philosophical perspectives further reinforce the
immorality of abortion. Many faith traditions uphold the belief that
human life is sacred and should be preserved at all costs. While more
religions than Christianity teach that abortion is immoral, they teach
that every individual is created in the image of God, with purpose and
value, and that the intentional destruction of life which God
intentionally created.

In addition to the ethical concerns, abortion carries significant
emotional and psychological consequences for those involved,
consequences that the pro-choice crowd also conveniently tries to gloss
over, gaslight, and whitewash. Countless individuals experience regret,
depression, and trauma after undergoing the procedure. Many
organizations that support women post-abortion report cases of deep
emotional suffering and lifelong struggles with guilt and grief.

Ultimately, abortion presents a profound moral crisis. While arguments
in favor of abortion often emphasize "bodily autonomy" and "reproductive
rights," they fail to address the **fundamental injustice of terminating
an innocent life.** If society is to champion human rights and dignity
(and we argue that any truly moral society should), it must extend those
protections to the unborn, recognizing abortion as an inherently evil
act that strips the most vulnerable of their right to exist.
Fundamentally, we believe that all humans have an equal right to life,
and there is no calculus by which the unborn can be excluded from that
right, because *it is our very humanity which gives us that right to
life.* Society does not bestow a right to life. It is precisely because
we are human that we possess an equal right to life. The earliest humans
***are still human***. They are also deserving of the protection of
their right to life.

In short, it's not this alone:
