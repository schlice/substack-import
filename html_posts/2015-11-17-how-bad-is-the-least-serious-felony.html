You can\'t say anything about what\'s true in most jurisdictions, as it
really is different in every jurisdiction. For example, even with all of
the answers you already got, in Colorado, theft of \$500 would be a
Class 2 Misdemeanor which carries a 3 month to 1 year prison sentence
and a fine of \$150 to \$1000. The lowest felony charge in Colorado is
theft of \$2000 to less than \$5000. This is a Class 6 Felony which
carries a 1 year minimum to 18 month maximum and carries a fine of not
less than \$1000 but not more than \$10,000. Also in Colorado, parole is
not applied *instead of* prison time, it is used *in addition to* prison
time. Therefore, you will also serve an additional one year of parole
following your release from prison.]{.rendered_qtext}
