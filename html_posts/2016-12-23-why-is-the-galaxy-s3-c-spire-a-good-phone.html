It is a CDMA phone, so you will only find it on Verizon in the US. The
GALAXY S3 (the C Spire) is a solid Samsung handset.

The phone has the following highlights:

- Processor: 1.5 GHz dual-core Qualcomm Krait processor
- Memory: 2 GB RAM, 16 GB onboard storage, expandable to 64GB with
  MicroSD card
- Screen: 4.8 inch HD super AMOLED screen running 1280x720
- Connectivity: Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.0, GPS, and of course, 4G
- Power: 2100 mAh removable battery
- Camera: 8 megapixel shooter on the back, 4 megapixel front-facing
  camera.

It's not the top of the hardware chain today, but it's a good quality
smartphone which has lots of features that people want, such as
expandable storage and removable battery.
