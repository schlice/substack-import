**I work as a stripper and went through a desperate time and slept with
a customer for money. He is now stalking and threatening me but he has
proof of the transaction in text messages. Can I report without getting
in trouble?**

It's true that you would be opening yourself up to potential prosecution
for your crime, but that you committed a crime doesn't justify
harassment and assault and stalking.

If you tell him to stop threatening you and that you are willing to
expose yourself to legal repercussions by going to the police to get him
to stop, he'll stop. Most people aren't dumb enough to use the evidence
they have to prove they committed a crime (in case you weren't sure, he
committed as much of a crime as you did, and him showing his evidence to
the police only proves his own guilt).

But on the off-chance that he doesn't stop, you will have to,
colloquially, "shit or get off the pot." You'll have to go down to the
police station and file a report. You will have to admit what you did.
And you may pay a penalty for it. But the harassment will indeed stop.
And if you come clean first, there's a better-than-average chance that
you will not be prosecuted for your crime.

He thinks he's got you over a barrel because you committed a crime, too.
But if you're brave enough to admit what you did, you can get him to
stop.
