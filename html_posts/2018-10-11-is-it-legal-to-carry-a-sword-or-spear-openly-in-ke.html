**Is it legal to carry a sword or spear openly in Kentucky?**

[[Kentucky Knife
Laws](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=204877&url=https://knifeup.com/kentucky-knife-laws/){.external_link

According to this, it is legal to open carry any knife. It is legal to
conceal a pocket knife or a hunting knife. Anything else is considered a
"deadly weapon" and cannot be concealed.

Whether or not you're going to be hassled about carrying a sword or a
spear is up for debate, as neither are specifically listed in Kentucky
law, as far as I can tell. You'll probably attract some unwanted
attention carrying a spear or a sword.
