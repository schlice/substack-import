Hollywood.

A highly classified military bunker carved into the side of a mountain
is the perfect backdrop for any plot which requires important military
operations to happen all the time while still operating just outside the
public view.

The 1983 movie *War Games,* starring Matthew Broderick, was a movie
about a kid who hacked into the new computer at NORAD which controlled
everything, from missile launch detection to automatic retaliatory
strikes. It was called the "WOPR" (pronounced "whopper"). I think it was
every other tour group that I took into the Mountain which asked to see
the WOPR. Most of them actually were asking in jest. Most.

*Editor's Note: It is virtually impossible to hack into NORAD's
computers, because they are not on the Internet. We do operate some
Internet-facing websites, but the actual processing systems are not
connected to the Internet. There are also no dial-up lines into the
NORAD processing systems, like in the movie.*

*Dr. Strangelove* featured military people inside Cheyenne Mountain
trying to save the world.

One of my favorite TV series, *Stargate: SG-1* starring Richard Dean
Anderson (and co-starring the late great Don S. Davis, who every single
one of us Air Force guys would have loved to have as a commander) was
set in a sub-basement of Cheyenne Mountain. I'm actually in the process
of re-watching SG-1; I'm on Season 3.

*Editor's Note: there are no sub-basements below Cheyenne Mountain.*

The one that really stands out to me, though, is the *Terminator* series
of movies. The main electronic protagonist of that movie was a computer
system called Skynet. In actuality, Skynet was the original codename of
the NORAD Computer System (NCS) which actually did air detection and
correlation of radar data, since the Mountain was built in the 50s.

Okay, war story alert: I was stationed at NORAD from 1996 to 1999. We
were in the middle of a massive upgrade, removing the aforementioned
aging NCS system and replacing it with the most wonderfully-acronymed
system: CCPDS-R (Correlation Center Processing and Display Subsystem -
Replacement).

The date came for the decommissioning of NCS (which, as was previously
mentioned, was codenamed "Skynet"). Anyone want to venture a guess as to
the date they chose to decommission NCS?

Yep, you guessed it: **August 29, 1997**. ***The very same day that
Skynet was shut down in the Terminator movies, the same day that Skynet
became self-aware.***

I was there, in Core Processing inside Cheyenne Mountain, on August 29,
1997. We were all in the central administration area, where the main
processors (each the size of a refrigerator) were all facing. We were
playing the theme song to *2001: A Space Odyssey* in the background. The
generals were all there to do the honors. One by one, they powered off
the main processors, and the disk packs behind them (a row of washing
machine-sized disk drives) slowly started to spin down over the course
of about a minute. The silence in that room, following that process, was
deafening.

And every one of us *Terminator* geeks were literally holding our
breaths, waiting for NCS to become self-aware and turn itself back on.
Seriously, like half of us who were in that room were there because we
really weren't sure that when we turned it off, it would stay off. True
story.

Moral of the story: NCS did not turn itself back on. And those disk
packs, which had been running for decades, actually spun on ball
bearings; once they spun down and sat there for about a minute or so,
they would have completely seized up and would never have spun again. We
had to relay that message throughout the crowd so they could literally
rest assured that there was no way the system was going to come back to
life. Also true story.

I received one of the power buttons from NCS:

Original question:

**Why is the Cheyenne Mountain Complex so famous?**

\

(EDIT) Wow, 2k upvotes, thank you! In honor of your support, I'll pass
on a little bit of trivia about the Mountain.

- The complex is actually made up of 15 individual steel buildings: 13
  3-story buildings, and 2 2-story buildings.
- The facility is not built inside a massive open cavern; the tunnels
  for the buildings were individually dug and the buildings constructed
  inside the tunnels. It was a truly joint project: the Army Corps of
  Engineers dug out the tunnels, Navy SeeBees built the buildings, and
  the facility is hosted and operated by the Air Force. The mission is
  carried out by the combined US-Canadian command NORAD.\
  \
  (UPDATE): The facility is now run by the Space Force. Go figure.
- The granite removed from the tunnels was used as the base for the
  parking lot.
- The buildings are physically separated from each other but are all
  electrically connected and grounded together.
- The buildings are not resting on the ground; instead they rest on a
  series of 1300 springs. Each spring is about .5 ton. The buildings can
  bounce and sway on the springs, and can move approximately one foot in
  any direction. The idea is to absorb any seismic activity without
  affecting operations. All water, air, and electrical conduits between
  buildings is made of flex conduit to allow for the buildings to move
  independently of each other.

- - Interestingly, when we decommissioned NCS and removed the processors
    and disk packs, the building got so light that the springs pushed it
    out of position relative to the other buildings around it. The ramps
    connecting the two buildings were then off, and people and carts
    were having difficulty traversing the gap. Engineers had to go under
    the building and individually re-tension the springs to fix the
    issue.
- The complex is powered by commercial power from Colorado Springs, but
  we have backup power delivered by six diesel generators, the kind that
  power locomotives:

- Each generator is capable of generating 2.5 MW of power, and four
  generators can support full operations within the facility. Normally,
  we run on full commercial power to save diesel fuel (we have a 500,000
  gallon diesel tank carved into the rock), but any time there is
  lightning within 5 nautical miles of the Mountain, we put two
  generators on line and tie them in with the commercial power.
- The power lines feed a bank of batteries comprising one of the largest
  uninterruptible power systems (UPS) in the US. The UPS only has enough
  juice to run the Mountain for about 15 minutes, but it's really only
  there to smooth the transition between commercial and diesel should we
  have a catastrophic commercial power loss. The batteries are connected
  only to the A bus, which is where the critical systems receive their
  power. Ancillary systems run off of the B bus.
- We have five lakes inside the mountain. One holds the aforementioned
  diesel fuel, one holds 1.5 million gallons of drinking water, and
  three hold 1.5 million gallons of industrial water (a total of 4.5
  million gallons of industrial water) used for the cooling towers to
  remove heat from the facility, and for fire suppression.
- Interestingly, heat is a negative cost as the facility uses the heat
  generated by people and machines to heat the inside of the facility.
  The facility only needs to be cooled.
- Water is also a negative cost as they discovered a natural spring
  during construction which provides all the water needed for the
  facility.

Let me know if you have any other questions about the facility. It is
still in operation today, by the way.
