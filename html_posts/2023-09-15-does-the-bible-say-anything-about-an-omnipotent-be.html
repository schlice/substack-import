Yes, even God cannot do certain things.

**An omnipotent God cannot deny His own nature.**

> if we are faithless,\
> he remains faithful,\
> for he cannot disown himself. --- 2 Timothy 2:13 NIV

God cannot deny Himself. If He were to break His promise to those who
have believed in Him, that would be a denial of Himself and His
righteous character. To those who fear that God is standing over them
waiting to cast them out if they deny Him or if they fail to have enough
belief or if they are unfaithful in their ministries, Paul says that God
always remains faithful. His faithfulness is a matter of His own
character.
