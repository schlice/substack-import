Sin is, literally, "missing the mark." But if you don't pattern your
life after trying to hit God's marks, then you cannot, definitionally,
sin.

To be more clear, the atheist can commit acts that the theist would
consider sinful. The atheist cannot commit acts that the atheist would
consider sinful.
