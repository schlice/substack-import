Not sure where you got this information, but it's totally wrong.

The officers were on scene within three minutes, geared up, and ready to
go.[\[1\]](#viFna){#cite-viFna .citation_link}

But they were not in control of the scene.

Turns out, school district police chief Pete Arredondo treated the
shooting as a barricade situation rather than an active shooter. It was
his decision to delay police response. He also could have transferred
authority of the scene to another agency, like Texas DPS. but he chose
not to.

His delay, because he was treating the shooting as a barricade situation
instead of an active shooter situation, is what caused the entry delay.

There were other failures at Robb Elementary. For example, the door to
the classroom could not be secured because of a malfunctioning strike
plate. The doors to the classrooms could not be locked from the inside.
The outside door the shooter used to enter the building was unlocked.
Police radios did not work inside the building, indicating that they had
not been tested before this incident, or it was known that there was a
limitation and nothing was done to fix it.

These are all fix-it items which fall squarely on the Uvalde School
District to fix. And wouldn't you know it, the person who was directly
responsible for the failures in the security posture of Robb Elementary
is the same person who failed to declare the scene an active shooter,
and instead declared it a barricade situation: school district police
chief Pete Arredondo.

I'm seeing a pattern here.
