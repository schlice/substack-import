No more and no less than any other man.

Do they rape because they are allowed to do so under military law? No.

Do they rape because there is a "rape culture" in the military? No.

Do they rape because the "spoils of war" include raping the population
of the land you just conquered? No. Perhaps other countries' armies
behave this way; the US military does not.

Rape is punishable by both UCMJ and US law. Any soldier found to have
committed rape will be arrested and tried.
