Because some believers are not really good at Biblical exegesis.

The first account of creation looks at the entire week, and the second
account of creation looks only at the sixth day.

As for the rest of the supposed contradictions:

> There are two primary claims of contradictions between Genesis

> that prior to the creation of man "no shrub of the field had yet
> appeared on the earth and no plant of the field had yet sprung up, for
> the LORD God had not sent rain on the earth and there was no man to
> work the ground." There is no contradiction, though, because Genesis

> garden. So the passages do not contradict. Genesis 1:11 speaks of God

> and second days when there was no vegetation; and Genesis 2:9 speaks
> of the specific growth of trees in Eden.

Hope this helps.
