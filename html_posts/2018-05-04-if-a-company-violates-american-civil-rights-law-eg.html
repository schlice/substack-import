**If a company violates American Civil Rights law (e.g. ADA) but the
victim cannot pay for a lawyer, can the violator be prosecuted still?**

There are attorneys who will provide legal services at low or no cost
(i.e. *pro bono*) for disability rights cases. Check the pro bono
websites
([[here](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=1f68df&url=https://www.probono.net/){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="probono.net"}]{.qlink_container} is an example) for
attorneys who might be able to assist you.

You might also check with the advocacy group for your particular
disability. For example, I have MS, so I would check with the
Colorado-Wyoming chapter of the National MS Society. They can also put
you in touch with legal aid resources who can assist you.

Or, as [[Colleen
Jones](https://www.quora.com/profile/Colleen-Jones-49)]{.qlink_container}
said, you can file a complaint yourself with the DOJ.
