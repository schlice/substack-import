There are a few ways.

1.  Depending on your model of Vizio TV, you may have a direct audio
    output. It may be a digital audio out (which you can run into an
    amplifier), or even a headphone jack (which you can run into the Aux
    input on your stereo --- just be very careful of the output volume
    on the TV. Adjust them both carefully). But either way, most Vizio
    TVs, even if they don't directly have an Audio Out port of some kind
    at least usually have a headphone out jack.
2.  If there is no audio out at all, you can grab the audio *on the way
    to* the TV. Since it's most likely that your audio is being sent to
    your TV over HDMI, use something like this: [[Amazon.com: Musou HDMI
    Audio Extractor,HDMI to HDMI + Optical Toslink(SPDIF) + RCA(L/R)
    Stereo Analog Outputs Video Audio
    Splitter](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=a66b4f&url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XDNJ6RM){.external_link
    rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
    onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);" qt-tooltip="amazon.com"}
    ]{.qlink_container}This device will extract the audio from the HDMI
    signal and send it to either S-PDIF (which is optical audio out) or
    to L/R RCA jacks, to be sent to an amplifier.

Hope this helps.
