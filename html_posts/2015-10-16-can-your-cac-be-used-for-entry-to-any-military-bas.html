**Content:** [Your CAC can be used by you to enter any military base
which has open facilities for military personnel.\
\
Some military facilities are Restricted Areas in their entirety. They
are generally mission-specific facilities, not full-service military
bases. They specifically require that you be stationed there before you
may enter. In such a scenario, you must go to Pass & Registration
***before*** you enter the base and receive your Restricted Area access
badge.\
\
Note that many facilities are now being upgraded to DBIDS (Defense
Biometric ID System) which will also use the CAC card for ID. However,
at any facility protected by DBIDS, you must first still pre-register
before you can enter.\
\
That said, if the facility is not a Restricted Area in its entirety,
your CAC card will allow you entrance.]{.rendered_qtext}
