**Why is Quora happy for people to ask how to commit criminal acts, and
censure those who object?**

Because [[Quora's Conduct
Policy](https://www.quora.com/about/conduct)]{.qlink_container} doesn't
prohibit it.

Specifically, the Conduct Policy prohibits the following in relation to
illegal acts:

> **1. Illegal activity**
>
> Do not use Quora to engage in unlawful activity or to promote illegal
> acts.

When someone answers a question about how to commit a criminal act, the
answerer is not "promoting an illegal act." They are merely answering a
question on how to do a thing, as many people all over the Internet are
wont to do. That thing may be illegal in one or more locations, but the
choice about whether or not to break the law remains with the reader.

This is the very nature of free speech. Quora ensures that people do not
engage in unlawful activity, and they don't support the promotion of
unlawful activity, but when people are *genuinely curious* about how
criminals do things, they can feel safe asking, and people can feel safe
answering.

For example, one of my more popular answers is in regards to[ [a way to
defeat traffic cameras and red light
cameras](https://www.quora.com/Is-there-a-way-to-trick-traffic-cameras-so-they-wont-have-the-license-number/answer/Bill-Stein)]{.qlink_container}.
I began my answer explaining that in nearly all states, adding any
accessory or treatment to your license plates that enables you to evade
a traffic camera is illegal, but then I discussed those treatments and
accessories. We had a lively discussion that veered off into the
Mythbusters testing of some of the myths surrounding radar speed
measuring devices. It was a generally well-received answer.

But nowhere in my answer did I *promote* doing any of the things we
discussed. As we've already mentioned, whether or not you do a thing is
entirely up to you. Additionally, the laws may be different where you
live. We reach a global audience as well, so this is important.

Now, after all of this, if you see an answer that you believe violates
the Conduct Policy, please report it. Quora's Moderation Team will
gladly review the content, and if it is found to violate a policy, it
will be removed.
