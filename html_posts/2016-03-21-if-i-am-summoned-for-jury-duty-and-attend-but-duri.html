It depends on the jurisdiction, but in most jurisdictions, yes, simply
showing up and checking in on the morning you\'ve been summoned counts
as serving. If you are chosen for the jury pool but then are not chosen
for the jury, you have fulfilled your service. And of course, if you are
selected for a jury, this also counts as service.

In my jurisdiction, we can\'t be called for jury duty more than one time
per calendar year. So showing up, clocking in, and never being called
counts as jury service for the year.

Also, in my jurisdiction, if you are called and placed on the standby
list, and then advised that you do not need to appear, **this still
counts as your service** and you won\'t be called again for the
remainder of the calendar year. That was my service this year. Easy
peesey.
