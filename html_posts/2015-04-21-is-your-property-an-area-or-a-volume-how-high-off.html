**Content:** [Your property is most definitely an area under the law.
You have few rights related to the \"airspace\" over your property.\
\
When it comes to privacy, current law relates to a person on the ground.
So if you have a 6 foot privacy fence around your yard, that would
constitute a reasonable expectation of privacy for your property.\
\
As you can infer, privacy laws are sketchy on the air over your house;
in most cases, anyone flying over your house can view your yard. This is
changing; drones are driving that argument. So laws related to that are
varied across the country.]{.rendered_qtext}
