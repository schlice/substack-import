**Content:** [As with everything, it depends.\
\
If you live in a \"just cause eviction\" city, a landlord must have
\"just cause\" to terminate your lease. Month to month leases
automatically renew at the end of the month. Raiaing rent to above
market value is illegal since it is an attempt to cause the tenant to
move (otherwise known as \"constructive eviction\"). Raising everyone\'s
rent may be enough of an excuse to avoid constructive eviction charges
if the landlord can show that the rent increase to above market value is
justified. Beyond this, a landlord would have to find another reason to
evict the tenant.\
\
If you do not live in a \"just cause eviction\" city, and you have a
month-to-month lease, a landlord would never do this. He would simply
tell you the agreement is up and give you 30 days to vacate. If you have
lived in the unit for over one year, he must give you 60
days.]{.rendered_qtext}
