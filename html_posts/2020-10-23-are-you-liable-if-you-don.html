**Are you liable if you don't lock your car?**

Depends on what you mean by liability.

Insurance may not reimburse you for your stolen items because you didn't
take proper care to lock your car. In that respect, you would be liable
for the cost of those items.

But you would not be liable for the theft; that's totally on the thief.
The presence or absence of a locked door does not alleviate the thief of
responsibility for his crime. That's all on him.
