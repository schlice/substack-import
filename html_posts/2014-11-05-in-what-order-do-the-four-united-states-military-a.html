answer is almost correct; all the service academies require the same
level of physical fitness. Except that there are five service academies
which can introduce commissioned officers into the United States Armed
Forces:\
\
- US Military Academy at West Point, NY\
- US Naval Academy in Annapolis, MD\
- US Coast Guard Academy in New London, CT\
- US Merchant Marine Academy in Kings Point, NY\
- US Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, CO\
\
But consider this: at all of the others, you\'re at sea level (at
Annapolis, the Coast Guard Academy, and at Kings Point, you are actually
training to work at sea level). At the Air Force Academy, you have to do
the same Physical Fitness Test (PFT), but at 7258 feet above sea level.
Air is rare up there. It just might be a bit more
challenging.]{.rendered_qtext}
