Most certainly no, not by modern English standards.

The King James Version is written in an *Old English* style, which makes
it particularly difficult to read and understand in a modern context.

If you want an "easy to read" or "easy to understand" translation of the
Bible, look towards the right side of this chart. If you want a "word
for word" translation that holds to the fidelity of the actual words
(but may take more Biblical understanding to tease out the meaning),
look to the left of this chart.

For something easy to read and understand, but which still holds some
fidelity to the thoughts, I'd look at the New Living Translation, or the
New International Reader's Version.

But why the differences? Why so many issues with a translation?
Shouldn't it be straightforward? Look at a word and translate it?

Not necessarily.

The problem comes with the languages themselves. Look at Hebrew, which
has fewer words than English. This means that some Hebrew words have
multiple meanings. Therefore, the translator must choose the correct
word in the target language to match the meaning of the word in the
source language. Therefore, when translating from Hebrew to English,
words may be changed. The same word in Hebrew may be represented by
different words throughout the Bible, depending on what the author
meant. The opposite problem exists for Greek. As an example, there are
no fewer than six words in Greek which we represent with the word "love"
in English. Therefore, when translating from Greek to English, we may
use the word "love" but it may not mean precisely what the author was
thinking.

The different modes of translation are **word for word, thought for
thought,** and **paraphrase.**

- Word for word translations take each individual word and translate it
  in to the target language. However, with either fewer or more words
  translating to one word, there may be some misunderstandings in the
  sentences.
- Thought for thought translations work differently. The translator
  reads one sentence and translates it into the target language. Words
  may be added or subtracted in order to retain the same thought from
  source to target. This is also challenging because cultures
  *understand* words differently. A word or phrase may mean one thing to
  one culture, and something completely different to another culture.
  Capturing the thought of the original writer may require changing some
  words during the translation.
- Paraphrase translations aim for a complete understanding of the
  original text, but they do it without maintaining any fidelity to word
  choice. The translator will read an entire paragraph and completely
  re-state the paragraph using different words (sometimes many different
  words) but retaining the main idea of the paragraph.

Ultimately, regardless of the method of translation, the translators aim
to keep the main idea of the original work in the translation. That is
always the goal of any translation: fidelity to the main idea of the
original. If the translation changes the main idea behind the original
sentence/paragraph, that translation has failed.
