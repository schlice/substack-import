**Content:** [We have already answered this question. I understand the
point of the question is different, but the idea of replacing bullets
with tranqulilzers has already been asked and answered:\
\
[[What are the biggest obstacles to the use of tranquilizer darts
instead of bullets in the United States as a solution to the gun control
controversy?](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-biggest-obstacles-to-the-use-of-tranquilizer-darts-instead-of-bullets-in-the-United-States-as-a-solution-to-the-gun-control-controversy)]{.qlink_container}\
\
Basically, tranqulizers don\'t work on people quickly or equally. Use
too much and you kill them. Use too little, and they just get a little
groggy.\
\
Plus, tranquilizers don\'t work the same way you see in the movies. If
you don\'t hit a vein, it could take up to 30 minutes before the
sedative starts to take effect, which makes the dart effectively useless
as a self-defense weapon.]{.rendered_qtext}
