**How do I report a company to the ADA?**

Who is the ADA? The American Dental Association? The American Diabetes
Association?

Are you perhaps referring to the Americans with Disabilities Act, which
is a law, not a government organization?

If you want to take action against a company for violating the Americans
with Disabilities Act, speak to an employment attorney in your area who
specializes in the ADA.
