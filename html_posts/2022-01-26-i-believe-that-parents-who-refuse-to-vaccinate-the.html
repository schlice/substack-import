There is a *thousandfold* difference in risk between a child getting
COVID and an older person getting COVID.

There are also some **not-trivial** risks to children taking the
vaccine.

Calling these parents "murderous" is simply false. Calling them
"irresponsible" is an opinion. But considering the risk/benefit
calculation is exactly what a parent is supposed to do for their
children, I can't see how that action is "irresponsible." This may seem
to be an innumerate calculation to you, but you're not the parent.

*Neither moniker is worthy of removing the children from the parent's
custody.* This is a very disruptive action which can cause
**tremendous** psychological harm to a child. You must be **very** sure
that the child is actually in grave physical danger to do this, and a
parent choosing which vaccines they wish to give their children does not
rise to that level of danger.

**TL;DR: No, I do not agree.**

Original question:

I believe that parents who refuse to vaccinate their children should be
removed from their children\'s custody as murderous and irresponsible.
Do you agree?
