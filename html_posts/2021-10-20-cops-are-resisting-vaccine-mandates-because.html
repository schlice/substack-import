Thanks for the A2A, [[Pat

Despite most of the answerers who believe that cops are not being
vaccinated because they think themselves "above the law" or because they
"are simply too stupid to be vaccinated," those really are not the
reasons why cops are not getting vaccinated.

Cops, by their nature, and reinforced through the work they do, are
highly skeptical of everything. Also as a function of the work that they
do, they know their rights. When a suspect says, "you're violating my
rights!" in most cases they are not. And also in most cases, if they are
violating your rights, they know it.

To that end, most cops who are not getting the vaccine either had COVID
already and have recovered and feel they don't need the shot, or are
simply skeptical about the vaccines and believe they have the right to
control what they put in their own bodies.

And yes, while they enforce the laws written by the government, they are
still skeptical of the government's motivations. This doesn't lead them
to blindly follow government edicts, but actually leads to (sometimes
unhealthy levels of) skepticism. And they question the motives behind a
vaccine mandate.

While they are getting vaccinated, albeit at lower numbers than the
general population, their unions are absolutely against vaccine
mandates. Only in the largest departments, which can absorb the loss of
officers who will resign before getting the jab, are vaccine mandates
even being pursued. Most departments are actually following the CDC
recommendation and are offering the "either-or" path forward: either the
vaccine, or weekly COVID testing.

Cops look at this and wonder why the government doesn't follow its own
CDC recommendations.

So it is quite possible in this case that cops are actually "too smart
for their own good."

Original question:

Cops are resisting vaccine mandates because "The govt. can't tell me
what to do". Isn't that a weird flex for people who literally enforce
govt mandates on others?

*This is a contentious and emotionally-charged topic. I have taken the
(unusual for me) step of leaving comments open.*

*Some people like to comment. Some people like to engage with me in a
civil manner. But do not misunderstand, I take this step very
cautiously, and I have no tolerance for harassing or inane behavior.*

*If you don\'t like what I wrote, tough shit. If my answer is
grammatically low-quality or is un-cited opinion masquerading as fact,
downvote it. If you think I\'m wrong, write your own answer. But Quora
is a question-and-answer site, not a debate site. If you are simply
commenting to tell me \"ackshually, you\'re wrong,\" don\'t be surprised
if I quietly delete your comment. Put anything vaguely harassing in
there, and your deletion will be followed by a block/mute, and a BNBR
report. I will do this immediately and with no compunction. You have
been warned. Be nice.*
