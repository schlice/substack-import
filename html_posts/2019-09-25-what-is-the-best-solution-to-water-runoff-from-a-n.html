**What is the best solution to water runoff from a neighbor flushing his
swimming pool sneakily. In Texas, is it allowed for me to put a barrier
on my side in my property to stop the water runoff?**

As with all legal questions, the answer is "it depends." And in this
case, what it depends on is where the water is supposed to go between
the two lots.

Now clearly, there is some water that will naturally end up on your
property depending on the *over-land grading* that was done when the
development was put in. So you'll have to investigate this by pulling
the grading specs for your neighborhood, showing the water flow as it
was designed, and as the lots were graded.

Once the construction grading is done, however, *finish grading* then
takes place, which includes what happens when landscapers come in and
plant trees and grass, and add other features like retaining walls. The
grading *changes* when this happens, even though it is supposed to
follow the same grading pattern as the over-land grading originally laid
out. This is where that homeowner runs into trouble: if they changed the
grading so significantly that water runoff now comes into your yard
where it was supposed to go somewhere else, then you have a case.

If the homeowner is intentionally directing runoff into your yard where
it was never supposed to be, you also have a case.

I put all of that in here before answering your question, because it
impacts what you can legally do about it.

You cannot put a barrier to stop water flow if the original overland
grading plan shows water coming from his lot and draining into yours. In
other words, if it was originally designed to flow into your yard, you
cannot block that water. What you *can* do instead, in that case, is
*re-direct* the water once it enters your yard. For example, you can
install french drains at your property line to catch all of that water
and redirect it somewhere else. Once it comes on to your property in
accordance with the overland grading plan, you can then move it
somewhere else if you choose. You can do whatever you want with it at
that point, but you have to allow it to come into your yard.

Now, if the water *was never intended to flow into your yard in the
first place*, not only do you have a case for tort trespass, you can
then install water mitigation systems along your property line (i.e.
barriers) and include that cost in your lawsuit.

Additionally, if there are ordinances in your city describing what must
be done with **pool waste water** and he is violating that, you can also
go the Code Enforcement route with your local police department.
