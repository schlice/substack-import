**My Galaxy S8 keeps randomly crashing, even if I am not using it. Is
that bad, and if so, can I stop it from getting worse or crashing?**

1.  Start with a factory reset. This will wipe and re-install your
    phone, and your apps will download from Google again. Bear in mind
    that any data which is not stored in Google or Samsung Cloud will be
    lost; make sure you have good backups of any critical data.
2.  If the issue still persists after a factory reset, contact your
    carrier's Technical Support. Make sure you tell them you just did a
    factory reset, because that will be their first suggestion.
