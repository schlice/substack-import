(US answer)

Depending on the level of injury or illness, we have multiple options
for same-day visits.

1.  Try your child's pediatrician. Many doctor's offices reserve some
    spots for same-day visits, although most will likely offer you a
    next-day appointment.
2.  If that's not soon enough, we have *urgent care* facilities in
    nearly every moderately-sized city in the country. Urgent care fills
    the gap between something which can't wait for your doctor's next
    available appointment, but something which is minor enough to not
    require a trip to the emergency room.
3.  If you cannot get in to see the doctor and you don't have access to
    a nearby urgent care (or it is after hours for urgent care), you can
    always be seen at the emergency room. They will stabilize the child
    and provide them with enough appropriate medication to last until
    you can get in to see your regular pediatrician.
