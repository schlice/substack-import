Here's the pull quote from The Hill:

> Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) said Thursday he negotiated a deal with
> Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) on an amendment allowing
> military veterans whose finances go into conservatorship to keep their
> firearms, a proposal Schumer previously called a "poison pill" to the
> Senate's minibus appropriations bill.
>
> Kennedy's effort to get a vote on his amendment had held up the bill
> funding military construction and the departments of Veterans Affairs,
> Agriculture, Transportation, and Housing and Urban
> Development.[\[1\]](#IxbbF){#cite-IxbbF .citation_link}

We should make sure that the amendment passes. And in the future, we
should make sure that the VA toes the line and doesn't try to overreach
like they tried with this process change.
