**What would an America with no guns be like, beyond making them illegal
but actually having no guns in America?**

Look at London. That will give you the perfect example of what American
cities will look like if guns actually didn't exist.

Knife attacks. Acid attacks.

But most importantly, ***tyranny.*** The tyranny of the strong over the
weak. The tyranny of the many over the few. And the tyranny of the young
over the old.

A world without guns means a world where the strong, the young, and the
many have power.

Guns *equalize that force calculation.*

When good people have guns, they can't be bullied. They can't be
intimidated. They can't be threatened. They can only be reasoned with.

In short, America without guns will become ***far less civilized.***
