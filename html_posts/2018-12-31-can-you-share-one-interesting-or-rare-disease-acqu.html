**Can you share one interesting or rare disease acquired by the human
body?**

The cause of the disease is ubiquitous, but it very rarely devolves into
the disease.

The disease is called PML, or [[**progressive multifocal
leukoencephalopathy**](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=9f0d6d&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_multifocal_leukoencephalopathy){.external_link

times fast.

PML is basically like multiple sclerosis (MS) on steroids. It is a
disease characterized by progressive destruction of the white matter of
the brain. And it's fatal. It has a mortality rate of 30--50% within the
first few months of contracting it, and those who survive are usually
left with permanent neuropathy (nerve death) and permanent neurological
damage and disability.

The disease is caused by the [[JC
Virus](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=6a2af9&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JC_virus){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}, named after the first
person to be diagnosed with PML (John Cunningham). The JC virus is
present in anywhere between 70 and 90% of all humans, but is normally
kept in check by the immune system. However, people on certain
immunosuppressant therapies, or people who are otherwise
immunocompromised, can potentially suffer an activation of the virus and
contract PML.

been linked to JC virus activation. Tysabri carries a [[black box
warning](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=fa2f55&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxed_warning){.external_link

The drug manufacturer, Biogen, pays for JC virus testing for all
patients who take it.

recently been linked to JC virus activation.
