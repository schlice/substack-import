The [[Real ID
Act](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=789bf1&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_ID_Act){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container} is far from new. The
provisions which affect the states were originally supposed to go into
effect in 2008, but it was postponed for **five years** to get more
buy-in from the states.

The Act only affects the states insofar as the Federal government has
set minimum standards that states must follow in order for their state
identifications to be accepted by the Federal government for official
purposes.

Official purposes include things like boarding commercial aircraft, and
gaining access to nuclear power plants and Federal buildings.
