**By doing absolutely nothing to prevent another Russian cyberattack
during the midterms, this president is deliberately shirking his primary
responsibility to protect this country from a foreign entity. Why aren't
conservatives outraged by this?**

What exactly do you think the Russians did during the last election that
was so dangerous?

- Did it affect vote totals?
- Did it prevent people from voting?

So understanding that Russians did nothing more than what they normally
do every day, just like we do, what exactly do you think we should be
"preventing?"

If you can come up with something that we can actually prevent, then
perhaps we can work to prevent it. But saying that the Russians "did
cyberattacks" and will do it again is like saying, "I breathed air
yesterday and will probably do it again tomorrow."
