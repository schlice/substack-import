While HBO wants to become the next Netflix, can it?

AT&T is already increasing HBO's original content budget. HBO is trying
to develop more content, and offer more on-demand content (which they
push through their HBO GO and HBO Now platforms) to try to compete with
market leader Netflix.

HBO currently reaches 88 million households compared to the 68 million
Netflix subscribers, but in most cases, those subscribers are not paying
a premium like Netflix subscribers are. HBO is, in more cases than not,
bundled along with another subscription service (i.e. a cable or
satellite package), or has licensed its brand or content to affiliate
broadcasters. That makes HBO's 88 million subscribers less valuable than
Netflix' 68 million.

Netflix is planning on spending about \$8 billion on content this year,
and it spends far more on producing content in-house instead of
licensing. In comparison, HBO spent \$2.5 billion last year on content,
but about half of that went to licensing content. They only spent about
\$1.3 billion last year on original, in-house content.

They are seriously going to have to ramp up spending on original content
if they want to compete with Netflix. They're hoping that the AT&T
buyout will do that, but I am somewhat skeptical. With AT&T spending
\$85 billion on the Time-Warner acquisition (and spending \$49 billion
on DIRECTV in 2015), they don't have a lot of excess capital to play
with, and they picked up an extra \$22 billion in debt from T-W,
increasing their debt to \$185 billion. Netflix is carrying about \$20
billion in debt and is in a much stronger financial position.

I don't think that Netflix will be de-throned anytime soon, but I do
think that HBO will be seeing some fresh new original content in the
coming months.
