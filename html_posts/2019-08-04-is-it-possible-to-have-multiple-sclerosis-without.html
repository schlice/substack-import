**Is it possible to have multiple sclerosis without lesions on scans?**

The answer is, while extremely rare, you can have MS without a positive
MRI.

The MRI is a great tool, and the results of the scan will absolutely add
to the body of evidence which indicates MS. Under the updated McDonald
criteria, one symptom and a positive MRI can indicate MS. However, two
symptoms separated by space and time, along with other evidence, can
still indicate MS. That other evidence does not need to include a
positive MRI.

This is why you need a neurologist to diagnose MS; it is as much an art
as it is a science. There is no one test that can indicate MS.
