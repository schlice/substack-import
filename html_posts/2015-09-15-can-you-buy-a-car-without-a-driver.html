**Content:** [In the United States, you do not need a driver\'s license
to *purchase* a car. You only need a driver\'s license to *drive* a
car.\
\
That said, it\'s nearly ***expected*** that you do have a license to buy
a car, unless you want to do your test drive from the passenger seat.
While unusual to not be licensed, it\'s not illegal. Additionally, it is
expected that you are able to *insure* your car, since that too is
legally required, and it\'s difficult to get auto insurance unless you
have a license and a driving record which is reviewable by the company.
You may be able to get insurance without a license and a driving record,
but it will probably be pricey.]{.rendered_qtext}
