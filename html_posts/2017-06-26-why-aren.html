There are very few drawbacks to internally suppressed firearms. The main
reason it is not done is because of the process.

In the United States, suppressors are regulated separately from firearms
under the National Firearms Act. For this reason, if you internally
suppress a firearm, the *entire firearm* must then fall under the
suppressor regulation.

Therefore, to purchase the new suppressed firearm, you would have to
follow the stricter rules of the suppressor:

- Be lawfully allowed to purchase a firearm
- Be 21 or older
- Be in a state where suppressors are legal to own
- Keep the firearm in a state which allows suppressors
- Before you purchase the firearm, you must fill out the appropriate
  paperwork (which includes photo, fingerprints, and approval of your
  local law enforcement) along with \$200 to a FFL to submit to the ATF
  to get your tax stamp
- Once the tax stamp is approved and returned, you can then purchase the
  firearm.

So not only are there additional requirements to purchase one,
especially if you purchase as an individual, but you just increased the
cost of the firearm by \$200 at a minimum, and you have to have your tax
stamp before you purchase the firearm.

So until the rules for suppressors are changed, it's easier to sell the
suppressor separately from the firearm.
