**How do you implement a rule to restrict the number of rentals in your
Home owners Association (if one does not exist now)?**

Your Board of Directors can do this, as they can modify the Rules and
Regulations at any time. They can make a modification to the R&R, vote
on it, and have it take effect immediately.

I will caution you, however. When it comes to things that severely
impact homeowners (especially things that may financially negatively
impact homeowners), courts do not look fondly on rule changes. While
they are technically binding on homeowners, courts are not in favor of a
small group of people imposing their will on the community, especially
when the change is unpopular or unresearched.

In that case, if you want the change to not only be binding **but to
stand up to court challenges**, make the change in the Covenants of the
HOA. In order to do that, you will need a percentage of homeowners to
agree to the change (that percentage is different in each state, but
it's usually no less than 3/4 of all the homeowners), and then you will
need a lawyer to draw up the paperwork to get the Covenants amended with
the City in which they are filed.

I will give you an example. We had an incident with a homeowner who
turned his home into a luxury rental, violating tons of rules along the
way (we eventually foreclosed on that property, but it was a years-long
battle). We decided that to try to forestall events like this again, we
attempted to limit short-term (VRBO and AirBNB) rentals in our
neighborhood by implementing a Covenants amendment requiring rentals to
be a minimum of 6 months and requiring a filing of a rental agreement
with the HOA along with a refundable deposit of some significant amount
(I think we were going to make it \$100 initially). The community, while
initially showing support, decided not to pass that amendment. Oh well,
there's only so much we can do to limit the damage done by rentals to
neighboring home prices. If homeowners eventually become sufficiently
motivated, perhaps we can run that amendment again, but for now, we
can't limit rentals to a specific timeframe because the homeowners
didn't approve it.
