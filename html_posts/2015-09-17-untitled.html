**Content:** [*under Section 163 of the Road Traffic Act 1988, a
constable in uniform has a power to stop any vehicle on any road or
public place at any time for any reason. Section 164 provides a power to
request production of your driving documents.*\

There are some laws in the UK that I simply envy. PACE, while a huge
law, is actually very good for law enforcement. Sadly, neither of these
three laws would work well in the United States*,* but I like what
they\'ve done for the UK.]{.rendered_qtext}
