It's interesting, because these people are so very worried about not
misgendering people, but they have no problem misgendering God.

The answer is **God's preferred pronouns are He/Him.**

Right about now, they'd say, *Really? How do you know?* God has said in
many places throughout Scripture that He wishes to be known as a Father.
