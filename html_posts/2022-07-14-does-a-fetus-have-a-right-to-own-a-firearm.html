Short answer: Constitutionally-speaking, a fetus has a right to keep and
bear arms. Rights are for "the people" and that includes all people.

But like all rights, it is not unlimited. The Federal government
controls pretty heavily who may purchase and possess a firearm. Firearms
ownership and possession are subject to reasonable regulations. And no
one is claiming that a fetus would qualify under those reasonable
regulations.

So while a fetus has the right to keep and bear arms, the fetus doesn't
have any ability to exercise that right under Federal regulations.

It also doesn't have the physical ability to do so, but don't let
reality get in the way of your hypothetical.
