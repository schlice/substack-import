**In the normal interaction between citizens and police, are citizens
smart to be suspicious of law enforcement? To worry that a police
officer will (perhaps not intentionally) twist facts to make a case?**

In the normal interactions between any two people (regardless of their
occupation), it is always wise to be aware of their motives.

So, to that end: what motivates the officer? Is he just trying to make a
case against "any warm body he can find" and you just happen to be
within reach? Or is he objectively trying to find the truth?

Regardless, the only way to protect yourself is to ***understand your
rights***.

- In conversations with police, you are only required to give your real
  name. You're not required to talk to the police. Understand that this
  makes their job that much more difficult, because the police actually
  need to talk to people without arresting them in order to do their
  jobs and actually find the bad guys. Nevertheless, if you are to
  protect your rights, you are under no obligation to talk to the police
  at all. If you can help them by telling them what you saw or what you
  heard, it's probably best to do that. But beyond that, you should
  probably not talk to them. If they want to come in to your home, you
  should probably not do that. It's best to step outside rather than
  letting them step in. Put on a warm coat if it's cold; don't take them
  up on their offer to go someplace warmer. If it's too cold for them,
  they should get a desk job.
- But let's say that you encounter one of these unscrupulous officers
  who simply wants to make a case against any warm body he can find
  regardless of the presence of actual facts (these are like unicorns:
  if you ever find one, get a selfie with him), and you're arrested.
  ***SAY NOTHING UNTIL YOU GET A LAWYER.*** When they question you, they
  will tell you that you have the right to remain silent until you've
  had the chance to talk to a lawyer. *Exercise this right!* Do not
  speak to the police without an attorney helping you! The police are
  not there to be your friend. They're not there to get you terrible
  coffee. They're there to send you to jail for the crime they are
  accusing you of committing. You should probably not assist them in
  that endeavor.
