**Content:** [To be specific, you didn\'t do anything wrong legally. She
ate at least once that day, and courts have ruled that \"sending a child
to bed without dinner\" is not \"cruel and unusual punishment\" assuming
the child has eaten at least one other meal that day and the pattern is
not continuous (i.e. daily).\
\
However, as a parenting philosophy, it doesn\'t make sense to deny food
because the child isn\'t following the phone rules. If the rule is \"no
phones at the table,\" the violation of that rule results in the phone
being taken away for a period of time, not the dinner.\
\
You might even try to forestall the issue entirely by placing one of
these near (but not at) the dinner table\

All phones must be checked in to the phone stand before dinner, no one
may respond to their phones, and as an added bonus, the phones charge
while you eat!\
\
Additionally, you can say that eating at the table is a privilege which
can be removed; i.e. the child can be made to eat in his room by himself
and not with the family. But in all cases, the most appropriate
punishment is the removal of the phone, not the removal of the meal.
