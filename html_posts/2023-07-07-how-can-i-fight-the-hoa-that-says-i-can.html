I hate to be the bearer of bad news...

It appears that you're not in a very good position. It was your
responsibility to know the HOA rules before you started work. You even
could have asked the HOA for clarification.

If you proceed with the installation, the HOA can fine you for every day
you are not in compliance.

If you don't pay the fines, the HOA will turn your account over to their
attorney and they will continue to fine you, apply late fees, and now
attorney's fees, to your balance.

Eventually, they will place a lien on your house for the unpaid fines
and fees.

And eventually after that, if your account is delinquent for long
enough, they can foreclose on your lien, selling your house to pay for
the fines.

You really have two options:

1.  Restore the grass and landscape back to the way it was. And then
    move.
2.  Retain a real estate attorney in your area who specializes in HOA
    law and challenge the legality of the Bylaws, or the clause in the
    Bylaws which you are in violation of.

**NOTE:** There is one notable exception, and it is *very new and very
hot off the presses.* If you happen to live in Florida, you just dodged
a bullet. Florida Statute 720.3045 was just passed by the Legislature
and signed by Governor DeSantis. It reads, in part:

> Regardless of any covenants, restrictions, bylaws, rules, or
> requirements of an association, and unless prohibited by general law
> or local ordinance, an association may not restrict parcel owners or
> their tenants from installing, displaying, or storing any items on a
> parcel which are not visible from the parcel\'s frontage or an
> adjacent parcel, including, but not limited to, artificial turf,
> boats, flags, and recreational vehicles.

So if it is not illegal to install a pool in your town or city, the HOA
cannot prohibit you from installing a pool so long as it is not visible
from the front of your house, or from a neighbor's property.
