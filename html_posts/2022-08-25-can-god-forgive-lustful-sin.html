First of all, there is an axiom that you must understand: **For any
statement which begins with "Can God..." the answer is** ***Yes, God
can.***

So the default answer is **yes, God can forgive lustful sin.**

The truth is that we are all sinners. We have all fallen short of the
glory of God. But if we seek Him with all of our hearts, we will find
Him. If you truly desire to know Him, He will make Himself known.

> You will seek me and find me when you seek me with all your heart. ---
> Jeremiah 29:13 NIV

So the key here is *seeking Him with all of your heart.* You can't seek
Him but then retain your sinful ways. So you can't persist in lustful
sin while continuing to seek repentance.

If you truly repent (which is a word which indicates a *turning away*
from sin), you will desire to not sin in thought or deed. And when you
are saved, you will begin to change. The old thoughts and desires will
fade away, and you will become a new person in Christ.

We will fail, because we are human. But God will never abandon us. He
will not leave us. He will never think we are "beyond saving."
