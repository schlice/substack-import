In almost every jurisdiction I know of, you are assigned a date. You
show up on the date.

Perhaps there is a jurisdiction in which you can show up anytime within
the two weeks around your assigned date, but I struggle to see how they
could then be assured that they would have enough jurors in the pool on
any given day.

If you can't show up on your assigned day, contact the clerk of the
court's office, and they can assist you with re-scheduling due to
hardship. But in most cases, it has to be a genuine hardship. Legally,
your employer is required to give you the time from work and legally
cannot fire you for going to jury duty. Your summons is sufficient
evidence for your employer that you're not making excuses.

In our county, we have a "one day, one trial" system wherein just
appearing in the jury pool on your assigned date, even if you are not
selected for trial, fulfills your requirement for the year. When they
have selected all of the juries for the day, they let everyone go, and
you are done for the year.
