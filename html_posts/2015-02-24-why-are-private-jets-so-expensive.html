**Content:** [Economies of scale.\
\
Commercial airlines keep prices relatively low because they sell massive
amounts of seats. They also use algorithms to determine how many people
will buy a ticket and not show up, thus allowing them to \"oversell\" a
flight, because a certain amount of people will not mind switching to a
less-crowded flight in exchange for a dollar-amount voucher. They
operate large numbers of aircraft and operate on a massive scale.\
\
Smaller private jet co-ops do not have the luxuries of exploiting an
economy of scale, so they rely on owners paying fractionally for the
aircraft and its costs, and throwing in the flights. With many co-op
programs, you can also buy time in the system and not take an ownership.
As you can imagine, buying in to a private jet co-op is an expensive
proposition, more expensive than buying commercial airline
tickets.]{.rendered_qtext}
