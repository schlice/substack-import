[[Matthew

analysis is spot on.

Especially when he says, "At the time, the Court (and indeed the nation)
literally had no concept of 'illegal' immigration."

He's right. The Court has never actually ruled on the citizenship of
children born to *illegal immigrants*. The *Wong Kim Ark* case settled
the question about *legal immigrants* and *lawful permanent residents*.
It never settled the question about *illegal immigrants*.

No case law which has come since has actually ruled on this issue.

So despite his insistence that this will be a "quick reversal" by
SCOTUS, I'm not so certain.

Now specifically to answer the question:

**If Donald Trump is allowed to overrule the 14th Amendment by signing
an executive order, which Amendment will be the next to go?**

his EO would not actually "overrule" the 14th Amendment. It would just
codify the appropriate interpretation of the phrase "and subject to the
jurisdiction thereof". It would state that illegal immigrants are not
subject to the jurisdiction of the United States when it comes to
citizenship, and therefore their children are not automatcally granted
US citizenship.

Clearly, this EO would be immediately injuncted (my money's on the 9th
Circus), and the Supreme Court would have the opportunity to rule on the
14th Amendment's applicability to illegal immigrants.

I believe that the 14th Amendment was never intended to grant
citizenship to the children of illegal immigrants. Senator Jacob Howard
worked closely with Abraham Lincoln in drafting and passing the 13th
Amendment (which abolished slavery). He also served on the Senate Joint
Committee on Reconstruction, which drafted the 14th Amendment. In 1866,
Senator Howard clearly spelled out the intent of the 14th Amendment by
writing (emphasis mine):

> Every person born within the limits of the United States, and subject
> to their jurisdiction, is by virtue of natural law and national law a
> citizen of the United States. **This will not, of course, include
> persons born in the United States who are foreigners, aliens, who
> belong to the families of ambassadors or foreign ministers accredited
> to the Government of the United States**, but will include every other
> class of persons. It settles the great question of citizenship and
> removes all doubt as to what persons are or are not citizens of the
> United States. This has long been a great desideratum in the
> jurisprudence and legislation of this country.

To me, from the plain wording of the writers of the 14th Amendment, it
was never intended to grant citizenship to children of illegals.

In actuality, [[according to Ilya Shapiro of the CATO
Institute](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=0372f5&url=https://www.cato.org/blog/birthright-citizenship-constitutionally-required){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="cato.org"}]{.qlink_container}, that phrase was originally
written to exclude the children of Native American tribes from American
citizenship, since those children were subject to the jurisdiction of
Native American tribal government, and were citizens of their tribe, not
of the United States. The amendment was also written to guarantee the
citizenship of freed slaves and their children, in opposition to the
*Dred Scott* ruling.

If we apply the same reasoning, the children born to parents who are
subject to *another* government are not US citizens.

I'd like to see this SCOTUS issue a ruling on this.
