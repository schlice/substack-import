**I have sole physical and legal custody. Why does my ex-husband, who
has not followed his court order at all, think he's going to become a
legal guardian?**

Because regardless of his past mistakes, he's still the father. And
courts recognize that children have the best possibility of later
success in life when raised by their biological parents in a communal
home. So maybe in your situation you can't have it all, but the more of
those things you can give a child, the better chance they have at being
successful. The state has a vested interest in the well-being of those
children.

So the court will try.

Granted, the court will *heavily* condition that try on the father's
willingness to follow each and every court order *to the letter*. One
false move and the custody agreement goes out the window.

But for better or worse, he is still the father. And for better or
worse, you had kids with him. He will never *not* be the father.

So if he throws himself on the mercy of the court and says he's a
changed man and he wants to try to be the best father to those kids that
he can be, I'd bet you dollars to donuts that they give him just enough
rope to hang himself. In other words, they give him the chance, and if
he screws up that chance, *then* they tell him to go pound sand.

So don't be surprised that a few mistakes in his past doesn't completely
shut him out of his kids' lives.
