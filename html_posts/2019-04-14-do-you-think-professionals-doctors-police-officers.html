**Do you think professionals (doctors, police officers, teachers) should
be held accountable after being convicted of a crime, including paying
restitution to their victims?**

Of course they should; that's what the civil court system is for. The
criminal courts find people guilty of crimes and send them to jail; the
civil courts find people responsible for actions and pay restitution to
their victims. The only penalty in a civil court is money to a victim.
The penalty in a criminal court is jail time (but also fines), a
punishment owed to the state (or the people in general).

Whether or not someone is convicted of a crime, they can be sued in
civil court and can be forced to pay restitution to their victims (or
their victim's estate). The most famous recent example of this is OJ
Simpson. He was found not guilty for the murder of his ex-wife and her
friend, but he was sued and was found to be responsible for her death
and the remainder of his fortune was paid out to the estates of the
victims.
