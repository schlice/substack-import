Not at all.

What it ***will*** do is to signal to the Democrats that they can stop
playing this silly game of pretending that Republicans are actually
***relevant.*** Democrats consider Republicans to be the "Washington
Generals." Remember them? They're the team that plays the Harlem
Globetrotters, always destined to lose, just there to be the
straight-man to the Globetrotters' antics, but they still get to "play"
and they still get a paycheck. If Hillary wins, it will be confirmation
that they are the **only** party that matters, and it's time to quit
pretending we have a two-party system.

America's Anchorman, Rush Limbaugh, was discussing this very thing on
his program on September 7th. He was reading from an article over on the
Claremont Institute website titled "[[The Flight 93
Election](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=6e2441&url=http://www.claremont.org/crb/basicpage/the-flight-93-election/){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="claremont.org"}]{.qlink_container}." It's an absolutely
brilliant piece, but very long. It is critical of conservative "Never
Trump"ers. Nevertheless, this is an excerpt from Rush's show where he is
reading a section of the article discussing what a Hillary election will
signal to the Democrat Party. The quote within the quote is from the
article Rush is reading (which I linked above):

> \"A Hillary presidency will be pedal-to-the-metal on the entire
> Progressive-left agenda, plus items few of us have yet imagined in our
> darkest moments. Nor is even that the worst. It will be coupled with a
> level of vindictive persecution against resistance and dissent
> hitherto seen in the supposedly liberal West.\"
>
> What he\'s saying is, with this, is that, look, it\'s not bad enough
> that they\'re advancing their leftist progressive agenda unstoppably.
> What they\'re gonna do if she wins, they\'re gonna get into vindictive
> persecution, and they\'re gonna take out, they\'re gonna do everything
> they can to destroy any and all opposition. And he cites evidence like
> Obama and the IRS and a couple of other examples.

> He\'s basically saying, you think that you\'re gonna continue to have

> They think they\'re on the cusp of getting rid of all opposition and

More about the article:

> And his point is, conservatism\'s about to be erased. Opposition to
> the Democrats and to Hillary and Obama\'s about to be erased if they
> keep winning. There isn\'t gonna be any opposition, principled or
> otherwise! That\'s his belief. Ten pages of it. \"So what do we have
> to lose by fighting back? Only our Washington Generals jerseys \-- and
> paychecks.\" That\'s a dynamite sentence. He\'s basically calling
> these people out: What do you have to lose by fighting back?
>
> He\'s chastising people who are afraid to oppose Hillary or Obama or
> the Democrats for fear they\'re gonna \[be\] kicked out of the
> establishment, for fear they\'re not gonna get their paychecks, for
> fear they\'re not gonna be able to maintain their donations and their
> fundraising. But then he says. \"But those are going away anyway.\"
> Don\'t you understand? All of that\'s going away anyway! There isn\'t
> gonna be a Washington Generals; there isn\'t gonna need to be a
> Washington Generals. There isn\'t gonna need to be a foil anymore,
> \'cause there isn\'t gonna be any serious opposition to worry about.
>
> \"Among the many things the \'Right\' still doesn\'t understand is

> need to go on like this anymore, that we really don\'t need to
> legitimize the Republican Party as an opposition. We don\'t need to
> legitimize conservatism, anymore. So we can just erase \'em.

If this article is even partly true, then this election is far more
important than Trump or Hillary.
