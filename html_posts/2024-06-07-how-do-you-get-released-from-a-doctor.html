I'll assume you're in the United States.

You don't "get released from a doctor's care." If you can no longer pay,
you stop going.

However, if you still need to go and you can't afford insurance, you
find some programs which can help you. There are numerous Federal and
State assistance programs for those who don't have the money to afford
insurance. Medicaid, Medicare, the ACA Healthcare Marketplace, etc. all
have options for people who cannot afford insurance.

Alternatively, there may be some facilities which take charity patients.
You would have to work that out with the facility themselves. Some
publicly-funded institutions must take a certain amount of charity
patients, and they usually do that by writing off the debts of those who
cannot pay and who don't qualify for government assistance. So you may
still be able to get the care you need, even if you can't afford to pay.
Talk to your physical therapist about treatment options for those who
are uninsured.

They may even be able to give you some simple strengthening exercises
that you can do on your own once you leave their care.

Hope is never lost. It's only hopeless when we give up.
