**Content:** [Guns solve a very limited and specific problem. All guns
(in general) allow you to kill something with incredible efficiency, at
extended distances, with exceptional accuracy.\
\
Do they solve problems *between people*? That depends on the problem. If
one of the persons is wielding a knife and is high on drugs, a gun will
solve that problem. If you are having what we could call a \"domestic
dispute,\" a gun would likely make that problem worse.\
\
So whether or not a gun is the right tool to use in any situation
depends on the situation.]{.rendered_qtext}
