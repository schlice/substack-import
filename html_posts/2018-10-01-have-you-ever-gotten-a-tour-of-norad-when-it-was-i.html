**Have you ever gotten a tour of NORAD (when it was inside of Cheyenne
Mountain)?**

I used to *give* those tours. I worked in the Systems Center, so I knew
everything about the workings of the facility. I also worked in Security
Forces, which meant that sometimes I'd provide armed security on some
tours.

The Mountain is a fascinating relic of Cold War paranoia, but it's still
relevant today, for several reasons:

1.  Heat is a *negative* cost inside the Mountain. We re-circulate the
    heat from the people and the computers throughout the facility,
    which is naturally cooled by the surrounding granite to between 55
    and 65 degrees F, so only a little bit of additional heat is needed
    to bring the facilities inside the Mountain to a comfortable working
    temperature.
2.  Water is a *negative* cost inside the Mountain, due to several
    prolific natural springs which were hit while excavating the
    facility. The springs provide *so much* water that it is more than
    we can conceivably use for drinking and for mechanical (cooling
    towers, fire suppression, etc). We store 1.5 million gallons of
    potable water and 4.5 million gallons of non-potable water, and the
    spring produces so much extra that it's literally dumped out the
    side of the Mountain.
3.  Security is a *negative* cost inside the Mountain. We don't have to
    worry about stray radio signals listening to our gear, because
    science has so far had a hard time propagating a radio wave through
    1500 feet of granite. Physical security is simple when you only have
    one way in to your facility and it's got big blast doors on it.
4.  While it may not be able to survive a direct nuclear strike, nothing
    else can touch it. Storms (hurricanes, winter weather, etc) won't
    knock it out. Its redundant power systems mean that it will never
    lose power. Its redundant communications systems means that it will
    never lose connectivity. You can't fly a plane into it. It's about
    the securest facility you can think of, as secure as any
    subterranean facility, except it's built into a mountain.

I personally believe that the minor inconvenience the General has to go
though to haul his ass up to the facility in the event of a contingency
is a small price to pay for the big benefits we have of hosting a
facility whose mission is still relevant today inside of Cheyenne
Mountain.
