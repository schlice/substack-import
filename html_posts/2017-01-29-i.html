I'm going to take this on, because you have a flawed premise which is
causing your problem.

Your flawed premise: ***MS patients need as much muscle as possible***.

Perhaps you've been told this. Perhaps you've read some stuff about
health maintenance with MS and you've come to this conclusion.

*The short answer is that this statement is false.* MS patients do not
need as much muscle as possible. If that were true, MS clinics would be
bodybuilding and bulking facilities, packing on slabs of muscle onto
every MS patient who could do it.

But they're not.

In actuality, maintaining muscle mass and muscle tone in MS patients is
nothing more than *a hedge against the future*.

The reason that MS patients should maintain muscle mass and muscle tone
is because at some point in the future, it is possible that they may
lose some of that mobility. Muscles may not respond as well in the
future, due to nerve damage. Sometimes, weakness in muscles occurs as a
mater of exacerbations, which can remit in RRMS patients. The problem we
are discussing comes when loss of full muscle control is caused by
actual nerve damage. And once you hit that point, it's very difficult,
if not impossible, to go back. Science as of today has not found a
proven method to repair damaged CNS nerves. Once they are damaged, and
those pathways between brain and muscle are disrupted, it becomes
exponentially more difficult to maintain muscle mass and muscle tone.

So exercising ***now***, while you're still healthy enough to do so, is
a hedge against future potential muscle atrophy due to poor signal
quality between the brain and the muscle. This does not translate to
"all MS patients must pack on as much muscle as possible." This does
translate to "you should tone and build muscle before you're no longer
able to do so."

In my opinion, you should work with your neurologist on this issue. Tell
him/her your fitness goals and your priorities. I believe you should
work out a timetable for when you might consider stopping bodybuilding
and transitioning to a muscle building routine rather than a
bodybuilding routine. I think it's only wise that at some point in the
future, you transition away from cutting, and you move towards building
and toning, as a hedge against future issues. This, however, is a
strategy you should work out with your care team. There is no single
answer for anyone. Based on your disease, the close monitoring of it,
how you have progressed up to this point, and what your goals and future
priorities are, you and your neurologist should be able to come up with
a reasonable timeline where you can continue your bodybuilding now, and
eventually transition to a model best suited for a more long-term
strategy to maintain the best tone and muscle mass profile for you and
your future well-being.

MS means you need to *change* your life. MS doesn't mean you need to
*end* your life.

Good luck!
