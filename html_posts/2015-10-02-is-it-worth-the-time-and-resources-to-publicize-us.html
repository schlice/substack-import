**Content:** [There is always a point to publicizing mass shootings.\
\
The problem is, most people *miss the point.* The President is a big
reason most people miss the point.\
\
Even before they finished searching the campus for bombs, before they
could ascertain exactly what had happened, the President was calling for
increased gun control.\
\
Missed the point.\
\
I think most people intuitively know that *the shooting wasn\'t caused
by guns.* So how can you hope to *fix* the issue when you\'re not
addressing the *cause*?\
\
But so many people tend to focus on the gun. It\'s easy to do that,
isn\'t it? It\'s easy to focus on the gun, because it\'s *tangible*.
It\'s a real thing you can hold and presumably regulate.\
\
People, on the other hand, are *messy.* It\'s decidedly harder to fix
*people* than it is to fix *guns.* And no one wants to admit that drugs
can\'t help every mentally ill person, nor that deinstitutionalization
wasn\'t a rousing success for everyone. As is often the case, a
one-size-fits-all solution is never the answer, as there are always some
for whom the answer doesn\'t fit.\
\
If we actually use incidents like these to highlight the failings of the
mental health system in the country, we could start making positive
changes to that system.\
\
Until then, incidents like these will only be ratings fodder for the
drive-by media.]{.rendered_qtext}
