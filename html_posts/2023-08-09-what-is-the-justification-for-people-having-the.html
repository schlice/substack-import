The justification for people to have any of the rights they have in the
United States is the Constitution.

The Framers of the Constitution held the right to own property as almost
sacred. They believed that property and liberty were one, and property
was a guarantee of legal rights. A free people was a people who could
own property.

In the 18th century, most people lived off of land that they owned. Land
was abundant and it could be had as "fee simple," the type of ownership
which gave them complete and full ownership of the property. This was in
stark contrast to what they had in England at the time, wherein all the
fee simple property was vested in the Crown. At best in England, you
lived at the sufferance of the king (and later, Parliament). As
agriculture was the main industry, the ability to own land and live off
of it was one of the main reasons that colonists left England (and other
countries) and came to the United States.

These days, the Supreme Court does not hold property to the same level
as the Framers did; they consider life and liberty to be far superior to
property, which has given rise to concepts like eminent domain, which
tries to square itself with the Constitution, and does so only just.
