There is an ocean's worth of difference between "Christians" and
"Christian Nationalists," specifically those who hold to the belief that
Trump is some kind of "anointed" savior. While he's definitely not the
second coming of Christ, he is, in their minds, specially anointed by
God.

Their evidence? Two attempted assassinations, one foiled by mere
centimeters, and another foiled by the efforts of the US Secret Service.
Additionally, he markets himself as a representative of those people who
traditionally have felt marginalized because of their "Christian"
beliefs. And he's not a timid representative. On the contrary, he's a
tough guy who will bust heads when needed to fight for his people. And
that's what these folks are ultimately looking for: someone who will
stand up to "the swamp" and to "liberal elites" and fairly represent
everyone for a change.

As hard as it may be to believe, you must understand that people who
believe this way are ***most definitely*** ***not*** mainstream
Christians.

(And also, as hard as it may be for some of you to accept, I don't hold
to this view; I'm merely reporting. Please don't shoot the messenger. I
am a Christian, not a Christian Nationalist in this way)
