**If the Hillary Clinton campaign allegedly conspired with the Russian
government against Donald Trump in 2016, where is all the comprehensive
investigative reporting from credible journalists to expose that it,
such has there has been on Trump?**

If you haven't seen it yet, it's because you have defined "credible
journalists" far too narrowly.

Let me guess. If the journalist isn't on broadcast television or CNN or
MSNBC, they're not credible, right?

When you define your sources of "credible journalism" so narrowly, you
miss ou on a great deal of actual reporting.

Try expanding your search a little. I think you might be surprised at
what you find.

And don't forget to take ***all*** journalism with a grain of salt.
