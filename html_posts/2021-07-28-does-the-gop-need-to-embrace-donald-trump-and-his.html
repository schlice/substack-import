The GOP needs to embrace the *idea* of Trump. In other words, you need
to support the same policies that Trump did, but without all the baggage
of Trump.

Trump did some really good things, and he did them well. He espoused the
idea of "the political outsider" (even if he was not). He placed himself
as someone who is willing to stand up to the special interests.

But Trump *the man* came with significant baggage. He is unfortunately
too polarizing as a person to continue to be a good candidate himself.

His *policies*, however, were wildly popular and even for the ones he
was able to accomplish, he probably didn't get the credit he deserved
because of just how polarizing he was.

**TL;DR: The GOP needs to embrace** ***Trump's vision*, but they need to
keep Trump at arm's length.**

Original question:
