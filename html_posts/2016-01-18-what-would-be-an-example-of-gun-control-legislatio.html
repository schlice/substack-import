As most folks have alluded to, we do need to enforce the laws we have.
And we need to make crimes with a gun so dangerous to do (in terms of
consequences) that no criminal (and criminals are not well known for
being all that bright) would be stupid enough to do them. So along those
lines, how do we better \"enforce\" the laws we already have? Here\'s a
few ways that not many folks on either side will like (thus fitting the
actual definition of \"compromise\"):

1\. Attach **mandatory jail time to crimes committed with a gun**. I
don\'t like mandatory sentences very much; they take the natural
flexibility away from the courts which is the fundamental reason we have
courts in the first place. But if we are to effect any meaningful
changes to gun crime, criminals who use guns must be punished, harshly,
for doing so. And no, we do not do this today.

2\. Similarly, we need to make it so that **this charge** (a crime
committed with a gun) **cannot be plea-bargained**. In other words, if
you commit a crime with a gun, that charge cannot be changed or reduced
by pleading guilty. What happens today: a prosecutor may offer a
\"plea-bargain\" wherein he tells the criminal that he will charge him
with the lesser included offense of unlawful possession of a handgun (or
some similar lesser included offense) in exchange for a guilty plea. He
will do less prison time (if he does any time at all), and will be back
out on the streets much sooner, all in the name of expediency in the
court system. Prosecutors do not use this indiscriminately (for the most
part), but they do use it, and criminals know it. They know they can
offer a guilty plea for a lesser charge. When it comes to crimes
committed with a gun, if we are serious about reducing it, we need to
eliminate this practice.

3\. You\'re thinking, \"well, this is going to overload the jails!\" So
let\'s get the non-criminals out of jail. For my third bullet (which no
one will like), we need to **stop jailing drug users**. We should
absolutely jail drug distributors and drug manufacturers. But jailing
drug users is counterproductive, a huge resource sink, and a waste of
everyone\'s time. Most of the people in prison are there on drug
charges, because they were caught buying drugs or caught using drugs.
They are not criminals and should not be in prison. Period. Instead,
force drug users to be placed into inpatient drug treatment, which
should be paid for by redirected funds which previously funded the \"war
on drugs.\" That means the money that was going to police departments to
fund increases in personnel or armament to fight this \"war\" will now
go to inpatient hospitals and clinics where former inmates are now
receiving treatment for their addiction. Police departments won\'t like
that, since they were able to use those funds to upgrade and modernize
their line-level officers\' gear. I am sorry to say that they will have
to work a little harder to get funding for line-level gear upgrades, as
\"war on drugs\" money will be going elsewhere.

This will also benefit a reduction of crime since we will be removing
much of the incentive that small-time criminals used to commit crime in
the first place: getting money to buy more drugs.
