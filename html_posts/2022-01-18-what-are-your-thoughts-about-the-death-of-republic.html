So let's get all the stupid out of the way right up front.

Yes, she died of a complication of OG COVID-19, a blood clot. Yes, she
*may* have benefitted from a vaccine.

**NO, SHE WAS NOT AGAINST VACCINES**. **SHE WAS AGAINST VACCINE**
***MANDATES*.** She claimed, as most Conservatives do, that vaccines are
a **personal choice**, and should not be **forced on the population**.
If you want one, get one, and if you don't, don't.

As you can see, the only person who failed to benefit from Kelly Ernby's
contracting COVID-19 is Kelly Ernby. She made a decision. She could have
made a different one, and she may still be with us today had she done
so. But that was her decision. She went into it with her eyes wide open.

She had the right to make that decision. And she did it. *Of course* you
feel sorry for her family. You can feel sorry for her, but it's kind of
a wasted emotion, as it's too late for her to change anything now, isn't
it. But *of course* you feel sorry for her family's loss. What kind of
psychopath doesn't at least feel some sympathy for that family?

I have had other people in my life die in exactly the same way. They
made a decision to be unvaccinated and it cost them their life. But they
died as they lived: ***free to make their own decisions***.

Original question:

What are your thoughts about the death of Republican Kelly Ernby from
COVID-19 at only 46? She was against masking and vaccines, she even said
Covid wasn't a big deal. Do you feel sorry for her?
