**Content:** [First, you have to expound a little.\
\
What kind of door are you looking to control? Car door? House door?\
\
Second, there aren\'t many controllers that open and close a door. Some
more modern cars have power doors and power liftgates that will open and
close on their own, but generally you\'ll only find that on the
liftgate, or the side sliders on a minivan. Driver/passenger doors are
manual.\
\
So first, you need to identify what you\'re trying to
open/close/lock/unlock.\
Second, those functions need to have a powered method by which they can
peform those functions.\
Finally, you can wire in your Arduino into the control lines for those
devices.\
\
I suggest Raspberry Pi. [[Here\'s a
