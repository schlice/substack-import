**How much money did Jerry Lewis raise in the fight against MS and was
it worth it?**

Zero.

Jerry Lewis raised money for ***muscular dystrophy***, not ***multiple
sclerosis.*** He raised billions of dollars for MDA (the Muscular
Dystrophy Association), not for MS. I can't find any record of his
fundraising activities benefitting anyone in the MS community, nor any
dollars going to the National MS Society or any other multiple
sclerosis-related charities.
