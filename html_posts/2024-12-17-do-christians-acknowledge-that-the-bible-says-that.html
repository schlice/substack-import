I'm a Christian, and yes, that's what it says. And yes, **Jesus did not
condemn slavery, because He didn't need to.**

As with any historical document, it needs to be read from the context of
the community it was addressing. Slave ownership was a common practice
long before the time the Mosaic Law was given. The law neither
instituted slavery nor ended it. Instead, the law *regulated* it. It
gave instructions on how slaves should be treated, but did not outlaw
slavery altogether.

Some people will indeed choose to criticize the Bible because it did not
demand an end to slavery or an immediate overthrow of every
deeply-rooted sinful custom of the day. But, as Warren W. Wiersbe
pointed out, "The Lord chooses to change people and society gradually,
through the ministry of the Holy Spirit and the proclamation of the
truth of the Word of God"[\[1\]](#Ubqsl){#cite-Ubqsl .citation_link}
Alexander MacLaren wrote that the gospel "meddles directly with no
political or social arrangements, but lays down principles which will
profoundly affect these, and leaves them to soak into the general
mind."[\[2\]](#uyTWh){#cite-uyTWh .citation_link} Christianity was never
intended to be a movement for political change. Instead, it works in the
hearts and minds of individual Christ followers, who eventually enact
social change and affect political policy. Indeed, in the places where
Christianity spread and took firm hold, those Christians eventually
brought slavery to an end.

The fundamentals of the movement which resulted in the eventual end of
slavery are indeed in the Bible, which teaches that all men are created
by God and made in His image (Genesis 1:27), which condemns those who
kidnap and sell a person (Exodus 21:16; cf. 1 Timothy 1:8--10), and
which shows that a slave can truly be "a brother in the Lord" (Philemon
1:16). Clearly, following the Bible will naturally lead one to abandon
slavery altogether.
