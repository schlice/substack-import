An AMBER Alert is just that: an alert. It\'s not a news story. It\'s not
an article in the paper. It\'s a brief alert to notify you of a
situation.

Also, you must consider the various methods by which AMBER Alerts may be
delivered: SMS-like notices on your phone. Overhead electronic road
signs. Scrolls on the bottom of your TV screen. There\'s only a limited
amount of information which can be delivered using this method.
