I find it odd that a normal functioning adult would not understand the
difference between assault and corporal punishment, but here we are.

So let's make sure we focus on state law, since the laws we are
discussing are all state-level laws. And with that in mind, let's also
remember that we have 50 separate, sovereign states, and they all have
their own laws. So just for argument's sake, I'll discuss Florida's laws
first and foremost.

Let's start with children. Corporal punishment is an approved method of
parental discipline in Florida, so long as it does not cause "harm."

However, the Florida statute lists the following as not valid or legal
methods of corporal punishment:

- Anything involving a deadly weapon
- Inflicting cuts, bites, lacerations, punctures, etc.
- Burning or scalding
- Damaging the brain or spinal cord
- Fracturing any bones or the skull
- Causing intracranial hemorrhaging or injury to the organs
- Drowning, suffocating, asphyxiation
- Any kind of disfigurement or discipline that would result in a body
  part not functioning or being impaired in function
- Causing significant bruising or welting
- Dislocating, spraining, or damaging the cartilage of the body

Additionally, the statute lays out conduct that could be seen as legal
"harm":

- Forcing, encouraging, or allowing the child victim to be sexually
  exploited, like engaging in prostitution
- Exposing the child to alcohol or drugs
- Abandoning the child
- Neglecting the child
- Committing, encouraging, or allowing lascivious or lewd acts or sexual
  battery to be committed against the child

\

When referring to adults, corporal punishment by parents no longer
applies. At this point, it becomes assault, which is a crime.
