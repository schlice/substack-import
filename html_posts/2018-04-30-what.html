**What\'s the cheapest way to legally enforce copyrighted computer code
without going to court?**

Send a cease and desist letter and hope they comply. That's the cheapest
way to enforce a copyright.

Second, have your lawyer send a *certified* cease and desist letter, and
hope they comply. A lawyer's letter carries a little more weight.

That's about all you can do without actually filing a copyright
infringement case in court.
