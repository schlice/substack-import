In any building in any type of active shooter situation, there are three
things that you should do, every time. Do these in order. Oh, and while
you do these things, you should be on your cell phone with 911.

1.  **Run**. If you can get out, then go. If you can get out a back door
    (or if you're on a ground floor, a window), go. Take as many people
    with you as you can. Run at least a block away and then wait for
    police.
2.  **Hide**. If you can't run, hide. Try to find a location that is
    easily defensible, one that you have full view in the direction of
    the shooter, but the shooter may not be able to see you clearly. An
    office with one door might be a good place to hide, or a classroom.
    Barricade the one door with whatever is in that room: desks, filing
    cabinets, etc. Then stay away from that door and hunker down. Make
    sure the 911 operator knows where you are.
3.  **Fight**. If the shooter tries to breach your position, don't
    hesitate just because he has a gun. He can't shoot everyone at once.
    Fight back! Use whatever tools are at your disposal: a phone
    receiver, a fire extinguisher, a desk chair, a book, a letter
    opener, *whatever you can find* can be used as a weapon. But don't
    sit passively and allow yourself to become a victim. Remember, **the
    shooter** is the threat, not **the** **weapon**. Neutralize the
    shooter and the threat is ended. Don't focus on the gun, focus on
    the shooter.
