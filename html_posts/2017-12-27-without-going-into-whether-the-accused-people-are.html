**Without going into whether the accused people are guilty, is
\"Murder\" the appropriate charge when someone is killed because of a
\"prank\"?**

The short answer is **yes**, the charges are appropriate.

Originally, the boys were charged with an Ohio charge called "felonious
assault" which is basically felony-level (criminal) assault, but when
the passenger died, the charge was upped to murder.

Essentially, you're asking about the "intent" portion, or the *mens rea*
(i.e. the guilty mind) in a murder charge. There are two portions: the
"act," also called the *actus reus* (i.e. the guilty act), and the
"intent."

The boys performed a criminal act, knowingly dropping a sandbag off of
an overpass into freeway traffic. This alone is felony assault. When the
passenger died, it became second degree murder: during the performance
of a criminal act, the direct outcome of that act was a death, even
though the death was not intentional. The other boys get charged with
murder as well under the "felony murder rule:" when the group is
committing a felony, if one member of the group commits a murder, the
entire group can be charged with murder.

If the boys had intended on killing someone by dropping the bag instead
of it being a "prank," the charge in most jurisdictions would be
first-degree murder.
