**Are MS and GERD related? Can gerd be a side effect of MS?**

MS is an autoimmune disorder which affects nerve fibers in the central
nervous system. Symptoms typically include balance, bowel/bladder
issues, gait, and sometimes swallowing.

GERD (Gastroesophegeal reflux disease) is an issue where the lower
esophageal sphincter does not properly close or leaks, allowing frequent
stomach acid back into the esophagus.

MS does not affect autonomic musculature like the heart, or the
esophageal sphincters. For that reason, MS cannot be a direct cause of
GERD.

However, MS medications, especially some of our early oral medications,
may indeed cause GI side effects. Acid reflux could be a side effect of
MS medication.
