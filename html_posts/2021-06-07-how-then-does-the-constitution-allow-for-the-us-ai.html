This is an interesting philosophical Constitutional question. This
question came up just recently when President Trump created the US Space
Force. The same argument that was made when Trump created the Space
Force would hold true when the Air Force was created. Indeed, the
argument was made in the 50s when the Air Force was created, and the
same argument holds true today.

The "textualist" argument is based on the text in Article I, Section 8
of the Constitution. This text seems to give Congress the authority to
create an Army and Navy, but not an Air Force or a Space Force. However,
the Constitutional disagreement that holds the most water is the
"sufficiently distinct" argument. If the new military function is
"sufficiently distinct" from the conventional meaning of "army" and
"navy" in 1788, then Congress still wouldn't have the authority to
establish the new service, since Article I allows them to establish an
"army" and a "navy," and those military functions are "sufficiently
distinct" from the functions of an "air force" or a "space force."

However, the argument falls flat for a number of reasons, but the
primary reason is that if the Air Force is constitutional as part of the
Army (i.e. the Army flies helicopters), or if the Air Force is
constitutional as part of the Navy (i.e. the Navy flies carrier-based
aircraft), then the Air Force is constitutional if it is reorganized
into its own branch under the Necessary and Proper clause.

The other reason is that the text in Article I Section 8 seems more
intent on granting the power to create armed forces to a specific branch
of government than controlling exactly the armed forces that they can
create.

While no one has yet realistically argued that the Air Force or the
Space Force is unconstitutional, if you are a textualist, you may fall
into the camp which believes that the role of an "air force" or a "space
force" are sufficiently distinct from what we traditionally know as the
role of an army or the role of a navy, such that the Constitution did
not grant Congress the power to establish them. A Constitutional
amendment would need to be enacted if this question should need to be
addressed in the future, and that would take care of this argument
completely.
