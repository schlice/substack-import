There is no cure for MS currently.

There is also no "functional cure," such that any indication of the
disease has been eradicated from the body.

There are treatments which provide some symptom relief to most patients.
Most treatments involve good diet choices along with one of the approved
disease-modifying drugs. These drugs shorten the length of MS relapses,
along with lengthening the amount of time between relapses and reducing
their severity. In some cases, the medications slow and repress disease
activity to such a degree that the brain can potentially begin to heal,
but this has not been studied to any significant degree.
