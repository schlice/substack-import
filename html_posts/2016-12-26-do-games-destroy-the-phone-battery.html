What depletes phone batteries? In order of biggest draw:

- Screen usage
- CPU utilization
- Network usage
- Memory utilization

Screen usage is the number one culprit of phone battery utilization,
more than CPU utilization or anything else you do with your phone. So
turn down your brightness, reduce the frame rate of your game (which you
can do with Samsung's Game Launcher, and usually doesn't negatively
impact gameplay), and you can extend your battery without unduly
sacrificing gameplay.

Without a rooted phone, you can't modify how the phone uses the CPU, but
even interactive CPU governors are going to be running nearly full tilt
while you are actively using the phone, so it's of little benefit to
discuss it in a discussion of active use of the device.

Network usage can be curtailed during a game, especially if it doesn't
have online components (i.e. connecting to Google Play or Facebook for
online gameplay or statistics or saving). If the game does connect, only
leave active the one method by which it connects; turn the other radios
off or limit background data and sync.

Memory utilization also can't be controlled by the end user, it's more
of a developer thing. Ensuring you have enough free memory for swap
space can help, and regular cleaning of junk also helps.
