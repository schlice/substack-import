**Can I legally install a camera at our front door for safety and a
camera in the living room facing the door only? Or only the camera
outside to secure our front door?**

Remember that in all cases, you must check your state and local laws
regarding the use of cameras, as they may differ.

In most cases, if you are the owner of the house, you may install
security cameras both outside and inside to protect your home. Inside,
you may only install cameras in "common areas" (i.e. the living room,
the kitchen, the hallway, etc). You may not install cameras in any area
of the house where there is a reasonable expectation of privacy (i.e.
the bedroom, the bathroom, etc).

Also in most cases, you cameras cannot record audio. This is a holdover
from federal "wiretapping" laws which dictate how conversations can be
recorded, and the types of consent required. In some states, posting
signs stating that audio and video recording takes place on the premises
and that entry implies consent may be sufficient. Again, check state and
local laws carefully before allowing your cameras to record audio.
