**Content:** [If you\'re in a home, just do what he is asking. Your life
isn\'t worth your pride. I know it\'s a hard pill to swallow, but
sometimes we do what we have to do to survive.\
\
If you\'re in a public place like a grocery store, the first thing you
should try to do is get away. Try to escape, and try to get as many
people out as you can.\
\
If you are prevented from leaving by the gunman, try to talk to him. Try
to de-escalate the situation. Tell the individual he hasn\'t hurt anyone
yet (as long as he hasn\'t), and he isn\'t in serious trouble yet, so he
can still \"walk away from this.\"\
\
(I know technically he is, but comparing waving a gun around with murder
is a huge gap, so he really isn\'t in much trouble at all just waving a
gun around)\
\
The overriding themes you want to present are \"nobody has to get
hurt,\" \"you can still walk away from this,\" and \"you don\'t need to
hurt anyone to get what you want.\"\
\
From there, you need to find out what he wants and help work through a
way to get that without hurting anyone.\
\
Hopefully, you can de-escalate the situation before the police arrive,
and it will go much more smoothly once they get there.\
\
In the meantime, someone should be calling the police and telling them
everything going on, including descriptions of all the people involved,
in as much detail as you can muster.]{.rendered_qtext}
