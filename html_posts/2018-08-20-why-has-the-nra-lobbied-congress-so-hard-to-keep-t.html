**Why has the NRA lobbied Congress so hard to keep the CDC from
investigating gun violence as a health matter?**

Short answer: ***they didn't.***

Longer answer: In 1993, a CDC-funded research study by Arthur Kellerman
found, among other things, that guns in the home were associated with an
increased risk of homicide in the home. The NRA saw this report as
unrelated to CDC's mission to prevent disease, and instead saw it as a
veiled attempt at gun control through "research."

Through their lobbying efforts, Congress passed the [[Dickey
Amendment](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=7fd880&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dickey_Amendment){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"

Omnibus spending bill. The amendment simply says, "\[N\]one of the funds
made available for injury prevention and control at the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) may be used to advocate or promote
gun control.\"

That's it. Do as much research as you like, but you can't take a
political position.

Researchers, of course, saw this is a "restriction" on their work, and
didn't do *any* research at all, making it appear that the NRA's
lobbying efforts had in fact **prohibited** the CDC from doing any gun
research at all.

Democrats tried all throughout the Obama years to remove the Dickey
Amendment from spending bills, but it stubbornly hung on. Obama directed
the CDC to get back to work and do gun research. They funded a study in
2013, and did their own study in 2015.

In 2018, when the Continuing Resolution was passed allowing for
government operations to continue, a report accompanying the CR
clarified that the CDC can, in fact, conduct research into gun violence,
so long as they do not advocate or promote gun control.
