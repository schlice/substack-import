If you can prove that the State's motivation in restricting abortion is
to remove the woman's control over her body, then the State can use the
same line of reasoning (removing control over his body) to sterilize a
man.

But as of yet, no State (nor does the draft SCOTUS opinion) state as
their primary reason for repealing *Roe* that the motivation in
restricting abortion is to "remove the woman's control over her own
body."

In my opinion, women absolutely have control over their own bodies, but
only to a certain extent. In the case of abortion, it's not a control
issue. It's an equal rights issue. And if we are to be consistent
regarding equal rights, then we must consider the baby in the womb to
have at least access to the same rights.

So it's much less about control, and much more about equal rights.
