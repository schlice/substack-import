**Content:** [The gun is a very simple mechanical tool. It works in the
harshest of conditions. It works when it is needed. So far, the \"smart
guns\" out there are fragile, complex, can be bypassed, and don\'t
always work (i.e. sometimes they let other-than-registered shooters fire
the weapon, and sometimes they prevent the registered shooter from
firing the weapon).\
\
If a gun is a tool to be used in a life-and-death situation, mistakes
like these can cost you your life. Until the technology becomes as
reliable as the underlying gun itself, it\'s not a viable
technology.]{.rendered_qtext}
