I was a victim of identity theft before identity theft was the fastest
growing crime in the United States.

The local police department told me that their investigators were simply
too busy to take the case. They gave me a jacket number that I could
give to the credit card company to show them that "someone" was doing
"something," and I'd likely get the whole incident scrubbed from my
credit and swept under the rug.

It likely would have worked. But it wasn't *right*.

I went to the Sheriff's Office, whose investigators told me that they
had a fifth of the investigators that the local department had, and they
never turned a case down. My enduring admiration for the Sheriff's
Office began that day.

It never went to trial; the DA chose not to press charges even though
evidence was present to support two felony charges.
