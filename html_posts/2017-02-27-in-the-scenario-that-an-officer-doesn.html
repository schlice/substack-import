Your question is convoluted, but it is like many other questions on
Quora looking for that *magic bullet* that you can show that the officer
didn't do that will get you off scot-free.

Unlike the movies and TV, the police do not read you your Miranda rights
statement when you are arrested. You are only read your rights and asked
to sign a Miranda statement *when you are being questioned*. The officer
at the scene is under no obligation to read you your Miranda rights
unless he has to ask you questions besides basic identity questions,
which you are generally required to give (truthfully) under law.

If your rights were not read to you, it's probably because you were not
being interrogated.

Work this out with your lawyer. Make sure your lawyer knows everything
that happened, when it happened, and what was said. If there was an
error, your lawyer will help you sort it out.
