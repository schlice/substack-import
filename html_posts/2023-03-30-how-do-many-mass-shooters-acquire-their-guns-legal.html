School shooters? Who are universally young and probably not too far out
of school themselves? Virtually all of them.

Adam Lanza stole his mother's gun, killed her with it, and then went to
the school where she taught and killed kindergarteners with it. So that
would be an illegal acquisition.

But the others bought their guns mostly legally. They weren't criminals
yet, until they were. And how do you stop someone who isn't a criminal?
You can't.

The best you can do is to make it so costly for them to commit their
crimes that they choose to do something else. Make it impossible to get
into a school any way but the front door, and then fortify the front
door. We do this with airports and courthouses all over the country, but
we can't do this to a school building?

So back to the question. **HOW** do mass shooters acquire their guns
legally? ***Because at the time they acquire their guns, they are not
prohibited persons.***

In the vast majority of cases, mass shooters are not prohibited people.
