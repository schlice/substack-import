God isn't some great cosmic vending machine. You don't put prayers into
the slot, push the button, and get your wishes out. It doesn't really
work that way.

Did you ever ask your parents for ice cream for breakfast? If you did,
what did they tell you? If you're a thinking adult, if your child asked
you for ice cream for breakfast, what would you tell them?

For the sake of the example, let's assume that you'd say no. Why?
Because ice cream for breakfast isn't healthy for them. They may not
know that. Or they may know that, and not care. But you know it. And so
you do what's best for them. **Sometimes, what's best for them includes
telling them no.**

If a parent does this with their child, don't you think that God would
do that with His children?

So if your prayers have not been answered in the way in which you want,
or think they should, one of several things may have happened:

- God heard your prayer and said no.
- God heard your prayer but you are asking for insincere, selfish, or
  unbiblical reasons.
- You may not be one of God's children (not yet "adopted" into His
  family), so He's not going to answer your prayers anyway.

So what can you do about this? It depends on why God isn't answering
your prayer in the way in which you want.

If God isn't answering your prayer because He's saying no, then we have
to learn to accept His wisdom. He's saying no for a reason, because just
like ice cream for breakfast, granting your prayer may not be good for
you. It may not be in your best interest, and what's in your best
interest is always in keeping with His good plans for you, which you and
I probably don't even know. But we know He has good plans for us
(Jeremiah 29:11), so we must **trust** that His ways are better for us
in the long run.

If God isn't answering your prayer because you are insincere in your
desire, or you are being selfish or unbiblical, it's time to examine
your own heart and ask why it is that you want what you're asking for.
Is it something that advances the Kingdom, or is it something that
advances your own comfort? Nowhere in the Bible does it say that being a
Christian will always be a pleasurable, comfortable, cozy experience. In
fact, the Bible tells us exactly the opposite, that being a Christian
will be a very challenging prospect, and we should expect trouble from
this world (John 16:33).

If God isn't answering your prayer because you aren't one of His
children yet, then consider why you're asking God for things in the
first place, when you haven't taken the necessary steps to get right
with God first. Have you truly, truly repented of your sin? Have you
truly asked God to come into your heart and take over your life? Have
you been baptized, to show the world of your decision? Are you daily
trying to live a right, Godly life? "You hypocrite, first take the plank
out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck
from your brother's eye" (Matthew 7:5). Maybe fix your own affairs
before you ask God to provide you with the fruits of His benevolence.

In all of these cases, what we do about this is **fix ourselves** and
fix our view of God, or our relationship with God. Once we realize that
God is going to fulfill His plans for our lives whether we agree or not,
we realize that prayer is a way for us to converse with God, to get our
minds right around His plans for us, and to ask Him to bring us
alongside Him while he works His plans in our lives.

So rather than asking for things, we should be asking God to help us
understand His plans better, so that the things we want better align
with His good plans for us.
