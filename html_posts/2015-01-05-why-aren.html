**Content:** [Since you\'re talking about water crashes, the Combiation
Voice and Data Recorder (CVDR) unit is stuck inside aircraft wreckage,
which is usually not floating. In order to float, the unit would have to
jettison from the aircraft just before it crashes. The entire fleet of
F/A-18 Hornets has ejectable CVDR units, since many more of those
aircraft fly over water than US commercial aircraft. Less than 10% of
the US aviation fleet flies over water, so requiring all CVDR units to
be jettisonable and buoyant is a monetary cost that the aviation
industry finds unnecessary.\
\
And while the NTSB can make recommendations on how to build CVDR units,
it is the FAA that makes policy. FAA policy doesn\'t require fully
buoyant CVDRs or transponders on CVDR units, just \"pingers\" which make
noise underwater. They would be heard by underwater microphones.\
\
In the case of MH370, we couldn\'t find the CVDR before the pinger\'s
battery died.]{.rendered_qtext}
