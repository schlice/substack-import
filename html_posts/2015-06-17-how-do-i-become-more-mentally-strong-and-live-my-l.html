**Content:** [If I may be so bold as to suggest some reading, I recently
read a book called *Daring Greatly* by [[Brené
Brown](https://www.quora.com/topic/Bren%C3%A9-Brown)]{.qlink_container}.
The sub-title is \"How the courage to be vulnerable transforms the way
we live, love, parent, and lead.\" Brené is a \"shame researcher\" and
has a great TEDx talk that went viral on YouTube.\
\
In essence, she talks about how our personal shame holds us back, and
having courage by allowing ourselves to be vulnerable is a more
authentic way to live your life. I highly recommend her book to you. If
you want the Cliff Notes version, look her up on
YouTube.]{.rendered_qtext}
