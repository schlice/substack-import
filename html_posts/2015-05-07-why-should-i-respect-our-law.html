**Content:** [Law is a funny thing. It\'s really nothing more than words
on a piece of paper. You can choose to follow it, or you can choose not
to follow it. Humans are created with free will.\
\
In America, we choose to live together as members of a civil society. In
order to do that, we have to cede some control to the law, so that all
of us can live together in an ordered society. Without law, there would
be anarchy. Rioting in the streets daily. Murder. Utter chaos.\
\
We choose not to live like that. In order to do so, we choose to follow
the law.\
\
There will always be those who don\'t follow the law. For them, we have
the police and the courts (the Executive and Judicial branches of
government) who arrest the lawless and remove them from society, and
then prosecute them under the law.\
\
The court system sometimes doesn\'t look \"fair.\" Sometimes, the court
system looks downright cruel and unfair. But know that it is definitely
fair, even though it may appear to be unfair. There are reasons for
every decision.]{.rendered_qtext}
