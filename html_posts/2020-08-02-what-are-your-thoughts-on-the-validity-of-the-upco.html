**What are your thoughts on the validity of the upcoming Tik Tok ban
from Donald Trump?**

The only way this would be allowed would be if they found a "smoking
gun" inside the app that was actually collecting user information and
delivering it directly to the Chinese government. Fear that the app, or
its parent corporation, are feeding user information to the Chinese is
not enough to ban an app. The 1st Amendment is still a thing. I can't
see the courts supporting a ban on an app simply because it is owned by
a Chinese company and we don't trust the Chinese. I mean, we don't,
because past behavior is generally a good indication of future actions,
but it's still not enough.

We have some history here, before the digital age. Banning books was a
popular pastime, but has largely been stopped here. For example, *The
Anarchist Cookbook* was banned in Australia and was highly restricted in
other places, but not here. It\'s still available for purchase. Amazon
sells it in digital format for Kindle.

That said, you've seen lately the unprecedented ability of a government
to literally stop capitalism in its tracks because of the threat of a
virus. Tens of thousands of small businesses, the lifeblood of this
country, will close permanently as a result, and we as a nation will be
worse for it. Trump could issue an Executive Order and ban the app,
forcing Google and Apple to remove it from their respective app stores
so that only those who root or jailbreak their devices would be able to
use it. This, obviously, would lead immediately to a lawsuit, but the
ban would stay in place until that suit is decided. Placing a nationwide
injunction on a national security matter is horribly bad optics. A
prosecutor who would do such a thing either has cojones the size of cue
balls, or is incredibly short-sighted.

As far as what he's going to do, it's hard to tell. It's a complex
issue.

But it does more than spread fear among 15 year olds that they are going
to have a lot more free time on their hands. It sends a much more
powerful message to China than it does to anyone in the US. To China, it
says that we can take your most powerful moneymaker in the US and shut
it down with the stroke of a pen. And that hits China where it hits
anyone and hurts the most: in the wallet. If it brings them to the
bargaining table, then maybe this power play isn't such a bad thing.

We shall see.
