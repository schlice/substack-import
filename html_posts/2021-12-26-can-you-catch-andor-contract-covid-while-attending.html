> Can you catch and/or contract COVID while attending Church services?

Of course you can. Especially with Omicron running around, which seems
to target both the vaccinated and the unvaccinated with equal vigor.

> Will Jesus heal you if you do?

Nope. I don't know where this idea came from. Maybe you're just guessing
why people would go to church during a pandemic. Maybe you think that
they think that Jesus will heal them.

We just had one of our congregation die from COVID, so we know full well
that no one is healing us if we get sick.

But there is a big, big difference between the church crowd and everyone
else.

We do not live in **fear**. We live in **faith**. Doesn't mean I don't
take proper precautions (I'm fully vaccinated with boosters), but I also
don't cower in my home, having my all my meals delivered and having
clean underwear shipped in from Amazon.

- If we contract COVID in church, in Walmart, or in Disney World, we
  still contracted COVID. And it was part of God's plan.
- If we die from contracting COVID, it was part of God's plan.
- If we contract COVID but we recover, it was part of God's plan.

So, I'm sure you're asking yourself right now: *what is God's plan?*

**We don't know.** We probably won't ever know until we meet him face to
face. But we know he has plans for us.

> "For I know the plans I have for you,\" declares the LORD, \"plans to
> prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.
> Then you will call upon me and come and pray to me, and I will listen
> to you. You will seek me and find me when you seek me with all your
> heart." --- Jeremiah 29:11 NIV

We can expound on this topic quite a bit more, but I'll limit it to this
for now. Bottom line: live in faith, don't live in fear. God's got this.
He always has.
