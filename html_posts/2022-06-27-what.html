I hate to burst your bubble, but *Roe* is dead and isn't coming back.
Whether or not abortion is legal, and up to what gestational age, is an
issue for lawmakers in Congress or the states to decide, not the courts.
Today, individual states can choose to allow completely, allow
partially, or limit abortions at their discretion.

So the quickest way to get *Roe*-like permission for abortion is to move
to a state which completely allows abortions, like New York, California,
Oregon, Washington, or Colorado.

The next quickest way is to elect people who will enact laws allowing
abortions in your state.

There are other, slower, ways to make it happen:

- Propose a Constitutional amendment. If there is as much support for
  abortion as you believe there is, it should be no problem getting 2/3
  of Congress and 3/4 of the states to sign on to an amendment to the
  Constitution declaring that the right to an abortion actually does
  exist. But that means you only need 12 states to say no and your
  amendment doesn't get added to the Constitution. So you have a really
  tough hill to climb for this one. You could also propose a
  Constitutional amendment guaranteeing the right to privacy, which was
  the faulty basis upon which *Roe*'s right to an abortion was based,
  and then try to say that abortion restrictions are unconstitutional
  based on the newly-discovered right to privacy. But you face exactly
  the same problem: you need majorities in 3/4 of the states to amend
  the Constitution.
- Or, you could lobby Congress to pass Federal abortion protections. But
  clearly, while people want *some* access to abortion, they don't want
  100% unfettered access to abortion at all gestational ages up until
  birth. So Congress would have to pass a *compromise* bill like, for
  example, allowing abortions up to at least 15 weeks, and states could
  decide to allow it for longer, but no less than 15 weeks. That would
  be a valid compromise bill: it sets a minimum threshold for the
  states, and allows them to permit it further if they choose, but
  they'd all have to allow at least a little. However, Congress really
  isn't interested in *compromise* these days. Some brave
  Representatives worked on a compromise bill, but the radical
  leadership of both the House and the Senate wouldn't even bring it to
  the floor for debate. So you're unlikely to get any motion out of
  Congress any time soon.
