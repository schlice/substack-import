Maybe you're willing to roll the dice with some unapproved treatment,
but not me. This is my health we're talking about.

Besides, the largest majority of patients have some form of insurance
which assists with drug costs. Manufacturers are more concerned with
keeping you on their drug and getting money from insurance than making
you pay out of pocket, so they all have payment assistance programs
which will cost you little to nothing out of pocket, so long as you stay
on the drug and you have insurance of some form (even Medicare
qualifies).

There are also nonprofit assistance funds available to help with
financial costs, plus if you are on Medicare, there is gap insurance
available, and all of these options are cheaper than paying retail for
an approved MS drug.
