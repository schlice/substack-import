**Not that he deserves it, but is there the slightest chance that Derek
Chauvin could find an impartial jury?**

It is especially for people like Derek Chauvin that the concept of
"everyone has the right to an impartial jury" exists. You may believe
that his *actions* deserve punishment, but that should not include
losing the right to an impartial jury. We are nothing as a nation if we
so easily dispose of our rights when we feel someone doesn't "deserve"
them. Don't fall into that trap. Chauvin deserves an impartial jury.

However, an "impartial" jury is not a jury comprised only of people who
have no opinion about the case. In today's climate, that will be nearly
impossible to find. What an "impartial" jury legally consists of is
jurors who are simply willing to decide the case only on the basis of
the evidence presented, and ignoring their own
bias.[\[1\]](#ckmhu){#cite-ckmhu .citation_link} In the court's view,
there are three safeguards which ensure that the jury does just that:

- *Voire dire*, or the process by which lawyers can remove jurors who
  they believe cannot decide a case impartially
- The ability of the judge and counsel to watch jury deliberations
- The ability of jurors to report unusual behavior to the court before a
  verdict is read

In *this* respect, I believe there are enough good, smart people to act
as jurors, who can logically put aside their biases and decide a case on
the facts presented alone.
