**Where does the US Constitution specifically call out the
responsibility of Congress to oversee the Executive branch of
government?**

As with many things in the Constitution, it may not necessarily contain
those words, but it contains those ideas. We can also look at the
thoughts of the people who wrote the Constitution. A collection of
documents known as *The Federalist Papers* details what the framers of
the Constitution were thinking when they wrote what they did. Federalist
number 51 defines the principles we're discussing: *checks and
balances.*

Checks and balances has a full Constitutional tradition, even though
those words were never listed in the Constitution. Each one of the three
branches of government is *co-equal*; that is, no one branch is more
powerful than the others. The powers of each branch are carefully
defined, and in each case, the power to *oversee the other branches* is
also clearly defined. From our friends over at
[[usconstitution.net](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=e5b5a8&url=https://www.usconstitution.net/consttop_cnb.html){.external_link

onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="usconstitution.net"}]{.qlink_container}, here's a listing of
the defined powers of each branch of government which serve as checks on
the other branches:

> **Legislative Branch**
>
> - Checks on the Executive
>   - Impeachment power (House)
>   - Trial of impeachments (Senate)

>   branch has a degree of self-checking)

>     consent of the other house

The quote doesn't completely identify how the Legislature can oversee
the Executive. Our laws, as allowed by our Constitution, call for
[[Congressional
oversight](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=27dc8b&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congressional_oversight){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"

to review how Federal agencies are implementing their laws, and how they
may need to modify those laws.
