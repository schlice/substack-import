A core principle of good Bible understanding is what we call *exegesis*.
It flows from the understanding that the Bible never contradicts itself,
and therefore no two Bible passages will ever be in direct
contradiction. To that end, when someone asks a difficult Bible
question, we should allow the Bible to explain the Bible.

If we try to derive meaning beyond that process, we are in danger of
using *our own interpretation* to understand difficult Bible passages.
This is a process called *eisegesis*, and it almost always leads to an
incorrect interpretation of the Bible.

When we try to understand the Bible, the best way to do it is to let the
Bible explain the Bible.

As a matter of fact, if you were to chart out all of the Bible verses
that refer to other Bible verses, you can see just how *interconnected*
the Bible is. And if you were to, say, draw those connections out on a
line, with the length of the arc determining its color, you'd get a
chart that looks something like this:

::: qtext_image_wrapper
![](images/qimg-14f49679969b76cb36043025f7255abd){.landscape
.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed
master_src="images/qimg-14f49679969b76cb36043025f7255abd"
master_w="2000" master_h="1176"}
:::

*(You might even say that the Bible is the first hyperlinked book in
history)*

This interconnection between the books of the Bible is incredible. And
not just because it is self-referential. It's incredible because the
timespan between the first book written and the last book written is
about 1500 years. And if you think that one of them just read the other
one and wrote the same thing, the books on the left side of the long
line in the middle, at the bottom, the separation between the Old
Testament and the New Testament, were written in different languages
(Hebrew on the left, Greek and Aramaic on the right), and on *three
different continents,* by no fewer than 40 different authors.

And yet, the Bible maintains a consistent message throughout, and never
contradicts itself. You think any book compiled by human authors, using
the same criteria, could accomplish such striking cohesiveness? Also,
where it references scientific facts or historical locations or people,
it is never incorrect about those. That doesn't make it a scientific
textbook, it just means that where it does mention scientific facts,
they are never wrong.

Other neat facts about this drawing: the shading along the bottom
indicates the different books of the Bible, and the lines below the
shaded areas show you the length of each chapter in the book. This is an
amazing visual representation showing just how deeply the Bible
references itself.
