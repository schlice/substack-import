<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [The right to life and the right to death are mutually<br>exclusive. There is no requirement that a nation endorse a right to die<br>simply because they endorse a right to life. A nation can recognize a<br>right to life that should be protected while simultaneously rejecting<br>that a person has the right to take their own life at a time and place<br>of their own choosing.\<br>\<br>The United States was firmly founded in Judeo-Christian values, and so<br>the need to protect life from being taken by others was far more<br>pressing than the need to protect one\'s ability to end their own life.<br>At the time of the writing of the Declaration of Independence (in which<br>the right to life is founded), no one would have rationally thought that<br>the need to endorse or reject the right to die would have existed. The<br>Founders never would have had such a thought cross their minds. They<br>believed in God and they believed that God would allow you to die when<br>He was ready. At the same time, the law needed to protect your life from<br>being taken by anyone else.\<br>\<br>If you endorse a right to life and a right to death, you would have to<br>say that your life is sacrosanct and cannot be taken by anyone ***but<br>you***. But this raises other questions: can you thus assign this right?<br>If you have the right to assign your right to die to someone else<br>(allowing someone to take your life), would this be legal? What if you<br>were coerced into assigning your right to die to someone else? Could<br>this be included in a sufficiently-funded contract?\<br>\<br>It just seems that when you endorse a right to life and a right to<br>death, life and the ability to live it gets boiled down to little more<br>than contractual agreements. It makes it very difficult to support both<br>a right to life and a right to death.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
