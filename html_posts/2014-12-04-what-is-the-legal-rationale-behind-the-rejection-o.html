**Content:** [The right to life and the right to death are mutually
exclusive. There is no requirement that a nation endorse a right to die
simply because they endorse a right to life. A nation can recognize a
right to life that should be protected while simultaneously rejecting
that a person has the right to take their own life at a time and place
of their own choosing.\
\
The United States was firmly founded in Judeo-Christian values, and so
the need to protect life from being taken by others was far more
pressing than the need to protect one\'s ability to end their own life.
At the time of the writing of the Declaration of Independence (in which
the right to life is founded), no one would have rationally thought that
the need to endorse or reject the right to die would have existed. The
Founders never would have had such a thought cross their minds. They
believed in God and they believed that God would allow you to die when
He was ready. At the same time, the law needed to protect your life from
being taken by anyone else.\
\
If you endorse a right to life and a right to death, you would have to
say that your life is sacrosanct and cannot be taken by anyone ***but
you***. But this raises other questions: can you thus assign this right?
If you have the right to assign your right to die to someone else
(allowing someone to take your life), would this be legal? What if you
were coerced into assigning your right to die to someone else? Could
this be included in a sufficiently-funded contract?\
\
It just seems that when you endorse a right to life and a right to
death, life and the ability to live it gets boiled down to little more
than contractual agreements. It makes it very difficult to support both
a right to life and a right to death.]{.rendered_qtext}
