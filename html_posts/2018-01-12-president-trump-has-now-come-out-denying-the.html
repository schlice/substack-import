**President Trump has now come out denying the \"s..holes\" remark,
despite numerous highly respected Democratic and Republican Senators,
present at the meeting, confirming the remark. Do Trump\'s supporters
believe Trump?**

I'm literally laughing at all this controversy over "shitholes." The
world is awash in "shitholes" today.

Are these literally the same people who just a few months ago were
wearing vaginas on their heads and actually attacking *individuals*, not
the *countries they came from,* calling conservative men "teabaggers?"
And yet, they're all wilting over "shitholes?" Not buying it.

So if the remark actually was said, he was not talking about the people
themselves, but he was talking about the countries from which they came.
Because if he actually said it, he asked why we keep getting "people
from shithole countries," which isn't a slam on the people themselves,
but the countries from which they were coming.

So let's be honest with ourselves: are the countries he mentioned (like
Haiti and El Salvador) *actually shitholes?* If they weren't, would
people from those countries be clamoring to come to the United States?
Where would you rather live: Haiti or the US? I rest my case.

So the problem, then, isn't the **truth**, it's the **language**. The
truth is, in his boorish, crass way, he said that these countries leave
a lot to be desired. But he doesn't talk like a president, and Democrats
find that utterly distasteful. Doesn't make him *wrong*, they just don't
like *him.*

To be honest, if he did say it, I also find it distasteful. But the
truth hurts sometimes, doesn't it. It's not like I didn't expect that
kind of language from the "pussy-grabber-in-chief." At least he's a
known entity. He acts exactly as I would expect.

I've often said I wished he would temper his speech, and I wish he would
quit being so obsessive with Twitter (a.k.a. the cesspool of the
Internet). But that's Trump. We'll support him so long as he produces
results, and so far, he's producing results.
