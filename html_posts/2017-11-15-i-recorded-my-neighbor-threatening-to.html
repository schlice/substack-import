is spot on. Threatening bodily harm is not always a crime, but in the
states where it is, it is called different things. It's sometimes called
"criminal threatening" or "intimidation." If intimidation or criminal
threatening exists in your state, call the police.

If there is no intimidation or criminal threatening statute in your
state, file for a restraining order, and then file a civil lawsuit for
assault and intimidation. Assault in tort is different from "battery" in
tort, which is actual physical harm. The "assault" is the words, the
"battery" is the action.
