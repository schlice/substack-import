You can certainly press charges. I wouldn't expect any *criminal*
charges to apply, so it's likely you're going to try to sue for battery
or some other civil charge. But if it was ***mutual combat***, as you
state, expect the other party to press the same charges (if it was truly
mutual, what applies to you applies to the other party). And if criminal
charges applied, you'd both be arrested.

What, exactly, do you think will happen when you go to court?

The judge will fine both of you and send you on your way.

So in the end, you'll both just end up spending all kinds of money that
you could probably spend better elsewhere, and I'm not sure anyone will
feel better.
