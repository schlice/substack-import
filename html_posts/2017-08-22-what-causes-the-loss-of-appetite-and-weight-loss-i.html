Loss of appetite and its attendant weight loss are not customary
symptoms of MS. That said, everyone experiences MS differently, and no
two MS patients will experience symptoms in exactly the same way, even
when the symptoms are the same.

It's possible that some other things may be going on:

- Dysphagia. If a person has swallowing problems, which do occur with
  MS, they may subconsciously avoid eating, or eat less.
- Depression. Neurological and immune changes can cause mood swings and
  irritability, and depression is one of the most common symptoms of MS.
  Loss of appetite is a symptom of depression. Depression is so common
  because it can either be a primary symptom (i.e. caused directly by
  neurological changes), or can be a tertiary symptom (i.e. brought on
  by the effect of the other changes in lifestyle).
