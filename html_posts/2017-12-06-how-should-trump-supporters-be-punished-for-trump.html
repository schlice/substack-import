**How should Trump supporters be punished for Trump naming Jerusalem the
capital of Israel and no doubt inciting violence against American
people?**

Why do you want to punish people who had nothing to do with this
decision for the results of the decision?

If you are to punish anyone, the only logical entity to punish is
***Congress***.

It is Congress that passed the Jerusalem Embassy Act on October 24,
1995, which named Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. The law was never
signed or vetoed by the President, and so it became law without the
President's signature on November 8, 1995.

Just one part of this law:

> JERUSALEM EMBASSY ACT OF 1995
>
> Public Law 104-45
>
> 104th Congress
>
> An Act
>
> To provide for the relocation of the United States Embassy in Israel
> to Jerusalem, and for other purposes.

As you can see, it is Congress that declared Jerusalem the capital of
Israel. Trump is simply fulfilling the will of Congress, since Clinton,
Bush, and Obama refused to do so.
