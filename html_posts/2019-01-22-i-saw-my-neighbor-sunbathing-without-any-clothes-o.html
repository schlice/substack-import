**I saw my neighbor sunbathing without any clothes on in her backyard. I
have young children in my house. Should I call the police for indecent
exposure in public?**

I see lots of commentary about what the police are "supposed" to do and
how you should look away but I don't see any real *answers*.

The answer is "it depends."

First off, I'm assuming you're in the United States.

Secondly, it depends on your state. Some states only classify indecent
exposure as nudity with a sexual component (i.e. an aroused male, or a
suggestively touching female). In other states, nudity in your own
backyard is acceptable. In still others, nudity that is visible from
anywhere (i.e. a second story into a neighbor's yard) is illegal.

You'll have to check the laws in your state as to whether or not it is
illegal.
