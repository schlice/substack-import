<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [We have lots of problems in this country because the<br>Framers never commented on certain things because they never **thought<br>they would have to** comment on certain things.\<br>\<br>Marriage was so long accepted for what it was that people forgot<br>*why* it was accepted for what it was. So they started changing it.\<br>\<br>With the changing of the very definition of marriage (allowing<br>gay/lesbian couples to marry), the door to all sorts of marriages opens<br>up. For example, there is nothing to say that three people marrying is<br>wrong, or a group of people, or a man marrying his dog, or a woman<br>marrying a corporation.\<br>\<br>They better have a really good prenup tho\... And where is the<br>corporation going to take her on her honeymoon? Who gets to represent<br>the corporation in that hotel room?\<br>\<br>Lots of interesting questions spring from this. But the bottom line is<br>that when you change the definition of marriage, you fundamentally alter<br>it, and it loses its relevance.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
