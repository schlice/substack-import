**Content:** [We have lots of problems in this country because the
Framers never commented on certain things because they never **thought
they would have to** comment on certain things.\
\
Marriage was so long accepted for what it was that people forgot
***why*** it was accepted for what it was. So they started changing it.\
\
With the changing of the very definition of marriage (allowing
gay/lesbian couples to marry), the door to all sorts of marriages opens
up. For example, there is nothing to say that three people marrying is
wrong, or a group of people, or a man marrying his dog, or a woman
marrying a corporation.\
\
They better have a really good prenup tho\... And where is the
corporation going to take her on her honeymoon? Who gets to represent
the corporation in that hotel room?\
\
Lots of interesting questions spring from this. But the bottom line is
that when you change the definition of marriage, you fundamentally alter
it, and it loses its relevance.]{.rendered_qtext}
