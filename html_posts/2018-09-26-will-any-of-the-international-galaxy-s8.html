**Will any of the International Galaxy S8\'s work with the cell service
in the USA?**

As far as I can tell, the international version of the S8 should work
just fine on US carriers. However, your mileage may vary, as radios and
coverage vary around the country, and not all radio bands are supported
on non-US phones. So there may be some area of the country where the
international version of the S8 won't work. It could happen. We can't be
sure.

But on paper (and from testimony of others), they do. There was [[an
interesting thread over at Android
Central](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=83384a&url=https://forums.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-s8-and-s8-plus/850482-us-model-samsung-s8-plus-better-than-international-version.html){.external_link

disagreement over whether or not the international version of the S8
does work in the US, but the general story seems to be yes.
