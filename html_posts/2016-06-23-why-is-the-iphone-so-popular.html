Overhyped when compared to what?

The problem is that any comparison you do (Apple to PC, Apple to
Android, etc) is an **apples-to-oranges** comparison.

Why?

Let's take just one comparison to start with: Apple to Android.

Apple is a **hardware company** which produces a piece of specialized
smartphone hardware. They also make *value-added software* to run on
their specialized hardware.

Android is a **software package** produced mostly by Google and is
designed to run on **many different hardware platforms**.

You can't compare Apple to Samsung, because Samsung, while they do make
very good hardware, does not produce software to run on their hardware.
And no, you cannot compare TouchWiz to iOS, as TouchWiz is nothing more
than an overlay to Android, where iOS is a fully-encapsulated operating
system designed to exploit every single feature of Apple's hardware.
Android could never hope to accomplish such complete utilization of all
features of every piece of hardware on which it runs, as it is designed
to run on so many.

Let's look at Apple vs Microsoft.

Apple is a **hardware company** which also produces *value-added
software* to run on its hardware.

Microsoft is a **software company**, and its software is designed to run
on **many different hardware platforms.**

Starting to see the difference?

Apple charges premium prices for its hardware, and either bundles its
software or sells it for a nominal fee (Microsoft Office retails for
over \$100, while iWork can be purchased for roughly \$30, IIRC. Updates
to Microsoft Windows are well over \$100, while updates to OS X are
anywhere between free and \$30).

Apple makes money producing quality hardware, and then supplying the
software to run that hardware. Note that Apple's EULA also restricts the
running of that software on any other hardware other than Apple-branded
hardware. Microsoft makes money selling software, and doesn't really
care what hardware platform you run it on.

\

Now, of these two configurations, which one do you think will give you
the better overall user experience? The hardware designer that provides
value-added software, or the software designer who doesn't really care
what platform you run your software on?

Apple and \<everyone else\> are in two totally opposed universes.

**TL;DR: There is no comparison.**
