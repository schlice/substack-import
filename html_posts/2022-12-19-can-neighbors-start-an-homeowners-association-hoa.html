The answer is yes you can. However, for an existing neighborhood, how
you go about starting an HOA is crucial to understand what you'll end up
with when you're done.

The reason: there is a big difference between *voluntary* and
*mandatory* HOAs.

Mandatory HOAs are attached to the property. Generally, they exist
before the property is sold for the first time, as they are established
by the developer. You cannot choose whether or not you will belong to
the HOA, because it is part of the property. If you buy the property,
you're in the HOA.

Voluntary HOAs are akin to club memberships or affinity groups. You can
join and leave as you choose. You may receive benefits from such
membership, such as clubhouse or pool access.

If you're trying to create a mandatory HOA, you will probably need
permission from 100% of the homeowners in the neighborhood. It can be
done, you just need more permission. You will need assistance from a
real estate attorney to file the paperwork and collect the legal
signatures to modify the deeds of all of the homeowners to indicate the
HOA.

You can create a voluntary HOA with a much smaller percentage of
homeowners, and it's much easier to implement.

If you really are serious about going forward with establishing an HOA
in your area, talk to a real estate attorney in your area who
specializes in HOA law.
