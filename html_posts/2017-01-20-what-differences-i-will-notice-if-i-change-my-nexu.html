On detailed photos, you will notice more "dithering" and more
"artifacts" when you zoom in. You will notice these sooner than if you
leave the setting alone.

When you watch videos, you may notice a decrease in quality, but it's
not likely.

You will notice an increase in battery life.

Besides those few things, you probably won't notice anything at all.
