**For roadways in the U.S. that are E-ZPass enabled, would you be in
support of the overhead vehicle sensors also being able to sense the
speed & fine drivers for speeding (excessively), if in return the
roadway would be free to travel? Why or why not?**

Our EZPass enabled roadways already have the capability to do this. In
fact, by simply timing how long it took you to get from one toll plaza
to the next, the system can quite easily calculate your speed.

However, most states have some pretty serious regulations on who is
allowed to issue speeding tickets, and that's usually somebody who wears
a badge, not a toll road administrator. The toll road administrator is
indeed free to fine people for speeding on their roads (billable to
their toll accounts), but they can't issue speeding tickets that would
go on their license. This is similar to red light camera violations,
which are not moving violations against your license either.
