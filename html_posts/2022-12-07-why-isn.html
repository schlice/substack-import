Public nudity is not legal because society has decided that it should
not be.

States have obligations to create well-ordered societies within their
borders. Part of their undeniable responsibilities are to "promote the
general welfare" so that everyone can safely participate in society.

Public nudity is limited because societies have equated nudity with
sexuality. Right or wrong, that's what they've done. While female
breasts are indeed just appendages used to nurse infants, society has
sexualized them, in a way in which society has not done with the male
chest. Again, in an attempt to create an ordered society where sexual
activity is confined to private spaces (which is definitely an
objectively good goal for a society to have), exposure of breasts in
public is (mostly) forbidden. The same holds true for all genitalia;
while it is used to excrete waste, the genitalia is also used for sex.
Separating the two uses is generally too problematic, especially for
females who show little physical change between states of arousal and
non-arousal.

In areas where public nudity is permitted, lines are indeed still drawn
around public arousal, the exhibition of which is deemed to be sexual.
This does target men, but it does not *unjustly* target men.

At the end of the day, states need to create a safe society where people
can freely engage with each other. Restricting the time, place, and
manner of public nudity is therefore a state prerogative.
