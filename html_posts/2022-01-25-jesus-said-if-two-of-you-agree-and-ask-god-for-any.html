I'm going to question your very premise.

You said, "Jesus said if two of you agree and ask God for anything, God
would do it." So are you sure about that? Because I really want laser
beam eyes. I mean really, really want laser beam eyes. So if I find a
buddy who also wants me to have laser beam eyes, if we get together and
ask God for it, he will do it?

Woohoo, here comes laser beam eyes!

So clearly, I'm questioning your assertion. Because last time I checked,
God did what *he* wanted to do. He's not a spiritual vending machine.
You don't get to walk up to him and if you push the right buttons you
get out what you want. It doesn't work that way.

God is already working in your life. A *better, more useful* prayer
would be to have God teach you what he's doing in your life, and to
bring you up to speed so that you can be a part of his plan. Ask God to
show you his plan for your life, and to allow you to participate.

Secondly, evil has no power unless people give it power. Evil has no
power over you. Evil only has the power you give it. If you give evil
form, and substance, and effort, it will flourish. If you ignore evil,
it will vanish. It has no substance on its own. Evil is simply the
perversion of the good things God has for you. For example, adultery is
simply the perversion of God's provision of marriage. If you don't give
evil an audience, it can have no control over your life.

Third, God allows evil in the world because we have free will, and he
wants us to be able to freely choose him, *or the alternative*. There
has to be an alternative, and it has to be at least somewhat attractive,
in order for our choice to be truly free. Because if God comes in and
obliterates evil, we would have no choice but to follow him, and that is
a perversion of free will, which God also does not desire for us.

I truly don't know where Christians got this idea that being Christian
meant God would make an easy life for you, as if God would skip ahead of
us with his cosmic leaf blower, sweeping away all evil from our paths.
Last I checked, even the greats of the Bible had some very hard lives.

So instead of asking God to sweep away evil, how about instead *you*
banish evil from your own heart and your own mind, and teach others to
do it too? This will diminish evil's power over you, and will ultimately
allow people to triumph over evil.

it. I pray God diminish the power of evil until they are incredibly weak
and powerless. If God would do it would you pray with me or refuse to?
