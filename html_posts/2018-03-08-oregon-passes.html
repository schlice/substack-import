It's going to make the Sheriffs in every county in the state very busy.

Because now, after every misdemeanor stalking conviction, or after every
DV conviction, a seizure warrant will be issued and delivered to the
Sheriff.

The Sheriff will have a specific time period (it's 24 hours in most
states, not sure what it is in OR) to get out to the residence and find
any and all firearms and confiscate them. Without breaking anything, of
course. All locked rooms and all locked doors must be opened. All safes
must be opened. Any place a gun could be must be opened, or the Sheriff
can break in.

This will now happen on every stalking misdemeanor conviction.

So like I said, the real consequence of this new law is that the Sheriff
of each county is going to be very, very busy.
