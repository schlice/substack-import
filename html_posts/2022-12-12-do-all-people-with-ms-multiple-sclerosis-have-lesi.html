No. Some people have lesions on their spinal cord.

Lesions will indeed be present somewhere. In about 5 percent of cases, a
person may initially develop MS symptoms before lesions are present, but
within a short timeframe, those lesions will appear.

The longer a person goes with *symptoms* but no *lesions* should
indicate to the neurologist that they should be looking for other
conditions which mimic MS but are not MS. There are, of course, other
tests to add to the body of evidence pointing to MS (visual evoked
potential, CSF sample, etc). The MRI alone does not determine whether or
not a person has MS, but the brain lesions are a hallmark symptom of the
disease. While a clear MRI initially does not rule out MS, a clear MRI
over time tends to indicate that there may be some other disease at
work.
