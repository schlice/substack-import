Every Christian tradition which uses the Bible as a basis uses a
different version. My Bible has 66 books in it: 39 in the Old Testament
and 27 in the New Testament. This is often referred to as the "canon" of
Scripture, or the "rule" or the "collection" of books that Christians
believe belong in the Bible. Catholics and Orthodox religions include a
group of books in their bibles referred to as the Deuterocanonical books
("second canon") or, as the Protestants call it, the "Apocrypha."

But that still begs the question: *how do you know that your list of
books is the right one?* This is probably the most convincing argument
against *sola scriptura* which exists today. Catholics go even further
and state that at the Council of Trent, they *infallibly* established
the canon, including the Deuterocanonical books, as being authoritative.
How do they know that *their* canon is *infallible*? I, unlike the
Catholics, don't believe that there is an infallible human authority
which determined the canon of the Bible. But I do believe that *the
books themselves*, as written, are *inerrant* and *infallible*. No one
seriously argues that point, regardless of translation or version.

So, at best, since it was people who have determined the list of books
in the Bible, we have a *potentially* *fallible* list of *infallible*
books, a claim echoed by R. C. Sproul[\[1\]](#LscTO){#cite-LscTO
.citation_link} and others many years ago. The list was defined by
humans, so the possibility of fallibility will naturally also exist.
Every Christian tradition must accept this, including the Council of
Trent Catholics. **So the question remains: how can I still profess**
***sola scriptura*** **when I can't even be infallibly sure what books
belong in the Bible?**

But that begs another question (which will help us answer the first):
***do you need infallible certainty in something in order to believe
it?***

The classic example of not needing an infallible certainty in order to
believe something is this: I believe that the sun is going to rise
tomorrow. Now, do I have an *infallible* *certainty* that it will? No, I
do not. Some astrological phenomenon could occur which causes the earth
to stop rotating. Or we could get hit by an asteroid, or the sun could
suddenly go out. But what is the *probability* that any of these things
would happen? It's super low, isn't it? But regardless, I don't have an
*absolute, infallible certainty* about the sun rising tomorrow.

But that doesn't mean that I have an excuse to believe that the sun will
not rise tomorrow. Because the probability of the sun not rising
tomorrow is so infinitesimally low, I can pretty much bank on the fact
that it will.

The same holds true for our determinations of canon. Just because there
exists the possibility that we are wrong (our fallibility) does not
provide us an excuse for unbelief. We must look at how probable it is
that we are wrong.

So: are we arguing the difference between books which would make or
break our belief? Would the addition or the subtraction of a book cause
the whole to change its meaning? Would any book of the Bible become
uninterpretable with or without the Deuterocanonical books? The short
answer is **no**.

So, now we get to the big bad question: ***does our belief change
because a small group of books is either included or excluded from a
particular reading of the Bible?*** That answer is **no**.

Therefore, because the probability is so low as to be non-existent that
it makes any substantive difference to the foundation of our faith, we
can still claim *sola scriptura*. We acknowledge that we have a
*fallible* collection of *infallible* books. While the possibility
exists that we may be wrong, what is included in our collection of
beliefs is so similar throughout the Christian traditions as to be
insignificant when it comes to our core beliefs, our "profession of
faith." So we can still, rightly, claim *sola scriptura,* even with
these differences in our *admittedly* *fallible* understandings of
inclusion or exclusion.
