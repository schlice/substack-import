**Content:** [So you have no context in your question. Why should
creepypasta be outlawed? What laws it is breaking? Is it violating some
sort of ethical code? I\'m just confused.\
\
For those who don\'t know, \"creepypasta\" is an outgrowth of
\"copypasta\", which is phrases or text that is repeatedly copied and
re-posted on the Internet, except that these are wildly-undocumented,
scary stories meant to startle the reader/viewer.\
\
But from what I can tell, the only potential legal issues I see here are
the fact that the videos and text may be copyrighted and would require
the permission of the content owners before they could be re-posted, in
which case a DMCA \"takedown\" notice would be issued to the owners of
[[creepypasta.com](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=aad98d&url=http://creepypasta.com){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="creepypasta.com"}]{.qlink_container}.\
\
Are you presuming that this content should not be shown to anyone?
Unfortunately in that case, the First Amendment protects the content, as
scary/gory as it may be.]{.rendered_qtext}
