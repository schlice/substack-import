Hi Anne, it would be easier to answer your question if we knew what the
drug was. In most cases, it's marijuana, and it does help MS patients
with neurological pain. On a side note, it is a great reliever of nausea
(for patients who take chemo) and it reduces intraocular pressure for
patients with cataracts.

First of all, you can always talk to your neurologist. Even if the drug
is illegal, your doctor cannot turn you in to police. The only time a
doctor can notify the police about something you told him in confidence
is if you indicated that you're going to do something to hurt yourself
or others, and drugs doesn't count. Yes, I'm talking about suicide or
murder, but beyond that, doctor-patient privilege works both ways. Your
doctor might be able to help you find an alternative medication for you
(may not work as well, but might still work).

Again assuming the drug is marijuana, if you're open to the possibility,
another option is to move to a state which allows medical marijuana.
Since Colorado allows you to have marijuana for any reason (personal use
is completely legal here), I would suggest there, but there are many
states which now allow medical use, if not recreational use.
