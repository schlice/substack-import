**Content:** [Your disease will continue to progress in the background.\
\
For the large majority of people with relapsing forms of MS, your
disease will change to a progressive form within 10 years.\
\
I\'m not trying to scare you. I\'m simply saying that this is the trend
for people who do not use one of the approved medicines to slow the
progress of the disease.\
\
As the other answerers have alluded to, diet and exercise are important,
but diet and exercise alone will not slow the progression of the
disease.\
\
From my research, I know this: if you \"had MS\" and you changed your
diet and \"cured your MS\", you didn\'t have MS. You had something else
that mimicked MS, but as [[Shane
Ryoo](https://www.quora.com/profile/Shane-Ryoo)]{.qlink_container} said,
you can\'t cure MS by changing your diet.]{.rendered_qtext}
