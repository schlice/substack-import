**A very noisy 6-year-old boy has moved upstairs, and even at 3 am he
continues to run, and his mother is very noisy when she walks, moves
furniture or has shouting sex in very late hours, I should complain to
the administration?**

Yes, you should. In the United States, we have noise ordinances which
usually are in effect between 11 PM and 7 AM. Excessive noise during
this time could warrant a visit from the police.

But start with the local administration of your living facility. If they
do not help, involve the police.
