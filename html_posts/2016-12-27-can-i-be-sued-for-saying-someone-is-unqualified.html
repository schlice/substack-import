The short answer is it depends. I know that's not much of an answer, but
to be fair, it's not much of a question either. *Touch√©.*

Firstly, we probably need a little more context. Unqualified for what?
Are you in a position in which your job is to determine someone's
qualifications (i.e. a recruiter)?

In order to be sued for slander, your statement that someone is
unqualified would have to cause some harm to that person (i.e. because
you said that they were unqualified, they lost their job).

That said, truth is always a defense to slander claims. If you do get
sued for slander, you could prove that the person truly is unqualified.
Do that, and slander does not apply, even if your utterance of that
statement did cause harm.
