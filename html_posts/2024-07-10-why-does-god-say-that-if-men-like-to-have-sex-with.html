Before we begin, we must agree that within the framework of this
question, you presume that God exists, He created you, and you at least
want to understand why His rules exist. Remember that if you think
you're going to comment. I'll point it out to you if you say something
stupid like "Yeah, but God doesn't exist, so why tf do you care" or
something like that. This discussion presumes that God exists and He has
rules.

The question you asked is *why.* Why does that attraction exist if
you're not allowed to have homosexual sex?

The answer is ***sin***.

Sin is falling short of God's will and good plan for us. Sin is,
literally, "missing the mark." Sin was introduced into the human
condition by Adam and Eve's disobedience to God. Since then, humanity
has been tainted by sin. We live in a fallen world, in fallen, sinful
bodies. This sin causes all sorts of maladies which did not exist before
that sin. Disease and decay are a result of sin. Disorders of the brain
are also a result of sin. The sexual desire for those of the same sex is
a result of our sin nature.

We know this because we know how God designed us, and what He intended
for us when it comes to sex and relationship. The Bible is abundantly
clear that not only are people supposed to marry man and woman, but they
are supposed to only have sex between them, within the boundaries of
that marriage. Therefore, anything you do outside of that is sinful.

You cannot help how you feel. Your feelings are part of your fallen
nature. You ***can*** help what you do with those feelings.

This is why while you may feel like, as a man, you are attracted to men,
you cannot have sex with men.
