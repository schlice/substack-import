Short answer: yes. Since you're only discussing the actual shooting
part, anyone in fear for their life has the right to defend themselves
using whatever force is necessary, up to and including deadly force.

Thankfully, you didn't ask us to tackle the legal questions surrounding
who would end up going to jail assuming someone was still alive. Phew!

But specific to the self-defense, everyone in America has the right to
life, and you can use any force to counter that threat.
