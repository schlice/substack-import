About 25 years ago, I met a guy in our medium-security prison. He told
us that prison was his retirement plan.

He had it all mapped out: the crime he was going to commit, the age at
which he was going to commit the crime, the location, etc. He was going
to allow himself to get caught so that he could be arrested and charged
and sent back to medium security, to spend the rest of his days on the
state's dime. Apparently, he thought life in medium security was better
than life on the outside.

I don't know if it all worked out for him, to be honest.

But I can say that I know at least one person who planned on doing just
that.
