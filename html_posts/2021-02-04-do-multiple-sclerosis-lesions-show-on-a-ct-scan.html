Why yes, yes they do. But the CT scanner is of limited usefulness in MS
treatment.

The CT scanner can see active MS lesions (after two or three doses of
contrast material), but it cannot see chronic lesions, and the lesions
it does see are highly nonspecific. In other words, it's very hard on a
CT to tell that they are MS lesions; they just appear as any other
enhancing white matter lesion. It may even be misdiagnosed as a tumor.

Because the CT scanner is of limited usefulness, and the MRI is so much
more precise in terms of diagnosing MS, the CT scanner is very rarely
used in the diagnosis and treatment of MS.
