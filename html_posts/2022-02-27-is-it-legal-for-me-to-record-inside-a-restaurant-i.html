The business could try to sue you for defamation, but what you posted
must be *untrue*, or the inference you made about what was clearly in
the video must be false. But truth is always a defense to defamation
claims of any kind.

I'd say record what you saw and post it on Yelp or in a Google review
and let the chips fall where they may. But make sure you have a good
defense attorney lined up in case the business does try to sue you.

Also, be aware that state laws may prohibit recording in businesses if
you have been duly notified of the prohibition, so you could be in
violation of a state law. Some states may require a posting at the door
in order for the prohibition to be binding. Check your state laws before
recording.

Original question:

Is it legal for me to record inside a restaurant? I wanted to expose the
manager's awful behavior&his scams. He claims he will sue me for
recording&then posting it on the internet because it's a private
business. Gino's Bar and Trattoria New York.
