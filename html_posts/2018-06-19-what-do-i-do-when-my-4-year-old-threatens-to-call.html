**What do I do when my 4-year-old threatens to call the cops because I
punished him with a timeout?**

First of all, time outs are not punishment, and if you're using them as
such, you are probably misusing them. But that's a discussion for
another question.

Secondly, you should never use the police as a crutch for parenting, and
you should not allow your child to think that police are the answer to a
parenting style with which they disagree. Where did he get the idea to
call the police when he didn't like your parenting style? Have you ever
said to the child, "You'd better listen to me or that police man over
there is going to take you to jail." I certainly hope not. Police are
not surrogate parents, and they are not there to be your parental
enforcers. This only teaches children that police are to be feared. What
if the child is lost and you call the police? If he fears the police,
he'll hide from them when they try to find him, because he would feel as
if he would get "in trouble" for being lost. Probably not the wisest
thing to teach him.

Finally, at some time in the future, you should take your child on a
field trip to the police station. He needs a lesson on what police do.
