No. I'll go even further and say that you cannot know that bad things
are even bad without God. The truth is that atheists borrow from theists
to make their arguments anyway.

The point is very simple. How do you know what is bad if you don't know
what is good? If there is no universal standard which applies to all
humans from which we all know what is good and what is bad, then you
cannot say that something is *objectively bad* or *objectively good.*
You must have an overarching standard of goodness to draw from in order
to say that something is bad, and that same bad thing is bad for all
people.

If there is no God, then there is no standard for goodness. What seems
bad to you may be good for someone else. If you think killing is wrong,
I may think that killing you and taking all of your stuff is good for
me.

Therefore, in order to say that anything in the world is bad means that
you have a standard of good. Since atheists have no overarching
universal standard for good, they must borrow from the theist's standard
of good in order to make their argument in the first place.
