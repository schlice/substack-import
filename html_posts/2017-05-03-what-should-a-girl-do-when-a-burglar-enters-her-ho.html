As most of the answerers have alluded to, the answer depends greatly on
where you are located. Because I am located in the US, I will base my
answer on their laws (generally), but your situation may be different
where you live, as well as different laws between states in the US, so
be very careful and make sure you know the law beforehand.

Let's start with what to do *before* a burglar enters your home. There's
an old story told about two hunters in Africa who stumble upon a den of
sleeping lions. As the lions begin to stir and eye their unfortunate
meal, one of the hunters kneels down, removes his backpack, and extracts
a pair of running shoes. The second hunter looks at him incredulously
and says, "What are you, crazy? You can't outrun a lion!" The first
hunter replies, "Oh, I don't have to outrun a lion. I just have to
outrun *you*." Now, I bet you're wondering what this has to do with home
security. The answer is this: You don't have to make your home a
fortress. You only need to make your home *less* appealing to the
burglar than your neighbor's home.

So how do you do that?

1.  **Lights**. Make sure your home is well lit on the outside. This
    used to be a fairly expensive proposition, especially the cost of
    running all those light bulbs all night. But with the advent of CFL
    and LED light bulbs, you can run many bulbs outside all night for
    nearly the cost of running a single 40-watt bulb. Setting your
    lights on a timer is a "set-it-and-forget-it" way to make sure your
    home is secure. You can also purchase lights which have ambient
    light sensors built in (they come on and dusk and turn off at dawn).
    Either way, burglars want to operate in the dark. Don't give them
    dark to work with.
2.  **Shrubbery**. Along with the dark, burglars like to be concealed
    while they break into your house. If there are large shrubs or
    ground cover which provides cover for a burglar to work in, clear it
    out. You don't want to give a burglar the means to work on opening a
    window while not being seen from the sidewalk.
3.  **Get a dog**. My Golden is the sweetest girl in the world. If you
    come in the house, she will lick your face to say hello and take you
    on a tour of all of her favorite toys. But if you're outside and you
    make even the slightest noise, it will sound like there's an angry
    horde of zombies outside and she's trying to wake up some very heavy
    sleepers. The point is that *if you're outside, you can't tell that
    she's a nice dog*. All you hear is the extremely vicious sounding
    barking. If you don't want to incur the expense of all the dog food,
    there are some pretty realistic dog barking simulators you can pick
    up on Amazon which are sound-activated.
4.  While you're at it, **create a safe room**. A safe room is a small
    room (generally a closet, but can be any small room with limited
    access) in which you should pre-stage a cell phone (it doesn't need
    a service plan to call 911) and a charger, and some form of weapon
    (a baseball bat, a throwing weapon, or if you are so inclined and
    are legally able, a gun safe, preferably with a gun in it). Ideally,
    you should replace the door to this room with a solid-core door
    (most interior doors in US homes are hollow-core) on which you can
    put a deadbolt lock. But even if you can't replace the door, just
    having a locking door is a good start.

Now, we can move on to what to do if a burglar *enters* your home. Most
states in the United States have a very strong "Castle Doctrine." The
Castle Doctrine stems from the old phrase, "A man's home is his castle."
This means that you should feel completely safe inside your home, and no
one should be able to threaten that safety. Castle Doctrine laws codify
the fact that you can defend yourself inside your home if an intruder
enters. You may not live in such a state. Some states require you to
attempt to retreat (called "duty to retreat" states). You should
investigate your state's laws regarding self-defense inside your home.

If you hear a burglar enter your home, get to your safe room. Get
inside, lock the door, and call 911. If you have a weapon in the room,
equip it. Be ready to use it in case the person on the other side of the
door is not a police officer. Stay on the phone with 911 until the
police arrive.

If the burglar enters your safe room, use your weapon. The only reason
they would be trying to get in there is to do you harm. Attack them, and
when they are incapacitated, ***run***. Get out of the house and get
away. The house and the stuff are not more important than your life.
