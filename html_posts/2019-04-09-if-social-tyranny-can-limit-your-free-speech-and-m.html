**If social tyranny can limit your free speech and more, then what is
the point of the constitution?**

The Constitution prevents the ***government*** from limiting your free
speech. It says nothing about what people can do through social tyranny.

The Constitution provides a framework under which people *should*
pattern their lives, and people abiding by the Bill of Rights would be a
good start.

But no one is under any obligation to protect or observe your rights
under the Constitution, other than the government.

The Bill of Rights limits what the government can do to you. Private
citizens can still use social tyranny to limit your speech, and it fully
has nothing to do with the Constitution.
