Legally, as a citizen, you are bound to obey the law. Violations of law
lead to punishment as prescribed in the law.

Morally, the adherence to the law is part of the **social contract**. We
understand as humans that in order to live in a peaceful, ordered
society, we must cede some of our personal freedom and obey the laws.
The laws allow us to exercise our personal freedoms without impinging on
the personal freedoms of others. When our exercise of our personal
freedom impinges on someone else\'s exercise of their personal freedom,
the law sorts out the convergence.
