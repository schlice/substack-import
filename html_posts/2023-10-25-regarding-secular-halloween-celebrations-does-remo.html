"Spiritual effects?" Like the ritual actually does something?

Only God has the power to have a "spiritual effect." Dressing up as a
ghost has absolutely no effect other than to limit your field of vision.
Man, it was hard to see in those costumes.

The truth is that *holidays only have the meaning that we give them.*

That said, pretty much every holiday once derived from some sort of
pagan ritual. Even Christmas. According to some evidence, Pope Julius I
chose December 25, 336 AD as the date when Christmas was first
celebrated. This date was chosen in an effort to adopt and absorb the
traditions of the pagan Saturnalia festival. Saturnalia was an
adaptation of the Ancient Greek festival known as Kronia. Kronia was
celebrated in midsummer rather than midwinter. It is thought to signify
the end of the harvest season to honor Saturn, a god associated with
agriculture.

These days, really the only thing remaining of the old pagan rituals is
the date. We have so modified and commercialized the holiday that its
original meaning is pretty much gone.

With the exception of Halloween. There is still quite a lot of
less-than-savory stuff going on there.

You should be careful of Halloween. There is a "celebration of death"
which sometimes associates with Halloween. Christians do not celebrate
death, but we celebrate life with Jesus. We don't fear death, but we
also don't celebrate it. Be cautious about this with Halloween
festivals.

Is there anything spiritually wrong with dressing up in costumes of
superheroes and knocking on doors for candy? No, not really. We only
need to be cautious of celebrating the wrong things.
