There are many rights not stated in the Bill of Rights. They are the
rights that the framers did not feel were necessary to explicitly call
out as things that are absolutely sacrosanct; the government many not
infringe on these rights.

The thing about the Constitution is that if it's ***not*** listed in the
Bill of Rights, it's not a right which cannot be infringed by the
government. While the UN has compiled a listing of "universal human
rights," these are not listed in our Constitution. Why? The Universal
Declaration of Human Rights tells governments how they should act. The
Bill of Rights tells government how it should **not** act.

Remember that the whole purpose of the Constitution was to limit the
reach of government. Government is only authorized to perform certain
tasks, and those tasks are spelled out clearly in the Constitution.
Still, the states were concerned that the government would overstep its
bounds (they were right) and attempt to take authority which was not
specifically authorized for them to take. So they required a *specific
listing* of rights which were so important to them, and were the main
reasons they wanted to make a new government apart from England in the
first place, that they created the Bill of Rights to spell those out.

Even though the Constitution specifically limits the government's power,
they still wanted a listing of items which the government could not do.
The main body of the Constitution tells the government what it is
allowed to do; the Bill of Rights tells the government what it is
**not** allowed to do.
