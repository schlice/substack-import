I wouldn't have done it that way. I personally think it goes a little
too far.

I would have worked out a way in which rape or incest victims, following
a rape kit and a report to the police, could receive abortifacient
drugs, or abortive procedures.

Those numbers (women who were raped AND who choose not to keep their
baby --- at last count, at least 50% of raped women chose to keep their
baby) are so infinitesimally small compared to the mass volumes of women
killing babies out of convenience that it's a really terrible hill to
die on.
