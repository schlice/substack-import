So you're claiming that "defects" in the round or the gunpowder can
cause them to spontaneously combust without being acted upon by any
outside influence? The chances of this are so infinitesimally small as
to be functionally non-existent. Modern smokeless powder is
"shelf-stable," meaning that unless acted on by outside forces
(temperature, external combustion, electrical charge, etc), it does not
combust. I don't think it's that far outside of the realm of reality to
say that because the odds of smokeless powder spontaneously combusting
are so low, that we can effectively call it non-existent.

That said, remember the scope of the question, which was worded to avoid
the slippery slopes about which you are referring:

> *Can a gun go off by itself?*
>
> *In normal conditions, without being dropped, heated up, shaken,
> having design issues, or having their state altered in any other way
> can they go off without anyone touching the trigger?*

So we have specifically excluded design issues with smokeless powder in
this discussion. What we are referring to are the ways in which a gun
could fire a bullet without an operator touching the trigger, and
without being mishandled or altered.

I think unless you pose a new question, we should limit our commentary
to that specific question only. Thank you.
