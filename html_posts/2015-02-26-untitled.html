**Content:** [You can\'t suddenly expect people to not buy milk, cheese
and hot dogs anymore.\
\
You\'re saying that people will simply stop buying things because taxes
get added to them. Good thing they won\'t have more money to spend.\
\
Look, I really don\'t have time to debate this with you today, but
you\'ve got such a terrible view of people and businesses that you\'d
throw away an opportunity to increase the flow of money to the
government because you need a more oppressive tax system because you
fear everything, from tax cheats to people no longer buying milk because
the price went up.\
\
This is exactly the reason that we can never make real progress in this
country.\

Sorry, it just saddens me.]{.rendered_qtext}
