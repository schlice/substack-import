Alzheimer\'s is considered a disability as far as the Americans with
Disabilities Act is concerned. Therefore, people with Alzheimer\'s are
protected under employment law, and under housing law, against
discrimination because of their disease, in just the same way that
anyone else with a disability is protected.
