**Can I contest a \"special event restriction\" parking ticket on the
grounds that the parking app (ParkChicago) accepted the payment, and the
city of Chicago cannot both accept a parking fee and also fine for
parking?**

You can, and you might even be successful.

However, I'm certain that there is "fine print" in there somewhere
(probably in the app) which says that you're still required to follow
all local ordinances and posted signs at the actual location and
ParkChicago is not responsible to inform you every time a space is
unavailable due to local government action.

For example, if you paid for a spot on a street that the police have
closed, can you barge into the closed street and park there simply
because the app accepted your payment? The answer to that clear
hypothetical is, of course, no.

Similarly, if the coordination between the local government and the app
administrator is not up to snuff, there is probably a clause in the app
which states that it's your responsibility to ensure that the street is
accessible and the spot is not restricted.

Now, if you arrived at the spot and it was not marked with a "special
event - no parking" sign, then you may have a legitimate grievance. The
app accepted your payment, and there was no marking that indicated that
the space was closed. But I bet there was signage somewhere that
indicated that there was no parking on that street or in that spot
because of a special event.
