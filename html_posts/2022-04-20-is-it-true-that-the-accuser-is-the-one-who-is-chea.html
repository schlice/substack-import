It is not always true that the accuser is the one who is cheating.

It is *sometimes* true that cheaters will accuse their significant
others of *exactly what they are doing* in order to deflect attention
away from themselves.

Original question:

Is it true that the accuser is the one who is cheating? Would he accuse
me if he was the one thinking about it?
