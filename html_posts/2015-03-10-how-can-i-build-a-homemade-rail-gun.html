1.  Purchase a nuclear power plant. You\'re going to need it to generate
    the 33 megajoules of electricity required to accelerate the
    projectile sled to any useful velocity.

OR\

1.  For something handheld, create a baseball-sized nuclear reactor. I
    mean, Tony Stark did it, in the desert.
2.  Build rails that can withstand massive repulsive forces, because as
    the rails use their magnetic repulsive forces to propel the sled,
    they also use those same forces to repel each other.
3.  Build to extremely tight tolerances. The farther apart the rails
    get, arcing starts to occur between the rails, which limits the
    serviceable life of the rails. The navy claims that a shipboard
    railgun has fired over 400 rounds out of one barrel, and they are
    trending towards a barrel that can fire 1,000 rounds.\
4.  Reduce the inductance and resistance of the rails, which limits the
    performance of the rails. This is the big limiting factor in using
    smaller amounts of electricity, which is why the device doesn\'t
    scale down very effectively.
5.  Build a bracing mechanism which can withstand stresses well over
    three times the stresses placed on a standard 105mm deck gun on a
    destroyer.

The less efficiently the gun is built, the slower the projectile will be
flung.\

> A very large power supply, providing on the order of one million
> amperes of current, will create a tremendous force on the projectile,
> accelerating it to a speed of many kilometres per second (km/s). 20
> km/s has been achieved with small projectiles explosively injected
> into the railgun. Although these speeds are possible, the heat
> generated from the propulsion of the object is enough to erode the
> rails rapidly. Under high-use conditions, current railguns would
> require frequent replacement of the rails, or to use a heat-resistant
> material that would be conductive enough to produce the same effect.
> At this time it is generally acknowledged that it will take major
> breakthroughs in material science and related disciplines to produce
> high-powered railguns capable of firing more than a few shots from a
> single set of rails. The barrel must withstand these conditions for up
> to several rounds per minute for thousands of shots without failure or
> significant degradation. These parameters are well beyond the state of
> the art in materials science.\

In other words, you have a tough row to hoe.
