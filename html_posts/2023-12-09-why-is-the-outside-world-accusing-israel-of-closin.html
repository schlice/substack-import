The "outside world" is utterly irrelevant to the sovereignty of the
nation of Israel. Israel gets to make its own decisions about its own
country and the safety and security of its own people.

So the "outside world" can say whatever it likes about what it thinks
Israel is or is not doing. Makes no difference to Israel. Israel is
going to do what is best for Israel. The "outside world" can go kick
rocks.

The fact is that **no Arab country in the region will accept Palestinian
refugees**. When you can answer *why that is*, you'll understand what
Israel is really up against in the region.
