Because God told them.

Remember, He told them that they could eat from any tree they wanted to,
except for that one. So *they already knew* not to do it.

The great secret of the fruit was that **the fruit didn\'t have any
magical properties**. It didn\'t impart any wisdom by its consumption.
It was just fruit.

What changed Adam and Eve was ***the act of disobeying God.*** Their act
introduced **sin** into the world for the first time, and they were
*changed* by the sin. Their eyes were opened. No longer did they only
know good, but because they introduced evil into the world, now they
*saw* evil. They *saw* pain. They *saw* sadness. And they saw **shame**.
And they noticed that they were naked, and they were ashamed. Shame was
something that was not introduced into the human condition until Adam
and Eve sinned.

The fruit didn\'t do anything to them. **The sin did.**
