So let's be clear. I'm not an atheist. But your characterization of what
will happen to them is not exactly correct.

First, the Bible does not say eternal **torture**. The Bible says
eternal **torment**. Those two words are different. What you described
is eternal **torture**, and the Bible does not say that. It does say
that they will suffer eternal torment, but "unimaginable pain" is
incorrect.

The punishment of the wicked dead in hell is described throughout
Scripture as "eternal fire" (Matthew 25:41), "unquenchable fire"
(Matthew 3:12), "shame and everlasting contempt" (Daniel 12:2), a place
where "the fire is not quenched" (Mark 9:44-49), a place of "torment"
and "fire" (Luke 16:23-24), "everlasting destruction" (2 Thessalonians
1:9), a place where "the smoke of torment rises forever and ever"
(Revelation 14:10-11), and a "lake of burning sulfur" where the wicked
are "tormented day and night forever and ever" (Revelation 20:10). But
"fire" in the Bible is often used as a symbol of God's **wrath** or
**judgement.** God's "unquenchable fire" is His holy wrath, poured out
on the unrepentant, for all of eternity. It is **punishment**, not
**burning in unimaginable pain**. It is torment to fully know God and to
be fully separated from His love. **That** is true punishment, the
unquenchable fire of God's wrath.

The punishment of those who actively reject God in hell is as never
ending as the bliss of the righteous in heaven. Jesus Himself indicates
that punishment in hell is just as everlasting as life in heaven
(Matthew 25:46). The wicked are forever subject to the fury and the
wrath of God. How? By being burned in pain forever? Not necessarily.
Those in hell will acknowledge the perfect justice of God (Psalm 76:10).
Those who are in hell will know that their punishment is just and that
they alone are to blame (Deuteronomy 32:3-5).

In short, people in hell will fully know the glory of God. They will
fully know that they are eternally separated from that glory. And they
will fully know that it was their own choices which put them there.
Having that **full knowledge** of their circumstances, and the eternal
separation from the love of God, is the one thing which will torment the
unrepentant, day and night, for all of eternity.

Now that we got that little detail out of the way, atheists are "willing
to risk it" because they don't believe the evidence for the existence of
God is convincing enough. In fact, they believe that accepting the truth
of Christianity would require them to change their thinking, friends,
priorities, lifestyle, or morals, and they are not quite willing to give
up control over their lives in order to make those changes. They believe
that life would be easier and more fun without such changes. Perhaps
they realize that while Christianity is all about forgiveness, it's also
about denying yourself and carrying your cross. Indeed, Christianity is
free, but it can cost you your life. Atheists are simply unwilling to
make those changes.

But that's okay. They are free to make that choice, as God has given all
of us **free will**.
