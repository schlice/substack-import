Appropriateness is a personal judgement call, and is also situational.
Some people may think it is appropriate while others do not, and there's
no right or wrong answer there. All we can really discuss is whether or
not it is **prohibited** by either department policy or by law. And in
general, it is not prohibited by either law or department policy in most
cases.
