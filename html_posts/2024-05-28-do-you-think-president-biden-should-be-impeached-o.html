The answer is yes.

The reason is that Democrats have *weakened the process of impeachment*
by taking it from what it was traditionally (only for high crimes and
misdemeanors, and generally only when there was at least some consensus
in the House) and turning it into a political spectacle that only one
side of the aisle is able to effect on a president. It should continue
to be used that way, in a "shoe-on-the-other-foot" scenario.

Democrats rarely think of what happens when the shoe is on the other
foot, like when they reduced the requirement from a supermajority to a
simple majority to appoint Federal judges. Republicans warned that this
would come around to bite them, and it did when Republicans expanded
that rule change to include SCOTUS judges under McConnell.

They should be reminded that what is good for the goose is also good for
the gander.
