**How will self-driving cars overcome the dilemma of a child stepping in
front of the car? Because most people would swerve into danger if there
was no time to brake but a self-driving car will choose the safety of
the driver as number 1 priority.**

That's not necessarily true. It depends on how the car is programmed.

The car may be programmed to protect its occupants above all else. Or
the car may be programmed to protect pedestrians above all else.

To solve this question, let's ask what the most complex computer that
drives cars currently would do: **you**.

*What would you do?*

You would evaluate the situation, and you would swerve to avoid the
pedestrian, placing yourself in harm's way to avoid hitting the
pedestrian.

If that's how we would react, there is no reason to believe we would
program a self-driving car to do otherwise.

It is clear, therefore, that self-driving cars will not eliminate
accidents, as this scenario clearly illustrates. But they should reduce
accidents as they reduce driver inattentiveness and distractedness.
