Yes.

The door lock (at least on the Airbus) is a panel switch. There are at
least two codes available: one just chimes in the flight deck, and the
emergency override code sounds an alert for 30 seconds before briefly
unlocking the door. The cockpit crew can still override the emergency
code via the same panel switch and the door will not open.
