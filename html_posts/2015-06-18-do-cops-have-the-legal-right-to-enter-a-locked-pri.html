**Content:** [The police have the need to enter the building to ensure
everyone is safe. The police can even claim exigent circumstances and
forcibly enter into the building if they feel that someone\'s life may
be in danger, if they say they heard someone screaming or they say they
heard someone calling for help. Exigent circumstances allow the police
to enter places that they normally would not, so it is used
judiciously.\
\
In this case, an agent of the compay allowed them entrance. The doors
opened, the agent of the company left, and the police walked in. No one
stopped them. The police can rightly claim that an agent of the company
opened the doors and did not stop them from entering. This, along with
the obvious public safety concern of ensuring that the 911 call was
actually an accident and not someone seriously in trouble, is enough
legal basis for the police to enter the building.\
\
If the employee who opened the doors and did not stop the officers from
entering is at fault according to company policy, the company is within
its rights to terminate him.]{.rendered_qtext}
