**Is there any realistic possibility that Roe v Wade will be overturned
after Trump picks the next Supreme Court nominee?**

Thanks for asking this question. It is certainly a valid question, and
one that opponents will definitely try to use to hamstring the
nomination process.

Let's talk about *Roe* for a second. When Blackmun penned his decision,
he admitted that science, religion and philosophy could not agree when
life began, and if they could not agree, then the judiciary would
certainly not make such a statement.

The corollary is also true: *If science, theology and philosophy*
***can*** *agree on when life begins, the foundation for Roe crumbles.*

However, this means that the turning point in the abortion debate is not
dependent on the makeup of the court. It is dependent on whether or not
science, religion, and philosophy can agree on when life begins.

To that end:

1.  It is not the next SCOTUS nominee which will determine the fate of
    *Roe*. It is science, theology and philosophy coming together to
    determine when life begins which will determine when *Roe*
    collapses.
2.  Even if *Roe* is overturned, this simply returns the control of
    abortion to the states. Some states will support unfettered abortion
    up through 40 weeks. Some states will use the
    science/theology/philosophy approved definition of the beginning of
    life to limit elective abortions (not abortions required by medical
    necessity; i.e. health of mother, rape/incest, etc). Some states
    will ban abortions altogether. It will become a patchwork of
    abortion laws, but states' rights advocates would like to see it
    that way: allow the state representatives to determine for those
    state residents how they would like their state dollars spent.\
    \
    So even if *Roe* is overturned, full access to elective abortions
    throughout pregnancy may still be available in some states.
3.  A decision somewhere in between could also happen: if a
    scientifically provable definition of life becomes acceptable,
    abortion after that point would be considered murder without
    compelling medical necessity. The court could limit abortions after
    the fetus gains "life."
