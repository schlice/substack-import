What will happen? Ultimately, nothing noticeable.

Statistics are varied and are never correctly reported. For example,
some states like New York do not report on the number of CCW holders.
Some states like Montana and Arizona do not require permits to carry
concealed firearms (i.e. Constitutional Carry states). And in the vast
majority of cases, when a firearm is used to stop a crime without a shot
being fired, it is not ever reported to anyone. So take any numbers you
hear with a grain of salt.

Concealed carriers do occasionally commit crimes with their firearms.
But make sure you define "occasionally." According to a study by the
Crime Prevention Research Center, only 0.006% of concealed carry permit
holders were involved in gun related crimes. Does that mean that they
wantonly shot someone? Not at all, it said "gun-related crimes" which,
according to the report, in most cases involved the CCW holder carrying
a gun somewhere prohibited by law (i.e. a gun-free zone, a posted zone
where concealed carry is prohibited, etc).[\[1\]](#FsBOt){#cite-FsBOt

In Texas in 2011, .18% of all crimes were committed by CCW holders. That
doesn't say that the CCW holder actually used a gun in the commission of
the crime, it just says that CCW holders committed .18% of all crimes in
the state.
