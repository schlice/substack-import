**How do I turn off my lock screen on Samsung Galaxy S9?**

Assuming you actually can (I'll get there in a minute), the lock screen
is controlled from Settings \> Lock Screen and Security \> Screen Lock
Type. Just select "None" as your screen lock type, and your screen will
never lock. It will turn off, but it won't lock.

Some of your screen lock types may be "grayed out" (i.e. you can't
select them). For example, on my phone, I can't select None, Swipe, or
Pattern. Off on the right is a small "i" in a green circle (which
generally means "Information." You will see a popup which says something
along the lines of "Unable to perform action" and some text which
explains why. It may show you an app that is preventing you from setting
certain lock screens. For example, if you are connected to a corporate
network, or you receive company email on your device, the "Messages"
program may restrict certain lock screen types (including None, meaning
you must have a lock screen).

You can always disable that Device Administrator which is forcing you to
have a lock screen, but that particular app may stop working if it is
not a device administrator.
