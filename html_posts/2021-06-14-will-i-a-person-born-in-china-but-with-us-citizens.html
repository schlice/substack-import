Let's take your questions one at a time:

> **Will I, a person born in China (but with U.S. citizenship) have
> trouble getting into USAFA, AFROTC, or OTS?**

As long as you are a US citizen, you are eligible to be appointed to
USAFA. You can also attend AFROTC, or OTS after your college graduation.

> **Will I have a problem getting a senator\'s recommendation letter?**

For USAFA admission, you need a *nomination*. Nominations come from
either a US Congressional representative, a US Senator, the Vice
President, or the President. You will need to work with the office of
your local representatives to the US Congress, but your country of birth
should not prevent you from securing a nomination.

> **Further, will I have trouble getting into certain career fields or
> ranks?**

You will have no trouble getting into any career field or achieving
rank. Ranks are granted based on demonstrated performance which occurs
once you start working.

As others have noted, security clearance will take a little longer to
process for you, as your country of birth is, understandably, a concern
for the military. They are going to want to ensure that your ties to
your country of birth do not constitute a risk to national security.
Your investigation may take a little longer, but it will not *prevent*
you from participating in any career fields.

For USAFA, make sure you check out the [[Academy

out what you need to do and when.

Good luck!
