**What if you get into a schoolyard fight with a bully and accidentally
kill him? Will you get arrested? On what charges?**

First of all, it sounds like you're talking about a child since you said
schoolyard. So the answer is, of course, "it depends."

So rather than saying "will" you be arrested, let's instead look at the
question of whether or not you "can" be arrested.

So: **can you be arrested?** The short answer is **yes**, you can. The
charge? Murder.

It's certainly not 1st Degree Murder (the unlawful taking of a life with
forethought and malice), but it would certainly qualify as 2nd Degree
Murder (the unlawful taking of a life with forethought).

You can most definitely be charged with 2nd Degree Murder, as you were a
willing participant in a fight in which you threw a punch which, through
a series of events, resulted in the death of another person. The willing
throwing of a punch which resulted in death is forethought. You had no
intention of causing death, which is the difference between the 1st and
2nd degree of the crime.

Now that you've been arrested, **is there any defense to this charge?
Absolutely**. You will most likely claim that you acted in self-defense.
You will claim that you were **not** a willing participant in the
altercation; instead, you only struck the bully to defend yourself. You
were doing only what you needed to do to defend your life or to defend
yourself from grave bodily harm.

Also at issue is the age of the defendant, and whether or not the youth
is charged as an adult. This differs by state. The state can indeed
commit you to custody as a youth, and you can serve time in a youth
facility.
