**Do Conservatives lack tact because they think people shouldn't become
offended? Do conservatives take "personal responsibility" when someone
hits them for what they said, even though a responsible thing to do
would be to have tact?**

Wow, there are so many logical fallacies here, I think you may have
confused *yourself.* Let's try to deconstruct this.

> **Do Conservatives lack tact because they think people shouldn't
> become offended?**

Conservatives don't believe that people shouldn't become offended.
Conservatives believe that *you don't have the* ***right*** *to never be
offended.*

In other words, in your life, it's virtually guaranteed that someone
will offend you. What can you do about it? Here's three choices:

1.  Punch them because they offended you
2.  Sue them because they offended you
3.  Change the channel, leave the room, or express a different opinion.

If you picked anything other than 3, you're probably not a Conservative.

If you picked 1, you're a criminal. That's called *assault* and you go
to jail for that. And if you stand in front of the judge and he asks why
you assaulted a person and you said it was because you felt offended,
when he's done laughing at you, he'll probably let your charge stand.

If you picked 2, you're a snowflake. A snowflake is a person who
believes they have the right to never be offended. But in this country,
everyone has freedom, not just you! Everyone is free to express their
opinion, including you. Everyone has an opinion. Everyone has a right to
an opinion. Yes, opinions can offend. But that offense is *your
response* to someone else's opinion. It's not their opinion, but *your
response,* which is at issue. They are not required to conform to your
opinion because non-conformance risks offending you. You are required to
temper your response if you feel offense.

> **Do conservatives take "personal responsibility" when someone hits
> them for what they said**

Oh yes, I take personal responsibility when someone hits me. I take
responsibility to pick up the phone and call 911 so I can report an
assault.

> **even though a responsible thing to do would be to have tact?**

It is irresponsible to withhold your opinion simply because someone else
may find it offensive. That is the antithesis of a free society. A
society which values propriety more than openness is a dictatorship. A
society which values feelings above truth is a demagoguery.
