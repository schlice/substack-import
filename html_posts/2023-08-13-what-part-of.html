Most of the time, Christians have trouble understanding what "other
Gods" means.

The Bible specifically said, "I am the LORD your God who brought you out
of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage. You shall have no
other gods before me" (Deuteronomy 5:6--7 NKJV).

So not only is God saying that His people cannot practice idolatry, but
He explains *why*. Only God had the power to bring the slaves out of
Egyptian slavery. Only God cared enough for them to choose them to be
His chosen people. Only God protected them. Can an idol of stone or gold
do that?

Can anything we worship that is not God do that? Can money do that?
Money can buy you some temporary safety, but does it offer you
*everlasting life?* Not even the promise of cryogenics does that.

More specifically, God is talking about *materialism*.

> No one can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love
> the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You
> cannot serve God and money. --- Matthew 6:24 ESV

The "money" referred to in this translation is more appropriately called
materialism. You cannot love God and be materialistic. The dangers of
worshiping material things are clearly outlined in the story of the rich
young ruler (Matthew 19:16-26) who turned away from Christ because he
could not part with his wealth.

This is the crux of what Christians misunderstand about the First
Commandment.
