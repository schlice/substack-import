**How can I root a Galaxy S6 when the network is blocked? I didn\'t know
it when purchased.**

You do not need network access to root an Android phone. You need access
to a computer and a USB cable.

There are tons of instructions available on Google for rooting a Galaxy
S6. Most of them are pretty simple for even a basic computer user to
follow. At worst, you may have to flash the original firmware back on to
the phone using Samsung's tools.
