**Content:** [Schools can charge you separately for items that are not
specifically related to education time in the classroom (and in some
cases, schools charge extra fees for those). These fees have become
increasingly popular as school budgets continue to get cut and schools
look for ways to recoup the costs of things they have traditionally done
with tax dollars: proms, senior week, senior picnics, yearbooks, etc.,
but can no longer pay for with tax dollars which must, by law, go to
classroom education first. The items paid for with \"senior dues\" are
generally ancillary items that are unrelated to actual classroom
education.\
\
While students will never be denied a diploma because they failed to pay
senior dues, they may be denied admission to activities funded by senior
dues. For example, if senior dues pay for the graduation exercises, the
student may not be able to \"walk.\" The student will still receive a
diploma, however. Usually, events like senior pictures and the senior
prom are conducted in conjunction with outside agencies and companies,
so those fees may be collected separately. But schools will generally
collect for senior activities in one lump sum to fund them
all.]{.rendered_qtext}
