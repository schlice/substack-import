It depends on the conditions of the order.

If the location where the car is parked is more than the distance
specified in the order, then they can legally be present there.

However, in this day and age, someone sitting in their car in front of
your house without a stated purpose is ***loitering***, and it can be a
sign that someone is engaging in, or planning on engaging in, criminal
behavior, and should be reported to the police (non-emergency line,
please).

If the restraining order is in relation to a domestic violence
complaint, then you might want to advise the dispatcher that the person
loitering in the vehicle is just outside of the distance specified in an
active restraining order for DV, and you are afraid that he/she intends
on violating that order, since he/she doesn't appear to be doing
anything productive. Based on that information, the police may be able
to re-prioritize their response. Domestic violence situations are highly
volatile and rapidly evolving, and it is better to get ahead of them
before they get out of hand.
