You didn't indicate whether or not you are on a disease-modifying drug
(DMD), but you did indicate that you have regular disease activity
(three relapses in seven years would likely be considered regular
disease activity). I would assume that with this rate of relapse, you
have relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) and are not using one of the DMDs we
have available.

On average, for people who are not using a disease modifying drug, it
takes 10 years for RRMS to progress to secondary-progressive MS (SPMS).

So can I expect the rest of your life to go smoothly? Based on
statistics and averages for people not on a DMD, I would have to say
**no**. If you are not taking a DMD, I would say you're likely just a
few years away from having a relapse that doesn't go away.

If you're not taking a DMD, you need to start. Basically, all of the
DMDs do the same thing:

- slow the rate of relapses
- reduce the severity of relapses
- extend the amount of time between relapses

Basically, the DMDs slow the progression of the disease. Nothing can
completely stop the progression of the disease, but even when you are
"all OK," the disease silently progresses in the background. It is
fallacy to think that because you are currently symptom-free that your
MS is not silently progressing.

Perhaps it's time to talk to a neurologist about getting on a DMD. If
you're on one and you've had three relapses in seven years, you should
probably think about getting on a new one because this one has only had
questionable efficacy.
