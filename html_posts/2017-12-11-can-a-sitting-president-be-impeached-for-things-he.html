In short, **yes,** a sitting president can legally be impeached for
something he did as a citizen. Impeachment is a *political* process, not
a *criminal* one, so the usual standards of evidence and strict legal
liability do not apply to impeachment.

However, the Constitutional standard for impeachment is "high crimes and
misdemeanors," and this is generally recognized as things which happened
while in the course of entering, or after one had entered, office. These
are generally considered to be actions taken under color of office. It
is generally recognized that "things which happened while as a citizen"
would be outside the scope of what the Constitution would likely cover
as president, and are generally left to the legal system after the
president has completed his term.

In all of the 19 impeachments we have had so far, the allegations have
been for actions which have seriously undermined the public trust in one
way or another. It would be quite a stretch to allege that conduct which
took place before the person was president undermined the public trust
after the person was freely elected by the people, *even if that conduct
was unknown at the time of the election.*

(EDIT) Also, following the same line of thought, it is presupposed that
the voters are well aware of what a candidate did or did not do before
becoming the nominee. Therefore, if we presume that voters are aware of
the conduct *and still vote for the candidate anyway,* impeachment for
such activities is likely to be frowned upon, as it would be seen as
controverting the will of the voters.
