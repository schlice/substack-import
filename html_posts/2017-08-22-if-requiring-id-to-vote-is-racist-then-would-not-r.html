Short answer, no. Slightly longer answer: the logic does not follow.
Logically, you have a Constitutional right to vote. You have a
Constitutional right to keep and bear arms; you don't have a
Constitutional right to **buy** a gun, or even **afford** a gun. No
money needs to be expended in order to cast your vote.

The idea that voter ID laws are racist comes from the fact that many low
income people (who are disproportionately minorities) do not have
government-issued ID cards, and thus voter ID laws unfairly target
minorities. This is also an incorrect assertion, as many elderly people
are not able to obtain government-issued ID cards because they can't
gather the required documentation, or simply don't possess it.

Requiring ID for firearms purchases fulfills a long-accepted requirement
that we keep firearms out of the hands of felons and the adjudicated
mentally defective. In order to determine ones identity before
purchasing a gun, we must positively identify the person, which involves
reviewing ID.
