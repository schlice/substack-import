**What Is the most powerful statement in the Bible for you?**

For me personally, it is Philippians 4:13.

> *I can do all this through him who gives me strength.*

I had received this quote on a small business card sized note, one which
I got during military in-processing (along with that small pocket New
Testament that you get with your initial issue gear). I highlighted that
quote and had it up on my corkboard throughout my time at USAFA, and I
kept it with me ever since.

The same thought from the letter to the Philippians, expanded and more
applicable to my situation, is found in 2 Cor 12:7--10. I didn't know
just how important both of these passages would be until I really needed
them.

> *\...or because of these surpassingly great revelations. Therefore, in

> Therefore I will boast all the more gladly about my weaknesses, so

That "thorn in my flesh" which I was given was multiple sclerosis.

I fell upon this section of Paul's second letter to the Corinthians
during a particularly low point in my life, while I was still going
through the grief of learning of my disease.

And then it all clicked.

The strength He promises, to "do all things" as Paul says in his letter
to the Philippians, seems to be a bit nebulous. And it always was, until
I was diagnosed.

Paul says that he "delights in weaknesses." I certainly did not delight
in my weakness. I despised it. It totally changed the course of my life!
Instead of my life proceeding in the direction I wanted it to, it was
now proceeding in a completely different direction. I had to leave the
military. I had to stop doing some of the very things which I had
desired to do for my entire life. This disease totally changed my life.

But that was the point, wasn't it?

My life should not have been proceeding in the way I wanted it to. It
should have been proceeding in the way *He* wanted it to. And the idea
that I had *any* control over my life was an absurdity of my own making.

It took a diagnosis of MS to realize that.

Then I re-read Paul's words again. "That is why, for Christ's sake, I
delight in weaknesses, in insults, in hardships, in persecutions, in
difficulties. For when I am weak, then I am strong."

Paul endured far more than I ever will (or so I hope). At least, he
endured far more than I have, even counting MS. I have expert medical
care which Paul, even on his best days, did not. Not to mention he
suffered punishments, imprisonment, and more, in the name of Jesus. Nah,
what Paul and I experienced are in completely separate universes.
Nothing I have experienced in my life even comes close to the hardships
he faced.

And yet, he still "delighted" in it.

Why?

Because when his life had trouble, it was then that God's power was
"perfected." This word "perfected" doesn't mean "flawless." It means "at
its most poignant" or "at its most desirable state." In other words, its
*raison d'Ãªtre.* The whole reason it exists.

And what is that reason? It isn't the reason that modern culture would
have you believe. It isn't the removal of hardships. It is to use our
hardships, our weaknesses, the "thorns in our side," to display the
glory of God ***by allowing us to endure them. Even to "delight" in
them.***

Satan (and his thorns) do not work in a vacuum. *God allows Satan to
work, because everything Satan does is carefully planned to glorify
God.* Let that sink in for a second. Everything that Satan does in this
world is designed by God in His loving plan to lead us to His glory. God
allowed Satan's thorns to afflict Paul, in the same way God allowed
Satan to afflict Job. But it was all done with an overarching design, to
turn that affliction and use it for His good purposes.

So I know that my disease was permitted to happen so that God could use
it for His good purposes. Don't misunderstand; I have no idea what those
purposes are. But God keeps His promises, and He has promised that this
affliction "will perfect His power," or will be turned into good, for
His glory. I may never know what that purpose is, while I'm still alive.
But I will trust in Him, and I will trust that He has a plan for me. And
while I haven't quite gotten to the point that Paul had, of "delighting"
in my afflictions, I can at least rest assured that God is using this
for His purposes.

He has a plan for me. *God* has a plan for *me*. Now it's up to me to
allow Him to do the good work through me that He has planned. I just
have to let Him take the wheel.
