You're absolutely correct. The FBI only has jurisdiction when a
kidnapper crosses state lines. In that case, the FBI has **original
jurisdiction**. They have jurisdiction defined by statute.

However, the FBI has developed a pretty good kidnapping investigation
program. So generally, state and local authorities ask the FBI to
assist. In most cases, they do not automatically get involved.

The FBI will automatically initiate a kidnapping investigation involving
a missing child "of tender years," even when there is no known
interstate travel. "Tender years" is generally defined as a child 12
years or younger. The FBI will monitor other kidnapping situations when
there is no evidence of interstate travel, and it offers assistance from
various entities including the FBI
Laboratory.[\[1\]](#MfCTj){#cite-MfCTj .citation_link}

Original question:

Why is the FBI involved with kidnappings? The FBI's jurisdiction only
applies to interstate crime. Most kidnappings occur within one state.
What gives the FBI the authority to intercede?
