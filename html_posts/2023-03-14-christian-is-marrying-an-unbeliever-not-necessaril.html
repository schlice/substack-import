Marrying an unbeliever is not, in and of itself, a sin. But it is
strongly warned against, because it could very easily lead you into sin.

The analogy given is a team of oxen.

Notice the **yoke** between them? In order for the cart to move forward,
the oxen need to move together, in the same direction. What do you think
would happen if the oxen went in two different directions? That cart
probably wouldn't go very far, would it. But even if they move the same
direction, if one ox is significantly stronger than the other, or
significantly larger or taller, they are considered to be "unequally
yoked" and cannot perform the task they are set to. They would always
operate in opposition to each other.

Paul uses this analogy when he makes this argument in his second letter
to the church in Corinth. He says:

> Do not be yoked together with unbelievers. For what do righteousness
> and wickedness have in common? Or what fellowship can light have with
> darkness? What harmony is there between Christ and Belial? Or what
> does a believer have in common with an unbeliever? What agreement is
> there between the temple of God and idols? --- 2 Corinthians 6:14--16
> NIV

Paul uses this analogy in a larger message to the church, which was
having difficulty with certain aspects of living as a Christian. He
discouraged them from being in an unequal partnership with unbelievers
because believers and unbelievers are opposites, just as light and
darkness are opposites. They simply have nothing in common, just as
Christ has nothing in common with "Belial," a Hebrew word meaning
"worthlessness."

For a believer to marry an unbeliever, a similar sort of imbalance would
take place, as a married couple becomes "one flesh." It's uniting
opposites, which makes for a very difficult marriage, and Paul warns
against this, because it is dangerous to the spiritual health of the
believer. For the relationship to work, one or the other must abandon
his moral center and move toward that of the other. More often than not,
it is the believer who finds himself pressured to leave his Christian
principles behind for the sake of the health of the marriage.
