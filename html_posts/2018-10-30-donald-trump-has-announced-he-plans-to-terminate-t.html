**Donald Trump has announced he plans to terminate the right to
citizenship for babies born on US soil to non-citizens. Why?**

First of all, the United States is one of only two developed nations in
the Western hemisphere that follows this practice. Most countries in the
Western hemisphere do have some form of birthright nationalization.

Second, the 14th Amendment was not written to guarantee citizenship to
children of illegal immigrants. The 14th Amendment says:

> All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to
> the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the
> State wherein they reside.

The sticking point is that phrase "and subject to the jurisdiction
thereof". Only citizens are subject to the jurisdiction of the United
States. Illegal immigrants are not subject to the jurisdiction of the
United States, since they are not citizens. They are subject to the
jurisdiction of their home country.

But are we certain that's what the writers of the Amendment meant? For
context, we return, as the Supreme Court does, to the words of the
original authors of the Amendment in question. Senator Jacob Howard
worked closely with Abraham Lincoln in drafting and passing the 13th
Amendment (which abolished slavery). He also served on the Senate Joint
Committee on Reconstruction, which drafted the 14th Amendment. In 1866,
Senator Howard clearly spelled out the intent of the 14th Amendment by
writing (emphasis mine):

> Every person born within the limits of the United States, and subject
> to their jurisdiction, is by virtue of natural law and national law a
> citizen of the United States. **This will not, of course, include
> persons born in the United States who are foreigners, aliens, who
> belong to the families of ambassadors or foreign ministers accredited
> to the Government of the United States**, but will include every other
> class of persons. It settles the great question of citizenship and
> removes all doubt as to what persons are or are not citizens of the
> United States. This has long been a great desideratum in the
> jurisprudence and legislation of this country.

Clearly, from the plain wording of the writers of the 14th Amendment, it
was never intended to grant citizenship to children of illegals. In
actuality, [[according to Ilya Shapiro of the CATO
Institute](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=0372f5&url=https://www.cato.org/blog/birthright-citizenship-constitutionally-required){.external_link

onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="cato.org"}]{.qlink_container}, that phrase was originally
written to exclude the children of Native American tribes from American
citizenship, since those children were subject to the jurisdiction of
Native American tribal government, and were citizens of their tribe, not
of the United States. The amendment was also written to guarantee the
citizenship of freed slaves and their children, in opposition to the
*Dred Scott* ruling.

(EDIT) I forgot to mention: Trump knows that if he does this as an EO,
it will immediately be challenged in one of the circuits (it's always a
safe bet to bet on the 9th Circus to challenge Trump's EOs), and it will
end up at the Supreme Court.

Which is exactly what Trump wants.
