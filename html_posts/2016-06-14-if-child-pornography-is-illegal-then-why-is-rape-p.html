Morally, is it wrong to write a book which details how to assassinate
the president? Is it wrong to write a book which details how to make a
pipe bomb? And is it wrong to film a movie which details a rape?

Morally, it's dependent on your particular set of morals. For some
people, that may be completely acceptable. For others, it is abhorrent.

Legally, while you can film a sexual activity and market it as a rape
but have statements showing the actors are all over 18 and consent to
filming the scene, you cannot film sex with a child and claim that the
sex is consensual. Sex with a child is illegal (it is real rape, not
pretend-movie rape), so recording sex with a child is, in and of itself,
a crime.
