**Why do you think Republicans are refusing to acknowledge that Trump is
hiding impeachment information by not letting key witnesses testify?**

Because if this were really the case, and Republicans were certain that
"impeachment information" was being deliberately restricted by the
President's invocation of executive privilege, they would have pushed
their Democrat counterparts in the House to take their subpoenas to the
courts to determine whose privilege wins: the House's impeachment
investigation power, or the White House's executive privilege.

The House failed to do this.

This indicates that the House Democrats did not think that the testimony
contained any critical "impeachment information." Clearly, they had
enough information from the "witnesses" they did have to proceed with
Articles of Impeachment, so clearly, there was nothing that the "key
witnesses" could have said which would have strengthened their position
that impeachable offenses occurred.

And to forestall the next question, the only authority under which the
President can restrict a government employee from testifying in front of
another branch of government is executive privilege. So if Trump in any
way convinced someone to not testify in front of Congress, the authority
to do so is contained in the executive privilege doctrine.
