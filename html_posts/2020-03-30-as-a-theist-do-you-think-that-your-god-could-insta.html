**As a theist, do you think that your God could instantly eliminate
Covid-19?**

First of all, what you must know about Christians broadly is that for
any question which starts with "Can God..." the answer is always **yes
he can**.

God can do anything. God can do more than you even have the capability
to imagine.

Which begs the question: **why doesn't he?**

Why doesn't God simply eliminate COVID-19? Why doesn't he walk before us
with his great cosmic broom sweeping away anything that can hurt us?

Let me answer that with a question: **Where did you ever get the idea
that this is what God is supposed to do?**

I'm guessing by the tenor of your question that you are not a "theist."
You may be agnostic, or atheist, it doesn't matter. In any case, it's
likely you haven't read the Bible. The Bible is actually very clear on
the point:

**God never promised that you would have an easy life.**

There is no record in the Bible of God ever promising that you would
have a carefree life, free of any bad thing ever happening to you. In
fact, Jesus tells his followers that they should prepare for the world
to hate them, reject them, and ultimately kill them.

> "If the world hates you, keep in mind that it hated me first. If you
> belonged to the world, it would love you as its own. As it is, you do
> not belong to the world, but I have chosen you out of the world. That
> is why the world hates you. Remember what I told you: 'A servant is
> not greater than his master.' If they persecuted me, they will
> persecute you also. If they obeyed my teaching, they will obey yours
> also. They will treat you this way because of my name, for they do not
> know the one who sent me. If I had not come and spoken to them, they
> would not be guilty of sin; but now they have no excuse for their sin.
> Whoever hates me hates my Father as well. If I had not done among them
> the works no one else did, they would not be guilty of sin. As it is,
> they have seen, and yet they have hated both me and my Father. But
> this is to fulfill what is written in their Law: 'They hated me
> without reason.'" --- John 15:18--25 NIV
>
> "I have told you these things, so that in me you may have peace. In
> this world you will have trouble. But take heart! I have overcome the
> world." --- John 16:33

Despite what some may tell you, being a theist is no foolproof insurance
policy against the trials of life. Even the greats of the Bible were
thrown in prison, tortured and ultimately executed, for committing no
other crime than simply believing in God. And God doesn't really clarify
for us what his plan is, or how our part in it glorifies him.

Believers know, however, that God keeps his promises, and that
everything he allows to happen, be it wars, famine, or illness,
ultimately glorifies him and furthers the church. That is the essence of
faith: believing in the truth of God when the world spends all of its
energy trying to convince you otherwise. Paul wrote:

> In all our troubles my joy knows no bounds. For when we came into
> Macedonia, this body of ours had no rest, but we were harassed at
> every turn---conflicts on the outside, fears within --- 2 Cor 7:4-5

Peter explained that there would be trouble when he said:

> Dear friends, do not be surprised at the painful trial you are
> suffering, as though something strange were happening to you. But
> rejoice that you participate in the sufferings of Christ, so that you
> may be overjoyed when His glory is revealed. ---1 Peter 4:12-13

In other words, there will be suffering, but we will ultimately prevail.
And it's only human to have doubts. But if you want to believe that
there is a silver lining to this dark cloud, talk to your "theist"
friends and ask how they've learned to dance in the rain. Ask them where
their hope comes from. If you don't have any theist friends, ask us
here. Because we do have hope. Christ gives us hope in the future, and
it may not even be an earthly future.
