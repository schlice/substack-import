**Content:** [You need a lot more diagnosis.\
\
There are many diseases which can cause minds to get blurry like you
described. Your neurologist will continue asking you questions and
trying to understand what\'s going on. You may be ordered to take an
MRI, or get a lumbar puncture (aka a spinal tap). If you haven\'t
already, you\'ll probably get lots of blood taken and analyzed. There
could be any number of systemic issues going on.\
\
And if you\'re not happy with what your neurologist tells you, get a
second opinion. Find another neurologist near you. Keep going until you
find the answer.]{.rendered_qtext}
