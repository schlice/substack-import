**What are the possible consequences if a girl of 17 leaves her home in
PA without her mother's consent, sneaks on to a military base in New
York in order to have sex with a man who is 24 years old and enlisted in
the military?**

There is a whole litany of things that are wrong with this scenario, and
sneaking on to a military base is literally the least of anyone's
worries. In fact, it's the only crime the girl can be accused of in this
scenario. 18 U.S.C. ยง 1382 prohibits any person from entering any
military installation for any purpose prohibited by law, and last I
checked, statutory rape is in fact prohibited by law. The girl faces a
fine and imprisonment of not more than six months

Now, to the guy. Let's start with the elephant in the room, and that's
the aforementioned statutory rape. The age of consent in New York is 18
years old. Having sex with a minor is called statutory rape. That he did
it on a military base simply means that he'll be sent to Leavenworth to
spend a few years turning big rocks into little rocks before he gets a
dishonorable discharge.

If he talked to you before you got there, he is guilty of a Federal
crime for soliciting sex with a minor across state lines. Under 18
U.S.C. ยง 2422 and Section 2423, if he is convicted of using mail,
Internet, or other forms of interstate or international communication to
solicit or attempt to solicit a minor with the intent to engage in
unlawful sexual activity or are convicted of successfully transporting a
minor for this illegal purpose, he faces a minimum of 10 years (as a
misdemeanor) and a maximum of life (as a felony) in federal prison and a
fine of up to \$250,000, and that's AFTER he gets out of Leavenworth.
