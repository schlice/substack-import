**If your neighbor\'s tree is overhanging into your backyard and you
have asked him on numerous occasion to trim it back and he hasn\'t, what
would you do?**

1.  Check with your city ordinances. They may be different in your area.
    In most areas, the area within your fence (and immediately over your
    fence) is your area to maintain. The tree overhanging your fence is
    technically trespassing (in tort) into your property.
2.  If your city allows it, trim the tree. Yes, you'll have to pay to
    trim the tree. But pay an arborist to trim it so that if there is
    damage to the tree, it's on the arborist, not on you.
3.  Talk to your neighbor about it. Not just with letters, but with
    words. Face to face. Maybe your neighbor will chip in to help pay
    for the trimming, maybe not. But ultimately, it's your yard, so it's
    your responsibility.
