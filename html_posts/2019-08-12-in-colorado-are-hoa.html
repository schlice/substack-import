**In Colorado, are HOA\'s required to send a pre lien letter before
placing a lien?**

No.

In Colorado, HOAs are governed by the Colorado Common Interest Ownership
Act (CCIOA) which regulates how HOAs work and how they are administered
in the state, including the establishment of liens.

In Colorado, the recording of the HOA Declaration of Covenants,
Conditions, and Restrictions (often called CC&Rs or the declaration)
constitutes record notice and perfection of the lien. No further
recording of the claim of lien for assessments is required (Colo. Rev.
Stat. ยง 38-33.3-316(4)).

So not only do they not have to send a pre lien letter, but they don't
even have to record the claim of lien anywhere. In other words, as soon
as you are delinquent in your assessment payments, a lien *automatically
attaches*.

Even worse, it's a *super lien* (under Colo. Rev. Stat. ยง
38-33.3-316(2)(b)) which means it takes precedence over your mortgage
lien. This effectively means that even if you are current with your
mortgage payments, if you are delinquent with your assessment payments,
the HOA can still foreclose. It's automatically a super lien because of
the new rules for HOAs, passed in 2014.

In 2014, House Bill 13-1276 limited the ability of HOAs to *foreclose*
on that lien under certain circumstances. The Board must vote to
foreclose, and they must do so within six years of the full amount of
the assessments coming due. The Board may only initiate foreclosure on
the lien if the total amount equals at least six months of assessments
(which also means that the lien is automatically a super lien).
