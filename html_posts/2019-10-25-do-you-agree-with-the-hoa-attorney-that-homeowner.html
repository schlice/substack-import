**Do you agree with the HOA attorney that homeowner associations are
entitled to undermine constitutional rights?**

HOAs are not government organizations. The Constitution (and the Bill of
Rights) prevents government from infringing on your rights.

Private organizations which you willingly choose to join can infringe on
your Constitutional rights. For example, HOAs can control what signs you
post outside your house and what they can and cannot say. They can
prevent you from speaking freely on the street corner with a megaphone
if it disturbs homeowners. They can prevent you from forming a church in
your house, even though you have the freedom of religion. Those are just
some of the ways that your rights can be curtailed, and I haven't even
left the 1st Amendment.
