**Content:** [First of all, RELAX. Yes, it\'s big news. Yes, it\'s
life-altering news.\
\
BUT\
\
It\'s not LIFE-ENDING news.\
\
Most people with MS will have lifespans similar to those without it. And
it is the very rare minority of people with MS who will end up in a
wheelchair or worse. The very large majority of people with MS go on to
live mostly normal lives.\
\
I know that it\'s a tough pill to swallow. I swallowed it roughly 8
years ago. I experienced all of those emotions: fear, grief, anger,
confusion\...but mostly fear, and fear of the unknown in particular. I
had lots of questions. What\'s going to happen to me? Will I still be
able to throw a baseball with my son? Will I live to see him get
married?\
\
For the very large majority of people, the answer to those questions is
a resounding YES.\
\
I would first recommend you get a neurologist if you haven\'t done so
already, and when you do, if available, make sure that your neurologist
is part of a practice that specializes in MS. Talk to your neurologist
about starting one of the approved MS therapy drugs. There are pros and
cons to all of them, so find one that fits your lifestyle and your
comfort level with the various routes of delivery (injection, oral,
monthly infusion, etc). You may be told that you should wait before
starting your MS therapy. I would say (as would my neurologist) that the
more \"conservative\" approach is to \"conserve\" as much nerve tissue
as possible, because for the most part, once it\'s gone, it\'s gone.\
\
So relax, you\'re going to be fine. If you have specific questions,
please feel free to ask away; I will answer all of your questions to the
best of my ability. I\'m not a doctor, I\'m a patient like you. I\'ve
been there, so I answer questions from my experience. The other
important thing to remember is that everyone experiences MS in a
different way; no one person\'s MS will progress like anyone else\'s.
It\'s a very unique disease.]{.rendered_qtext}
