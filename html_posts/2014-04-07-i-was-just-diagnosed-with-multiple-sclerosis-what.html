<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [First of all, RELAX. Yes, it\'s big news. Yes, it\'s<br>life-altering news.\<br>\<br>BUT\<br>\<br>It\'s not LIFE-ENDING news.\<br>\<br>Most people with MS will have lifespans similar to those without it. And<br>it is the very rare minority of people with MS who will end up in a<br>wheelchair or worse. The very large majority of people with MS go on to<br>live mostly normal lives.\<br>\<br>I know that it\'s a tough pill to swallow. I swallowed it roughly 8<br>years ago. I experienced all of those emotions: fear, grief, anger,<br>confusion\...but mostly fear, and fear of the unknown in particular. I<br>had lots of questions. What\'s going to happen to me? Will I still be<br>able to throw a baseball with my son? Will I live to see him get<br>married?\<br>\<br>For the very large majority of people, the answer to those questions is<br>a resounding YES.\<br>\<br>I would first recommend you get a neurologist if you haven\'t done so<br>already, and when you do, if available, make sure that your neurologist<br>is part of a practice that specializes in MS. Talk to your neurologist<br>about starting one of the approved MS therapy drugs. There are pros and<br>cons to all of them, so find one that fits your lifestyle and your<br>comfort level with the various routes of delivery (injection, oral,<br>monthly infusion, etc). You may be told that you should wait before<br>starting your MS therapy. I would say (as would my neurologist) that the<br>more \"conservative\" approach is to \"conserve\" as much nerve tissue<br>as possible, because for the most part, once it\'s gone, it\'s gone.\<br>\<br>So relax, you\'re going to be fine. If you have specific questions,<br>please feel free to ask away; I will answer all of your questions to the<br>best of my ability. I\'m not a doctor, I\'m a patient like you. I\'ve<br>been there, so I answer questions from my experience. The other<br>important thing to remember is that everyone experiences MS in a<br>different way; no one person\'s MS will progress like anyone else\'s.<br>It\'s a very unique disease.]<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*This answer is not professional medical advice**, nor is it a<br>substitute for professional medical advice.
