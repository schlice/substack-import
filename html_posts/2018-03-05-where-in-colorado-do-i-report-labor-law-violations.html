**Where in Colorado do I report labor law violations such as not giving
mandatory breaks and having safety violations in the workplace?**

This one's easy. The bit about "mandatory breaks" is covered by the
Colorado Department of Labor and Employment. They have [[an online
form](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=1438e0&url=https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/cdle/complaint-forms){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="colorado.gov"}]{.qlink_container} to fill out to begin an
investigation.

> The Division of Labor Standards and Statistics may assist employees
> performing work in Colorado with the recovery of earned compensation,
> and labor law violations. If you wish to file a Wage and Hour Law
> Complaint with the Division, you must fully complete and submit to the

As for safety violations, this could be more serious. If it's an
occupational safety and health violation that could put the public at
risk, I suggest you contact by phone the [[Colorado Department of Public
Health and
Environment](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=93a241&url=https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/cdphe/categories/concerns-and-emergencies){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="colorado.gov"}]{.qlink_container}. That website has contacts
for all sorts of public health-related issues and how to report them.

Good luck!
