If you define them this way (which is not the actual definitions of
those two words), I'd choose "knowledge" at least as you have it defined
here. I don't trust me as far as I can throw me, so I certainly don't
trust my "belief" as it is defined here. I'd only trust my "knowledge"
as it is defined here.
