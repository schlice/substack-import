**Is it possible that Barr\'s earlier written statements regarding the
Mueller probe be construed as obstruction since the now published report
contradicts many of his judgements?**

Obstruction of what? Obstruction of justice is a specific process crime,
and usually involves three elements:

1.  There was a pending federal judicial proceeding;
2.  The defendant knew of the proceeding; and
3.  The defendant had corrupt intent to interfere with or attempted to
    interfere with the proceeding.

Barr found that there was not enough evidence to even start a federal
judicial proceeding, so obstruction simply does not apply.

If the Mueller report contradicts the DOJ's findings, then that just
means you have a bad AG and a poor DOJ. It doesn't mean they committed a
crime by failing to prosecute.
