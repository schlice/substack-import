Since you can't send your child to Prager University, since it isn't an
accredited academic institution, you should instead look into a few
other Christian traditional universities you can send her:

Those are actually some solid choices. You can still get a well-rounded
education at these schools, despite what others may say.

If she still insists on going to a progressive, liberal college, then
send her out on her own. Make her pay for it herself. I mean, student
loans are still a thing, right?
