**Content:** [Your question really boils down to what you believe the
job of SCOTUS is, and HOW they are supposed to interpret the
Constitution.\
\
Some people believe that the Constitution should be interpreted as it is
written, drawing from the Framers the context around how to interpret.
These people are called \"strict constructioninsts.\" Others believe
that the SCOTUS should exercise broad latitude in interpretation,
drawing context from modern society so that they can be larger
influencers in society. These people are called \"broad
constructionists,\" \"loose constructionists,\" or \"liberal
constructionists.\" The very first \"construction\" that was either
\"strict\" or \"loose\" was the interpretation of the \"Necessary and
Proper\" clause (also called the Elastic Clause) of the Constitution:\
\
]{.rendered_qtext}

> The Congress shall have Power \... To make all Laws which shall be
> necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers,
> and all other Powers vested by this Constitution in the Government of
> the United States, or in any Department or Officer thereof.

\
Almost immediately after the Constitution was ratified, the Founding
Fathers split into these two separate groups (so this is not a new
debate by any stretch of the imagination). The strict constructionists
were led by Jefferson, the loose constructionists were led by Hamilton.
Jefferson believed that only the strict construction of the Necessary
and Proper clause would keep federal government small and allow the
people the largest access to liberty. Hamilton believed that a much more
powerful federal government and much less powerful state governments
could propel the country to much greater and faster economic
development. Only the broadest, loosest reading of the Necessary and
Proper clause would allow Congress to create the laws needed to fulfill
Hamilton\'s view of how government should work.\
\
Jefferson\'s Democrat-Republicans and Hamilton\'s Federalists became the
nations first two political parties. They have been replaced by
Republicans (strict constructionists) and Democrats (loose
constructionists). This argument between Jefferson and Hamilton over the
Necessary and Proper clause became the first major political dispute in
our nation\'s history.\
\
So if you believe that SCOTUS should take a strict interpretation of the
Constitution and they are not (or if you are a loose constructionist and
SCOTUS is taking a strict view), then they are \"trampling the
Constitution.\"
