**What happens in Canadian court if you use pepper spray on someone who
tries to rape you, but the spray you used is illegal?**

First of all, not all pepper spray is illegal in Canada. According to
the [[Criminal Code of
Canada](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=8769f2&url=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="justice.gc.ca"}]{.qlink_container}, it's legal to carry a
product designed for personal protection against another human. However,
some products like mace (which has a higher concentration of oleoresin
capsicum, the chemical found in pepper spray) is considered a prohibited
weapon, [[which makes it
illegal.](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=2b2619&url=http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/cfp-pcaf/faq/im-ex-eng.htm){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"

has the Canada-correct amount of OC, it's legal to carry. So if you have
pepper spray in Canada, make sure it complies with Canadian law.

Secondly, even if you did use an illegal device, you are generally
allowed to defend yourself. However, Canadian criminal code says that
you are allowed to use only force that is reasonable in that
circumstance. Therefore, even using prohibited pepper spray against an
actual rapist might be permitted. Canada is very situation-dependent
when it comes to defenses against crimes against the person. A judge
will have to determine whether the force applied (in this case, unlawful
pepper spray) was reasonable to use in that situation.
