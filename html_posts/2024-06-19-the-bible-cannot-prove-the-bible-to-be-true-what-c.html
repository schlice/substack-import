Look, I get what you're saying. We're not talking about exegetical
analysis, we're talking about **logic**. And if you were to say "The
Bible is true because the Bible says it is true," this would be an
example of **circular logic**.

So using the Bible to prove the truth of the Bible only works for people
who already believe that the Bible contains God's Word.

So for the remainder of the logically-minded, how can you prove that the
Bible is authentic and trustworthy, and that the Bible contains the word
of God?

The answer comes in a set of logical proofs that build upon themselves.

1.  First, you must prove that God exists. We do this through our
    logical arguments: the beginning of the universe (Cosmological
    Argument), the design of the universe (Teleological
    Argument/Anthropic Principle), the design of life (Teleological
    Argument), and the existence of the Moral Law (Moral Argument)
2.  If God exists, then miracles are possible. Miracles can authenticate
    a message from God (i.e., as acts of God to confirm a word from
    God).
3.  We know the Bible is historically reliable. This is evidenced by:
    1.  Early testimony
    2.  Eyewitness testimony
    3.  Uninvented (authentic) testimony
    4.  Eyewitnesses who were not deceived
4.  The Bible says Jesus claimed to be God.
5.  Jesus' claim to be God was miraculously confirmed by:
    1.  His fulfillment of many prophecies about Himself;
    2.  His sinless life and the miracles He performed;
    3.  His prediction and accomplishment of His own resurrection.
6.  Therefore, Jesus is God., and whatever Jesus (who is God) teaches is
    true.
7.  Jesus taught that the Bible is the Word of God.
8.  Therefore, it is true that the Bible is the Word of God (and
    anything opposed to it is false).
