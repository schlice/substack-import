First of all, I don't know of any place where you pre-pay for your
appointment. Usually you pay for your haircut after they're done, not
before. This gives the salon the opportunity for what they call
***upsell.*** They try to sell you more services, styling products, etc.
Forcing you to pre-pay for your haircut minimizes the opportunity for
upsell. So I'm not sure what "cancelling an appointment with no refund"
means, since you rarely pre-pay for your haircut.

Nevertheless, it is not discriminatory to require your haircut clients
to be compliant. Children have to be old enough to sit still in the
chair while the stylist does his or her work. Having a child kicking,
screaming (disturbing the other stylists and/or guests), or getting out
of the chair is not only disruptive, it elongates the amount of time
needed to complete a haircut which ruins efficiency for the salon, and
could be dangerous for the child (kicking children and scissors don't
mix). And if they start to have appointments backing up, they start to
lose clients to the competition, which means they lose money.

Unless there is a state law which requires salons to accept clients of
any age, salons can determine the minimum client age they take on their
own. It's not discriminatory to say that you don't do kid's cuts, or
that your clients must stay in their seats for the duration of the cut,
or that clients cannot disrupt other stylists or patrons. So long as
they apply those policies to every client, regardless of age, I find it
hard to believe that a discrimination lawsuit would prevail.

And even so, you would only be able to recover actual damages, and what
damage was done by this particular salon refusing to cut a child's hair?
I don't think you could recover much.
