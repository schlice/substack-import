**Does multiple sclerosis cause bloodshot eyes?**

Multiple Sclerosis is an autoimmune neurodegenerative disease in which
nerve cells are attacked by the immune system. It is generally not
characterized by bloodshot eyes.

However, occasionally MS users will use cannabis (marijuana) to relieve
neurological pain (as opposed to physical pain which is effectively
treated with current pain meds). Marijuana does cause bloodshot eyes.

So if the MS patient is treating their MS symptoms with cannabis, then
bloodshot eyes may be a result.
