<h2>Answer Comment</h2>
<div>

**Content:** [A couple of the other commenters mentioned that you talked
about the cost of your car, but you failed to mention other expenses,
namely your medical care. Even if you have health insurance, you\'re
going to have to pay things like copays and coinsurance, and as you
alluded to, this is a lot of hassle, a pain in the butt, lots of time
and effort. Not to mention, you probably will have to take time off of
work to go to all of the doctor appointments, which is time you\'re not
being paid for. This was not your fault! It\'s extremely inconvenient
that you now have to go through all of this medical nonsense when this
was not your fault at all.\
\
You deserve to recoup some of those expenses.\
\
If you accept the insurance company\'s offer (which is pretty fair for
your car), you also give up the right to fight for other expenses, which
could end up being far more than your car. Plus, there\'s all this time
and effort that you\'re not being compensated for. It\'s a category of
award called \"pain and suffering.\" If you take the offer, ***you waive
the right to recoup any other costs***, which could be substantial.\
\
What your attorneys are asking for is reasonable and is in line with
what most personal injury firms charge: they take 1/3, you keep 2/3.
Remember again, they won\'t take your case unless they can make some
money off of it.\
\
Yes, I have had to deal with this once before. My attorney walked me
through the entire process, and while the award wasn\'t what I would
have liked (i.e. it wasn\'t fair), it was *just.* So it all worked out
in the end.\
\
In my opinion, you should do what your attorney is asking of you, let
them walk you through the process. Good luck.]{.rendered_qtext}
