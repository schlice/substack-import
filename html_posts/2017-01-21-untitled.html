**Content:** []{.rendered_qtext}

So that there is no further ambiguity, do yo feel that you "had MS,"
then changed your diet, and you "cured your MS?"

Or are you saying that you found a strategy that works for you in
controlling inflammation to such a degree that you haven\'t had a
relapse in a very long time, but you still have MS? And if this is the
case, how do you know you still have MS? MRI results? Somebody tells you
that you still have it?

Some other important tidbits you neglected to add:

- Are you taking any of the approved MS drugs?
- If not, have you ever taken any of them?
- Are you under the care of a neurologist?
