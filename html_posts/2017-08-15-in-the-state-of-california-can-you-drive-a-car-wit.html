It is illegal in California to drive a motor vehicle without a valid
drivers license in your possession. This charge is a California
infraction under California Vehicle Code Section ยง12951(a), failure to
present a driver's license. A photograph of your license is not a valid
substitute for your license. It's enough for the officer to look your
license up (so that he knows that you actually have a valid license),
but the law does not allow for reproductions of your license; you must
have it in your physical possession or you can be charged with VC
12951(a). Also, if you have it and you fail to present it, that is a
misdemeanor under VC 12951(b) (but that's not what this question asked).

Drivers that are discovered to be driving without a valid drivers
license in their possession face a fine of up to \$250.

However, this is a "dismissible offense" which means that if you can
show the court that you had a license at the time of the offense, the
court is required to dismiss the charge. If you have been charged three
times or more of this infraction, the court is no longer required to
dismiss the offense (even though they may).
