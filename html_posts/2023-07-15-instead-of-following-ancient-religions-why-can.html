You certainly can do that. Nothing is stopping you. You can believe in
anything you like, or nothing at all. In fact, if you're truly motivated
enough, you can even start your own religion!

Organized religions happen because *more than one person believes
similarly*. Christianity has [[more
followers](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=8d8bba&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_religious_populations){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container} than any other world
religion at 2.382 billion followers worldwide (31.11% of the world's
population), based on the 2020 projection using 2010 numbers. That's a
lot of people who believe similarly.

But hey, if you are dissatisfied with all of the world's existing
religions, you can just abandon them all and come up with your own
"religion" which dictates how you should live your own life.

Most people just call it "atheism." (Cue the atheists in the comments
who will be quick to tell me that atheism is not a religion. Before you
do, though, I suggest you read through the WikiHow identifying the
elements of a religion).

Anyway, here's my advice to you: don't bother with all that religion
stuff. Just live your life in the best way you know how. Call it a
religion if you want others to believe as you do, otherwise just call it
"how I live." If you're just not interested in answers to questions like
*why am I here*, or *is there anything more to this life*, then don't
bother with religion.

Because just building something to believe in, that will help you live
this life, will not answer those deep, nagging questions, especially
that one little voice in the back of your head, when you survey the
splendor of this world, that whispers "*This is amazing, but why? There
must be a greater purpose to this life than* ***just this****."*

It is only religion that can answer such questions.
