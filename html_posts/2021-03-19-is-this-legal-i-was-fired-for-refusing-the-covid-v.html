**Is this legal? I was fired for refusing the covid vaccine because I
believe there's not enough testing and EUA approval only I wanted to
wait for long term results and FDA approval first? Can they fire me? In
Oregon?**

Everyone here telling you that Oregon is an "at will employment" state
is correct. They can fire you for any non-protected reason.

Everyone here telling you that your employer in Oregon can fire you
because you didn't take the COVID-19 vaccine is **100% wrong.**

Both of those statements are true. How? Vaccines are governed under
Federal law, and Oregon's right to work statute is state law.

Last time I checked, Federal law trumps state law.

Drugs covered only by Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) can only be
taken voluntarily, when a patient agrees to the risk and at a patient's
own risk. This is Federal law surrounding EUAs.

Consequently, you cannot be compelled to take a drug only covered by an
EUA, and **no employer can terminate you for failing to agree to take a
vaccine only covered by an EUA.**

If your termination was ***specifically*** listed as due to you failing
to take the COVID-19 vaccine, you can hire an attorney and sue them for
wrongful termination. Even in a right-to-work state, you can still sue
for wrongful termination. Let's say you were terminated because you are
black. Can the employer say, "Well, it's a right to work state, I can
fire you for any reason"? Of course not, it would be in violation of the
federal Civil Rights Act. This is exactly the same. If they fired you
specifically because you didn't take a vaccine only authorized under an
EUA, they have violated Federal law surrounding vaccines.

If, however, no specific reason was given for your termination (which is
the upshot of working in a "right to work" state), you're going to have
a difficult time proving that you were fired because you didn't take the
shot, unless you have some evidence showing that you were pressured to
take the vaccine with loss of your job, you failed to take the shot, and
then lost your job. If you have such evidence, the advice is the same:
hire an attorney and sue the employer for wrongful termination.

Oregon state law prohibits retaliating against an employee for refusing
to participate in a violation of federal law. Organizations that require
COVID-19 vaccination in violation of federal law may face lawsuits under
these state laws. You cannot be fired because you refused to violate
federal law and take a vaccine against your will when it is only covered
by an EUA.

**TL;DR: Hire an employment attorney in your area and investigate
whether or not you can sue for wrongful termination due to
retaliation.**
