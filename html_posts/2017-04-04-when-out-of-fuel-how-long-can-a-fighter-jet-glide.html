The answer is "it depends." It depends on the fighter, the weight of the
fighter at the time, the ambient air temperature and air pressure, the
current speed of the aircraft at the time it runs out of fuel, and the
current altitude above ground level (AGL).

Every aircraft has what they call an "optimum glide slope" which is the
optimum attitude for the aircraft to be placed in when in an "engine
out" situation. Every pilot trains on the optimum glide slope when you
are out in training and your instructor pulls your throttle all the way
to idle and says, "You just lost your engine." Instincts and muscle
memory take over, and you trim the aircraft for its optimum glide and
start looking for a place to set it down. On the Cessna 172R, we roll
the trim wheel three turns back to trim for engine out.

But it is literally different for every aircraft.

There is a [[glide ratio

use to calculate the optimum glide.
