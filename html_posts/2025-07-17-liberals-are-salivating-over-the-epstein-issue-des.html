Liberals salivate over these things all. the. time. It's always the next
thing that's going to "destroy Trump."

They just don't get it.

Trump is Republican Clinton. He's the new Teflon President. We all said
that Clinton should be called "Slick Willie" because "nothing sticks to
him." And it was true. Nothing stuck to him, really.

Trump is exactly the same. Nothing sticks to him. They can literally
throw anything they want at him. Felony conviction? Check. Sex abuse
scandal? Check. Bullets? Check. Epstein's list? Check. *Nothing sticks
to this man.* And nothing will.

And he's *still* fixing the country *despite* their desire to not do so.

You know, if Dems had *an actual platform* to run on, they might have
something better to do than trying to "destroy Trump," but alas, they
have nothing better to offer besides *more of the same*, and it's clear
that more than half of the country doesn't want *more of the same*.
