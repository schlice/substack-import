What makes you feel like you're being brainwahsed? Are you being
indoctrinated against your will? Because if you don't want to be there,
***don't go***.

The cool thing about this life and the free will that comes along with
it is that if you don't want to believe in the truth of Christianity,
*you are free to reject it*. This ability to make choices---even to
reject the truth---makes us rational creatures and allows us to choose
our own eternal destiny.

And to make sure your choice is truly free, you exist in a world filled
with evidence of God's existence, but without His direct presence, which
would be so overwhelming as to negate your free will.

God has left enough evidence in this life to convince anyone *willing to
believe*, but He has also left just enough ambiguity so as to not coerce
*the unwilling*. That's how much He cares about respecting your free
will.

It's not about evidence. It's about volition.

TL;DR: If you don't want to believe, ***don't.*** No one will force you.
