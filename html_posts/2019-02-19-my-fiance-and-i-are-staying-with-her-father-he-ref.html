**My fiance and I are staying with her father. He refused to let us pay
rent and now, suddenly wants us out within 24 hours and threatened to
move our stuff out when we are working. Is any of this legal?**

Because you and your fiancé agreed to pay rent, you are probably legally
considered to be "tenants," whether or not you actually paid that rent.
If you never paid money and you never agreed to pay money, you're
probably not a tenant, but a guest. But if you agreed to pay money to
stay there, even if you never paid, you are probably a tenant.

But let me look into my crystal ball and see where this is going: if he
does move your stuff out while you're at work, what are you going to do?
Legally, you'll have rights to file a lawsuit for wrongful eviction. A
wrongful eviction lawsuit can be very costly for him. He may have to
repay you for living costs while you were no longer in the house, lost,
stolen, or damaged personal property, pain and suffering, lost time from
work dealing with this, and what the law calls *punitive damages* to
punish him for what he did, especially if he did so maliciously.

That is, of course, if the judge agrees with you and finds that you did
agree to pay rent, making you a tenant instead of a guest.

But let's assume that you're right, and you are found to be a tenant,
and he is found to have wrongfully evicted you. He gets hit with a huge
judgement (which he may or may not be able to pay), and he may lose some
property which he is forced to liquidate in order to repay that
court-ordered debt to you. *Once he is settled up with you, he never
speaks to you or your fiancé again.*

Is that really what you're going for?

You may win in the short term, but are you prepared to accept the
consequences of winning in the long term?

You might just have to bite the bullet and move out. It may be better
that way.
