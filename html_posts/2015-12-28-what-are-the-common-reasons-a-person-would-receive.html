The most common reason for a \"delay\" status is that one of the
agencies with which the NICS system normally communicates did not
respond within the appropriate time. So the request to that agency sits
in a queue, waiting to be processed. The request returns a \"delay\"
status which could turn to a \"deny\" should the delaying agency return
a non-approval status. If the response does not come, but all the other
reporting agencies report an approval status, the delay expires, and the
NICS request is approved.
