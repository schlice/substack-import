While I'm not exactly sure which icon you are referring to, most likely
what you are seeing is the "Orientation Lock" icon. Your iPhone is
locked in Portrait mode, so even if you turn your iPhone sideways while
you watch a YouTube video, the screen will not rotate. This is useful if
you often lay down on your side while you look at your phone, and you
don't want it to rotate to where it will be sideways from how you are
looking at it.

To release the lock (assuming you are running iOS 12 or higher), from
the home screen, drag down from the top right corner. You'll see your
Control Panel (note that if you are running an older version of iOS, you
may need to drag up from the bottom right corner).

If you see the same lock with circle highlighted (as it is in the
example), then your Rotation Lock is enabled. Click that icon to toggle
it off, and when you turn your phone sideways in compatible apps, the
screen will rotate to a Landscape orientation (long-ways) instead of
Portrait orientation (normal tall orientation).
