**I work for a doctor and one of our patients died from an accidental
overdose on a pain medication she prescribed. What happens now?**

What happens is very situation-dependent. If the doctor prescribed the
medication correctly, and the medication was given with all of the
correct warnings regarding proper use of the medication, then most
likely nothing at all will happen. You even said that it was an
"accidental overdose," and doctors are not liable when accidents occur.
Accidents are accidents.

If the doctor did not prescribe the medication correctly, or the doctor
prescribed the wrong dosage, or the doctor did not adequately discuss
the medication with the patient (which we'll really never know), then
there may be some consequences. However, it doesn't sound likely that
anything will come of this, because again, if it truly was an accident,
then nothing should happen.
