**Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said that two important ways to fix pay gap
are to stop asking for salary history and allow salary info to be shared
at work. What do you think about this proposal?**

It would do absolutely nothing to fix the gender pay gap.

First of all, it's already illegal to discriminate on the basis of sex.
The Equal Pay Act of 1963 ensured that men and women with equal skills
will get equal pay.

But the *Paycheck Fairness Act*, which AOC is pushing, won't do anything
to improve pay equality. Instead, it will tightly regulate how employers
compensate their employees (in the name of ensuring "fairness"), which
will do little more than eliminate things like the employer's ability to
tie your compensation with the quality of your work, or your time in
service. It will regulate what employers are allowed to pay employees,
which will only reduce workplace flexibility in pay, which will make pay
worse for everyone.

But hey, if you're a lawyer, you'll love this legislation, because it
will make it much easier for an employee to file a lawsuit alleging
unfair pay practices. So the bill is certainly good for one group of
employees.

So why are we still talking about these things?

Because the "women make 77 cents for every dollar a man makes" trope is
still out there, even though it's been debunked hundreds of times over.

Now, I'm not saying that there aren't dishonest employers who will seek
to underpay their employees every step of the way They do exist, and no
one who logically engages in this discussion supports that. No one truly
believes that a woman should make less than a man simply based on what's
between their legs. That is patently ridiculous.
