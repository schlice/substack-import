Alan Dershowitz, Harvard
law professor &gt;&gt;&gt; Who could agree with this?**</p>
<p>Dershowitz went on to clarify that U.S. residents don\'t have a right to
infect others, and that if they wish to opt-out of vaccination, they
could be given an alternative in which people rejecting the state
mandate could remain in their homes permanently so as not to risk
infecting others.</p>
<p>\"That\'s what a democracy is about,\" he said. \"If the majority of the
people agree and support that, for public health measures, you have to
be vaccinated, you have to be vaccinated. They should give you an
alternative. The alternative is to live in your home, don\'t get
vaccinated, but never ever leave your home or live in a bubble. But if
you want to interact with other people, you cannot become Typhoid Mary.
The Constitution doesn\'t give you the right to spread your illness to
other people.\"</p>
<p>Basically, if a vaccine is developed, and you want to participate in
society, the government has the right to demand you be vaccinated. You
can refuse to be vaccinated, but if a majority of Americans agree, they
can demand that you not participate in society. Basically, like he said,
you don't have a right to spread illness to others. You are under no
obligation to get a vaccine to protect <em>yourself</em> from disease, but you
are indeed obligated to get a vaccine to prevent <em>others</em> from getting a
disease.</p>
<p>The protection of public health permits reasonable actions to prevent
the spread of communicable disease. The case that comes to mind is
[<a href="https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=f18eb9&amp;url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobson_v._Massachusetts"><em>Jacobson v.
Massachusetts</em></a>{.external_link

qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}, and it was decided in
the early 20th century during the smallpox crisis (Dershowitz said
tuberculosis during his interview). <em>Jacobson</em> upheld the authority of
states to enforce compulsory vaccination laws. The Court\'s decision
articulated the view that individual liberty is not absolute and is
subject to the police power of the state. The court reaffirmed its
position in [<a href="https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=38121e&amp;url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zucht_v._King"><em>Zucht v.
King</em></a>{.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}<em>,</em> in which a school was
permitted to deny entrance to a student who had failed to be vaccinated.</p>
<p>If a vaccine is developed, and if the vaccine prevents transmission of a
virus from one person to another, the state can compel your compliance
with the vaccination, or it can exclude you from participation in
society in any way it chooses in order to reasonably protect the public
health.</p>
