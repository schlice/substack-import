You can call and ask. They will *try* to accommodate your request, but
the needs of higher-priority calls will always take precedence.

If you need to have police at a specific location at a specific time for
a specific period of time, you can hire them. Please try to do this as
far in advance as you can, so that they can schedule resources.
