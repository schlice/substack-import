Certainly! They verify its validity by displaying it in their car with a
valid date on it.

With respect to the Fair Housing Act, there are no provisions for
parking. If you are a landlord and someone is parking illegally in a
handicap spot in a lot you own, you call a tow company. Hopefully
you\'ve already contracted with one.

If you feel that a handicap tag is invalid or illegal, it is on you to
contact the DMV or the police. You\'d better hope you\'re right, or you
could be facing charges yourself under ADA.
