When Congress passes a law, they may have an intention in mind. They may
wish the law to do a certain thing, or have a certain effect.

But when it gets through the various writers and legal staff and
everyone else who writes, reviews, and approves the law, it may not say
exactly what they intended it to say.

So let's look at the ruling and what it means.

Arizona passed several new laws, one which required "provisional
ballots" to be completely disregarded if they were submitted to the
wrong precinct, and another which made it a felony to submit another
person's ballot (with limited exceptions). The court found that neither
of these two laws violate Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act.

If Biden and Congress were actually trying to make it legal to submit
provisional ballots in whatever precinct you wanted, rather than your
home precinct, and if they didn't want it to be a felony to submit
someone else's ballot for them, they should have written the law to say
that. However, as Section 2 is written today, and in accordance with
today's ruling, these things do not constitute a denial or a limiting of
voting rights based on race, color, or membership in a language minority
group.

Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, which was initially adopted as an
enforcement mechanism for the 15th Amendment's guarantee that the right
to vote cannot be abridged "on account of race, color, or previous
condition of servitude," allows voters to seek judicial relief if they
believe that a state or local government has denied or limited their
voting rights on the basis of their race, color or membership in a
language minority group. As amended in 1982, Section 2 now provides that
a voting process or requirement that *results in* the abridgment of the
right to vote on account of a voter's race, color or language minority
status is unlawful, whether or not an intent to discriminate can be
proven.[\[2\]](#JRWpz){#cite-JRWpz .citation_link}

**TL;DR:** Congress can go back and amend Section 2 if they actually
wanted to make the law act in the way they desire. But as the law is
written today, the claim that Arizona's voter laws discriminate based on
race was not upheld.

Original question:

Biden has called on congress to fix the damage done by the Supreme Court
voting right's decision. Aren't Supreme Court's decisions final? Wasn't
this legislation attempted with the For the people's act?
