**Does my mother need my signature to finalize a restraining order
against someone for me?**

As with all things legal, the answer is **it depends**.

It sounds like your mother is filing a request for a temporary civil
protection order on your behalf.

In most states, if you are listed on the order as the applicant and you
are over 18, you will likely need to sign yourself, unless your mother
has a power of attorney document which allows her to sign on your
behalf. If you are under 18, in most states, your parent or guardian is
allowed to file on your behalf.

It does vary by state. In California, for example, anyone over 12 is
allowed to file for themselves. You should [[check your
state](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=982fbf&url=http://www.womenslaw.org/laws_state_type.php?statelaw_name%3DRestraining%2520Orders%26state_code%3DGE){.external_link

are for restraining orders.
