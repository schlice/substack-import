**For any reason at all: if a company that produces bulletproof
materials offers to completely bulletproof your truck/car for free,
would you accept the offer, even if you don't live in an area that's
full of violence and prone to theft and vandalism?**

No.

First of all, while it would be *cool* to have a totally bulletproof
vehicle, there are a few disadvantages.

- Bulletproofing, while it would be free, is not *light*. It's heavy. In
  fact, it's *really* heavy. Adding an extra half ton to the vehicle in
  bulletproofing will mess with lots of things in the vehicle:
  performance, acceleration/braking, gas mileage, premature wear on
  components of the car, etc.
- While it might make a cool novelty car, I don't buy cars that just sit
  in my driveway as novelties. I'm not that rich. Every car I own is a
  working vehicle, even if it's just a daily driver. I can't afford to
  fully bulletproof a car and then have to drive it around every day. It
  actually makes the driving experience that much more dangerous. The
  President's bulletproof limousine is built on a *truck* frame, not a
  stretched car frame. My car, built on a *car* frame, can't handle the
  added stresses and will eventually fail, leaving me without a car.

**TL;DR:** While it would be cool, and free, it's unnecessary and not
good for my car.
