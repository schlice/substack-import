I know, coming back to life? It's hard to wrap your head around that.

First of all, while it is unlikely simply because we have never seen it
happen, is it *possible* that someone could come back to life? Yes, of
course it is possible. Because when we say "all men are mortal," we
don't know that for 100% certain. Perhaps someone in the past never
died, or someone in the future may not die. We don't know. We haven't
seen the birth and death of every single person ever. So it is possible
(although certainly very unlikely).

But at the same time, you, unironically, are living in a universe which
exploded into existence out of nothing. You are living on a planet, as
part of ***an entire universe, where that universe and everything in it
exploded into being, out of nothing.***

And whatever caused that universe to come into existence can't be part
of the universe, because you can't be part of what you created, or you'd
have to exist before you existed. So whatever it was that created the
universe must be **outside** of the universe. That means outside of time
(eternal), outside of matter (immaterial), and outside of space and
energy (transcendent). And in order to have created something as
*massive* and *complex* as the universe, it must be extremely powerful
and intelligent.

So, an eternal, transcendent, immaterial, extremely powerful and
intelligent cause of the universe, what does that sound like to you? As
Thomas Aquinas put it, "this is what most people mean by 'God.'"

\

And if God is capable of creating an entire universe, and everything in
it, ***by literally speaking it into existence***, then why does a
trivial matter like resurrection cause you such angst?
