**Does everyone have to do jury duty?**

To answer this question, it's time to employ the old logic trick of
"shoe-on-the-other-foot."

*If you were seated at the defendant's table, how would you feel if you
knew that people were scouring the internet trying to find out how to
get out of jury duty?*

Those jurors are your only hope. Your only hope at a fair and impartial
trial. Your only hedge against government overreach and tyranny.

*And they don't want to be there*.

Is *that* the kind of society you want to live in?

So yes, as a member of a free society which contains a Constitutional
right to a jury **of your peers,** at some point, your peers will have
to make up a jury. And yes, at some point, you may be considered to be a
"peer" of another citizen in your community.

To further clarify, understand that even if you do get called for jury
duty, you may not have to serve. There are, as always, exceptions. For
example, these are some of the recognized disqualifications for people
serving in my local jury:

> Not a Citizen of the United States.
>
> Not Eighteen years of age or older.
>
> Not a resident of Colorado and will NOT return to reside in Colorado
> in the next 12 months. (you still qualify if you are traveling outside
> of the county; seek a postponement instead of a disqualification).
>
> The summons received is not from the county in which you reside.
>
> Inability to read, speak and understand the English language.
>
> Currently serving as a juror OR have served as a selected juror within
> the preceeding twelve months OR scheduled for jury service within the
> next 12 months.
>
> Having a serious physical or mental illness
>
> Having the sole responsibility for the daily care of a permanently
> disabled person living in the same household and do not work outside
> the home.
>
> Breastfeeding a child and temporarily unable to leave the child

You can *postpone* your jury service instead, if you are temporarily
unable to attend on the day you were selected. In my judicial district,
you can ask for **one** postponement per year. Some valid reasons for
postponing your service: business, health, vacation, student, etc.
