**In some US states, planting just a few marijuana plants for your own
use in your basement is legal. Do you think it\'s a good idea to make
this a federal law?**

When you ask yourself one of these questions (about whether or not
something should be federal law), ask yourself the following really
important question:

*Does the Federal government have a compelling interest in imposing a
law on* ***all*** *states?*

Perhaps there is a safety issue. Or perhaps uniformity between states is
the only way a particular thing will work properly.

So: is there a compelling reason that the federal government needs to
tell **all** states to allow marijuana?

The answer, truly, is **no**.

In fact, the Controlled Substances Act, designating controlled
substances at a Federal level, is only useful to determine what
substances can and can not be prescribed by a doctor (since
prescriptions are controlled at a federal level). It's also useful in
controlling what happens *between* states (i.e. what substances can and
can not move between states). It's not useful to *tell* a *state* what
it can and can not do with substances within that state. That should
rightly be left to the state to determine. If all of the residents of a
state vote to allow marijuana, it should be allowed. If the residents
vote to disallow it, it should be disallowed. But this is something
which is best left to states to decide on their own.

Put another way, something which is good for Oregon may not be good for
Illinois. Something which is good for California may not be good for
Texas. You get the point. The United States is *huge* and has a varying
population across its states. The most effective government is at the
state level.

It's also important to note that the Controlled Substances Act currently
makes it a federal crime to possess marijuana. The federal government
(i.e. the FBI and the DEA) can prosecute anyone, in any state, for
possession of marijuana. What states are doing by "legalizing" marijuana
is removing any state penalties for violating the federal law. In other
words, the *state* will not prosecute an individual found to be in
violation of this particular facet of the Controlled Substances Act.
