**Trump is pushing to reopen schools in the US in the fall. The only
known way to ensure an area is free of covid-19, given asymptomatic
carriers, is testing. How will Trump provide the 100 million tests per
day required to reopen schools safely?**

You're absolutely correct. We're doing hundreds of thousands of tests in
a single day, but that's nowhere near the millions of tests per day we
would need to rapidly test everyone. But it's not 100 million, because
if we had the capacity to test 100 million people in a single day, we'd
have testing of the entire population of the United States completed in
one week. There's only 340 million people in the country. So we
definitely need to be able to test millions in a day, but maybe not 100
million.

Regardless, we can't test that many yet, because of a severe shortage of
testing kits, because of an unprecedented shortage of testing chemicals
and supplies. Guess Trump was right and we should have returned
manufacturing to the United States so we didn't have to rely on China
for all of these supplies, eh?

Facing this shortage, scientists are coming up with new ways to test.
One novel approach being looked at is **group tests**. By pooling
samples from many people into a few groups and then evaluating the
groups, scientists think they can test more people with fewer tests. The
strategy has been used in the past to successfully detect cases of HIV,
chlamydia, malaria and influenza, and was originally conceived during
World War II to test thousands of military personnel for syphilis.

If the group tests negative, you can safely move on. If the group tests
positive, you can focus on that group and do contact tracing to find the
actual infections.

Here's an example of how that works:

> Let's say you are examining 100 people, and one of them is positive.
> Normally you would do 100 diagnostic tests, searching for genetic
> material from the virus in each individual. But with group testing,
> you can divide those 100 people into five groups of 20. That gives you
> five pools with 20 samples, and you use one test per pool. If the
> first four sample pools test negative, you have eliminated 80 people
> with four tests. If the last pool tests positive, you retest each
> sample in that last pool individually to identify the one with the
> disease. In the end, you did 25 tests instead of
> 100.[\[1\]](#DnbIj){#cite-DnbIj .citation_link}

This is an attractive option for scientists trying to do more with less.

But there's a catch. Group testing is only effective if the prevalence
of the disease is low. As the prevalence of the disease increases, the
effectiveness of group testing decreases. So in the above example, if
four of the groups show positive, you're still doing 85 tests instead of
25. It's a savings, but as you can see, the more groups that test
positive, the more individual tests you must do.

Scientists believe that testing a relatively asymptomatic population in
this way is a great method to monitor for a second wave, find out what
groups to focus on, and clear groups of people to return to work and
school.
