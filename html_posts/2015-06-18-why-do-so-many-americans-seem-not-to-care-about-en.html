The price of gas is not low. I\'m old enough to remember paying
\$.98/gal for unleaded gas. Yes, I said unleaded, because they were
still selling leaded gas at the time. I know I just dated myself and
someone else is going to tell me that they remember \$.89/gal or
\$.50/gal or something like that. Bottom line is that gas prices are
influenced primarily by the cost of buying crude from OPEC.
Neighborhoods were built with the understanding that everyone had cheap
gas and could drive everywhere they went. Now that people want to
commute by bike more on smaller trips, they can\'t because a \"small\"
trip isn\'t very small anymore, or safe. Neighborhoods need to be
redesigned to allow for this, but that hasn\'t happened yet.\

Houses are built with wood frames because it\'s cheap but still sturdy
enough to meet all code requirements. We\'d love to thermally isolate
all houses, but it\'s just too expensive to do at
scale.]{.rendered_qtext}
