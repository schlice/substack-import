In addition to this, we have the lowest unemployment numbers in four
decades. Blacks and Hispanics have the lowest unemployment ***ever***.

We can argue all day whether or not you think any of these things are
worthwhile, but you didn't ask whether or not they were. You asked why
Trump supporters can't accept the "horrible realities of his
presidency."

These things don't seem all that horrible to Trump supporters.
