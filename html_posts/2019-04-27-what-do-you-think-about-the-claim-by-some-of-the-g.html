**What do you think about the Gold Star Families who, because of Pres.
TRUMPS income tax OVERHAUL, are PAYING ALMOST 4 TIMES the amount of
income tax in 2018 as they did in 2017?**

It's the unintended consequence of trying to make the rich pay their
fair share, something you should be all for.

Here's the context you left out (I also added it to the question for
you):

[[Tax overhaul raises taxes for some Gold Star families on survivor
benefits](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=49db8a&url=https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/24/politics/gold-star-families-higher-taxes/index.html){.external_link

is spot on: the problem is happening to Gold Star families who receive
benefits from both the VA and the DoD. Legally, you can't receive both
at the same time. What some Gold Star families would do is assign their
DoD benefits directly to their children while they are minors (called
the "child option") so that they can continue to receive full benefits
from both the DoD and the VA.

The new tax laws create a "kiddie tax" which taxes unearned income for
children at a higher rate, up to 37%. This was done because some wealthy
families were hiding money in their children\'s names. It is supposed to
be a trust or estate tax, not a tax on death benefits received from the
government, but it seems that children of Gold Star families were
inadvertently swept up in the tax law, forced to pay the 37% rate, as
well as back taxes.

To be clear, it was **not** designed to impact Gold Star families. This
was an unintended consequence, and the government is working to rectify
this situation for Gold Star families.
