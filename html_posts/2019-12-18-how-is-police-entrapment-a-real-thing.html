**How is police entrapment a real thing?**

Entrapment steps over the line when it convinces an *otherwise
law-abiding person* to commit a crime. Police engaging in undercover
stings must be extremely careful to not cross that line.

Let's say, for example, you live in an area where marijuana is illegal.
An undercover police officer approaches a suspected drug dealer and asks
to buy marijuana. At this point, if the person sells the marijuana, it's
not entrapment, because normal non-criminals are expected to resist
doing something illegal when they are simply asked to do so.

But let's say that the undercover police officer tells the suspected
drug dealer that he needs the marijuana to treat a medical condition.
This might sway an otherwise law-abiding citizen to violate the law in
order to ease the suffering of his fellow man. This behavior could be
considered entrapment, because it could be argued that an otherwise
law-abiding person could be persuaded to break a law by the desire to
ease someone's pain and suffering.

This is just one example of how police entrapment could be a real thing.
