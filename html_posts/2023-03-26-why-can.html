Why do you need that? Do you need God to float down from heaven on a big
cloud with thundering trumpets and angels singing praises and for God to
zap all the evil with His lightning-bolt fingers? Will you believe then?

The problem with that scenario is that if God does that, *what choice do
you have* ***but*** *to believe that He exists?* That doesn't sound like
free will, does it. Because then even the unbelievers will believe.

Here's a little hint: *God doesn't want unbelievers.* God wants
believers. God wants those who *haven't* seen Him, and yet still
believe. He wants people who see the evidence all around them and
believe in Him without His direct presence compelling their belief.

Let's also be clear: one day, everyone will believe. One day, every knee
will bow and every tongue will confess that Jesus is Lord (cf Phil
2:9--11). You may not want to, but eventually you'll believe. But those
who were compelled to believe will not be saved. Those who did not
freely accept Jesus *while they had the opportunity to do so* will not
be saved. Even the demons believe in God; they just affirmatively reject
Him. Unbelievers will share their fate.
