I love how you just casually threw that out there, as if it's an option
that Hamas just hasn't considered.

"It's easy, Hamas! All you have to do is stop being bad!"

Except *Hamas can't stop being bad. Being bad is in their nature, in
their charter.*

It's literally on their website. Their goal is the complete eradication
of the state of Israel and all Jews.

\

Hypothetically speaking (because there is no way this is happening in
reality), ***IF*** Hamas agreed to peacefully coexist with Israel, the
conflict would end the same day.

But that's a really big IF, because **Hamas doesn't want to agree to
peaceful coexistence.**
