**My landlord says he's charging me extra next month because there was a
noise complaint against me. Can he do that?**

You will need to review your lease and find out if there is a clause in
there in which the landlord can fine you for noise complaints.

If there is, then yes, he can charge you that particular fine because of
a noise complaint.

If there is nothing in your lease about fines for noise complaints, then
he cannot.

Check your local area for free legal help or tenants rights groups. You
should be able to show them your lease to get help understanding it.
