There really aren't any signs of Guinea worm disease (GWD) until the
person begins to become symptomatic. A person infected by GWD can be
symptom free for up to a year while the larvae gestate. A few days
before the worms emerge, the person may develop a fever and redness and
swelling in the area where the worms begin to appear.

When the worms are ready to emerge, a blister will develop. These
blisters can be created anywhere, but are usually in the legs and feet.
The blisters cause a very painful burning sensation, which immersion in
water usually helps to alleviate. The blisters will burst within 24 to
72 hours.

The immersion also causes the worm to appear from the wound and release
a milky white substance into the water, which contains millions of
larvae, contaminating the water and repeating the cycle.

Guinea worm disease affects poor, rural communities which do not have
access to clean drinking water. It has been categorized as a "neglected
tropical disease," one of the first slated to be eradicated. In 1986,
there were 3.5 million cases of GWD; in 2014, there were 126.
