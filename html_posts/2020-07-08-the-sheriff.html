**The sheriff\'s office left me a voicemail, saying he had paperwork for
me to fill out. What does this mean?**

This probably means that he has paperwork for you to fill out.

The only ways you can find out what this means:

- Call them back
- Go in

I'd suggest you cal them back and find out what this is all about. If
they're evasive and cagey with you, maybe tell them "no thanks" and tell
them that if they want you to fill out the paperwork, have a process
server serve it to you and then return it to them via certified mail.

Maybe they tell you that it's something you submitted to them a long
time ago. Maybe they got a complaint about you and they want your side
of the story. Ultimately, you'll never know what it's all about until
you call them.
