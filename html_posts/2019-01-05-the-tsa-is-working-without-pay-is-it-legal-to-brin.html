**The TSA is working without pay. Is it legal to bring cash to the
airport and tip them? They are protecting our lives.**

It's not illegal to give money to someone, unless you're paying for
something illegal.

However, it's not really a great idea to give money to a TSA agent.

Besides potentially showing impropriety (i.e. they're letting your
little pocket knife slip through because you paid them), because TSA is
a federal agency, there are massive rules about federal agents receiving
gifts. It's usually not allowed.
