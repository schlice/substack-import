**How can I purchase a car with suspended license but have driving
privelages \[sic\]?**

You don't need a license to buy a car. It certainly helps (it's hard to
do a test drive from the passenger seat), but it's not mandatory.

You do have to have insurance for the car, or be able to get insurance,
but a driver's license is not required to buy a car.
