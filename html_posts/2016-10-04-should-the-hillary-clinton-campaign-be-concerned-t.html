Yes, it is indeed a trap. Hillary's gonna get caught up in it, and it's
a total non-starter, and here's why:

1.  The tax returns were most likely obtained illegally. No one who had
    legal authority to release them has stated that they have done so,
    so it's most likely that someone who did not have legal authority to
    release them, did so. This is yet another indication that the
    mainstream media has totally abandoned all pretense of impartiality
    and are wholly in the tank for Hillary. Remember the University of
    East Anglia? That's where the emails were that exposed global
    warming as an elaborate hoax. But the New York Times had too much
    "journalistic integrity" to publish those because they were the
    fruits of an illegal hack (another reason the left can continue to
    claim that global climate change is a real man-made thing, because
    those emails came from a *hack*). But these private tax returns,
    which are also clearly illegal (or at least not clearly legal) are
    published before the ink is dry on the manila envelope they were
    found in? Nope, totally in the tank for Hillary. It's not even a
    question any more, as in if you still believe the media is unbiased,
    you've been living under a rock for the past 20 years. Eventually,
    the illegality of them will catch up, and Trump will use it to
    highlight, again, exactly what lengths the Clinton camp (and their
    media arm, the New York Times) will go to in order to try to
    discredit him.
2.  It highlights the fact that Trump is not a political insider. He has
    not structured his tax returns to look good under public scrutiny,
    as **every other politician** has done, including Hillary. His tax
    returns read as a businessman's tax returns do, not as a
    politician's do.
3.  The big story with the taxes is not the fact that \$918 million was
    written off. It's that *no laws were broken*. No one is alleging
    that Trump did anything illegal. As in, move along folks, *nothing
    to see here*
4.  It's also **well known** that Trump lost all kinds of money during
    that period of time. As a matter of fact, the New York Times (yes,
    the very same birdcage-liner that published the illegally-obtained
    returns) [[wrote a
    story](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=bcebda&url=http://www.nytimes.com/1995/10/25/nyregion/crowning-the-comeback-king.html){.external_link
    rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
    onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
    qt-tooltip="nytimes.com"}]{.qlink_container} in 1995 praising Trump
    for losing all that money and then returning to wealth. A quick
    quote from that article:\
    \
    *After the collapse of the real estate market of the 1980\'s, Mr.
    Trump\'s company was left holding some \$8.8 billion in debt,
    causing his personal net worth to drop to a low of about \$1 billion
    in the red by 1991.\*
    \
    Writing off huge losses is something that you would expect a
    business owner to be doing during this period of time. They called
    him "the Comeback Kid" and that piece actually inspired Trump to
    write his book, "The Art of the Comeback."
5.  Hillary is trying to profit off of the returns, but she failed to
    remember that both she and the New York Times have used the same
    provision in the tax code that Trump did. Carrying over a loss to
    the next tax year is part of the tax code, and not only is not a
    crime, but everyone has done it, including Hillary and the New York
    Times.
6.  And seriously, if Hillary can dismiss Benghazi, leaking classified
    information by using a private email server, destroying evidence,
    pay-to-play, and silencing Bill's side chicks as "no big deal," then
    this is by far really no big deal at all. Look, a tax return.
    Nothing illegal on it.

Much ado about nothing.
