Not unless he also plans on ripping up the Constitution.

Federal police officers cannot enforce state law, only federal law. So
unless he plans on abolishing all states and making one "United State of
America" with one American Police Force, then the states will continue
to enforce their own laws.

The FBI does not enforce state law. only federal law.

By the way, Trump has never stated, ever, that he planned on ripping up
the Constitution. In fact, he greatly respects the police and will
likely increase his support of them rather than tearing them down.

It would have been a Democratic president who would have been more
likely to abolish the states in favor of the Federal government than
someone like Trump who at least leans Republican.
