While I can see your leading question, it actually has real answers.

1.  Azerbaijan. Purchased in May, 2021. Protects from rockets from
    Armenia.
2.  South Korea. A few months after Azerbaijan's system, South Korea
    announced a purchase of their own to defend against North Korea.
3.  United States. We have purchased our own version of the Iron Dome
    here in the US, based on the same Tamir missiles used in Israel. But
    it doesn't look like we're going to take delivery, as it appears
    that Israel needs those missiles.
