There are not multiple versions of the Bible. There are multiple
translations of the Bible, and translation, as a matter of course,
alters words. *How* the translation is done is the reason why there are
so many different types of translations.

To understand this, you must understand that there is not a "one-to-one"
correlation between languages. For example, Hebrew has fewer words than
English. Therefore, many words in Hebrew have multiple meanings. It's up
to the translator to pick the correct word in English to express what
the original author was trying to say in Hebrew. Similarly, there are no
fewer than six different words for "love" in Greek (familial love,
platonic love, love between dear friends, erotic love, etc.), but in
English, we only have "love."

Therefore, when creating a Bible translation, you can either stick very
closely to the original words, but you may have a hard time
understanding the meaning of what the original author was trying to say,
or you can reproduce what the author was trying to say, and stick less
closely to the original words.

Translations which stick very closely to the words are called "word for
word" translations. They will very closely retain fidelity to the
original words used, but some of the original meaning may be "lost in
translation." To try to account for this, some translations will use a
"thought for thought" method of translating. The translator will read a
sentence and then re-write it in the target language, trying to retain
the original words as often as possible, but will more frequently try to
retain the original thought that a person reading it in the source
language would have understood. Finally, translators may take a
"paraphrase" method of translation, where translators will read an
entire passage and re-state it in the target language, without concern
to the original words, solely trying to "paraphrase" the original idea.
As you move from "word for word" translations towards "paraphrase"
translations, the translations become more easily understandable and
easier to follow along (in fact, some of the paraphrase translations,
like *The Message*, read like a novel), but retain less fidelity to the
original words used.

Here's a handy graph of many of the current translations and where they
fall on that spectrum:
