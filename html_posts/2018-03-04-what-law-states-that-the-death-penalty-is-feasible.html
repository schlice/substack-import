**What law states that the death penalty is feasible in certain states
of America?**

State law is written by states, and only states determine whether or not
they will institute a death penalty.

There is no federal law that allows states to pass certain laws. There
are some federal bans on some items which have been incorporated to the
states. There is no federal ban on states passing laws instituting death
penalties for crimes in those states.
