**Is it safe to play porn games? Will the FBI, police, or CIA go to your
house if you do such things?**

Since it's not illegal to play porn games (unless someone can show me
where it is a crime to do so) unless you're underage, then no, no one is
going to do anything at all.

The worst that could happen would be that if the website was not taking
adequate precautions to ensure that only those of legal age play their
games, then the website operator could be the target of an
investigation, not the random thousands on the Internet who might play
it.
