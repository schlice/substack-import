There is no valid answer to that question. If it was that easy, there
would only be one religion, because it would be blatantly obvious which
one was the true religion.

Every person, who holds any particular faith, always says the same
thing: my religion is the only religion, and every other religion is
false. No one says anything otherwise, or else their faith is
meaningless. Even the atheists can be considered to be a religion,
because they behave in exactly the same way. They believe that their way
is the only right way, and everybody else is wrong.

As long as there is freedom of opinion, there will always be more than
one religion.

That said, I will tell you one thing that you can use to help you
determine for yourself how you should believe.

All world religions, except one, involve you seeking God. One religion,
only one, involves God seeking you.

All of world religions, except one, involve you doing something to gain
your salvation. One religion, only one, offers you your salvation
freely, as a gift that\'s already been paid for. All you have to do is
accept it. You don\'t have to do anything special in order to get it.

That one religion, so unique amongst all of the world\'s religions,
might be something worth looking into.

How can I tell which religion is the true religion, since the existence
