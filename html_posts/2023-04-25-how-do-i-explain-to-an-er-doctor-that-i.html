You say, "I'm having an MS exacerbation and I need solumedrol via IV."

The true answer is that while you'll be able to (eventually) convince
them of the former, you won't be able to tell them that you need
corticosteroids. They will have to come to that conclusion on their own.

Therefore, you should prepare now for the eventuality that you'll need
to explain to an emergency room doctor that you have MS.

*But how do you do that?* You should have copies of your MRIs with you
at all times, copies of the radiologist readings from your MRIs, and
copies of your neurologist's medical records (or online access to them).
Clearly, you don't want to spend your life lugging around either films
or CDs, so you'll need to be able to electronically save those things.

*But how do you do* ***that****?* What I have done is created "ISO
images" of my CDs from my MRIs. The name ISO was taken from the name of
the file system used by optical media, which is usually ISO 9660. You
can think of an ISO image as a complete copy of everything stored on a
physical optical disc like CD, DVD, or Blu-ray disc---including the file
system itself. They are a sector-by-sector copy of the disc, and no
compression is used. The idea behind ISO images is that you can archive
an exact digital copy of a disc, and then later use that image to burn a
new disc that's in turn an exact copy of the original.

Think of ISO images as a pile of wet sand. You take an object and press
it down into the sand, and it leaves an "image" behind. Fill that image
with wax or latex and you can re-create the object using the image. ISO
images work the same way.

Additionally, software exists which allows you to load an ISO image into
a virtual CD drive and simply read it as if it was already written to a
CD.

You can use free (donationware) software such as
[[ImgBurn](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=9fe271&url=https://www.imgburn.com/){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="imgburn.com"}]{.qlink_container} to create ISOs from your
CDs or DVDs with your MRIs on them. Don't have your DVDs? Every time you
get an MRI, you should get a DVD with your images on it. They didn't
hand you one? Ask for one! They will burn one for you in just a few
minutes. Then, using a computer with a physical DVD drive (which is
becoming rarer and rarer these days), you can take an ISO image of the
DVD.

Now, take all those ISO images and load them out to your favorite cloud
storage provider (Google Drive, OneDrive, etc). Now you always have your
MRI CDs everywhere you go! I also store the radiologist reports out
there. I have about 15 years of MRIs and radiologist reports stored in
my Google Drive, and can share them anywhere as needed. I also have
online access to my neurologist's notes and reports, and can also grant
that access as needed.

Once the ER doc realizes you have MS, they should do a neurology consult
to determine how best to help you. Expect this to take some time in the
ER.

Ultimately they will help you, but it may take some time for them to
come to the correct conclusion regarding the help you need.
