Normal white blood cell count is between 0 and 5. Abnormally high WBC
count in CSF usually means inflammation or infection or bleeding. Some
potential causes:

- Abscess
- Encephalitis
- Hemorrhage
- Meningitis
- Multiple Sclerosis
- Other infections
- Tumor
- Neurosarcoidosis[\[1\]](#zPAtX){#cite-zPAtX .citation_link}

This is why your doctor is potentially investigating whether or not your
symptoms are caused by MS.
