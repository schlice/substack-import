**Is it illegal for an 18-year-old to have sex with a minor?**

Yes. This is a crime called **statutory rape.** It is a crime because it
is universally accepted that minors do not have the mental capacity to
consent to sex.

However, in some states, there are "close-in-age" exceptions which state
that if the two participants are within a certain number of years apart,
they won't be charged with statutory rape. This is an exception designed
to exempt a minor couple from statutory rape charges when the law is
designed to target older adults taking advantage of the less-developed
mental capacity of minors. Check the laws in your state to see what
kinds of exemptions it may contain.

There is also a "marriage exemption" in some states which allow minors
to marry adults (with parents' permission). In such a circumstance,
statutory rape does not apply.
