**Content:** [First thing first: turn off the pool filter. You don\'t
want the mercury making it into the pool filter, or you\'ll likely have
to replace the entire filtration system.\
\
The good thing here is that the spill is contained (within the pool, but
contained nonetheless). As long as you turn off your filter, the spill
can remain contained. The EPA will assist with the cleanup.\
\
Next, according to the US EPA website:\

\
The EPA will ensure that the spill receives the appropriate
investigation, and it will likely not be conducted by your local police
department, so 911 is still not the appropriate number to call.
