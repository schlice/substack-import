**Can an HOA force you to sell your home due to non-owner occupancy
requirements?**

An HOA cannot "force you to sell your home."

An HOA can fine you for violating the Covenants or the Rules. If you
fail to pay your fines, the HOA can place a lien on your home, which
means you can't refinance or sell until that lien is cleared. The home
becomes the collateral for the fines, as the HOA has an ownership
interest in the property. Behind the primary mortgage holder, the HOA is
next in line.

If the lien goes unpaid for too long, the lienholder can **foreclose**
on that lien, and they can sell the collateral used in the lien to pay
their outstanding debt. This is a drastic step, and it means that
negotiations have failed or have broken down, and this usually takes
well over a year and a very large sum of money owed (including
attorney's fees and late fees) before the HOA would even consider
foreclosing.

As an alternative, the HOA may consider sending the delinquent account
to collections, but they are under no obligation to do so unless it is
written into the Covenants or the Bylaws of your HOA.
