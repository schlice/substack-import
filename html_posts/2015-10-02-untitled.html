**Content:** [In 2011, 8583 murders were committed in the United States.
That is indeed a sad fact. But over 15,000 people die from alcoholic
liver disease in our country every year. The number for "alcohol-induced
deaths, excluding accidents and homicides" is over 25,000. According to
the Council on Alcoholism & Drug Abuse, almost 16,000 people a year are
killed by drunk drivers.\
\
Let\'s not stop there. A considerable amount of all crime in the United
States, not just murders, are a direct result of alcohol abuse. And how
many cases of physical, emotional, and sexual abuse occur each year
because of alcohol? Would you say that maybe half of the gun crimes in
this country potentially involved alcohol?\
\
Why do you campaign so hard to remove guns from society, yet you ignore
the utter blight inflicted on society by alcohol?\
\
The health benefits of wine were reported in an epidemiological study
that showed nothing more than correlation, and as you know, correlation
does not equal causation. There was never any causation that showed that
drinking wine reduced heart disease or increased overall health in any
meaningful way. And because your body has the ability to remove toxins
does not make it \"perfectly safe\" to \"intoxicate\" yourself (which
literally means to introduce toxins).\
\
What I\'m trying to say here is that plain reason should show that any
attempt to ban firearms should logically be preceeded by a ban on
alcohol. Alcohol is far more destructive to people, families, and
communities than guns can ever be, and any perceived benefits of alcohol
pale in comparison to the massive destruction to society that it has
caused. And any objection to such a position can only reasonably come
down to, \"but I like alcohol and I hate guns.\"\
\
My right to own a gun can at least defend me from others who own guns.
Can my right to own whiskey do anything to prevent me getting killed by
a drunk driver?\
\
I\'m not trying to deflect. I\'m just trying to show you that your
various political viewpoints are contradictory.\
\
So let me ask again: if you\'re going to ban one of two items, wouldn\'t
you ban the one that is more dangerous? Especially when the
less-dangerous item is protected by the Constitution?]{.rendered_qtext}
