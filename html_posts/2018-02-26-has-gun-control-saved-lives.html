**What is the lives saved by guns by civilians vs. life's taken by
guns?**

Make sure you ask the question correctly. Of the 33,000 deaths per year
involving guns, roughly 2/3 of those are suicides. Should we count
those?

Let's assume we're smart and we don't count those. Of the remaining
11,000, about 8,000 of them were criminal killing other criminals while
committing crimes. The remaining 3,000 includes 1,000 killed in police
activity, and 2,000 which are true homicides not involving multiple
criminals or criminal activity, and accidents.

So if we're honest, we're only looking at roughly 2,000 people a year
killed in true violence or accidents.

We know, even by the most stringent estimates, that about 40,000 crimes
a year are stopped with a gun, most of them stopped without a single
shot being fired. The mere presence of a gun stops the crime.
Realistically, that's closer to somewhere between 800,000 and 1 million,
but most of those are never reported because no shots were fired, so no
crime is reported.
