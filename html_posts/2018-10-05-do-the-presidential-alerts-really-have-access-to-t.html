**Do the Presidential alerts really have access to the E911 chip in your
phone?**

While there may be some problems with privacy concerns and E911,
Presidential Alerts are not the problem.

John McAfee got it wrong.

Sorry John, but this is simply not accurate.

The Wireless Emergency Alert (WEA) system is the same one that sends you
severe weather alerts and AMBER alerts. The Presidential Alert has never
been used, and has never been tested until just recently.

It basically functions like an advanced text message. It can get through
when other applications are using your phone.

But to be sure, it's a one-way message. It sends nothing back.

Additionally, your phone doesn't have an "E911" chip. You do have a GPS
chip in your phone, and in the future, E911 systems will be able to see
your GPS location when you call 911. Most 911 centers don't have this
functionality, and most carriers haven't enabled the 911 interface to
allow dispatchers to see the GPS data on your phone when you call 911
yet. It's in the works, but not rolled out yet.

And as I mentioned, while there are indeed privacy concerns about your
GPS chip and its utilization by law enforcement, they have absolutely
zero to do with Presidential Alerts. When WEA is activated, it sends a
text message to your phone. That's literally it.
