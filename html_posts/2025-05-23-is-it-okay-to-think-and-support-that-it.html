It's literally okay to think anything you like, in the sense of you are
human, and you have a right to your opinion.

But if we're going to talk about **objective reality**, the US doesn't
have anything close to what we call "regimes."

If you take just the *base* definition of a "regime," and you squint
real hard and turn your head a little, you *might* be able to justify
your belief that the US has a "regime." I mean, the base definition of a
"regime" is "a governing body, especially one that is authoritarian or
tyrannical." Does President Trump sometimes give the *appearance* that
he somehow runs the entire government, and does so in what one might
perceive to be an *authoritarian* way? Sure, I can understand how you
might think that.

But if you look **more closely** at what makes a regime, you start to
see that it is actually Cuba which fits the definition of a regime much
more closely than the US. A regime often implies a system of government
that is not based on democratic principles, such as a one-party system,
a dictatorship, or a military junta.

- The US is a primarily two-party Constitutional democratic republic
  which has experienced 245 years of peaceful transitions of power to a
  duly-elected administration. The US has an independent (some might
  claim "hostile") media, and it protects the fundamental rights and
  freedoms of its citizens.
- Cuba\'s political system is characterized by a single-party communist
  government led by the Communist Party of Cuba. This system does not
  allow for political opposition or independent media, and it restricts
  fundamental rights and freedoms.

Which one sounds more like a regime?

\

Then, you say that the reason you believe the US is a "regime" is
because they have imposed sanctions against Cuba. The United States
maintains a comprehensive economic embargo against Cuba, primarily due
to historical issues, concerns over human rights, and the Cuban
government\'s communist ideology. The embargo was initiated in 1960,
primarily as a response to the Cuban Revolution and the nationalization
of US assets. It aims to exert pressure on the Cuban government to
change its policies, including its human rights record and international
behavior.

The embargo stemmed from the Cuban Revolution in 1959, which led to the
overthrow of the U.S.-backed government of Fulgencio Batista and the
establishment of a communist regime under Fidel Castro. The Cuban
government then immediately nationalized U.S.-owned properties without
adequate compensation, further escalating tensions.

The U.S. has long expressed concerns about human rights abuses in Cuba,
including restrictions on freedom of speech and assembly. The U.S. has
viewed Cuba\'s communist government as a threat to its interests and the
interests of its allies. The U.S. has also cited Cuba\'s involvement in
regional conflicts and its support for other communist governments as
reasons for the embargo.

So unless and until those things change, the US will keep its trade
embargo against Cuba in place.

So maybe you should talk to Miguel Díaz-Canel and get Cuba to improve
their behavior if they really want trade with the US to resume.

\

TL;DR: Can you believe that the US is a regime? Can you call for "regime
change" (á la the Cuban Revolution) and the installation of a communist
government to get trade to resume? Of course you can! You are free to
believe whatever you like!

But is there a *snowball's chance in Hell* that it will actually happen?
Nope. Not at all.
