I would venture to say that many theists haven't really thought about it
all that much. But if they had, they would agree with you: the Bible
doesn't prove the existence of God.

But that's because, primarily, it was never designed to do that. You can
prove God's existence without ever referencing the Bible or any religion
at all.

The purpose of the Bible is to tell a story. It's a story in three main
acts:

1.  Paradise
2.  Paradise Lost
3.  Paradise Regained

The bulk of the Bible centers around explaining #2, whereas #1 takes up
only two chapters of the book of Genesis, and #3 takes up the last two
chapters of Revelation.

TL;DR: The Bible was never designed to prove God's existence. You do
that *first*, and *then* you read the Bible.
