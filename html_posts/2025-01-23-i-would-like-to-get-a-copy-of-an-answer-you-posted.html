I recall answering this question once, but I can't seem to find it at
the moment. So I suppose I'll just answer it again.

**Yes**, a Homeowner's Association can indeed charge an owner for damage
done to common areas.

When homeowners use common areas, they accept liability for any damage
done during the time they are using that common area. So, for example,
let's assume you have a recreation room in your HOA (possibly in an
activity center). Let's also say you, as the homeowner, reserve the room
for a party. If the HOA comes in the next day and finds the room
damaged, they can charge the homeowner the cost to repair the room.
Presumably, the HOA also has cameras which have documented the damage
being done, but the HOA can hold the reserving homeowner responsible if
damage occurs during the time they have the room reserved.

For common areas where responsibility is less clear-cut, the HOA would
have a difficult time assigning liability to a particular homeowner
unless they have some form of evidence to show who damaged the area and
what damage was done.

Assuming the HOA has a reasonable basis to hold a homeowner liable for
damage, the HOA will most likely hire their own maintenance people to
repair the damage, the HOA will pay for the repairs, and the HOA will
add the cost to the homeowner's payment account (the same one where HOA
dues and fines go). This is the most common way for the HOA to address
the issue.

If you have been charged by the HOA for damage done to a common area,
and you are not necessarily liable for that damage, you should retain a
real estate attorney in your local area who specializes in HOA law to
help you work the issue with the HOA.

(EDIT) Additionally, if there is no one homeowner to whom fault can be
assigned, the HOA can pass the cost on to **all** of the homeowners,
assuming that the damage falls outside of the HOA's projections for
routine maintenance and upkeep of the facility. For example, if a water
line breaks and floods the common area, the HOA may have budgeted enough
for standard maintenance but not catastrophic loss, and they may have to
do a special assessment to collect the money to pay for the damages.
