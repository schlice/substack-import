Let me explain where the "gun show loophole" comes from. The term was
coined from news reports which were discussing how people could buy and
sell guns "at a gun show" without a background check. The overall title
the media gave to this practice was "the gun show loophole," though it
has little to do with a gun show, and it's not actually a loophole.

As all of these answers correctly stated, the sellers in a gun show are
licensed dealers, and they will do background checks on every person who
buys a gun, period.

But the gun show itself is a marketplace where buyers and sellers come
together, *and they don't necessarily have to be on opposite sides of
the table*.

Let's say I'm attending a gun show. I'm not a gun dealer, just an
ordinary citizen attending a gun show. I'm walking around and I see a
guy looking at an M4 for sale. I tap him on the shoulder, and I say,
"Hey, I happen to have an M4 out in my car, and I'll sell it to you for
\$100 less than this guy." He says okay, we leave the gun show, walk out
to my car, and I sell him the M4. No background check, all cash.
*Perfectly legal*.

Why?

The gun show sales are **dealer sales** from FFL-licensed dealers. They
are required to perform background checks, and they do.

The sale out at my car is a **private sale**. In most states, background
checks are not required for private sales (that is, if I, as a
non-dealer \[which means someone not "in the business" of selling guns\]
sell a gun). This was a compromise put in place when the National
Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) was implemented. Private
sales were exempted from the requirement for background checks. This
also means this is not a "loophole." A loophole is a process which
follows the law but does not meet the ends envisioned for the law. This
is a specific exemption which was put in place when the law was enacted.
It's not a loophole; it's the law functioning as designed.

So let's recap. Is the "gun show loophole" real? Well, it doesn't
actually happen in a gun show (it happens away from a gun show), and
it's not a loophole (the law is functioning as designed).

For those reasons, the "gun show loophole" is nothing but fake news.
It's a made-up propaganda piece. It's vaporware. It doesn't exist.
