**Can I donate blood if I am on Ocrevus?**

First of all, let's make sure we fully understand. People with MS in
general have been approved to donate blood since 2007. If you're
otherwise healthy, on a treatment, and your MS is under control, you
should be able to donate blood at any Red Cross blood donation location.
Of course, you'll need to meet all the other blood donor requirements:
be at least 17, be in good health, and weigh at least 110 pounds (49.89
kg). Also, while the Red Cross allows persons with MS to donate blood,
some individual donation centers may still reject you.

As for medications, in almost all cases, medication will not disqualify
you from donating blood; the underlying reason you're taking medication
might.

Currently, the only MS medication which prevents you from donating blood
is Aubagio (teriflunomide). You must wait two years after your last dose
before you can donate blood.
