**What sort of criminal liability is Donald Trump exposed to because of
alleged misspending on his inauguration?**

Despite what all the conservative pundits will tell you, there is some
(albeit limited) criminal exposure for the president.

A paper from the Justice Department, *Federal Prosecution of Election
Offenses*, spells out the criminal liability which a candidate can face
for violating the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 (FECA), 52
U.S.C. §§ 30101--30146, as amended:

> FECA contains its own criminal sanctions, which provide that, to be a
> crime, a FECA violation must have been committed knowingly and
> willfully and, except for campaign misrepresentations and certain
> coerced contributions, must have involved at least \$2,000 in a
> calendar year. 52 U.S.C. § 30109(d). FECA crimes aggregating \$25,000
> or more are five-year felonies, and those that involve illegal conduit
> contributions and aggregate over \$10,000 are two-year felonies. 5 2
> U.S.C. § 30109(d)(1)(A), (D). Moreover, all criminal violations of
> FECA are subject to U.S. Sentencing Guideline § 2C1.8, that the United
> States Sentencing Commission promulgated in response to a specific
> Congressional directive.

> FECA violations that either: (1) do not present knowing and willful

> Election Commission (FEC) under the statute's civil enforcement

> Finally, FECA violations that result in false information being

> (conspiracy to disrupt and impede a federal agency), 18 U.S.C. § 1001
> (false statements within the jurisdiction of a federal agency), 18
> U.S.C. § 1505 (obstruction of agency proceedings), or 18 U.S.C. § 1519
> (creation of false records in relation to or contemplation of federal

Therefore, in order for Trump himself to be criminally liable (and we're
talking about Cohen's payments to the porn stars being illegal campaign
contributions), Trump would have had to know that the contributions were
illegal. This means that someone would have had to tell him, "Hey boss,
this violates campaign finance laws," and he would have to have said, "I
don't care, do it anyway." Or words to that effect.

If he didn't know it was a violation, it's not a criminal action, but a
civil action. Obama's campaign violated these laws by failing to report
some campaign contributions and paid over \$300,000 in fines for
non-criminal violations of the law.
