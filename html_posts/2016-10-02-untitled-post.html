The phrase conveys exactly enough information to prejudge the situation
without knowing any of the pertinent facts.

The two most important things to remember

1.  **Unless you're attempting to inject the pretense of racial bias,
    there is no need to indicate any of the races of any of the people
    involved.** Race has no bearing on whether or not an individual is
    dangerous. In fact, it is well-established that police are more
    likely to shoot whites than blacks, and it is also well established
    that white police officers are less inclined to shoot blacks than
    black or Hispanic police officers. There is little to no evidence
    that race plays any part at all in who gets shot by police.
2.  **"Unarmed" does not equal "not dangerous."** There are plenty of
    situations in which unarmed individuals can legally be stopped with
    lethal force. For example, persons who are not in a stable mental
    state can cause serious bodily harm to police or to bystanders
    without being armed. Also, people who are on drugs can cause death
    or serious bodily harm, and are virtually immune to pain compliance
    techniques (i.e. Tasers).\
    \
    Remember, police do not shoot to kill, nor do they shoot to "not
    kill." Police shoot to stop a threat. If they are allowed to use
    lethal force (which is something determined by a court afterwards),
    they shoot until the threat is stopped. The threat must be
    "objectively reasonable," which means that we can't review the
    situation from the lens of hindsight; we must review the situation
    from the officer's point of view, at the time of the incident. How
    much information did the officer have? What factors did he use to
    make his judgement on whether or not the person was a threat? What
    did he know at the time, not what should he have known?
