**Why did President Trump repeal the Obama-era clean water rule?**

First of all, you're watching too much mainstream media.

Second, the pre-Obama Clean Water Act is still in effect. Trump only
rolled back Obama's changes to the Act.

Obama's additions to the Clean Water Act took a good regulation and
stretched it way too far, giving the EPA control over more than just
water. It gave the Federal government control over vast amounts of dry
land by adding terms such as "adjacent waters" and "tributaries" to
Clean Water Act coverage. It allowed the EPA to control things like
seasonal streams, farm irrigation ponds, roadside ditches and even
"connective" dry lands that can turn into "shallow wetlands" when it
rains.

The government's position at the time said that tributaries and adjacent
waters can flow downhill into larger bodies of water, and so the smaller
adjacent waters must also be regulated.

However, Obama's move constituted a massive power grab for the EPA, and
great uncertainty for farmers and landowners over virtually any land
which gets wet. Farmers, ranchers, real-estate developers and pretty
much anyone who owned more than an acre of land had to be worried about
violating the new rules because it was impossible to know if, for
example, the presence of a pond, or even a seasonal pond, on that land
wouldn't bring the EPA down on you. And the federal government is not
shy about imposing multimillion-dollar fines on farmers just for plowing
fields that they determine actually contained "seasonal wetlands."

Ever since Obama made the changes, they were the subject of state-level
lawsuits. Federal district courts stopped Obama's rules from taking
effect in roughly half of the states in the US anyway. Trump reversed
Obama's changes to the Clean Water Act, which were enacted by Executive
Order, and so were reversed by Executive Order, returning some sanity to
government.
