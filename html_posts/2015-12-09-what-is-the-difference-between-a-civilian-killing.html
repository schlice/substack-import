The only difference between the two is the process by which
investigations happen.

The cop has to go through more investigation that the civilian does. The
District Attorney will review the shooting and will determine whether or
not charges will be brought. Even when the DA finds that the shooting
was in self-defense and chooses not to press charges, the cop will face
an internal Use of Force (UOF) review, whereby the cop\'s reports will
be scrutinized by his/her chain of command. They will ensure that the
force was reasonable, was within department UOF policy, and whether or
not any disciplinary or retraining actions need to be taken. Even if the
cop is not tried in criminal court, he could still face disciplinary
action within his department for violations of policy.

The civilian will only face the DA. If the DA decides that no charges
will be filed, the civilian does not face any other reviews.

Granted, I was not discussing civil lawsuits for wrongful death, but
those follow. The difference there: if the officer was acting within the
confines of his department\'s rules, he will be represented by the
department\'s attorney. A civilian would have to find his own counsel to
represent him in a civil suit.
