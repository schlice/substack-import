Whether or not people are lost will not alter God's plan.

Christ indeed has said that He is coming back. Revelation explains
what's going to happen once it happens. We have no reason to doubt what
the text says.

Evangelism appears to be a lost art in the Christian churches, mostly
because they haven't been taught. They have a commandment to bring the
Gospel to the nations, but they don't know how. So I feel like that's a
different conversation. Regardless, we aren't going to change the
message because the messenger isn't trained.
