**Content:** [Your argument is known as a [[false
equivalence](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=d6f1d5&url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_equivalence){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container} so it\'s easy to see how
you can get caught up in believing that these two ideas (gun control and
mandatory vaccinations) are equivalent. They both are related to rights
and whether or not you have the free exercise thereof. Other than that,
there is no relation between the two concepts.\
\
First, I didn\'t see any right to be free from vaccinations in the Bill
of Rights. \"The right of the people to be free from vaccinations shall
not be infringed.\" I missed that amendment. There is, however, a right
to keep and bear arms in the Constitution, right after the amendment
that allows you free speech and the free exercise of religion.\
\
Second, owning or carrying a firearm is not a public health issue; not
getting vaccinated is. You benefit from the vaccinations of others even
if you choose not to vaccinate; as the population density increases, the
number of vaccinated individuals assists you with staying disease-free,
because others will be less likely to transmit the disease. You not
getting vaccinated risks a public health pandemic, allowing the disease
to spread throughout the population to people who can\'t be vaccinated
because of immune system complications and other reasons. Your
*choosing* to be unvaccinated threatens them. This is where the call for
mandatory vaccinations comes into play.\
\
No such similar threat exists when you carry a firearm. In fact, the
opposite effect happens: when you carry a firearm, others around you
become safer. You benefit from the safety of the person carrying a
firearm; criminals will think twice before acting in your vicinity, thus
making you safer.]{.rendered_qtext}
