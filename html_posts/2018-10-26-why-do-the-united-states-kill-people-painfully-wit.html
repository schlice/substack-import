**Why do the United States kill people painfully with poison, instead of
using a more humane way of execution?**

The current lethal injection system is designed to kill in the same way
that an anesthesiologist puts someone to sleep before surgery. It does
this through the injection of three drugs:

1.  Sodium thiopental or pentobarbital: an ultra short-action
    barbiturate, an anesthetic agent used at a high dose that renders
    the person unconscious in less than 30 seconds. Depression of
    respiratory activity is one of the characteristic actions of this
    drug. Consequently, the lethal-injection doses will---even in the
    absence of the next two drugs---cause death due to lack of
    breathing, as happens with overdoses of opioids.
2.  Pancuronium bromide: a non-depolarizing muscle relaxant, which
    causes complete, fast, and sustained paralysis of the skeletal
    striated muscles, including the diaphragm and the rest of the
    respiratory muscles; this would eventually cause death by
    asphyxiation.
3.  Potassium chloride: a potassium salt, which increases the blood and
    cardiac concentration of potassium to stop the heart via an abnormal
    heartbeat and thus cause death by cardiac
    arrest.[\[1\]](#xRrxS){#cite-xRrxS .citation_link}

The drugs are administered in order: the first drug causes loss of
consciousness, the second drug causes paralysis, and the third drug
induces cardiac arrest.

In some instances, the drugs did not work in the order or doses in which
they were given. Especially in drug abusers who already have high
tolerances to certain drugs like barbiturates, the pentobarbital may
have little effect, rendering the inmate conscious while the second drug
is administered. When the third drug is administered, if you are still
conscious, you would essentially be experiencing painful cardiac arrest,
while conscious and paralyzed. This, arguably, is torture.

The problem is that the drugs are administered by prison guards, not by
an anesthesiologist. Things like previous drug use and size of the
inmate are not adequately taken into consideration when the doses of the
drugs are determined.

There are other ways to execute prisoners more humanely. [[Inert gas
asphyxiation](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=0759a1&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inert_gas_asphyxiation%23Capital_punishment){.external_link

Indeed, three states (Oklahoma, Mississippi, and Alabama) have inert gas
asphyxiation listed as a primary or secondary method of capital
punishment.
