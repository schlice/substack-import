**Does Luke 14:23 imply that unbelievers are to be compelled by force to
become Christians, as Augustine argues?**

As with all things, context is important. Let's read the entire parable
as Jesus told it:

> **The Parable of the Great Banquet**
>
> 15 When one of those at the table with him heard this, he said to
> Jesus, "Blessed is the one who will eat at the feast in the kingdom of
> God."
>
> 16 Jesus replied: "A certain man was preparing a great banquet and
> invited many guests.
>
> 17 At the time of the banquet he sent his servant to tell those who
> had been invited, 'Come, for everything is now ready.'
>
> 18 "But they all alike began to make excuses. The first said, 'I have
> just bought a field, and I must go and see it. Please excuse me.'
>
> 19 "Another said, 'I have just bought five yoke of oxen, and I'm on my
> way to try them out. Please excuse me.'
>
> 20 "Still another said, 'I just got married, so I can't come.'
>
> 21 "The servant came back and reported this to his master. Then the
> owner of the house became angry and ordered his servant, 'Go out
> quickly into the streets and alleys of the town and bring in the poor,
> the crippled, the blind and the lame.'
>
> 22 "'Sir,' the servant said, 'what you ordered has been done, but
> there is still room.'
>
> 23 "Then the master told his servant, 'Go out to the roads and country
> lanes and compel them to come in, so that my house will be full.
>
> 24 I tell you, not one of those who were invited will get a taste of
> my banquet.'" *(Luke 14:15--24)*[\[1\]](#vaSwS){#cite-vaSwS
> .citation_link}

So what is it that Jesus is trying to say here? Matthew retells the same
story, so it may be easier to understand when you hear it from him:

> 1 Jesus spoke to them again in parables, saying: 2 "The kingdom of
> heaven is like a king who prepared a wedding banquet for his son. 3 He
> sent his servants to those who had been invited to the banquet to tell
> them to come, but they refused to come.
>
> 4 "Then he sent some more servants and said, 'Tell those who have been
> invited that I have prepared my dinner: My oxen and fattened cattle
> have been butchered, and everything is ready. Come to the wedding
> banquet.'
>
> 5 "But they paid no attention and went off---one to his field, another
> to his business.6 The rest seized his servants, mistreated them and
> killed them. 7 The king was enraged. He sent his army and destroyed
> those murderers and burned their city.
>
> 8 "Then he said to his servants, 'The wedding banquet is ready, but
> those I invited did not deserve to come. 9 So go to the street corners
> and invite to the banquet anyone you find.' 10 So the servants went
> out into the streets and gathered all the people they could find, the
> bad as well as the good, and the wedding hall was filled with guests.
>
> 11 "But when the king came in to see the guests, he noticed a man
> there who was not wearing wedding clothes. 12 He asked, 'How did you
> get in here without wedding clothes, friend?' The man was speechless.
>
> 13 "Then the king told the attendants, 'Tie him hand and foot, and
> throw him outside, into the darkness, where there will be weeping and
> gnashing of teeth.'
>
> 14 "For many are invited, but few are
> chosen."[\[2\]](#kGBlX){#cite-kGBlX .citation_link}

Who is Jesus talking about here? Clearly, he is referring to religious
people who claim they have no time for God. They are represented by
people who have accepted an invitation to a wedding banquet, but when it
comes time to go, they can't seem to find the time to actually show up.
In Matthew's accounting, it's more than just not having time for God;
it's living in open contempt of God, and you can see that when the
guests torture and murder the servants who were simply delivering the
message.

To your question about *compelling* people off the streets to come in to
the banquet, he was trying to make the point that his house would be
absolutely full, and that even if one of the originally invited guests
wanted to attend, now they could not, because the house was full. He
says, "I tell you, not one of those who were invited will get a taste of
my banquet." The point of *compelling people off the streets* into the
banquet was to make the point that the king would do anything to ensure
that those who refused his invitation would not be welcome once they did
so. It has nothing to do with forcing religion upon anyone.
