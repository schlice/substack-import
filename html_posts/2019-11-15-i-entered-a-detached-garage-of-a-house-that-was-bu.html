**I entered a detached garage of a house that was but is no longer under
construction, without intent, but took something when I saw it. Is this
burglary?**

Technically, burglary is knowingly entering or unlawfully remaining on
someone else\'s property with the intent to commit a crime (other than
trespass).

If you form the intent to commit a crime (in this case, theft) *after*
you enter the property, it is not burglary.

So the answer is this is not burglary. It is trespass and theft, but not
burglary.
