As with all legal answers, the answer is "it depends."

Even in Colorado, where you can legally walk around topless (women),
public indecency includes "knowingly exposing one\'s genitals to another
person in a way likely to alarm or offend the person." The higher level
charge of indecent exposure is triggered when there is intent:
"knowingly exposing one\'s genitals in view of another in a way likely
to cause alarm or offend *with the intent to arouse or to satisfy the
sexual desires of anyone*".

So this would be very specific to the situation. I think much would
depend on intent.
