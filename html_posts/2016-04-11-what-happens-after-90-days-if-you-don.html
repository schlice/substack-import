Simple: they will come by and pick up the item. What you already paid is
then applied to the item when you\'re ready to start paying again. So
there\'s really no reason to stop paying and not return the item, which
would clearly be a violation of the rental agreement. It\'s in their

If you don\'t pay and you don\'t return the item, then the entire amount
of the item becomes due, and is sent to collections. To be honest, I\'m
not sure when exactly that occurs, but it will be in your rental
contract.

They have lots of different ways to buy, three, to be exact. You can buy
the item outright, you can do a 90-days-same-as-cash, or you can do a
rental agreement where you rent the item and return it at the end of the
rental period, or a rental agreement where you purchase the item at the
end of the rental period.
