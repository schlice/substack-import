**Are there any prototypes of autonomous charging stations that will tag
along for a 40 min recharge while the self-driving car is in motion?**

The only in-motion charging solution I have seen so far is this:

[[World\'s first electrified road for charging vehicles opens in
Sweden](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=02f892&url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/12/worlds-first-electrified-road-for-charging-vehicles-opens-in-sweden){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"

The vehicle connects to the roadway using a movable arm.

There are other options currently in the works, such as embedding
wireless charging in roadway surfaces.
