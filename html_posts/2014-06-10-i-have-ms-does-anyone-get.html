**Content:** [\"White vision\" can mean a number of things. If you\'ve
already had optic neuritis, \"white vision\" could be the vision signals
being disrupted as you \"heat up\" during your walk. The same could be
true of your dizziness. As your body heats up during your walk, your
symptoms could be temporarily getting worse. If they get better after
your walk, this could match what you are seeing. My optic neuritis tends
to flare like this, but only when I\'m running; it doesn\'t do it when
I\'m walking, not even when I hike. Try to make sure you\'re staying
cool during your walk. Use a neck cooler or a body cooler when you walk;
there are many available to choose from. I can provide some links if
you\'re interested.\
\
It could also simply be dehydration \-- make sure you drink plenty of
water before, during, and after your walk. I have to use a hydration
pack (I carry a pack when I hike anyway) in order to stay adequately
hydrated. Not to mention I live in Colorado which is super-dry, so
adequate hydration is an issue for us MSers in dry climates.\

Hope this helps.]{.rendered_qtext}
