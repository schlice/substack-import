Child support is a function of the state, and has nothing to do with the
characterization of the pregnancy.

**It's all about the baby**.

The state has a compelling interest in protecting babies. Child support
is awarded to ensure the baby has enough money to have its needs met
while it grows.

Let me ask a hypothetical: If the biological father could "refuse" child
support because he was raped, and the mother is in jail for the rape,
who pays for raising the baby? Taxpayers? Well, ultimately they might,
but the taxpayers in most states have decided that the biological
parents of the baby should pay for the baby's upbringing.

If a state wants to make it so that a rape victim does not have to pay
for child support, they must provide alternate funding to support that
baby during its formative years, and that would most likely come from
taxes, and right now, no one wants to raise taxes.

Therefore, the biological parents of the baby pay child support for that
baby. It does seem a little injust that a boy can be forcibly raped and
then, to add insult to injury, has to *pay* for the progeny he created
against his will. Understanding that child support is not a punishment
or a reward helps, even though it doesn't lessen the sting.

If a teenage boy is forcibly raped and is unable to do anything about it
and gets the girl pregnant can he legally refuse child support? And if
not what will happen to him if he refuses to do so? This is only out of
curiosity.
