*(US Answer Only)*

While these types of answers are highly dependent on state law, in
general, the answer in the United States is **no**.

Public schools in the US can only display religious symbols when they
are used as part of a **temporary** educational lesson, discussing the
history or cultural significance of religion, and not as a permanent
display that could be seen as endorsing a specific faith; essentially,
they can be used as teaching aids to illustrate religious concepts
within a broader curriculum, but not as standalone symbols of religious
devotion.

Religious symbols can be displayed when they are used to **teach** about
religion in a historical or cultural context, like discussing the
symbolism of a cross in a world religions class. The display should be
**temporary** and only used during the relevant lesson, not as a
permanent fixture in the school. Schools must also present religious
symbols in a **neutral** way, avoiding any appearance of promoting one
religion over another.

**Examples of acceptable use:**

- Showing a menorah during a lesson on Hanukkah
- Displaying a picture of the Star of David while discussing Judaism
- Including a nativity scene as part of a broader holiday display with
  diverse cultural elements

**Examples of unacceptable use:**

- Permanently displaying religious symbols like the Ten Commandments on
  a school wall
- Using religious symbols as a form of decoration without educational
  context
- Forcing students to participate in religious activities or displays
