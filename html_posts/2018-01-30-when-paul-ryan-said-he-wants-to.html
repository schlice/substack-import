Let's let Ryan's own words describe what Ryan meant, rather than us
trying to interpret what he said and inserting our own biases into an
answer:

> \"Let it all out, get it all out there, cleanse the organization,\"
> Ryan said at a breakfast event with members of the press, according to
> the report.
>
> \"I think we should disclose all this stuff\" in the memo, said Ryan,
> who has previously skirted questions about it. \"It\'s the best
> disinfectant --- accountability, transparency, for the sake of the
> reputation of our institutions.\"

It appears that Ryan is discussing what is known as "institutional bias"
--- where members of an organization allow their personal biases to
affect their work, which is supposed to be objective and bias-free.

It is impossible for any investigatory body to be completely free of
bias, because people are involved in the process, and every person has
some bias. However, in the case of the FBI, and according to the
allegations in the memo, the levels of bias have compromised the
sanctity of the investigation process.

His words have nothing to do with loyalty to a person, or loyalty to the
Constitution. They have everything to do with the ability of a person to
leave their personal biases at the door and conduct a fair and impartial
investigation, which the memo alleges is not occurring at the FBI.
