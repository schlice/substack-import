First of all, it's extremely expensive and difficult to own assault
rifles. The Army classifies an "assault rifle" as one which is
select-fire, which means it can fire one shot at a time, or multiple
shots with one trigger pull. The last time I used one of those, I was
Active Duty. Civilians have to have a special Federal permit, pay a lot
of money (since no "new" assault rifles can be registered to civilians),
and then follow oppressive state regulations on top of that. So we
already do have a *de facto* ban on assault rifles.

I think what you are trying to do is ban "assault weapons," which is a
made-up category of firearm classified by its cosmetic features. We had
an assault weapons ban for ten years until it expired. And we did fight
back: we proved that the ban did nothing to stop crime, and we allowed
the ban to expire.

So here's a fun exercise: which one of these weapons is an assault
weapon?

If you said B, according to the law, you'd be right. B is a weapon which
would have been classified as illegal under the Assault Weapons Ban.

But you want to know a little secret? **They're the same weapon**. This
is a Ruger 10/22. They both shoot 22LR, they both have a 10 round
capacity, they are both semi-automatic (which means one pull, one shot).
The difference? Cosmetic. One has a wood stock, the other has a black
composite stock. One has a vicious pistol grip and a vertical foregrip,
which makes bullets move faster I guess. One has a collapsible stock,
which makes everything so much more dangerous.

So wanna ban assault weapons like this again? Sure, fine, go ahead.
Certainly won't hurt me. I'll just use A instead of B, and I won't be
deterred in the slightest. Certainly won't stop any mass shootings. You
can just use A instead of B.

See, Democrats like to pass laws that **feel good**. Doesn't it feel
good to get those *evil-looking assault weapons* off of the streets?
Sure it does, but it doesn't actually help the situation you were trying
to help. Republicans are more concerned with passing laws that actually
**do good**. Pass *meaningful* laws, instead of passing laws for the
sake of passing laws.
