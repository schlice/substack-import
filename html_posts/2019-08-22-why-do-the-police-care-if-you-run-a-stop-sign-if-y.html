**Why do the police care if you run a stop sign if you've looked and
nobody is coming?**

Because unfortunately, the law is not built with "do X unless you can do
Y instead." The law says "Do X." Period.

The law requires you to come to a full and complete stop at the line. A
complete stop is indicated when your tires stop moving.
