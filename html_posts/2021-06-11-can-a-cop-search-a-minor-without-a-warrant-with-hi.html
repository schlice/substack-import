Generally, yes.

Parental consent is permissible to allow a search of a minor. Without
consent, probable cause would be next required. What constitutes
probable cause is an area of Fourth Amendment law that is continuously
evolving and being refined by case law.

Without parental consent or probable cause, the police would need a
warrant to conduct a search.

If the minor is in a school, the lesser standard of reasonable suspicion
is applied, in order to maintain a safe and orderly school environment,
and with the additional understanding that the school acts *in loco
parentis*. Like probable cause, what constitutes reasonable suspicion is
continuously evolving. For instance, in a landmark SCOTUS case, it was
held that an assistant principal's search of a student's purse was
reasonable where that student was observed smoking in violation of
school rules.
