**Knowing Colorado and Washington are \"Right to Die\" states in which
doctor assisted suicide is legal, will this evolve to a criminal
circumstance where a person convicted and sentenced to die be given an
option to commit suicide?**

No.

The "right to die" legislation is narrowly tailored for someone who has
been diagnosed with a terminal illness and has less than six months to
live. They are already suffering in their last days; they simply want to
end their suffering.

Death row inmates are appreciably not suffering in the same way that
terminally ill patients are. Death row inmates already die peacefully
(or at least, that's how the lethal injection medicine is designed to
work). They do not suffer.

There is no need to extend the existing "right to die" statute to
include those on death row, as the circumstances surrounding their
deaths are totally different.
