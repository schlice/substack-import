**Are Air National Guard alert fighters sufficient to defend US airspace
against a Black Swan event involving a Bolt Out of the Blue penetration
by a major adversary? Or are they only capable of intercepting hijacked
airliners?**

The answer is no, but not because the ANG is out of its depth. The
answer is primarily because it's not the ANG's job to defend the border.
It's the AD Military's job.

NORAD guards the border, and NORAD has alert fighters to do targeted
intercepts. Black Swan / Bolt Out of the Blue events are, by their very
definition, unexpected. The Distant Early Warning (DEW) Line is still
running, and holes in DEW radar are plugged within hours, by US/Canadian
joint agreement.

**The US military counters Black Swan / Bolt out of the Blue events by
doing its level best to ensure that no event goes unexpected.**

They do this through many means, but primarily using intelligence. We do
our utmost to track the militaries of other nations, so in theory, we
should get some whiff that a massive invasion force is being assembled
somewhere, long before those planes ever leave the ground. There are
many indications that an invasion force is being assembled (I won't go
into them here), and while you can cover up some of them, you can't
suppress them all.

Also, while missile flight time from Russia to the US may be only 30
minutes, aircraft flight time from Russia, even over the poles across
Canadian airspace is a flight measured in hours, not minutes. There's a
fair bet that *someone* would notice, and we'd have near-alert aircraft
in the air well within that timeframe, with many more to follow.
