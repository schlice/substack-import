**Is Donald Trump slowly turning into a dictator vowing to veto any
effort to block the national emergency he has called at the border?**

Is that true, or has Congress become the dictator, vowing to veto
anything that he does?

I'm not sure. But which political party has #RESIST as its motto?

Veto power is the President's alone. It's in the Constitution. He is
certainly free to use it. There are always political ramifications for
everything you do, but this is a no-brainer to him.

And in most cases, you can't "block a national emergency" through an act
of Congress. The National Emergencies Act says that every six months,
Congress can review the list of active national emergencies, and they
can end one by passing a **joint resolution**.

Congress isn't passing a joint resolution ending this national emergency
any time soon. Even if they do, Trump can still veto it. Congress would
still need a 2/3 majority in both houses to override it and end the
national emergency. That requires massive negative political capital
against the President, and it doesn't exist in either house.
