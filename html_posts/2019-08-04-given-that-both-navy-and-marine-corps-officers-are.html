**Given that both Navy and Marine Corps officers are educated at
Annapolis, why did the Air Force need a separate academy from West
Point? Aside from flight training, are there any real differences?**

The Marine Corps is actually part of the Department of the Navy, and has
always been, since its foundation. Historically, the Marine Corps was
founded to serve as an infantry unit aboard naval vessels and was
responsible for the security of the ship and its crew by conducting
offensive and defensive combat during boarding actions and defending the
ship\'s officers from mutiny. With their missions so closely linked, it
only makes sense that officers are part of the Navy first, and then
disseminate into the Marine Corps after graduation from Annapolis.

The Air Force became its own service (on par with the Army and Navy)
with the signing of Executive Order 9877 and the National Security Act
of 1947. This action indicates that the mission of the Air Force was so
different from that of the Army that it was deserving of its own
service. It was at that time (1947) that the leadership of the new
service started work on their next agenda item: their own service
academy. It took until the early 1950s before this work was completed
and Colorado Springs was chosen to be the home of the Air Force Academy.
The first class was already in school at a temporary location at Lowry
Air Force Base in Denver by the time the Air Force Academy completed its
initial construction phase.
