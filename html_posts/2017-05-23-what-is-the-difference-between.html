There is no difference.

Space-A means "space available." This program allows military members to
fly on military transport aircraft if there is space available, anywhere
that aircraft goes, for little to no cost. The colloquial term for
space-available passengers was "self-loading cargo."

These transport aircraft are operated by Air Mobility Command (AMC). It
used to be known as Military Airlift Commnd (MAC), which is why they
were previously known as "MAC flights."
