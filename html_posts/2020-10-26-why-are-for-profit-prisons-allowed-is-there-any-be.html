**Why are for-profit prisons allowed? Is there any benefit to having
them?**

Why wouldn't they be allowed? They don't violate any laws, they follow
all government regulations and they provide prison services at lower
cost than the government can. And before anyone comments and says that
private prisons are not following law, you had better be reporting it to
your state's Attorney General, not commenting on Quora.

Even if you were to remove all private prisons today (which only house
8.2% of US prisoners as of 2017), you still have massive amounts of
private participation in the public prison system, with private
companies providing *services in most prisons* such as healthcare, food,
and communications.

Still, "\[t\]his works out to about 15 percent of federal prisoners and
7 percent of state prisoners at the time. At least 27 states
incarcerated people in private facilities, and eight of those states
used private facilities to house at least 15 percent of their prison
populations (not all states reported data). Montana topped that list
with 38 percent of prisoners in private
facilities."[\[1\]](#WenCh){#cite-WenCh .citation_link}

But since it is true that private prisons most generally follow all
government regulations, the problem then is that government regulations
are not structured to give you the outcomes you want. "The reality is
that private prisons are a tool, and like all tools, you can use them
well or use them poorly," Adrian Moore, vice president of policy at
Reason Foundation, said.

So if you want better private prisons, you need better private prison
regulations.

*For the time being, I have re-enabled comments on selected answers.
Some people like to comment. Some people like to engage with me in a
civil manner, and I did kinda miss that\...a little. But do not
misunderstand, I take this step very cautiously. My mental well-being
isn\'t worth your harassing, inane behavior. If you don\'t like what I
wrote, tough shit. If my answer is grammatically low-quality or is
un-cited opinion masquerading as fact, downvote it. If you think I\'m
wrong, write your own answer. But Quora is a question-and-answer site,
not a debate site. If you are simply commenting to tell me \"ackshually,
you\'re wrong,\" don\'t be surprised if I quietly delete your comment.
Put anything vaguely harassing in there, and your deletion will be
followed by a block and a mute, and a BNBR report. I will do this
immediately and with no compunction. You have been warned. Be nice.*
