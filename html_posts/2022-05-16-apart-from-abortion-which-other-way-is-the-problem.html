First of all, this is a poor argument. Ectopic pregnancies are not
viable. The egg needs to implant in the uterus to be viable, not in the
Fallopian tube.

Additionally, a ruptured Fallopian tube can cause fatal internal
hemorrhaging. Thus, the life of the mother is at risk. The odds of
surviving an ectopic pregnancy (roughly 60 million to one) are
outweighed by the risk to the mother for continuing the pregnancy
(massive internal hemorrhaging due to ruptured Fallopian tubes). Thus,
to save the mother's life, the pregnancy would be terminated.

Every state which has a post-*Roe* abortion ban (either total or
partial) has an exception to save the life of the mother. Medical
procedures to save the life of the mother are never illegal, and that
includes aborting a pregnancy to save the mother's life. They weren't
even illegal *before Roe*. And they're still not illegal.
