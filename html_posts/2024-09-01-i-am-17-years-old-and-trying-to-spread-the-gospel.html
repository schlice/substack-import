Good on you for stretching your evangelical legs.

I think first you need to define terms. What will they accept as
"proof?" Is the only proof they will accept discovered through the
scientific method? When they look for "proof," does that mean only
something that they can see, hear, taste, touch or smell?

That certainly wouldn't make sense. If God exists, then He is
*necessarily* immaterial (He exists outside of the material universe
which He created). So if God is not material, why would you use material
tests to try to find Him? It's like using an X-ray machine to find a
plastic cup. It's the wrong tools.

So if you're going to prove that God exists, you have to use tools of
inquiry which are *not* based on the material. Those tools of inquiry
are collectively part of the discipline of *philosophy*. Philosophy
allows us to probe truths that are beyond what science is capable of
understanding.

But let's not fail to realize that philosophy is not divorced from
science, as if you can rely on science alone, and philosophy is just
pseudo-babble for PhDs to discuss while smoking pipes in dimly-lit
rooms. Philosophy is the *foundation* of science. Science is dependent
on philosophy. In fact, ***science is a slave to philosophy.*** Bad
philosophy results in bad science, and good science requires good
philosophy.

Why? Because:

Once we have determined that we have to use philosophy to discover the
truth of God's existence, we next need to learn the *arguments* for the
existence of God.

If you really want to learn this stuff, there is a great book you should
absolutely read. It is by Dr. Norm Geisler and Dr. Frank Turek, and it
is called *I Don't Have Enough Faith To Be an Atheist*. It is not a
difficult read (so it's not like you're learning about Kierkegaard or
Freud in school), and it lays out the philosophical and scientific
truths which act as the "signposts" that point us to the existence of
God. These signposts alone don't prove that God exists, but they lead us
to the knowledge that we can be certain, *beyond a reasonable doubt,*
***but not beyond all doubt****, that a creator God exists.*
