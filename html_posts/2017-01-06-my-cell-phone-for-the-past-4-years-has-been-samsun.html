I actually currently own and have in my possession a functional S4 (my
last phone) and a GALAXY S6 edge (my primary daily phone).

On the upsides:

- I don't even own the newest S7 devices, and my S6 performs twice as
  well as my S4 did. The CPU is simply better.
- The screen is sharper and clearer. Less noticeable dithering between
  pixels. It's just a sharper screen. And if you get one of the "edge"
  devices, the curved screen is a real looker. It's simply gorgeous. Is
  it extremely functional? Not really, but the curved screen is more
  about form than function. It does have some functionality, but not
  much.
- The camera is better. It almost snaps better pictures than my DSLR.
  Almost.
- On the S7, the internal storage space is bigger.
- I can't remember whether or not my S4 had LTE capabilities, but I know
  the newest GALAXY phones are LTE compatible. My S6 is LTE.

But, as with anything, there are downsides to every upside:

- You will sorely miss removable batteries. I think it was worlds easier
  to keep a spare charged battery in my pocket than to have to use a
  battery case or an external battery. And because it's Android,
  processes can go amok and can silently run down your battery. Granted,
  the newer internal batteries are higher capacity which kinda makes up
  for the fact that you're losing a removable battery, but with my S4, I
  could not only carry a spare charged battery, but I could change the
  capacity of the battery if I chose. I have a big 5200mAh battery for
  my S4. It came with a replacement back cover for the phone because it
  was so big. I even got a case that fit the phone and the big battery.
  I could go almost three days of heavy use on that big battery. My
  battery case tends to make up the difference on vacation and such, but
  like I said, I still miss removable batteries.
- In the S6 series, they didn't even include expandable memory. In the
  S7 series, it did make a comeback, but the sealed battery is still
  there.
- The S4 series felt more "solid" than these newer phones do. It is a
  little heavier, but I was okay with that.
