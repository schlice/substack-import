**How likely is an FBI probe into the sexual assault allegations against
Brett Kavanaugh?**

Extremely unlikely.

First of all, the Senate Judiciary Committee has no authority to direct
the FBI to investigate the allegations. The FBI does not work for
Congress, and Congress does not have the authority to direct the FBI to
do any independent investigations. If Congress learns of a Federal
crime, they can indeed refer the evidence of that crime to the FBI for
investigation, but there is no evidence that a Federal crime took place
here.

Secondly, the FBI does *background investigations* on Supreme Court
nominees, **at the behest and the direction of the nominator.** In other
words, the FBI works for the White House. It has already conducted
multiple background investigations on Judge Kavanaugh and it has
presented that information to the White House. The only way that the FBI
is even allowed to investigate these allegations is if the White House
decides to re-open the latest background investigation on Judge
Kavanaugh and to direct them to investigate this new allegation. The
White House has already stated its reluctance to re-open the
investigation, as it is virtually impossible to determine without any
evidence and with spotty recollection of over 36 years ago whether or
not the allegations are credible.

Now, before you hit the comments to trash me for calling Dr. Ford a
liar, I can tell you that she most likely did not lie. However, her
memory is likely faulty, and several pieces of evidence show this to be
the case.

Therefore, unless the White House has a change of heart, there will be
no FBI investigation into the allegations against Judge Kavanaugh.
