As with any legal answer, "it depends." If the company wants their money
back from you, they will have to file a lawsuit against you, and it will
be up to them to prove that you knowingly were involved with fraud in
order to recoup their losses.

**If you had no involvement with any fraud, and had no knowledge of
fraudulent activity**, then US law regarding receiving unsolicited
merchandise through the mail applies. Whether or not the items made it
to your doorstep through fraud is irrelevant to you; you were not
involved with the fraud. You simply were the surprise recipient of
unsolicited merchandise. If that is truly the case, you are protected.
You are not "profiting from fraud" because in order be charged under
this statute, you must be involved with the fraud in some way, or have
knowledge of the fraudulent activity that led to the unsolicited
merchandise arriving at your doorstep.

**If you were involved in some way with the fraud**, or if you had
knowledge **at all** of how this merchandise was making its way to you,
**you are liable.** You are responsible for every dime you earned from
the sale of the items, and you are responsible for covering the losses
the company suffered. You can also likely be charged with mail-order
fraud, and the same organizations who would protect you if you were not
involved (the USPIS, the state AG, etc) will come after you instead, and
you'll face some hefty fines and possible jail time for perpetrating, or
participating in, or profiting from, the fraud.
