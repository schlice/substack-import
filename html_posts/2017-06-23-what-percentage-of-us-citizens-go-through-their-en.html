I have fire insurance on my home, and I have several fire extinguishers
in my house. I've never used them. But I still have them.

I have a winter kit in my car during the winter season. It has candles,
thermal blankets, MREs, and emergency water. I've never used my winter
kit. But I still have it.

We have these things *in case* we need them. If we don't ever use them,
was it a stupid idea to have them? Of course not! If we need them, we
really need them. If we don't, we're glad we had them in case we needed
them.

It's called **being prepared**. I would much rather have them and never
use them, than to not have them and need them.

Carrying a gun is the same way. We hope no one will ever find out we are
carrying a gun. Because there really should be only one way they find
out: if we have to use it.

I have the training. I have the experience. I have the temperament. So I
carry.

I'd rather have it and not need it than need it and not have it. I would
think it would be the most horrible feeling in the world to look at a
situation in which I needed my gun and didn't have it.

As to percentages? We can't give you that number, for the same reasons
that we can't tell you the actual number of crimes that were stopped
through the use of a gun. And by that, I mean sometimes the simple act
of displaying the weapon. It's *estimated* (because that's all we can
do) that between one and three **million** crimes a year are thwarted by
the *mere presence* of a firearm, *without a single shot ever being
fired*. In most of those cases, the police are never called, so it is
impossible to record statistics.

The one question I can answer: *I am curious though as to the percentage
of people who never find themselves in that type of situation.*

I would say at least 99%.
