That's the thing about morals, isn't it? Morality is usually a person's
intrinsic understanding of right and wrong. Morality differs from ethics
as morality is personal (from within), and ethics are derived from an
organization or group (from outside). A person's morals are generally
shaped by their upbringing and their environment.

The upshot of all of this: *morals can vary from one person to the
next.*

So what one person finds *moral,* another person may find *immoral*.

\

So what does any of this have to do with the abortion question? Some
people may find it morally acceptable to kill a fetus, while others may
not.

The difference between the pro-life and pro-choice camps turns
specifically on the value the two groups place on human life:

- Pro-life people are primarily focused on the preservation of all human
  life, regardless of its phase of development or its temporal location.
  Pro-life people generally believe that it is immoral to destroy any
  human life, outside of extenuating circumstances.
- Pro-choice people place varying values on human life depending on its
  temporal location (i.e. its location in space and time). In other
  words, they place less value on human life when it is in its very
  earliest stages, and when it is present in a mother's womb. Pro-choice
  people largely believe that it is *less immoral* to destroy
  early-development human life.

**TL;DR: The morality of abortion at any phase in the development of the
baby varies from person to person. You can broadly categorize the
difference in morals when you divide people by their pro-life or
pro-choice leanings.**

*Sorry, no comments on this one. This topic is simply too emotionally
charged to lead to any productive discussion in the comments.*

*If you don't like what I wrote, tough shit. If my answer is
grammatically low-quality or is un-cited opinion masquerading as fact,
downvote it. If you think I'm wrong, write your own answer. But Quora is
a question-and-answer site, not a debate site. If you were simply going
to comment to tell me "ackshually, you're wrong," then you're the reason
why I disable comments. Well done, Karen. You ruined it for everyone.*

Original question:

Is abortion more morally acceptable when it's early like within four
weeks or is it irrelevant?
