**What is the format of a bat file or script to allow user log on to run
a few tasks such as checking to see if windows is updated, antivirus,
and to set a default printer in Active directory?**

It's unlikely that you'd be able to do this in a Windows batch file.

Your best bet would be to do this in Windows PowerShell. There are some
excellent PowerShell scripting tutorials which are easily searchable
from Google.
