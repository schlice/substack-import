I used Copaxone for seven years. The injection site pain will always be
there, but it goes away fairly quickly. There are some things you can do
to minimize the pain:

1.  Take Tylenol 30 minutes prior to your injection
2.  Use a cold compress right after you inject
3.  Don't "slam" the medicine in there; after you insert the needle, be
    slightly more gentle while you push the plunger. This is why I don't
    recommend the Autoject for everyone in every circumstance. I only
    used the Autoject on my waist (my "love handles" injection site)
    because it was hard to reach. The rest of the time I just used the
    bare needles.

If, by "pain after it enters your body" you mean that after you inject
the medicine you feel pain throughout your body, that may be something
different. You might want to consult with your neurologist on that one.

(EDIT) After re-reading this question, it's possible that when the OP
said "does the body get used to Copaxone" they meant that Copaxone might
stop working after a period of time.

I can tell you that this does happen, as it happened to me. Eventually,
Copaxone just stopped working, and I got new lesions and new disability.
That's when I moved from Copaxone to Tysabri.
