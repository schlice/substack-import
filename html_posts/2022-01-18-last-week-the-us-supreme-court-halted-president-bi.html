Yes they can. Private companies can put whatever rules they want in
place for their workers. Private companies can even force all of their
employees to get mandatory vaccinations or be fired. Some companies have
already done this, like Disney (yes, Disney [[suspended its mandatory
vaccination
program](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=4eb6cc&url=https://www.reuters.com/business/disney-world-puts-covid-19-vaccination-mandate-policy-hold-local-tv-2021-11-21/){.external_link

of Florida state law). But outside of Florida at least, an employer can
force all their employees to either "get the jab or lose the job."

The ruling simply said that OSHA cannot *mandate* vaccinations or
testing for all businesses, because that is outside the scope of OSHA's
authority.

Original question:

Last week, the U.S. Supreme Court halted President Biden\'s vaccine and
testing mandate for employers. Can workplaces still mandate vaccines
anyway?
