**What do you think Trump\'s reaction will be to Trump Organization CFO
Allen Weisselberg getting immunity for providing information about
Michael Cohen?**

The world will find out just what a sleazy businessman Trump actually
was when he was running the Trump organization. I think Trump should be
concerned that *everything* about his past will come to light, in
excruciatingly gory detail. Trump will, most likely, send a tweet storm
excoriating Weisselberg as a sellout and a sleaze and decry Fake News
and the Russian Witch Hunt.

HOWEVER, I must acknowledge the elephant in the room.

**NONE OF THIS HAS ANYTHING TO DO WITH RUSSIA OR COLLUSION!**

Remember the ***REAL*** reason for the Mueller probe: to get Trump out
of office. That's the whole reason we have it. Mueller knows there is no
Russia collusion. We all know that Strzok and Page made up the whole
Russia collusion tactic as an insurance policy to get Trump out of
office. The thought is that if we dig up enough dirt on Trump, we can
have a Nixon-esque exposition of *just how bad a man Trump really is*,
and the House can see clear to call something a high crime and
misdemeanor so that they can file articles of impeachment with the
Senate.

They'll never get him removed from office, because the Senate will never
vote to remove him from office without a real crime proximate to the
office of the President which would make it apparent that he can no
longer effectively function as President.

But hypothetically, even if they *did* get him removed from office, then
Pence is president, and he'll keep all of Trump's voters, and probably
take some #NeverTrumpers back from wherever they went. He'll double down
on Trump's policies, with a much tighter Christian bent and no real
Trump-like skeletons in his closet, which makes it objectively worse for
the far left. You think abortion is threatened *today*? Just wait until
Pence becomes president.

So it will be a Pyrrhic victory at best, and at worst, it keeps
Republicans (if not Trump) in the White House through 2024.
