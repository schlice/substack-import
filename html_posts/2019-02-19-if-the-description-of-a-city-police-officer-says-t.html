**If the description of a city police officer says they have to enforce
federal as well as state laws, how can they enforce a no trespass order
when a business says I cannot have and care for my service animal in the
business?**

If the business owner says you cannot bring a service animal into a
building, you can't bring that animal into the building. The police
enforce trespassing ordinances when a business owner says that you are
not welcome in their building. It's not up to the police to not enforce
the law simply because the business owner is violating a Federal law.
The police are not lawyers. While they can advise the business owner
that service animals are allowed anywhere that people are under Federal
law, the business owner is still free to violate ADA if he chooses.

The business owner violating the Americans with Disabilities Act is a
matter which you must address through your lawyer. The police do not
enforce the provisions of the ADA, as there are no criminal penalties
under that law, only civil penalties.

Also, city and state police do not enforce federal law. They enforce
state law. Federal law enforcement agents enforce federal law. In most
cases, despite their job description, city police officers cannot
enforce federal law.
