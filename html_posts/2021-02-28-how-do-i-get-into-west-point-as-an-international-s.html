**How do I get into West Point as an international student (Canadian)?**

Here's the answer from West Point's website, with **emphasis** added by
me:

> To apply for admission to West Point, contact the [[U.S. Defense

If you're competitive now, then you have a shot. Granted, it's a really,
really slim shot, but it's a shot nonetheless. Think of it this way: if
you can easily be accepted into RMC, you have a chance to be accepted at
West Point.

Also, note that it takes longer to be accepted as an international
student than it does as a US citizen, so the Application Timeline is
extended. Use it as a guideline, but don't hold yourself to those dates
as a minimum. Have everything ready well before those dates.

Good luck!
