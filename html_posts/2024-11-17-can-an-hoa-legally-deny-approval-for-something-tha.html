As with all legal answers, the answer is "it depends." And what it
depends on is your Governing Documents; specifically, the language which
establishes the committee doing the review of requested changes.

It's usually called the Architecture Review Board (ARB) or the
Architecture Control Committee (ACC) or something like that. It its
charter, it will normally have language which indicates that **it is
their sole judgement** which determines whether or not a particular
change, on a particular house, will be approved.

What that means, in practice, is that a change can be perfectly legal.
The paint color may be part of a standard, approved paint color palette.
And this is the crazy part, *it may even be a change that was approved
for another house!* The ARB can *still* legally deny the change if, **in
their sole opinion**, the change, on your house, doesn't fit the overall
look of the neighborhood they are trying to achieve or maintain.

Now, all of those things I pointed out are reasons that might make you
believe the ARB is practicing what we call *selective enforcement*: with
two changes exactly the same, they approve one and not the other. It
would take some pretty serious explanation on their part to overcome a
charge of selective enforcement. Nevertheless, you can still make that
charge. To do so, you'll need to hire your own attorney and file suit
against the HOA making that claim.

But can they *legally* deny a change that fits their guidelines? Yes,
legally they can, so long as the Governing Documents indicate that the
ARB maintains the final decision based on their own judgement.
