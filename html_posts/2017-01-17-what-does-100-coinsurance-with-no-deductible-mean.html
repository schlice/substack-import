Here's a few definitions you might find useful:

**Copay**: A fixed amount that an insured person pays at the time of
service. For example, your doctor's visits may include a \$30 copay. You
would pay this at the doctor's office

**Coinsurance**: This is a "shared cost" model of insurance. When you
have coinsurance, your plan will pay a certain percentage of the cost of
a covered service, and you will pay the remainder. For example, let's
say you had a 70% coinsurance. For a \$150 procedure, the plan would pay
\$105, and you would pay \$45. Coinsurance is normally billed to you.

**Deductible**: The amount you pay for services before insurance starts
to pay. For example, let's say your plan had a \$1500 deductible. This
means you pay the full amount of your health care costs until you have
paid the amount of your deductible. So looking at the coinsurance
example above, if you have not paid \$1500 of charges during that
calendar year, you would pay the full \$150 for the procedure. Once you
have met your deductible amount, then the coinsurance would kick in.

Some other important tidbits about health insurance:

- Choose your plans based on how frequently you think you'll be visiting
  the doctor or using healthcare. For example, if you visit the doctor
  often, choose a plan with a lower copay or coinsurance.
- However, you should also note that plans with lower copays and lower
  coinsurance will usually cost you more in monthly premiums.

Now that that's all out of the way, let's look at your example. "100%
coinsurance" is sort of a silly way to describe a policy, because there
are no "co" payments going on. The insurance company is paying 0% of the
bill, and you pay 100%. Similarly, no deductible means that you don't
have to pay any deductibles before insurance begins paying, but it's
moot since insurance isn't paying anyway.

In case it's still not clear, ***that's not a really good plan.***

Your monthly premiums will probably be fairly low to purchase such a
plan, but you will pay the full cost of any procedures you undergo.

With MS, your procedures can be fairly expensive (i.e. regular MRIs of
the brain, expensive medications, etc). Medications alone can cost
\$10,000 per month retail. I don't know what your out-of-pocket cost
would be, but if medications are part of this plan, you will pay the
full out-of-pocket cost for them as well.

If you didn't have a condition which required regular treatments, this
might be a good plan. But in your case, this is not an ideal plan.
