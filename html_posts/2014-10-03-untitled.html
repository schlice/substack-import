<h2>Answer Comment</h2>

**Content:** [We were expressly forbidden from providing humanitarian
assistance following Hurricane Andrew which leveled Homestead AFB.
However, Combat Comm was authorized to go in and set up communications,
because that comm re-established C2 functions between Homestead and HHQ.
As a side effect, limited phone service was restored for the general
public as well, but this was a permitted military use since the primary
function was reestablishing HHQ contact with Homestead.\
\
This is just one example off the top of my head, but I have seen many
examples of this during my own military time.]{.rendered_qtext}
