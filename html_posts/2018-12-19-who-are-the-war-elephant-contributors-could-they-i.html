Hi readers!

My DW (for new readers, you'll see that acronym around; it stands for
Darling Wife) thinks I talk too much. She thinks I stick my nose into
other people's business, and that I inject my opinion at more times than
for which it is asked.

And that's why I write.

I can exercise my creative talents and write about things that I like,
things I know about, and things that interest me. And it helps to save
my marriage. Win-win.

But first, a little about me, as it is my history that most greatly
influences my writing. I grew up on Long Island as a staunch Roman
Catholic. My dad was a cop, and my mom was a teacher. I did the whole
CCD thing as a kid, and basically grew up in the church. If there was a
church job for a lay person, I did it: I was an altar boy, I was a
sacristan, I was an organist, I was a cantor, I was a Eucharistic
Minister. I went to an all-boys Catholic high school. I played the organ
during our church services (we had a reclaimed theater organ from a
movie theater being torn down), accompanied the Glee Club, and sang with
them, too.

That whole music thing started when my parents caught me playing the
Sesame Street theme song on one of these toy pianos:

rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"

qt-tooltip="amazon.com"}]{.qlink_container}

I don't remember the brand of piano I had as a child, but this is a fair
approximation of it. It has little hammers that strike steel rods, and
mine was much the same. But yeah, I picked up the theme song by ear. At
age 3.

By age 5, they had me in piano lessons. By age 6, they had discovered
that I had perfect pitch. I started supplementing my playing in middle
school with singing, in the choir and in solo performances. By the time
I graduated high school, I was performing with the Glee Club as well as
on stage with the Drama Club, and played in two concert series
performances at Carnegie Hall. I sang in All-County, All-State, and
All-Eastern Choirs. I was a soloist in our All-State choir.

I went off to college and graduated from the US Air Force Academy's
Class of 1994. I graduated with a BS in General Engineering, and an
emphasis in Legal Studies. Constitutional Law was my favorite class; it
came effortlessly for me. I served as a Communications officer for 5
years on Active Duty. My last duty station on Active Duty was in the
Systems Center in NORAD. I served as a Crew Commander on a few crews, as
well as serving as Chief of Operations. I also had a "secondary AFSC" of
Security Forces Officer. Back in the day, we called it a wartime skill.
It was a job that we could do to "augment" critical career fields during
times of contingency. I served as an ART/SRT Team Leader, also at NORAD.
I'm not a "gun nut," because you're only officially classified as a gun
nut if you have more than two gun safes (I only have two) and they're
full (mine aren't *completely* full). I am a "gun enthusiast," and
combine that with my legal bent, and I spend lots of time defending the
2nd Amendment.

I spent an additional 7 years in the Air Force Reserves, doing the same
job, while working for several high-tech companies (I currently work for
Dell).

And then, I got MS, which effectively ended my military career. I could
literally go on for weeks about that, so suffice it to say that I'm
currently well-controlled, with occasional niggles, on my third
medicine,
[[Gilenya](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=1d8fed&url=https://gilenya.com/index.jsp){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="gilenya.com"}]{.qlink_container}. I currently own the
[[Multiple Sclerosis
Forum](https://multiplesclerosisforum.quora.com/)]{.qlink_container}
here on Quora, discussing all things MS (EDIT: New neurologist, new
medicine. I'm now on to
[[Zeposia](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=826efb&url=https://www.zeposia.com/multiple-sclerosis/){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="zeposia.com"}]{.qlink_container}, which is real similar to
Gilenya but acts against fewer S1P receptors so is apparently safer. We
shall see).

Understanding *all of that*, you'd probably not be surprised to find
that I enjoy writing about the following topics:

- Military (specifically, the Air Force, and the Air Force Academy, or
  service academies in general)
- Multiple Sclerosis
- Police and Law Enforcement, and Law in Everyday Life
- Conservatism
- The Constitution
- Christianity

I'm no longer Roman Catholic. I dabbled in United Methodism (which was a
nice segue away from the RCC), and I am now simply Christian. I attend a
non-denominational Bible-based Christian church. But I have been a
Conservative for as long as I could formulate an opinion. As I age (note
that I did not say gracefully; I am aging kicking and screaming: I live
by the "growing old is mandatory, growing up is optional" mantra), I
find that some of my views have been tending towards Libertarian (or at
least, less Conservative). This may be because I'm simply disgusted by
career politicians and the rise of bureaucratic despotism in this
country. Term limits FTW!

War Elephant is *literally the perfect fit* for me. I really truly hope
they feel the same. Smart, thoughtful, passionate writers live here, and
somehow they accepted me into their company. I won't be like Groucho
Marx; I'm happy to be part of a club that would accept me as a member.
Hopefully, I can live up to the high bar they've already set.

I try to be respectful always, and I try to back my answers with
research and reason and logic. I'm not always successful, but I am
sincere in my attempt. It's taken me nearly five years to figure out
that BNBR isn't about *being incorrect*, it's about *saying a correct
thing in an incorrect way*.

Please feel free to read my body of work here at Quora. If you enjoy my
particular brand of thought, feel free to follow me. And don't forget
that there are other like-minded people who post here at the War
Elephant, so make sure you follow our Space.
