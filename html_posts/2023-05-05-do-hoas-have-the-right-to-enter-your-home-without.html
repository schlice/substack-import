Most likely no.

While it is true that most covenants give HOA Board members and Officers
the authority to enter *property* when it is necessary to protect the
community or neighboring property, in the vast majority of cases the
*inside of the home* is off-limits.

We would frequently enter property when there was something like a
sprinkler system failure and water was spraying everywhere and running
into neighbors' yards; we'd be able to get to the shutoff vale to stop
the chaos until the homeowner returned home and was able to fix the
broken pipe.

Presumably, there *could* be a clause in the Governing Documents that
allowed an HOA Board member or Officer to enter a home in the event of
exigent circumstances which might lead to damage of neighboring
property, but I have never heard of it and I highly doubt any HOAs have
it.

This could be something I could see happening in a Condo Association,
but in a single-family HOA, unlikely.
