Since you asked this question in the Christian Corner, I'm going to give
you a Biblical answer. And the answer is more related to where you allow
your money to be spent.

Your money is not yours. It's God's. We Christians know this. God gives
us the resources we need to live our lives. We are merely stewards of
the resources that God has given us.

So tell me: are you being a good steward of God's resources if you
knowingly allow it to be given to an organization which will use those
resources to facilitate the murder of babies?

I don't doubt that It will be hard. You'll have to give up your iPhones.
In my case, I'll have to forego renewing my Annual Pass to Walt Disney
World, despite the fact that from all signs, Disney is not going to sell
Annual Passes in their current form any more, so once I let it go, it's
most likely gone for good.

But I also know that there are plenty of other companies whose health
plans include travel to "centers of excellence" or locations for
specialized healthcare if it is not available near you. For example, my
company's health plan allows for travel reimbursement in these cases,
for all covered health services. So if I, for example, get cancer, I can
travel to a cancer treatment center and recoup some of my travel
expenses through my health care plan. But what constitutes a "covered
health service" varies from company to company, and it's not all
black-and-white, and it's not all out in the open. So it becomes very
difficult to really know whether your money will actually be
facilitating abortions.

However, for the "clear-cut" cases (like where companies have literally
issued press releases declaring that they will pay for employees to
travel to states which allow the killing of babies), we can choose to
spend our money elsewhere.

\

That said, is there a *limit* to how much we must disrupt our lives? For
example, if Visa said that they will pay for their employees to travel
to abortion clinics, do I have to cancel all of my Visa cards because of
this? If my bank supported this policy, should I change banks? If my
*employer* supported this policy, should I quit?

And what about *taxes*? What if the government successfully repeals the
Hyde Amendment and actual tax dollars are forced to be paid to abortion
providers like Planned Parenthood to pay for abortions? Can I refuse to
pay taxes because my money will go towards paying for abortions?

I struggle with these questions, and I'd love to hear your thoughts in
the comments.

But I know that God is sovereign, He is just, and He is righteous.
Notice that nowhere in the Bible does it say that God is *fair*. So I
know that He is loving and righteous, but sometimes following Him isn't
fair, or fun, or painless. I will have to be uncomfortable. I will have
to be inconvenienced. I may have to even endure suffering at times. But
all of it is according to His will and His good plan for us.

In my opinion, where companies *applaud* evil, I will make the most
inconveniencing efforts to distance my resources from that company.

But you will have to follow the dictates of your conscience and the pull
of the Spirit on your heart. In the end, we will all account for our
actions in this life, whether we have been washed clean by the blood of
Christ or not. I pray that God will guide our hearts to make decisions
regarding stewardship of His resources that will be pleasing to Him and
will advance the Kingdom
