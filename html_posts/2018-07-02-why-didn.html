**Why did the Dallas police take out the attacker of their officers
using a robot instead of showing their true strength and courage "mano a
mano?"**

I missed the part in the job description where it said that when
evaluating how best to stop a criminal from killing people, cops must
always use the most macho, Hollywood-style method to do so, so you can
prove to people just how much of a badass you are.

I also missed the part in the job description where it says "Gets killed
when necessary."

Yes, police work can be dangerous. But cops wear bulletproof vests
because they'd like to *not die* today. The priority is to go home at
the end of your shift, but to go home in your own car, not in the
coroner's van.
