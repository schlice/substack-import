If the website does not have your permission to post the photo over
which you have copyright, you can send them a DMCA Takedown Notice.

Larger service provider sites even have DMCA forms online that you can
simply fill out.

Of course, if they still refuse to take it down, you will have to retain
a copyright attorney and sue them for violating DMCA. So at a certain
point, the answer will come down to "you need a lawyer."
