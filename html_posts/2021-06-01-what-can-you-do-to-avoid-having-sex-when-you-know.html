**If you do want to have sex with him**, his current relationship status
is his business. It might make living where you do a little more
uncomfortable, as the live-in girlfriend may not be happy with you, but
that's really his problem, not yours. You don't know, they may have an
open relationship. If the girlfriend has a problem with it, make sure
you tell her that **he came on to you**, not the other way around. It's
not your job to turn him away simply because he's already in a
relationship. His relationship status and his willingness to step
outside of it is a reflection on him, not on you. So long as you aren't
interested in a relationship with him (considering that he's so willing
to step out on a girl he's in a relationship with; he'd do the same with
you), then go for it. Have fun. Don't expect anything more from him. If
you do it, make sure you're not expecting something more. Clearly,
you'll only end up hurt.

**If you don't want to have sex with him**, tell him so. Break his
little heart if you must. But you control when you have sex, not him.
Don't give him wiggle room here, because you will only invite him to
keep pressuring you. Be very assertive with him, and tell him you don't
want to have sex, period.

Original question:

**What can you do to avoid having sex when you know you shouldn\'t?
Background: my neighbor has been coming on to me for years and I\'ve
done everything I can to resist him because he has a girlfriend (that he
lives with).**
