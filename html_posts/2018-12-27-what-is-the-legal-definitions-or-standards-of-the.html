**What is the legal definitions or standards of the Constitution's ban
on \"foreign emoluments\"?**

Most folks are getting really close to the correct answer but missing
the most important mark.

The whole purpose of the emoluments clause is to prevent *divided
loyalty.*

The actual clause reads as follows: "no person holding any office of
profit or trust...shall, without the consent of Congress, accept...any
present, emolument, office, or title, of any kind whatever, from any
king, prince, or foreign state." We want our governmental officials to
be 100% loyal to the United States. We don't want them even partially
loyal (or beholden) to any foreign government.

Foreign emoluments, therefore, would mean receiving any form of
compensation in exchange for any form of loyalty or fealty to another
sovereign.

So let's put this into context.

- Is it a foreign emolument for President Trump to have a foreign
  official stay in Trump Tower? **NO**, by itself, it is not an
  emolument. Trump's family name is on a business, which he no longer
  personally owns (but his family still does). This is also why a blind
  trust would be pointless for Trump, but that's another answer to
  another question. Trump is still allowed to have the business bear his
  family name, even though the rest of his family runs that business.
- Is it a foreign emolument if, say, Trump allows a foreign official to
  stay at Trump Tower for a reduced rate? **NO**, again this alone does
  not constitute a foreign emolument. Trump (or his family) is allowed
  to set the prices that they charge as part of his business.
- Is it a foreign emolument if, say, Trump alters a policy decision
  based on the fact that a foreign official stayed or did not stay at
  his hotel? **YES**, this would clearly be a violation of the clause.

We want anyone to be able to be president. Business leaders should be as
qualified as career politicians who don't own hotels and can easily
dispose of any stocks/bonds/other instruments and place the assets into
blind trusts. Trump can continue to conduct business while President.
But the moment he makes a governmental decision *with respect to who
does business with him*, he's violated the Constitution.

Ultimately, it's up to Congress to monitor the relationship between
Trump's family, Trump's businesses, and Trump's executive actions.
Presumably, this is why people had the foresight to turn control of the
House over to Democrats, who are presumably more likely to scrutinize
the President more closely.
