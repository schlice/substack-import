**How hard is it to get the nomination required for the Naval Academy?**

Nominations for any service academy are similar. You apply with the
nominating official (usually your Congressman), complete an application,
and be interviewed in front of a review board.

It's not that the process is difficult, it's that you're usually up
against quite a bit of competition. When I applied, there were roughly
100 applicants from my district. I was one of **two** selected by my
Congressman, as he had two slots available at USAFA. So that year, I
literally had a **2%** chance of getting a nomination, all else being
equal.

So it's not a difficult process, but it is a very narrow gate through
which you must pass.
