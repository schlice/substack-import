**Legally, does Fox News have to specify it's not actually news but an
entertainment program?**

Please detail for me the law which requires any media outlet to
categorize any broadcast in any particular way.

But every "news" program is guilty of intermingling their "news" anchors
with their "entertainment" anchors. For any avid watcher of Fox, the
difference is easy to see. But for someone just tuning in for the first
time, it would be very difficult to tell, on first blush, that a program
is entertainment or news.

Previously, in the time of the Edward R. Murrows of the world, it was
left to news agencies to maintain their neutrality and integrity, and
they prided themselves on that.

Now that this has changed among all broadcast media, perhaps the law
should change with it. I have no idea how you implement something like
that, as the 1st Amendment will make this challenging, but it's an
interesting thought experiment.
