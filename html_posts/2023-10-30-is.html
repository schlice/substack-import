Wait, I see an error in your question there...let me fix it for you.

**Is Senator Tommy Tuberville right that servicemembers should not use
taxpayer dollars to fund abortion services, or use taxpayer dollars to
fund travel to receive abortion services in another state? What effect
will that have on the recruitment of women into the service?**

There. Fixed. I may have even removed some of the condescending tone
from it. Sorry if you didn't mean to do that.

Anyway, let's answer the revised question. Yes, Senator Tuberville is
right. No one else can use taxpayer dollars to pay for abortion, and no
one else can use taxpayer dollars to fund travel to receive abortion
services, ***because it is illegal***. The Hyde Amendment has been
appended to Congressional appropriations bills for over 40 years and has
been repeatedly approved by both Republican and Democrat Congresses. It
basically says that taxpayer dollars cannot be used to fund abortion
services. Initially, the Hyde Amendment only affected funding for
abortions under Medicaid, a state and federal health program for
low-income individuals. Because Congress reauthorizes the Hyde Amendment
annually as an attachment to the appropriations bill for HHS, it also
restricts abortion funding under the Indian Health Service, Medicare,
and the Children's Health Insurance Program. Over the years, language
similar to that in the Hyde Amendment has been incorporated into a range
of other federal programs that provide or pay for health services to
women including: the military's TRICARE program, federal prisons, the
Peace Corps, and the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. The
Affordable Care Act (ACA) also included a provision that applied similar
abortion coverage limitations to plans that are sold through the
Marketplace for women who receive federal income-based subsidies to
purchase private health insurance.

But in a shocking move, the Pentagon decided, through a policy change,
to allow servicemembers to use military "Space-A" travel to fly to
abortion-friendly states to receive abortion services, and that the
military would reimburse them for their trip expenses. This policy is,
admittedly and clearly, a violation of Federal law, and apparently no
one cares.

Well, no one except Senator Tuberville.

I'd like to say that what he's doing is Constitutional, but it is not.
The "hold" process he has placed on military promotions isn't really
supposed to be used in the way he is using it. If he has an objection to
a Pentagon policy, he can introduce legislation to clarify or alter any
law, encourage judicial resolution, or even run for president himself.
But he must abide by his constitutional oath.
