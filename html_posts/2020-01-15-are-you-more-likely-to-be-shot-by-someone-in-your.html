**Are you more likely to be shot by someone in your home if a gun is
kept there?**

Doesn't this sound like a silly question?

"Are you more likely to drown if your home has a pool?"

"Are you more likely to eat fried foods if your home has a deep fryer?"

"Are you more likely to be stabbed if your home if a kitchen knife is
there?"

There is a big difference between the statistical probability that an
action can occur and the *likelihood* that a particular action will
occur.

And there is **nearly zero** correlation between the two.

In other words, *just because a home has a gun does not increase the
likelihood that any one person will be shot in any one scenario.* For
instance, if that gun is secured properly, there is zero chance of
accidental discharge. If all of the people in the home are properly
trained and socialized on guns, then the risk of negligent discharge is
so close to zero that it is functionally zero.

Don't believe me? Just replace guns with another object in the house
that is equally as deadly: kitchen knives.

These things exist in nearly every home in America, and yet you are
never concerned when you walk into a house and you see a butcher block
with knives in it on the kitchen counter.

Yet more people are stabbed in domestic violence attacks using those
very kitchen knives than are shot.

In theory, you should be more worried when you walk into a house and see
kitchen knives than if you walk into a house in which you know a gun is
present.

But the mainstream media and gun grabbers have made it their mission to
make guns the next cigarette. They want to make the gun so socially
unacceptable that people will eventually eschew them, even though guns
are involved in fewer incidents of violence in the home than kitchen
knives, and no one is seriously seeking to ban those.
