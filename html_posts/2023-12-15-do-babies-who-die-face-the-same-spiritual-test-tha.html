Babies, as well as those who cannot comprehend right and wrong (such as
mentally disabled people), are not held accountable for their sin.

Jesus lays down this principle in John 9. In essence, God does not
condemn people for things they are unable to do. So babies, and people
who cannot comprehend right from wrong, are not held accountable for
their original sin. It is only after a person is able to recognize right
from wrong (sometimes called the age of accountability) that they are
held accountable for unbelief.
