Yes they can. I've seen it happen, as I was in the emergency vehicle
doing the "forcing."

Sometime in 1989, I was sitting in the passenger seat of a Chrysler K
car, fully equipped with a "Kojack light" when we approached a red
light, one car back from the intersection. A New York police detective
was driving. We observed what looked like a traffic accident (with
injuries) that had just taken place on the far corner of the
intersection.

The detective flipped a switch, and the Kojack light at my feet filled
the footwell with red, rotating light. "Stick that thing on the roof,
would you?" he said. I grabbed the light off of the floorboard and stuck
it out onto the roof of the car.

We then had to get to the accident, but there was a car in front of us
at the red light. The detective pushed a momentary switch on the knee
plate and the siren came on for each push. It made that sort of "woop
woop" sound you hear sometimes from police vehicles. The implication for
the driver ahead was "Please get out of my way so I can get to the scene
of the accident in front of you." The car in front of us proceeded
through the red light, past the accident, and drove off. We pulled up to
the accident to start assisting, which we primarily did by providing
first aid and calling in appropriate police and ambulance personnel.
