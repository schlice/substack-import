No, he can't stop Biden from nominating a replacement.

But he *can* make it virtually impossible for that replacement (who is
likely to be a black woman) to get a vote on the floor.

The Senate Judiciary Committee is split 11--11 between Republicans and
Democrats in a deal brokered between McConnell and Schumer. And the
nominee can only go to the floor for a vote if the Judiciary Committee
passes her on. If all 11 Republicans vote no to pass the nominee along,
and all 11 Democrats do, the nomination goes *inert*. The nomination
doesn't die, it just gets parked until a lawmaker brings it to the floor
for four hours of debate.

A majority of the Senate can then put debate about the issue on the
calendar for the next day. But this isn't a debate about the nomination,
it's a motion to discharge. It's a *cloture* motion which requires 60
Senators to approve. In other words, 10 Republicans would need to agree
to resurrect a nomination of someone who was already *effectively
blocked* by the Judiciary Committee.

So Republicans can indeed basically kill the nomination if they so
desire. And given that more than half of the 11 Republicans on the
Judiciary Committee have Presidential aspirations themselves, there's a
good chance that they will do just that.
