First, and I can't stress this enough, this is a great question to ask
your neurologist. Please don't start or change any of your medications
without consulting with your doctor. This includes supplements.

While I agree with [[Angel
Singer](https://www.quora.com/profile/Angel-Singer)]{.qlink_container}
that Vitamin D is important to people with MS, I would suggest that if
you are able, you should try to get Vitamin D the natural way. Fifteen
minutes a day of exposure to the sun is all you need to get your Vitamin
D for the day. Vitamin D supplements are tricky things; you have to work
with your doctor to get the dosing right, and too much Vitamin D can
cause other health problems, such as kidney stones in people who are
susceptible to them. Ask me how I know.

Supplements I would suggest, which are safe and effective to start any
time:

- Cod Liver Oil. Fish oil has great benefits to both the brain and the
  immune system. But again, try to get your omega 3 oils the natural
  way: make sure you're eating fish which are naturally full of good
  fats, like salmon, halibut, herring, tuna, and of course, cod.
- Don't believe the hype! Fat does not make you fat! You need
  cholesterol in your diet because it feeds your brain. Your brain cells
  are swathed in fatty substances made from primarily cholesterol. Make
  sure you eat whole foods and meats which contain actual fat, like
  chicken with the skin (not necessarily fried though), buffalo,
  venison, and uncured bacon.
- Make sure your veggies are whole and you eat enough of them; most
  people do not. Good veggies are plentiful, and include broccoli, kale,
  Brussels sprouts, Romaine lettuce, asparagus, collard greens,
  radishes, cucumbers, spinach, artichokes, onions, carrots, bok choy,
  etc.
- Fruits should be whole and plentiful. Good ones to eat are apples,
  oranges, kiwis, grapefruits, strawberries, blueberries, avocados
  (which also have good fat), honeydew, papayas, raspberries, oranges,
  mangos, nectarines, cranberries, apricots, etc.

AVOID these things:

- Any oil listed as hydrogenated. This produces TRANS FATS, which are
  the actual fats which are bad for you. Any vegetable oil which is
  heated at all will form trans fats and will also denature and become
  carcinogenic. Olive oil heated to more than medium heat will denature
  and is actually bad for you. And the big one, partially hydrogenated
  anything is bad. If you need fats to cook with, use whole, real
  butter, or coconut oil.
- Artificial sweeteners. The killer here is high fructose corn syrup.
  Anything with HFCS should be avoided like the plague. Stay away from
  all artificial sweeteners. One exception: stevia. So long as you use
  whole stevia extract (and avoid the stevia mixed with artificial
  sweeteners like Mannitol or Sorbitol or Glycerol or Dextrose), you're
  in good shape. Stevia may have some neuroprotective effetcs. Also okay
  but in moderation: whole cane sugar, or cane juice.
- Artificial colors, which have been linked to neurological disorders.
  Stay away from any foods which contain FD&C colors at all, but the
  biggies are Yellow 5 and Red 40.
