***If a criminal is not equal to his deed then why should a punishment
equal to the deed be applied to the criminal?***

Your use of the word "equal" in the two thoughts is incorrect.

A criminal is only equal to his deed in that he is the impetus behind
the deed. The criminal is not "bad," the deed was "bad."

A punishment is never equal to the deed. If that were the case, the
punishment for theft would be for the government to steal something of
equal value from you. The punishment for rape would be to have someone
rape you.

Punishments are **equitable,** not **equal**. Punishments are measured
by the deed, but they punish the criminal for committing the deed.
Punishments, therefore, are only tangentially tied to the deed, but
primarily punish the person committing the deed.
