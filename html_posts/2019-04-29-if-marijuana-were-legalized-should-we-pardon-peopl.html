**If marijuana were legalized, should we pardon people serving sentences
for misdemeanor offenses and remove them from their criminal records?**

It makes sense that it would be "fair" to go back in time and
retroactively remove all of those sentences and expunge those records.

But laws generally don't work that way.

Charges are applicable from the time the offense was committed.
Basically, if it was illegal when you did it, then you are still guilty,
even if the offense is removed later on.
