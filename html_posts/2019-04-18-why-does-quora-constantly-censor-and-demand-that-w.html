**Why does Quora constantly censor and demand that we waive our rights
under the 1st and 4th Amendment?**

Quora is a private organization and is not subject to the 1st or 4th
Amendments. Those amendments prevent the **government** from taking
actions that violate your rights. Private businesses can conduct their
private business in whatever way they choose; you don't have a right to
free speech on someone else's platform.

Additionally, you agreed to the user policy and the community rules when
you joined Quora. It's a little hard to argue that their policies are
unfair after you agreed to follow them.

**Libel isn\'t protected even on the internet, but our right to privacy
is and an opposing answer with facts isn\'t libel nor violates it.**

Something else you clearly don't understand about Quora: **The community
owns questions. The answerer owns his or her own answer.**

This is why you can freely edit any question (since the community owns
it once it is asked), but the answerer owns his or her own answer, along
with any comments he or she may or may not permit to his answer. On
Quora, you can answer a question, and you don't even have to allow
comments to your answer. There is no right to be able to post comments.

However, libel is lying about someone or something which causes
demonstrable harm. You can actually commit libel in an answer, if the
victim can prove that your lie harmed them in some way. I can't comment
about whether or not this could happen with something you posted, but
libel is always a potential issue in any forum or any medium in which
you can print things about someone else. Libel is a separate legal issue
which is really outside of Quora's purview. However, if they are
informed of a libelous post of any kind, they have the right to take it
down and retain it for appropriate legal action.

Again, it's their forum, you're just a willing participant.
