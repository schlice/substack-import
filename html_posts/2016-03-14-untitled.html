**Content:** []{.rendered_qtext}

It seems to be reprehensible to ask a rape victim of any age to pay for
the child created during that attack. It seems to be **more**
reprehensible to ask a statutory rape victim to pay for the child,
especially when they were not legally able to consent to the sex act.
Then asking them to pay for the child that was created from that sex act
is ludicrous.

Remember though, like I mentioned, the child support doesn\'t benefit
the rapist, nor is it is not punitive damages for a rape victim. It is
designed to ensure a child is cared for. Regardless of how the child
came into being, there is still a child there, and the state has a
vested interest in ensuring the welfare of children.
