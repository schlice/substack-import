**What criteria are needed to subpoena email and phone records when
questionable coincidences appear to suggest a wide-ranging conspiracy
given the limited amount of direct proof the employee might possibly
have?**

Not enough detail to answer.

You did say "employee," so if you're talking about an employer, they
already have the right to review every email and phone call you have
made on their system. As a matter of fact, they do it every day, albeit
in a mostly automated fashion. But if you're talking about using an
employer's email and phone system, they already have those records, and
you consented to their monitoring of your email and phone (and Internet
use) when you logged in. It's usually posted in a logon banner that you
probably absent-mindedly click through. What it would take an employer
to look at email and phone records is desire. They already have
authority.

If you're not talking about an employee, the only way to subpoena email
and phone records is with a subpoena. You get one of those when there is
an investigation. In most cases, that investigation is in conjunction
with a lawsuit, or when the district attorney is conducting a criminal
investigation. The criteria, therefore, would be either a criminal
investigation or a subpoena pursuant to discovery in a lawsuit.
