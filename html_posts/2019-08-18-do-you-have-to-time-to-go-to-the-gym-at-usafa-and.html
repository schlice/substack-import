**Do you have to time to go to the gym at USAFA,**

Yes. While your time is limited and you are indeed very busy, there is
some time in your schedule that you can go to the gym. Generally, that's
going to be in the afternoon, after classes and after any participatory
sports (intramurals or intercollegiate, you'll do one or the other) you
may have on that day, until you either go to dinner, or between dinner
and Academic Call to Quarters (ACQ). ACQ (or Ac Call) is at 2000, or
8:00 pm. It lasts for three hours every night, and should be used for
study time. If you are on Academic Probation, you *must* use that time
for academics. If you are not on Academic Probation, the time is,
somewhat, more flexible, although you get to structure that time as you
see fit. You must be in the Cadet Area, but you can be down at the gym
(or in my case sometimes, the ice arena).

Summer hours are more limited, but cadets still have eight hours a day
(from roughly 11:00 am until 7:00 pm six days a week) to use the gym.

**and is it as good as a commercial gym?**

It's not as good as a commercial gym. It's **way better.** The gym
facilities at the Air Force Academy are *world-class.*

In fact, beginning in 2012, the cadet gym got a 50,000 square foot
upgrade.

The gym now boasts some of the finest workout equipment available,
including a cybex room, climbing walls, cardio equipment, physical
fitness testing room, and a brand-new weight room. The Air Force spent
\$9.5 million on the upgrade, which was desperately needed, as the
facility hadn't been upgraded since it was installed in the late 50s to
service no more than 2,200 male cadets.

The new facilities include upgraded locker room facilities, and a new
swimming pool area and fencing area improvements.

The upgrades to the gym included donations from commercial corporations
(along with the Academy's traditional food budget) to include a wellness
area which includes snacks and sports and nutrition drinks,
appropriately dubbed "Falcon Fuel." In mid-2014, the NCAA ruled that
student athletes may consume "unlimited" snacks and meals in conjunction
with their athletic participation. To that end, cadets have full access
to these stations, to provide appropriate nutrition during and after
their workouts.
