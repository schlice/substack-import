**Can it be proven that a police officer neglected to turn their body
camera on before shooting someone in a court of law?**

No, in general it cannot be proven that a police officer neglected to
turn their body-worn camera (BWC) on before a shooting, at least not
beyond a reasonable doubt. And most cameras are very simplistic in their
feedback to the user, so while there may be a hard switch to turn it on
and off, there is really very little to indicate that it is actually
recording something. You'll really only know this for sure when you plug
it in at the end of your shift and attempt to download the video.
Therefore, it is very easy to produce reasonable doubt, and very
difficult to prove that an officer willfully neglected to turn the
camera on, or even accidentally neglected to do so.

**Are and should there be any laws forbidding this?**

In general, there should not be law surrounding this. Generally, there
are department policies that require camera use in certain situations in
departments that currently field BWCs to their officers, and this is
rightly where the policy should be maintained. These policies are
greatly dependent on the amount of storage space available to the
department to maintain the video footage, as this is the largest cost to
the department. Camera maintenance and upkeep will be a factor, but not
nearly as much of a factor as video storage.

When law is involved, it mandates monetary expenditures, and most often,
the law itself doesn't come with money attached to it. It's what we call
an "unfunded mandate," and if funding is not provided, it can chew up a
significant portion of a department's budget just to keep up with the
new laws, which will mean taking funding from other areas of the
department.
