By "opened tabs," it sounds like you\'re talking about the Samsung
internet browser. If that\'s the case, down in the bar at the bottom of
your screen will be an open tabs indicator. When you click that, you
will see a listing of all of your open tabs. If you click the triple dot
menu in the upper right hand corner of the tab management page, the
first option will be "close all tabs\".

If, by open tabs, you mean all of your open apps in your phone, the way
to close those is to click the apps view button in your bottom bar.

On modern versions of OneUI, just swipe up from the bottom of the
screen.

Once you click that, you will see all of your open apps, and a big
button underneath that says "close all."
