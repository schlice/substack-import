The military is not a democracy because often, superiors have to give
subordinates distasteful orders. They may even have to give orders that
they have a reasonable suspicion might result in their men being
injured. Or dying. But those orders must still be given, and those
orders must be obeyed, without question. \"The discipline which makes
the soldiers of a free country reliable in battle\" is only achieved
when soldiers, sailors, and airmen follow orders.

We have a structure of rank, and a system by which lower-ranking
personnel are ***subordinate*** to higher-ranking personnel. This means
that when the higher-ranking personnel provide orders, the lower ranking
person is required by military law to follow them, unless they are
unlawful orders.

A democracy in the military simply wouldn\'t work.

That said, I heed the famously misattributed words of Patton: \"No
bastard ever won a war by dying for his country. He won it by making the
other poor bastard die for his country.\"
