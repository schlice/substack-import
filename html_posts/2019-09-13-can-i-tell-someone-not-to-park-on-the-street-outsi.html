(US Answer)

First of all, you can tell anyone anything you like. First Amendment and
all.

Secondly, in most cities and in most places where people live, you can
*ask* people to not park in front of your house. But since you don\'t
own the street, you can\'t *compel* people to park somewhere else.

Note that in some places, you *may* indirectly own the street, like if
you live in a gated community. In that case, parking in front of your
house *may* be controlled by your HOA. If you do live there, check your
HOA rules to learn more about parking.
