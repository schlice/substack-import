The answer, as with all legal answers, is "it depends." But if your
"something suspicious" doesn't rise to the level of probable cause, they
cannot search inside the home, and certainly not without a warrant.

There are some exceptions to the need to get a warrant. Here's a few
examples:

- Is the "something suspicious" they see accompanied by sounds from
  inside the home which would indicate to a reasonable person that
  someone was hurt or injured inside and needed medical assistance or
  was otherwise in trouble?
- Is someone in the house on parole?
- Did someone in the house give permission to search?

In other words, are there "exigent circumstances" that would lead a
reasonable person to believe that a crime was taking place, or was about
to take place, or someone was hurt, or a fugitive was about to escape,
or evidence was about to be destroyed? If so (and if the officer can
articulate that suspicion in court), then he can search without a
warrant.

But all of those things amount to "probable cause" in some way. There
must always be probable cause, either through exigency, or a warrant. A
police officer cannot search a home without probable cause if he wants
any of the evidence to be admissible in court.

Also don't forget, he doesn't have to tell you what his probable cause
is. He only has to tell the judge.
