**How long must you stop at a stop sign?**

The vehicle must completely cease motion. The way this is visualized is
that the tires will stop turning. Once the vehicle has ceased its
forward motion, you can check the intersection to see if it is clear to
proceed. Then you may proceed with forward motion again.

So the answer is that you must stop long enough for your vehicle to come
to a complete stop and for you to check for cross traffic.
