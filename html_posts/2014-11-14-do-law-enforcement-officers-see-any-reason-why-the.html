**Content:** [Continuous recording of one person and his actions is a
burden that no other profession endures. Continuous recording would mean
continuous, in all places at all times. So for every bathroom break or
pit stop, the camera is rolling. That is definitely a burden that we
don\'t place on anyone, anywhere, and I don\'t expect we\'d place that
same burden on our law enforcement officers.\
\
There has to be a system that balances the desire for on-body video from
the officer\'s perspective (the public frequently videos officers
performing their duties, sometimes in the hopes that they\'ll catch the
officer doing something illegal) with the desire for officers to be able
to control when the video is running and when it is not.\
\
The on-body system produced by TASER (the same group that produces the
stun devices which bear their name) is pretty good. The officer wears a
head-mounted camera (usually attached to sunglasses, but can be attached
to any eyewear or possibly a hat). The system is wired to a playing-card
sized recorder the officer wears on his belt. It also has a remote
start/stop button which can be run to somewhere on their body, usually
on their shirt.\
\
When they push the button to start the recording for the on-body system,
it takes the previous 30-seconds of video, *sans audio*, and prepends it
to the video. Yes, this means the video is running all the time, but it
only uses the previous 30 seconds of **video-only** after the officer
presses the button. From the button press forward, the full interaction
is recorded until the button is pressed again. It could, in theory,
record continuously from that point on if the officer does not stop the
recording. The unit makes a very quiet beep every 30 seconds or so to
remind the officer that he is recording.\
\
The idea is that you start the recording when you begin a contact with
someone. You\'ll get 30 seconds of video before the button press, but
you\'ll get everything from the button press forward.\
\
At the end of the shift, the recorder is checked back in to a cradle at
the station. The video is uploaded to a central server and the unit is
wiped and recharged for the next officer to use. The pre-roll video is
never kept; it is only used when the button is pressed.\
\
Additionally, the officer can only view the video after the unit is
checked in; the unit has a proprietary docking connector which means
that the officer cannot view or edit the video until after the video is
checked in. This ensures a chain of custody and allows the videos to be
admissible in court. The in-car cameras work the same way; the hard
drive is checked out at the beginning of the shift and checked back in
at the end; the video cannot be viewed until after the unit is checked
in]{.rendered_qtext}
