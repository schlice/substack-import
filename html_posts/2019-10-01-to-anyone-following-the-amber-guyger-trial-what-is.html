**To anyone following the Amber Guyger trial: What is your opinion about
what the verdict should be? How would you vote if you were a juror?**

So there are two things at issue here.

1.  Was her belief that she was in her own apartment reasonable?
2.  Did she act in accordance with the law based on the information she
    had at the time?

I think you can fairly honestly find that her belief was not reasonable.
There were many clues that she was not in her own apartment. There was a
skylight (his apartment was on the top floor, hers was one floor down).
There was a red floormat in his, not in hers. There were plenty of clues
as to whether or not she was not in the right apartment. A reasonable
person should have known that they were in the wrong apartment.

However, and this is a very very important point: **the courts do not
question the basis of a person's belief before using that belief in the
adjudication of laws where one must believe something in order for it to
apply.** For example, before you can use deadly force against a person,
you must believe that your life is in danger. Your life may not have
*objectively* been in danger. It may not have even passed the reasonable
person test (i.e. would a reasonable person have believed the same way).
That person may have been holding a BB gun, or a cell phone, or an ice
cream scoop, but you still *believed* that it was a gun, and you
*believed* that your life was in danger. The operative factor is whether
or not the defendant believed that his or her life was in danger.

In this case, Amber Guyger believed she was entering her own apartment.
Even if that belief was unreasonable, she believed it.

To that end, she acted in accordance with the law in defending herself
in a location she believed to be her own.

So while it is a terrible tragedy, it is not murder. She should not be
convicted of a crime. The Castle Doctrine should protect her from
criminal charges.

That said:

1.  Once the family raises the civil trial, she will almost definitely
    be found culpable for the wrongful death of the man.
2.  She will also lose her job and will never work in law enforcement
    again.
3.  She may also face a Federal civil rights violation case, which she
    should clearly lose as well.

So don't think for a second that just because she should not be
convicted of a crime that she gets to walk away from this scot-free. She
will never work in law enforcement again and she will lose every asset
she owns. She'll be lucky to find gainful employment anywhere but in the
service industry on the other side of the country after she legally
changes her name. Her life, as it is today, is effectively over.
