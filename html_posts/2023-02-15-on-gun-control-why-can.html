Okay, let's assume that you could sneak in an unconstitutional law
banning all guns.

Let's run through what happens.

1.  Person buys a gun, legally (he thinks).
2.  Person walks out of the gun store and is immediately arrested,
    citing the new law you just sneakily passed which makes purchasing
    guns illegal.
3.  Person goes to trial and is prosecuted under the new law.
4.  Person appeals the decision, claiming that the law is
    unconstitutional because it violates the 2nd Amendment.
5.  Appeals court agrees, law is struck down

So, what was the result of this little exercise?

- Your law is gone
- People find out who passed this unconstitutional law.
- You are outed as an anti-Constitutional lawmaker who tries to skirt
  the law for his own purposes
- You all get voted out of office the next time elections come around.

So if you are trying to get yourself kicked out of office, then this is
a good plan.
