1.  They already do, but rather than dropping a massive fuel bomb on
    some unsuspecting city population when an airliner has an emergency,
    they just drop the fuel, *sans* tank. Aircraft can "dump" their fuel
    from the fuel tanks in an emergency. The fuel vaporizes in the
    atmosphere and generally is not a factor to anyone or anything
    below.
2.  Added drag on the outside of the aircraft increases fuel use, and is
    generally not advisable.
