Of course they do! It's a natural human emotion. We all have an innate
sense of "fairness" and "balance" that we believe should exist in the
world. It does not. That doesn't stop us from believing it should. That
sense helps to guide us. But that sense is often at odds with logic.
Gandhi said, "An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind."

Our system of justice is blind (or it's supposed to be). We weigh the
facts and determine if there is enough of it to find someone guilty. If
not, they are "not guilty," not innocent. Those are two different
concepts.

Nevertheless, it's natural to want revenge. It's logical to suppress
that desire and allow the justice system to work.
