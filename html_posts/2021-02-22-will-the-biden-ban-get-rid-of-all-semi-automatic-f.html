**Will the Biden ban get rid of all semi-automatic firearms or just
ARs?**

Since there has not been a concrete piece of legislation to consider,
just Biden's words, we really don't know. There are some older pieces of
failed legislation that the House hopes to revive, but nothing has come
out of committee yet.

On 14 Feb 2021 (the third anniversary of the Parkland shooting), Biden
took the opportunity to call for Congress to pass reforms to gun laws:

> Today, I am calling on Congress to enact commonsense gun law reforms,
> including requiring background checks on all gun sales, banning
> assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, and eliminating immunity
> for gun manufacturers who knowingly put weapons of war on our streets.

So let's review the three points in his statement:

**Universal background checks:** We can examine this one fairly clearly
as we know why they were never implemented in the first place: **cost**.
A National Instant Criminal Background Check system, open to anyone who
wants it, would be prohibitively costly and rife with abuse.

The system would be far too expensive to build out now, and you can't
expand our current NICS system and allow unfettered access; you would
have to build a new one from scratch. The cost was too much then, and it
would be even more now.

Additionally, despite rules prohibiting it, it would be used for more
than just gun transfers. Employers would use it when hiring people. Dads
would use it before their daughters went on dates. People in the dating
scene would use it to screen potential dates. And anyone could use it on
anyone for whom Social Security numbers are accessible. While those all
sound very enticing, and some maybe even desirable, the privacy
implications are really scary, and not something that the general public
is really interested in.

Finally, universal background checks for **every** gun transfer are
unworkable. For example, if I want to gift a rifle to my 18 year old
son, I need to run a background check on my son. If I want to get that
cute little pink Ruger LCP (look it up) for my wife, I need to run a
background check on my wife. If I need to store my firearms safely at my
friend's house because I'm being evacuated from mine (true story), I
would need a background check on my friend. And what would that hope to
accomplish? Would we be safer because of it? Is there a rash of
transfers from father to son or husband to wife that is leading directly
to lawless action? It's really just a hindrance to lawful gun owners.

It's probably also telling that in the four states which have enacted
universal background checks by law, compliance has hovered around 5%.
It's really an unworkable system.

**Banning assault weapons and high capacity magazines:** How onerous or
useless this is really depends on the definition of "assault weapons"
and "high-capacity magazines."

If "assault weapons" are defined as flimsily as they were in the past,
with only cosmetic features making up the lion's share of restrictions
(collapsible stocks, pistol grips, barrel shrouds, mounting lugs, etc),
then they will only spawn a rash of accessories which function the same,
but "look" less scary, and are narrowly legal. It won't stop anything at
all. Same with "high-capacity magazines." Does that mean a standard
30-round mag like my M4 takes, or does that mean the 100-round drum mag
piece of crap? Because if you limit magazines to 10 rounds, all it does
is make me reload more; it does literally nothing to slow me down. I can
switch mags in a little more than a second, and I'm right back to
firing. With practice, I could do it faster.

Besides, we already tried it, and it did nothing. The Assault Weapons
Ban put in place during Clinton's administration was proven to have ZERO
effect on gun violence. None. It did not accomplish anything that it set
out to do, so it was allowed to expire.

**Eliminating immunity for gun manufacturers who knowingly put weapons
of war on our streets.** Wow. The President of the United States
actually mis-characterized what an existing law does, just so he can
score political brownie points. Oh yeah, just another day in Washington.

The PLCAA (Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act), which Biden is
calling on to be repealed, prevents people from suing gun manufacturers
when people use their products illegally. The Act was passed after a
spate of lawsuits against gun manufacturers to try to hold them
accountable when people misused their firearms. They were also designed
to make participation in the marketplace too costly for gun
manufacturers to continue their business. However, today, just as then,
you can't hold a company liable if someone misuses your product. Even if
the bill is repealed, and someone tries to sue a gun manufacturer when a
crazed gunman misuses their product, the gun manufacturer will prevail,
because they cannot prevent anyone from misusing their product and
harming people. What's next, suing Ford when I get hit by a drunk
driver? The only person responsible for a criminal's bad actions is that
criminal. Searching for deeper pockets to assuage your grief or to try
to disrupt lawful commerce because you personally find a product
distasteful is repugnant to free enterprise. Yes life is precious. No,
you don't have the right to disrupt lawful commerce because you disagree
with a company's product.
