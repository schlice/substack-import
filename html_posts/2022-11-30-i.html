I'm also a right-wing anti-communist, and I don't deny that the climate
is changing. The climate has been changing for millions of years.

I simply question the degree to which humans are actually influencing
that change. And the science is decidedly unclear on that account.

And I question whether we should *literally bankrupt our country* in
order to potentially have an impact on climate change when it's changing
anyway and we can't stop it. Just a simple cost/benefit analysis. Again,
this is not quickly forthcoming.
