**Is Florida\'s suggested shooting of rioters who break into houses
constitutionally acceptable?**

Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd said that there is a difference between a
protester and a rioter. One is legally exercising his First Amendment
rights, and the other is a criminal.

Florida has a *very* strong Castle Doctrine. Florida law states
*unequivocally* that a criminal who forcibly enters or intrudes into
your home or occupied vehicle is, *by law*, presumed to be there to
cause death or great bodily harm. Therefore, a person may use any manner
of force, including deadly force, against that criminal.

Since that person is breaking into my house to either kill me or do me
great bodily harm (or burn my house, which would also do the same), I
can use whatever force I choose, up to and including deadly force, to
stop them.

My ability to protect my own life and the lives of my family members is
most certainly acceptable under the Constitution, which guarantees me
the right to life, and to not have my life unlawfully removed from me.
