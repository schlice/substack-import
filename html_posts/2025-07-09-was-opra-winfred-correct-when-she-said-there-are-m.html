Not only was Oprah's statement wrong, but it's **unloving** to even
suggest such a thing.

Here's an example to underscore what I'm saying.

Let's say I just flew in to a massive international airport. It's huge,
there's gates everywhere, and I don't read the local language. I just
want to find the gate that's going to take me home.

I ask someone like Oprah, and she says "Sure, you can take any gate!
They'll all get you home!" So I take a gate, and I end up someplace even
farther away from home.

Whereas if I asked a Christian, they'd say "D14 is your gate. That's the
gate you need to get home." But then I say, "But what about all these
other gates? Won't they get me home too? It's not very inclusive of you
to disregard all these other gates. Can't I get home through one of
these gates?"

In that situation, is it more loving for the person to present the truth
about which gate will get me home, or is it more loving to try to be
inclusive of all of the gates, even if they don't get me home?

There aren't a million ways to get to heaven. Jesus said so very
clearly.

> *Jesus said to him, "I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one
> comes to the Father except through me. \-- John 14:6 ESV*

If Jesus is *credible*, then what He says is true. Unless you believe
Jesus is a liar. To date, there is no proof that Jesus is a liar. So the
question is: ***is Jesus credible?***

Well, ask yourself this:

- Has anyone else's life been prophesied so heavily, and had all of
  those prophecies come true in His life?
- Has anyone else performed miracles to prove He is God?
- Has anyone else predicted and then accomplished His own resurrection?

Jesus appeared to hundreds of people after He was raised from the dead.
Those hundreds of people were willing to suffer and die for that belief,
when all they would have had to do to save themselves would have been to
recant their stories, yet they didn't. They were willing to die for
their belief, which means that, at the very least, they all actually
believed it. They didn't think it was a lie, because while people may be
willing to die for a belief they think is true, no one is willing to die
for a lie they know is a lie.

The fulfilled prophecies, the miracles, the resurrection, and the
eyewitness accounts of His appearance after He was resurrected make His
story ***credible.***

Because Jesus is ***credible***, what He says is true.

Jesus says that there is only one way to heaven. Therefore, it would be
***unloving*** to tell anyone any different.
