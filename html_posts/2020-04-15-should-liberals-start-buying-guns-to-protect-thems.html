**Original question:\
Should liberals start buying guns to protect themselves from
Trumpistas?**

Liberals should start buying guns to protect themselves from **people
who want to kill them**.

It's a proven fact that murderers are not limited to people who agree
with the president.

If I were liberal, I'd buy a gun to protect myself from anyone who
wanted to harm me or my family. Then later on we can talk politics.
