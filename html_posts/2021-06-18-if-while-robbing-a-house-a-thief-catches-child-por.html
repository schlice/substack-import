The answer is, in the United States, yes.

So long as the thief was not acting as an agent of the government at the
time he saw the evidence, it can be turned over to the police.

Even if the information was illegally obtained (i.e. the person was a
hacker, and while in the course of hacking into the victim's computer to
install malware, he stumbled across the kiddie porn), it is still
admissible.

Original question:

If while robbing a house, a thief catches child porn on the victim\'s
computer, is that grounds for a search warrant?
