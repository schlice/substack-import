**Can a negative actually be proven to standards that will be upheld in
a court of law?**

In law, the "burden of proof" standard is probably what you're talking
about. And as many have already answered here, yes you can most
certainly prove that someone did not do something using the "burden of
proof" standard.

In philosophy is often found the phrase "you can't prove a negative."
However, this is different from a legal standard, because when we
discuss this concept philosophically, we're actually talking about
affirmatively proving the non-existence of something. The difference
between this and a positive claim is that it takes only one example to
demonstrate the positive claim, whereas to affirmatively prove the
non-existence of something, you must be omniscient and omnipresent
(being all-knowing in all places at all times) in order to show that the
something does not exist and has never existed, which simply cannot be
done. This is not what we're doing in a legal context, so "proving a
negative" is not actually what we're doing in a court of law.

The common example used to illustrate this principle is the "red eagle"
example. I can claim that red eagles exist, and you can claim that red
eagles do not exist (an affirmative claim of non-existence). In order
for me to prove my claim, I simply need to show some evidence that red
eagles exist or have existed at one point in time. In order to
affirmatively prove that red eagles do not exist, you must be present in
all places at all times in order to show that there were never any red
eagles that existed, which is clearly an untenable position.
