**Content:** [The vast majority of citizens don\'t live in fear of the
police. Some people do, because they have lived their lives in such a
way as to draw negative attention from the police. Some people do
because they are perpetually fearful of authority. And some people do
because they are just mentally unstable. But the vast majority of the
population are good, honest, hard-working citizens who deserve
protection.\
\
Your notion of police-citizen relations is skewed. I can say that
because I grew up in the Tri-State area. And my dad was a cop there.\
\
I saw the good cops and I saw the bad cops. I saw what the cops there
did when no one was looking, so I know what good cops and bad cops look
like. I could tell stories, but what would be the point of that? I also
know that many police ***administrations*** in that area of the country
were bureaucratic nightmares in which corruption was rampant, but at the
line level, it was very infrequent. It happened, and more so in the
Tri-State area than in other parts of the country, but not more so than
other departments around the country, on average. Remember that those
areas of the country have a much higher number of people living there
than in other areas around the country, and things \*appear\* to happen
more frequently there because there is a larger population there, as
well as a larger police force.\
\
But cops are people too, and cops have good days and bad days.\
\
If you\'re spending your entire life living in fear of the police,
you\'re not living right, and you\'re wasting your fear on the police.\
\
Cops don\'t want to bother you! They\'d rather do *less* paperwork than
*more*. So remember, if you\'re stopped by the police, relax, do what is
asked (up to a point), and you\'ll be fine. You can\'t take a few bad
apples and generalize to the whole population. How your particular
interaction with the police goes is mostly up to you and how you
respond.]{.rendered_qtext}
