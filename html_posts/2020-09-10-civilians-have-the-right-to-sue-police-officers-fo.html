**Civilians have the right to sue police officers for excessive use of
force?**

You cannot directly sue a police officer. Police are protected by what
is known as "qualified immunity" which allows them to do their jobs
without fear of being sued for doing so.

However, they have to do their job. If they act outside of their job,
they are no longer protected.

The law says that the police are allowed to use **reasonable force** to
subdue an individual, given the circumstances (a combative individual
will require more force to subdue). The courts have never explicitly
defined what constitutes excessive force, so it is analyzed on a case by
case basis.

The particular law in question here is the federal Civil Rights Act of
1871. Basically, it says that no person acting under the authority of
the law has the right to deprive a citizen of their civil rights under
the Constitution. So you can file a lawsuit in Federal court alleging
that your civil rights were violated. You must prove that the force was
excessive. The court will have to look at the details of the crime and
whether or not you posed a threat to the officers. It compares the
details of the crime and the response to what a "reasonable" police
officer would do.

If you feel that police force was excessive, you should talk to a civil
rights attorney, particularly one with experience in police misconduct.
