**Could drinking too many sodas or other sweetened beverages each day
worsen symptoms for people with multiple sclerosis?**

The answer to the specific question is no, soda does not make MS worse.

The answer to the more general question is that soda in general,
especially if it is sweetened with sugar, is bad for you.

The carbonation process creates carbonic acid, which is great for
preserving the stuff inside the can, but not the best for the stuff
inside your body, let alone the enamel on your teeth. It's also got
sugar, which is terrible for you. Liquid sugar is even worse. If you
want to get real fat, real quick, soda is a great way to do it.

Diet or sugar-free soda is better, but watch what it's sweetened with.
Aspartame is not terrible, but sucralose isn't great, and neither is
saccharin. Stevia is your best bet, but not too many sodas are sweetened
with stevia yet.
