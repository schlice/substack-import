**How could it be Trumps fault that people are purchasing fewer trees?**

I have no idea, especially because the quoted article blames the Great
Recession for the rise in tree prices. From the article:

> *Christmas tree farms often cut down trees only as they are sold.
> Because the farms sold fewer trees during the recession, they had less
> space in which to plant new ones. Nearly 10 years later, the trees
> that should have been planted then are not around to be cut in a
> better sales climate.*

If this is true, then Trump had nothing to do with rising prices of
Christmas trees. He had nothing to do with causing the Great Recession.
In fact, Trump the businessman was hit just as hard by the Recession as
everyone else.
