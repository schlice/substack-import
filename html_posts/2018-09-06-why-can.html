**Why can't you donate blood if you have multiple sclerosis?**

In the past, you could not donate blood if you had MS. Up until
recently, American Red Cross guidelines excluded people with MS from
donating blood.

However, as of May, 2007, those guidelines were updated, since no
scientific evidence exists to show that MS is contagious or can be
transmitted by blood. So long as other qualifications are met, and there
are no local or FDA restrictions, an otherwise healthy person with MS is
permitted to donate blood.

For more details about other eligibility requirements, see the [[Red
Cross
website](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=2bc608&url=https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/how-to-donate/eligibility-requirements.html){.external_link
