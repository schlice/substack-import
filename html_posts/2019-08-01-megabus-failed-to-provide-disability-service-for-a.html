I am going to presume you took your Megabus trip in the United States.
If you did not, you will have to seek answers from an attorney in the
country in which you reserved and started/ended the trip.

If you feel you have a case, you should absolutely contact a civil
rights attorney in your area, preferably one who specializes in cases
involving the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). You stated that the
fact that she couldn't use her wheelchair on board caused her suffering.
If you can detail exactly how she suffered because Megabus failed to
properly account for her disability, then you may have a case.

I strongly suggest you contact a civil rights attorney in your area as
soon as possible.
