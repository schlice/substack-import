**How should a homeowner respond when a contractor does substandard
work, then doesn't even complete the job, but slaps a contractor lien on
the home so it can't be solved?**

Time to get a lawyer.

You have literally no option but to file suit against the contractor
claiming that the original contract was never fulfilled because the work
did not meet the standard to fulfill the contract.

The lien which flowed from the contractor failing to get paid should be
dismissed once the contractor is forced to either fulfill the terms of
the original contract or to walk away with nothing.

The only way to effect this sort of determination is with a lawyer.
