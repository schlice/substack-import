**Content:** [Your nephew has parents (albeit absentee), which is more
than can be said for most children in the foster care system, who are
either dead or in jail.\
\
I think you sitting down with the child\'s parents and explaining to
them that you are basically raising this child and they better get with
it or they are going to miss out on some of the best times in a child\'s
life.\
\
You can offer to them that you adopt the child, but there isn\'t a court
in the world that\'s going to award you custody when both biological
parents are actively part of the child\'s life (i.e. they are there
daily, regardless of how little attention they pay to their own child).\
\
Maybe the parents are taking you for granted. Maybe they are relying on
you way too much. Maybe you should limit your childcare to the times
when they are at work, and maybe they should be taking care of the child
beyond that.\
\
But forcing the courts to get involved is not a good situation. You\'re
much better off talking it out with them then trying to force their
hand.]{.rendered_qtext}
