**How do we get our HOA to enforce rules and regulations?**

Contact them. Advise them of rules which are being violated. Ask them
for a specific response as to what they are doing about those rules.

Attend a board meeting. Board meetings are open to members (although
they may enter Executive Session to discuss specifics about homeowners
and maintain confidentiality). Ask them what the purpose of the HOA
actually is if they're not going to enforce their own rules.

Selective enforcement is actually worse than non-enforcement. When an
HOA selectively enforces rules, it can be very bad for them. In essence,
if they can't state a reason for selective enforcement, then ***none***
of their enforcement of anything is valid.
