**Content:** [*In this answer, I differentiate \"in the military\" with
\"not in the military\" by differentiating commissioned officers and
NCOs as \"in the military\" and military contractors and civilians as
\"not in the military\". Basically, if you wear the uniform to work,
you\'re in the military. If you wear a suit to work, you\'re not in the
military. Civilians and contractors don\'t \"join the army.\" They join
civilian corporations that work for the Army. They may work alongside
their military counterparts in military installations, but they are not
military. I will be discussing non-combat career fields in the
military.*\
\
Everyone in the military is a soldier/sailor/airman first, and a
specialist next. No one is a \"non-soldier.\" I know you meant no
offense by that question, but we are all soldiers. Wearing the uniform
puts you in the same category as so many others who have come before
giving their lives for their country. Wearing the uniform makes you a
soldier, regardless of what job you have to do in the military. Not
everyone is on the front lines. Not everyone flies the planes or drives
the sub or shoots the missiles. There are many cogs in the military
machine, and all have important jobs.\
\
Perfect example: In 1992, the drawdown from Desert Storm meant that the
number of pilot slots for Undergraduate Pilot Training (UPT) for the
USAFA Class of 1994 went from over 1,000 down to 225. This meant that
roughly 75% of the over 1,000 pilot qualified cadets were not going to
fly.\
\
When this news was presented to the class, they gave us an extra week to
decide whether or not we wanted to stay at the Academy, knowing that we
were, more likely than not, not going to fly. This was a tough decision
for many cadets who spent their lives dreaming of \"Top Gun\" and about
wearing the flight suit and the leather jacket.\
\
This taught us a valuable lesson, something that many other classes at
the Academy simply didn\'t get. You are officers first, and pilots next.
Your college major doesn\'t matter. Your chosen career field doesn\'t
matter. You are all officers first. Graduating from the Academy doesn\'t
make you primarily a pilot, or a computer scientist (which is where I
went when I couldn\'t fly), or whatever. It makes you an Air Force
officer. Your career field is secondary to that.\
\
And a note about military computer scientists: Look 20 years down the
road. We are going to have UAVs as combat pilots, and a pilot seated in
a virtual cockpit with a 360 degree view of the battlefield that he can
see as he swivels his head. Is this pilot \"Billy Bad-Ass\" who can
withstand 9+ G\'s and chews nails and spits out quarters? Nope, he\'s an
R/C enthusiast and/or a gamer. Billy Bad-Ass pilots say that it will
never happen. Regardless of their bravado or vitriol, they are wrong.
Removing all of the weight of the life support systems from the cockpit
will allow us to put that many more bullets or bombs in that weapons
platform. And air power will not be the primary theater that will need
control in battlefields of the future. Space Dominance will be key, as
all of our wars will be directed by satellite links to our unmanned
aircraft and warfighting robots. And it\'s all made possible by
\"computer scientists\". It may have been that the military could
function without its comm in the old days, but not any more. The
military is dead in the water without comm.]{.rendered_qtext}
