Get abortions.

An "ectopic pregnancy" is a misnomer. It's not actually a pregnancy that
can be carried to term. The baby cannot survive outside of the uterus.
It's not like a 5% chance that it could survive, or a 1% chance, but a
0% chance. And if the baby is left where it is to continue to grow, it
will rupture the Fallopian tube in which it is (usually) incorrectly
implanted and likely cause fatal hemorrhaging.

Calling it a "pregnancy" is a misnomer. It is only a "pregnancy" when
the baby is growing, healthy, in the uterus, not in the Fallopian tube
within which neither the baby nor the mother can survive. It is only a
"pregnancy" when "doing nothing" means the baby grows to term and is
born normally.

And since abortions to save the life of the mother are allowed in 100%
of states in which there are abortion restrictions, the answer is for
the mother to get an abortion of the ectopic pregnancy.

Look, there are plenty of controversies surrounding abortion out there,
but this is not one of them. Even pro-lifers agree with this. Let's not
make controversies where they don't exist.
