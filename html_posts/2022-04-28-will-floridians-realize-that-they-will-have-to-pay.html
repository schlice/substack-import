So I'm guessing you didn't read the legislation that Florida actually
passed.

Here's what they passed:


<pre class="linenums codehilite"><code class="language-prettyprint">                        A bill to be entitled                      
         An act relating to independent special districts;
         amending s. 189.0311, F.S.; dissolving certain
         independent special districts; authorizing the
         reestablishment of certain independent special
         districts; providing an effective date.

Be It Enacted by the Legislature of the State of Florida:

       Section 1. Section 189.0311, Florida Statutes, is amended
to read:
       189.0311 Independent special districts; charter
requirements.—
       (1) Notwithstanding any general law, special act, or
ordinance of a local government to the contrary, any independent
special district charter enacted after September 30, 1989, shall
contain the information required by s. 189.031(3). Recognizing
that the exclusive charter for a community development district
is the statutory charter contained in ss. 190.006-190.041,
community development districts established after July 1, 1980,
pursuant to the provisions of chapter 190 shall be deemed in
compliance with this requirement.
       (2) Notwithstanding s. 189.072(2), any independent special
district established by a special act prior to the date of
ratification of the Florida Constitution on November 5, 1968,
and which was not reestablished, re-ratified, or otherwise
reconstituted by a special act or general law after November 5,
1968, is dissolved effective June 1, 2023. An independent
special district affected by this subsection may be
reestablished on or after June 1, 2023, pursuant to the
requirements and limitations of this chapter.
       Section 2. This act shall take effect July 1, 2022.
</code></pre>



So a few observations:

1.  The special districts in question (one of which is Reedy Creek) will
    be dissolved effective June 1, 2023. So a little over a year from
    now.
2.  Notice what it says right after that: **An independent special
    district affected by this subsection may be reestablished on or
    after June 1, 2023, pursuant to the requirements and limitations of
    this chapter.**

Therefore, what the law specifically says is that "you have a year to
fix your special district, and the new version will take effect
immediately following the dissolution of the old one."

And even if Disney doesn't work with Florida to re-establish RCID,
Orange and Osceola counties will do it without them.

So one way or another, Disney's special district will remain.

\

Original question:

Will Floridians realize that they will have to pay more taxes as a
result of DeSantis' childish feud with Disney? Will it impact who they
vote for?
