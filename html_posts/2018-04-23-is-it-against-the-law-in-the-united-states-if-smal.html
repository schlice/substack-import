**Is it against the law in the United States if small kids pee in public
or in open areas?**

There are technically no age limits when it comes to public indecency or
indecent exposure laws, so *technically* it is illegal.

But kids are kids. I have, on more than one occasion, pulled over so
that one of my boys could run into the tall grass and pee because he
just couldn't hold it any longer. I think you'd be hard pressed to find
a cop that would ticket the parent of a small child who had to pee,
unless there were extenuating circumstances (i.e. in the middle of a big
city instead of out in the suburbs, on someone's lawn instead of in an
open field, etc). Remember, sanitation is also a concern, not just
indecent exposure.
