**Can Trump adjourn Congress?**

Yes, although the President is assuming that the Constitutional
authority applies in this circumstance when it may not.

The Constitution says the President \"may, on extraordinary Occasions,
convene both Houses, or either of them, and in Case of Disagreement
between them, with Respect to the Time of Adjournment, he may adjourn
them to such Time as he shall think proper\" (Article II, Section 3).

However, SCOTUS has never ruled on that clause, since it has never been
invoked before. There is some disagreement as to what constitutes
"disagreement" with respect to the time of adjournment and whether or
not he can only adjourn sessions which he has convened because of
"extraordinary Occasions."
