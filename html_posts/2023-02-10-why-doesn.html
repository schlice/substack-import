Would make things easier, right? I mean, it would certainly put all
those atheists in their places, right? I mean, the whole basis of their
religion is "no god," so if God exists, then being atheist would be an
illogical belief.

But why do you have to see God to believe in Him? Aren't there plenty of
things that we can't see, yet we believe in? Do you believe that love
and hate exist? Okay, what's the chemical composition of love? What's
the specific gravity of hate? Those are silly questions, because love
and hate are not physical. Sure, they use chemicals in our body to be
expressed, but chemicals do not love or hate on their own. So things
must exist which are not physical, because we have things we believe
exist that are not completely physical in nature.

Additionally, if God reveals Himself to everyone, you would have no
choice but to believe He exists. I mean, if you can physically see him
and you still don't believe He exists, then you clearly have some sort
of mental deficiency. Everyone with sufficient mental capacity would
*have* to believe He exists.

But He doesn't want that. He wants people to believe *despite* the fact
that He can't be seen.

Just look at the story of Thomas in the Bible. The first time Jesus
appeared to the disciples in the locked upper room after the
Resurrection, Thomas was not with them. When the disciples told Thomas
what had happened, he refused to believe. He said the only way he'd
believe that Jesus had risen from the dead is if he touched the nail
holes and put his hand in Jesus' side where it was pierced by the spear.

The next time they met in the upper room, Thomas was there, and Jesus
appeared amongst them. He went to Thomas and told him to touch the nail
holes and feel the spear hole in His side, which Thomas did, and
believed.

> Then Jesus told him, "Because you have seen me, you have believed;
> blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed." --- John
> 20:29 NIV

Jesus' words are the point here. Blessed are those who have not seen and
yet have believed.

God wants people to freely believe in Him. He doesn't want to *convince*
them to believe outside of their free will. There's more than enough
evidence to convince anyone willing to believe that He exists. But He
left just enough ambiguity so as to not compel the unwilling. To make
sure that our choice was truly free, He placed us in an environment
filled with evidence of His existence, but without His direct presence,
which would be so powerful, awesome and overwhelming as to override our
free will and force us to believe whether we wanted to or not. That's
not the kind of people God wants.
