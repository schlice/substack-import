As with all legal answers, the answer is "it depends." However, in all
at-fault states in the US, the car in the back is always at fault in a
rear-end accident.

Your auto insurance usually covers the costs if you are found at fault
in an accident. Auto insurance has multiple parts. **Liability
insurance** pays the other party\'s injuries and property damage if you
are found liable or "at fault." **Collision insurance** pays for *your*
vehicle *regardless* of who caused the accident.

But there is one more wrinkle in auto insurance: **no-fault states**. In
a \"no-fault\" state, your own insurance will typically cover your
medical bills *regardless* of who caused the accident, while in an
\"at-fault\" state, the at-fault driver\'s insurance is primarily
responsible for the other party\'s damages.

In "at-fault" states (most US states are), if you are the car in back,
your liability may be **limited** by the fact that the car in front had
faulty tail lights. This would limit the amount your insurance company
would have to pay.

But the default position is that the car in back is responsible for the
accident.

You can help yourself by installing a dash cam. The dash cam video can
show the missing tail lights (or any other mitigating factor in an
accident) and may help you to avoid having your rates increase due to an
accident which you would normally be at fault for. It can also help your
insurance company negotiate a lower liability payment to the other
company.
