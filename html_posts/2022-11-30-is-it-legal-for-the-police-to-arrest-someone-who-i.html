Yes.

Want to know the worst part? They don't even have to tell you why you
are being arrested. They only have to tell the judge.

I mean generally, it makes it a little easier when they tell you why
you're being arrested, but there is no law (usually, I can't speak for
every state) requiring a police officer to tell you why you are being
arrested. They simply must be able to articulate their probable cause to
a judge.

The police have to have **probable cause** to arrest you, which means
that they have a reasonable basis for believing that a crime may have
been committed. And if they can articulate that probable cause to the
judge, their arrest is valid.
