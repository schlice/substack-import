**Content:** [Police officers retain their arrest authority while they
are off-duty. Their obligation to protect and serve exists on and off
duty. This is why off duty police officers carry firearms. If they
witness a crime in progress within their jurisdiction, they are
similarly obligated to identify themselves and take action until on-duty
personnel can arrive and take over.\
\
Reserve police officers in my state, when not performing police duties,
are ***civilians.*** They do not have any arrest authority, and are
therefore enjoined from acting as peace officers when not on duty.
However, they do carry firearms, and their organizations get around the
legality of this by providing concealed weapons permits to reserve
police officers. Our organization prints the CWP on the back of our
police ID cards for our reserve officers. Since they are not active
peace officers when not on duty, reserve officers are simply advised to
be good witnesses, and with their inside knowledge of police procedures,
they generally make excellent witnesses. They would use their firearms
in the same way any armed civilian would at the time.\
\
Enforcing laws outside of your jurisdiction is always tricky, but
becomes even trickier if you\'re not on duty. Most organizations would
say that you have an obligation to step in if the crime being committed
is especially egregious, and waiting for local law enforcement to arrive
would create continuing unsafe conditions for the general public.
Otherwise, just be a good witness.]{.rendered_qtext}
