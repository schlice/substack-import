**What are your thoughts on E. Jean Carroll accusing Donald Trump of
sexual assault saying: "Trump attacked me in the dressing room of
Bergdorf Goodman."?**

I understandably question anyone who has not reported an assault to the
police, the very agency which is supposed to bring criminals to justice.

Instead, she wrote about it in her book.

So what exactly is her motivation? Why come out now? Why not come out
when the *Access Hollywood* tape was released? With information like
that, she could have assisted in derailing his presidential bid.

Instead, she reveals today, in her new book.

It seems her motivation is not to tell the truth, but to sell books.
