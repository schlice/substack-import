Senator Leahy is as over-the-top and nonsensical as Trump is. He should
not stoop to Trump's level.

And I say this as a conservative.

Trump has a good heart, but it's not backed up by a whole lot of
intelligence. He may be a fighter, but sometimes it's better to say
nothing and be thought a fool, than to open your mouth and prove it.

And for completeness, Trump said that ***if he is re-elected in 2024*,**
he would offer pardons to the January 6th rioters.

Original question:

What do you think of Senator Leahy calling Trump a \"two-bit dictator\"
for suggesting that convicted January 6 rioters could get pardons from
Trump?
