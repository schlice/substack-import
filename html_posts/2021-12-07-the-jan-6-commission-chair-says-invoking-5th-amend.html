No, totally wrong.

Numerous Supreme Court decisions have upheld the validity of the right
to 5th Amendment protections in Congressional inquiries.

If it is valid to use the 5th Amendment in a Congressional hearing, then
all the same caveats which apply to the invocation of that Amendment
still apply even though it's not a criminal trial.

And the most notable of those caveats was a SCOTUS case called
*Slochower* v. *Board of Higher Ed. of New York City* from 1956, in
which the Court made it exceedingly clear: invoking the 5th Amendment
does not amount to an admission of guilt. The right extends to any
answer that would "furnish a link in the chain of evidence," which
SCOTUS has stated includes a refusal to answer or to testify. Therefore,
**no one may make any implication of guilt** based on an invocation of
the 5th Amendment.

Of course, not all Congresscritters are lawyers, and even some who are
choose to "push the boundaries" of their committees. Remember that most
of what they are doing is not really to get to the bottom of anything.
It's a show. For you.

If the courts are not going to try these people as insurrectionists,
then Congress is going to make them expose themselves as such. Except
for that pesky Constitution keeps getting in the way.
