**If Donald Trump is seeking re-election to avoid prosecution, then 4
more years would do nothing but delay the SDNY proceedings, wouldn't
it?**

Correct. In fact, if they did file charges against the President and he
was ineligible to be prosecuted because he is literally in charge of
prosecutions, the statute of limitations would be *tolled* (or paused)
until he was no longer President, either through the natural expiration
of his term, or impeachment *and removal from office*.\*

So you're absolutely right, a second term would only delay the
prosecution; he would not escape it.

Makes you think he's probably not pursuing a second term to avoid
prosecution.

\* Most likely. No President has ever been indicted successfully while
still in office, so there is no precedent for such an action. However,
Constitutionally-speaking, it's most likely that a President cannot be
prosecuted while holding the office of President.
