**Can a state\'s legislature override a governor\'s executive order? I
know with the US President, there are federal court processes, for
example, but how does it work with a governor?**

It works exactly the same way with a governor.

The governor can issue an executive order which directs his government
agencies to do or not do something, in accordance with the law. For
example, he could order his Attorney General to use as much
prosecutorial discretion (which is legal under state law) as he wanted
when dealing with marijuana crimes. In other words, don't prosecute
those cases any more for low-level users.

The state legislature could then choose, for example, to write a new
bill which states that all laws must be prosecuted as written, when
evidence of a crime exists. It would be a "mandatory prosecution" law.

But remember, a bill must be signed by the governor before it becomes
law. And considering the governor's most recent executive order, it's
highly unlikely that he would sign such a bill into law, undoing his own
executive order.

However, just like at the federal level, in most states, a supermajority
of the state legislature can override a governor's veto. So if enough of
the legislature thought that the executive order was wrong-headed, they
could write a new law, but it would have to be veto-proof.
