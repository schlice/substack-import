In just comparing the two devices, I'd definitely go for the Le Max. The
Xperia is a good phone but it is way overpriced for what you get.

The Le Max is also a little pricey (the 128 GB version is expected to
retail in India for Rs. 36,999, or roughly USD \$518), but
comparatively, for 128GB of built-in RAM, that's a good price. Plus the
long litany of features that are packed into this phone is quite
impressive:

- 6.33-inch QHD (1440x2560 pixels) display, 464ppi and 0.8mm bezel
- 64-bit 2GHz octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 SoC and 4GB of LPDDR4
  RAM
- 21-megapixel rear camera with optical image stabilization featuring a
  Sony IMX230 sensor, dual-LED flash, and an f/2.0 aperture lens
- 4-megapixel front-facing camera with an f/2.0 aperture
- fingerprint sensor
- 3400mAh battery
- Wi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac with hotspot support and Wi-Fi Display
  connectivity
- Bluetooth 4.1 with APT-X support
- GPS, A-GPS, NFC, and 4G LTE connectivity
- infrared (IR) remote control
- An array of sensors including an electronic compass, hall sensors,
  gyroscope, gravity sensor, proximity sensor and ambient light sensor
- USB 2.0 Type-C port and MHL 2.0

For the price, I think you're getting a good phone in the Le Max.
