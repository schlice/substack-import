**If Attorney General Bill Barr is intentionally spinning the Mueller
Report to mislead Congress, the media, and the public in order to
protect Donald Trump, can he be convicted of obstruction of justice?**

You read that Barr is intentionally spinning the Mueller report to
mislead everyone in *Slate* magazine.

They have some notable quotes in that article, like this gem (emphasis
mine):

> \[O\]n the question of whether Trump obstructed justice, Barr draws
> his own conclusion: "Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and I have
> concluded that the evidence developed during the Special Counsel's
> investigation is not sufficient to establish that the President
> committed an obstruction-of-justice offense." **That's Barr's opinion,
> not Mueller's**. As the letter concedes, Mueller "did not draw a
> conclusion one way or the other as to whether the examined conduct
> constituted obstruction." **That's for the rest of us to decide.**

**"That's Barr's opinion, not Mueller's."**

*Of course it is!* Mueller decided not to render an opinion on whether
or not the President obstructed justice.

When that happens, the evidence from the Special Counsel's investigation
is forwarded to the Attorney General (and the DOJ as a whole) ***and it
is up to them to decide whether or not obstruction charges are
warranted. Which they did.***

Specifically, from the letter, you should move on to the next paragraph,
and you'll understand how the DOJ came to that conclusion (again,
emphasis mine):

> In making this determination, we noted that **the Special Counsel
> recognized that \"the evidence does not establish that the President
> was involved in an underlying crime related to Russian election
> interference,\"** and that, while not determinative, **the absence of
> such evidence bears upon the President\'s intent with respect to
> obstruction.** Generally speaking, to obtain and sustain an
> obstruction conviction, the government would need to prove beyond a
> reasonable doubt that ***a person, acting with corrupt intent, engaged
> in obstructive conduct with a sufficient nexus to a pending or
> contemplated proceeding.*** In cataloguing the President\'s actions,
> many of which took place in public view, **the report identifies no
> actions that, in our judgment, constitute obstructive conduct, had a
> nexus to a pending or contemplated proceeding, and were done with
> corrupt intent,** each of which, under the Department\'s principles of
> federal prosecution guiding charging decisions, would need to be
> proven beyond a reasonable doubt to establish an
> obstruction-ofÂ­-justice offense.

**"That's for the rest of us to decide."**

*Only if you think that your opinion is more important than the Attorney
General, who is actually charged with prosecuting crime.*

If you want to "decide," you should become the Attorney General. Until
then, it's up to the AG and the DOJ to decide if a crime was committed.

And, Congress can review that determination (which they will, no doubt,
do).

But it's not up to "the rest of us" to decide. But because *Slate*
thinks they know better than the Attorney General, the DOJ, or the
Special Counsel, they believe they should.

And they're trying to convince you of the same.
