It's somewhat more nuanced than that.

First, Eve indeed committed the first sin, but it wasn't "trying to be
like God." **The first sin was disobeying God.**

*The reason why* she committed the first sin is related to Eve "trying
to be like God," but that wasn't her motivation. The serpent used Eve's
*humanity* to trick her into thinking that God was holding something
desirable back from her and Adam.

Let's look more closely at Genesis 3:

> Now the serpent was more crafty than any of the wild animals the Lord
> God had made. He said to the woman, "Did God really say, 'You must not
> eat from any tree in the garden'?"
>
> The woman said to the serpent, "We may eat fruit from the trees in the
> garden, but God did say, 'You must not eat fruit from the tree that is
> in the middle of the garden, and you must not touch it, or you will
> die.'"
>
> "You will not certainly die," the serpent said to the woman. "For God
> knows that when you eat from it your eyes will be opened, and you will
> be like God, knowing good and evil." (1--5 NIV)

The first thing to note is how Eve responded when the serpent asked his
question. She said that you must not eat from the tree in the middle of
the garden, **and you must not touch it**, or you will die. *But God
didn't say that*. So what we learn first is that Eve didn't really know
what God had commanded. *And the serpent,* ***who did know exactly what
God had commanded****, used that knowledge to his advantage.*

The serpent pushed on and told Eve that she wouldn't die, but instead
would gain the ability to know good and evil. And she then desired that
ability. The serpent played on her emotions, evoking *jealousy* out of
Eve, making her feel like God was "holding back" something from her.

And this is what tricked her into committing the sin: she disobeyed
God's command and ate from the fruit of the tree which God commanded to
not eat from.

More importantly, "trying to be like God" is not necessarily sinful. In
fact, we should all be striving to be more like God in some ways. Jesus
lived a perfect, sinless life, and His example is how we should pattern
our lives.

But we should not be like God in other ways. The Bible is clear about
this. For example, God rebukes Isaiah for wanting to be great like Him.

> I will ascend above the tops of the clouds;\
> I will make myself like the Most High. --- Isaiah 14:14 NIV

But then, Paul tells us to be like God when he says we should
"\[f\]ollow God's example, therefore, as dearly loved children"
(Ephesians 5:1 NIV).

What we see here is that the Bible tells us to be like God in His love
and forgiveness, but not in His sovereignty or glory. If we seek to run
our own lives instead of submitting to His will, we are taking His
authority. Or if we serve others for our glory instead of God's glory,
we take that which does not belong to us. We should strive to be like
God in the ways He wants us to be, but to not take that which does not
belong to us.
