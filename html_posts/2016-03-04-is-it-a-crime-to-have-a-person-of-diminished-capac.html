It is only a crime to have a person sign a power of attorney when they
have diminished mental capacity if the recipient of such power intends
to use it to criminal ends; i.e. to defraud the assignor. If it is done
to facilitate decision making by a spouse when the other spouse begins
to lose mental capacity due to disease or defect, it is probably not
criminal. Most generally, if the power is assigned to a spouse, the
marital contract takes over, as the spouse would be the beneficiary of
the marital assets should the assignor pass. So the PoA doesn\'t pose
any real additional risk to the financial situation if the recipient of
the power is a spouse.
