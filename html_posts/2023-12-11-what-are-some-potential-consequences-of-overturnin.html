Well, *Roe v. Wade* was already overturned. The consequence of that is
that control of abortions has been returned to the states. The states
decide how much access to abortion they want to allow. Some states allow
abortion through all nine months of a pregnancy. Some states limit
abortion at 15 weeks gestation, while at least one state prohibits
abortion completely, with no exceptions other than to save the life of
the mother.

"Limiting access to abortions nationwide" is not an easy task. As we
just mentioned, abortion is a state's rights issue. Because of this,
limiting access to abortions nationwide would be a really difficult
task. In reality, the only way to accomplish such a thing would be an
amendment to the Constitution declaring that the fetus in the womb has
the same right to life as a born citizen, and has the right to not have
its life taken from it without due process of law.
