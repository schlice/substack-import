**Content:** [Yes, there is thought to be oligodendrocyte involvement in
multiple sclerosis.\
\
While the mechanism is not completely known, it is thought that immune
and toxic mechanisms, such as cytokines, reactive oxygen or nitrogen
species, and excitatory amino acids, may damage oligodendrocytes during
MS activation and later courses of the disease (it is thought that
remyelination through oligodendrocyte activity occurs in the early part
of the disease). It is theorized that primary oligodendrocyte death is
one of the mechanisms that causes demyelination and subsequent axon
death in later courses of the disease.]{.rendered_qtext}
