The evidence is abundant. The rub is that people who demand evidence
usually won't accept the evidence that is provided to them.

First, "concrete evidence" of an immaterial God is illogical and is
self-defeating. It's like trying to use a metal detector to find a
plastic cup. In other words, you're never going to see God's footprint
or find one of God's hairs, because those things simply don't exist.

Secondly, if, when you say "evidence," you mean "scientific findings
following empirical testing using the scientific method," that also
wouldn't make sense. There are plenty of things that science can't
prove, but we're all rational to believe. For example:

1.  Math and logic. Science can't prove them, because science
    presupposes them.
2.  Metaphysical truths, such as there are minds that exist outside of
    my own.
3.  Moral judgements. Science can't prove that the Nazis were evil.
4.  Aesthetic judgements. The beautiful, like the good, can't be proven
    by science.\
    \
    And surprisingly,
5.  Science itself. The belief that the scientific method accurately
    discovers truth itself can't be proven by the scientific method.

You may be able to use logic or reason to gain enough "evidence" to
believe something, even if science can't prove it.

Be careful relying on science when science itself can't be proven by
science.
