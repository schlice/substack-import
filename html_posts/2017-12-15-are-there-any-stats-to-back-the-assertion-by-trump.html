According to the FBI, [[57,180 officers were victims of line-of-duty
assaults](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=4aa103&url=https://www.fbi.gov/news/pressrel/press-releases/fbi-releases-2016-statistics-for-law-enforcement-officers-killed-and-assaulted-in-the-line-of-duty){.external_link

This means, on average:

- 156.6 assaults a day, or
- 6.5 assaults an hour.

Six assaults an hour means one assault every 10 minutes.
