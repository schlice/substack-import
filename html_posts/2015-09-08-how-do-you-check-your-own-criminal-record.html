**Content:** [If you\'ve ever been arrested, you have a criminal record.
If you\'ve ever been charged with a crime, you have a criminal record.
If you\'ve ever been a defendant in a criminal court case, you have a
criminal record.\
\
If none of these things are true, don\'t worry, you don\'t have a
criminal record.\
\
But what comprises a \"criminal record\" only matters to the agency
doing the checking. Some agencies perform \"national agency checks\"
which, along with checking NCIC, also looks at things like credit
history.\
\
To be fair, however, you can\'t really run a check on your own criminal
record. Not everyone has free and open access to NCIC.]{.rendered_qtext}
