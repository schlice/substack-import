**Content:** [You asked if the police have the legal right to deny a
person their civil rights. Since detention is a denial of your right to
freedom, if a police officer detains you, you have just had your civil
rights denied.\
\
So yes, legally, a police officer can deny anyone their civil rights.\
\
If you feel your civil rights have *unjustly* or *unfairly* been denied,
you can hire a lawyer and sue the department for unlawful
arrest.]{.rendered_qtext}
