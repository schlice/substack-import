As with all legal questions, the answer is "it depends."

While adolescents have authority to consent to a variety of medical
treatments without parental consent, they do not yet have independent
authority to consent to vaccinations. States are working to change that
through legislation:

> Bills have been proposed in at least two jurisdictions in 2019 to
> grant adolescents independent authority to consent to vaccination. New
> York's bill would allow anyone 14 or older to consent to any vaccine
> required for school or day care entry (measles--mumps--rubella,
> diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, poliomyelitis, hepatitis B, varicella,
> and meningitis vaccines). A bill in Washington, D.C., would permit any
> minor deemed by a clinician to be capable of meeting informed-consent
> standards for care to consent to any vaccine recommended by the
> Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, which includes HPV and
> annual influenza vaccines along with those covered in New York's
> bill.[\[1\]](#oYFUP){#cite-oYFUP .citation_link}

Absent this, if a child wanted to make the case that the home is
dangerous, he or she would have to report the danger to Child Protective
Services (CPS) for the state or region, and they would have to make an
independent assessment of household safety.

And as always, this too varies by state. Some states specifically filter
out CPS cases of vaccine refusal, like Michigan. Some states have
specifically written in their CPS law that refusal of vaccines does not
constitute medical neglect.

And even if vaccine refusal does amount to medical neglect, it's not
clear among the states whether or not this amounts to a situation in
which CPS must intervene.[\[2\]](#Xmpvm){#cite-Xmpvm .citation_link}

There have been several court cases in which vaccine refusal amounting
to child neglect was decided, and results are varied.

A final alternative would be for a minor child to become *emancipated*
and make all decisions for himself or herself, but this is a very
drastic step and requires many more findings of independence than just
the ability or desire to make vaccination decisions, and so is likely
not the direction to take.
