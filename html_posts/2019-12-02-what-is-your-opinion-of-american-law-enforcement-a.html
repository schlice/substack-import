**What is your opinion of American law enforcement agencies asking for
proof of citizenship?**

As with all legal questions, the answer is "it depends," and today, it
depends on who you're talking about when you say "American law
enforcement agencies."

American law enforcement agencies *meaning police who work for a state*
should not ask for proof of citizenship. It's not the state's job to be
the arbiter of US citizenship. That's a Federal government function; the
Courts have said as much.

American law enforcement agencies *meaning Federal law enforcement
agents like the FBI or DHS* **can** and **should** ask for proof of
citizenship, if it is reasonably in question, especially if citizenship
is at issue in whatever they are doing.
