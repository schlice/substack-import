**Do you think gun control laws would stop school shootings?**

No, because **laws do not stop bad behavior from happening.**

There is some effect from laws, because sane people fear punishment, so
some laws may have some effect at keeping some behaviors from happening.
But that's not what laws are designed to do. Laws are designed to punish
those who violate them. They're not designed to prevent people from
doing the bad things should they choose to do them. They are simply
designed to provide a punishment *after* you break the law.

So laws do exactly what they were designed to do: they send criminals to
jail.

They don't actually *prevent* people from doing bad things.

The only thing that does that: **security.**
