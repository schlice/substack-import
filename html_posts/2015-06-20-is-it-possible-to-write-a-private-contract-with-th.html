**Content:** [It\'s likely that such terms in a rental agreement would
be considered excessive and unenforceable.\
\
Your terms have to be reasonable in that they have to collect what you
are owed. That can include any money you spend on getting your money
back as well. You can\'t impose exorbitant fees just to create a
disincentive to failing to pay. I wish it worked that way. Alas, it does
not.]{.rendered_qtext}
