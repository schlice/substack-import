**Do you think every state should have a "Stand your ground" law? If
someone breaks into your house and threatens your family, would you
rather retreat or engage the threat?**

I think every state (and the voters in that state) should decide for
themselves how they want to structure their laws. I don't want anyone
outside of that state to tell that state how it should work its laws. If
a state decides not to incorporate a Stand Your Ground or Castle
Doctrine law, that's up to that state.

That said, in my personal opinion, I think that all states *should* have
Castle Doctrine laws.

The Castle Doctrine comes from the old adage, "a man's home is his
castle." Residents should feel completely safe within their own homes.
To that end, residents should have the full authority of the state to
use whatever force is necessary, up to and including deadly force, to
counter a threat within their own home.

Whether or not they have Stand Your Ground laws (or the opposite of
"duty to retreat" laws) should be up to the residents of that state.
