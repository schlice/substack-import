Yes, doctors can choose to refuse to prescribe medications based on
insurance reasons. You do not have a right to a particular medication.

However, this scenario is unlikely.

More likely than not, the doctor will not know what your insurance
covers and what it does not. They may advise you that a particular
medication has no generic substitute, and if you fill it and your
insurance *does not* cover it, you may be on the hook to pay for it, and
name-brand medications are not cheap. But usually, doctors are unaware
of what your insurance will cover and what it will not.

In general, doctors will prescribe you the medication you need and leave
it up to you and your insurance provider to figure out how to pay for
it. They may be able to give you some samples of the medication to cover
you in the interim, until you and your insurance company can come to
some agreement on how to pay for it.

Usually, it is the *insurance company* which will refuse to pay for a
medication your doctor prescribes. Your insurance company believes it
can *second-guess* the doctor and claim that there may be similar
medications (usually which have lower-cost generics) which will work
just as well.

The disconnect here is between your doctor and the insurance company.

When this happens, your doctor will need to *justify* his or her choice
of medication. Perhaps that medicine was prescribed because the generics
unacceptably react with other medications you are taking, or the
alternatives are unsuitable for one reason or another.

But I'm getting too far into the weeds.

To answer your question, it is legal for doctors to not prescribe a
medication if your insurance company will not cover it, and there are no
laws which protect you in that circumstance. But this scenario is highly
unlikely. Most commonly, your doctor will prescribe your medication and
your insurance company will either simply refuse to pay for it, or will
advise your doctor to prescribe a lower-cost alternative, usually a
medication which has a generic equivalent, to save money.
