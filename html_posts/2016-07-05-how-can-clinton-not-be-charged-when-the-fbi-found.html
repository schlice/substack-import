The question the FBI had to answer was whether or not she did something
*criminal*. That means something that violates Federal law.

They were unable to find clear evidence that she did something criminal.

However, they did go so far as to say that Clinton was "extremely
careless" in using a personal email address and server for sensitive
information, declaring that an ordinary government official could have
faced administrative sanction for such conduct.

To warrant a criminal charge, there had to be evidence that Mrs. Clinton
intentionally sent or received classified information --- something that
the FBI did not find. "Our judgment is that no reasonable prosecutor
would bring such a case," said FBI Director James Comey in a news
conference.[\[1\]](#VcWCV){#cite-VcWCV .citation_link}
