**Content:** [Joining the Air Force is a decision that should not be
held up to compare to the type of degree you received. It is a decision
that stands on its own.\
\
Joining the Air Force without a true desire to serve your country is a
bad choice.\
\
Joining the Air Force simply because you think you\'re going to get
something out of it is a bad choice.\
\
Joining the Air Force because you think it\'s cool to kill bad guys and
it will be all \"Call of Duty\" is a bad choice.\
\
On the plus side, since you have your degree, you can apply for Officer
Training School and become an Air Force officer in about three months.
You should check it out.\
