**Content:** [If he\'s caught sleeping in the closet **during** work,
I\'d say he either has a medical condition which prevents him from
sleeping soundly at night, or he\'s doing something at night which is
keeping him from sleeping. Perhaps he stays up late playing video games.
Perhaps he\'s a serial rapist. We\'ll never know until we see him on the
6 o\'clock news. But his employer might have a problem with him sleeping
on the job, and it might affect his potential for future employment at
that establishment.\
\
If he\'s caught sleeping in the closet **before** or **after** work,
there may be a situation that is preventing him from going home, or
preventing him from sleeping at home. It might be something that the
employer might have a problem with, or it might not. If no one is using
the closet after or before work, there may not be enough harm done to
pursue the matter.]{.rendered_qtext}
