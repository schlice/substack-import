**How do I handle my sons washing out of basic training and his refusal
to go back?**

I'm in a similar (but not identical) situation. My middle son wanted to
join the military for a very, very long time, and I couldn't be prouder.
My youngest still wants to join, but he's still two years away.

He had a few setbacks, but finally these were all cleared up and he was
on a clear path to enlisting.

He decided against it. In his words, he decided that the military is not
for him. He wants to be a police officer instead.

What can you do?

My advice: ***Parent the kids you HAVE, not the kids you WANT.***

My son decided that the military is not for him. This tells me that he
doesn't yet see the bigger picture: *you're a military member first, and
a career second.* I'll admit, it took me a while before I could see that
in my own career. When I first went in, it was because there was a
specific job I wanted to do. By the time I found out that I would not be
doing that job, I realized I was there to be an Air Force officer first,
and a job second. So I decided that I would be the best Air Force
officer I could be, and the Air Force would put me where they needed me,
and it would all work out for the best. Sage advice from a 20 year old,
because somehow it did all work out for the best, despite becoming a
disabled veteran and not having the fulfilling military career I had
hoped for.

My son doesn't see it that way.

While it's disappointing to me, since I know that the military would
take good care of him, and would be great for his personal growth (and
if he still wanted to be a cop, he could literally *walk into any police
academy* when his term was up), I can't *make* him understand what I
understand. I can't *make* him think like I do. He is his own man. He
thinks for himself. He may regret his decisions later on, but hindsight
is 20/20. Foresight, not so much.

So be there for him. Support him in whatever he decides to do. And don't
consider his washing out of Basic as a failure. Consider it a learning
experience. It may teach him something that will become clear later on
down the road.
