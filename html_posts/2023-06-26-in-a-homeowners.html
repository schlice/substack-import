In an HOA, where the common area is owned by the HOA, it is the HOA
which maintains the common area. They use HOA dues to pay for this
maintenance.

Homeowners *should not* be maintaining this area. Unless the homeowner
is being paid as a contractor for the association, homeowners should not
maintain common areas. There could be problems with liability should the
homeowner be injured and need to make a claim against the common area
insurance policy maintained by the HOA on the common areas.
