Depends on what state you're in.

In general, in most states, **you do not have to consent to a FST (field
sobriety test).** Additionally, in most states, **you do not have to
consent to a PAS (preliminary alcohol screening).** That's the handheld
breathalyzer that some police officers have access to at the scene. Bear
in mind, however, that **this may not stop the officer from arresting
you for DUI if there is enough evidence for him to do so.**

However, in most states, **there are consequences for refusing the
actual breathalyzer** at the police station once you are arrested,
because usually the evidentiary breath test you are given at the police
station is covered under *implied consent laws* when you get a driver's
license. In other words, you consented to evidentiary breathalyzer tests
when you got your license. If you refuse the breathalyzer at the police
station, you can automatically lose your license.

You don't have to give a blood sample, and the police cannot take one
without a warrant, absent exigent circumstances such as where evidence
may be lost because a subject is unconscious and can't consent.
