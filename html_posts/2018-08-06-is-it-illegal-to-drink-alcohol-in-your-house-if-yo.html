**Is it illegal to drink alcohol in your house if you can be seen from
the street? For instance, are you legally required to close your
curtains (Oregon, USA specifically)?**

This sounds like some confusion between drinking alcohol and public
indecency laws.

Drinking alcohol is legal if you're over 21. It's not indecent. There's
no requirement to squirrel away your alcohol drinking inside your house.
There are "open container" laws in Oregon, which means that you can't
have open containers of alcohol in your car. You can drink alcohol
outside if you're of legal age.

It seems like you're thinking of public indecency laws regarding closing
your curtains. Basically, you can't have sex in front of an open window.
You can't expose your genitals *with the intent of sexual arousal*.
Simply being naked is not public indecency in Oregon.
