The whole purpose of laws is to ensure that your freedom to live your
life as you choose does not impact anyone else's freedom to live their
lives as they choose. When those two items intersect, we need laws to
determine how to best handle the situation.

The phrase itself is a little misleading. It somehow seems to imply that
rights are naturally limited when what you do is experienced by someone
else. This is mostly untrue. For example, I have the right to speak
freely in the public square. The fact that someone can hear that speech
does not infringe on the hearer's rights. They have the right to listen
to something else. They have the right to leave the area in which I am
speaking (assuming it is a public place). They even have the right to
express a differing opinion. But they do not have the right to
***silence*** my speech simply because they don't like it, or they don't
want to hear it.
