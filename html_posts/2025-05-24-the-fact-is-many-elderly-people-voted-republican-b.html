Ha! Those stupid elderly people fell for the scam! We're going to cut
ALL social programs and we're going to find the richest people in the
country, you know, all the big Republican fat cats and we're going to
give them ***BEEEEEEELIONZ*** of dollars of YOUR HARD-EARNED MONEY while
you waste away to nothing because you don't have Social Security or
Medicare! You're going to die penniless and alone! *(with deep echo)*
***MUAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!***

So if you couldn't tell that was sarcasm, I've got a bridge in Brooklyn
to sell you.

Of course, the reality is that we're not eliminating either Social
Security or Medicare. The President ha publicly committed to keeping
both programs intact for those who need it. The White House has also
stated that they will not be raising the retirement age.

What they ***will*** be doing is ***fixing*** the programs, because
currently they are spending more than they are taking in. And you don't
need to be a math major to realize that if you spend more than you earn,
you're going to run out of money. And both Social Security and Medicare
are actually **projected to run out of money, very soon.** So those
programs must be fixed.

How?

- **Social Security:**
  - The focus has been placed on addressing waste and fraud within the
    program. Billions are estimated to be lost annually to fraud. A
    proposal to eliminate federal taxes on benefits for retirees was
    made. Some experts caution this could negatively impact the
    program\'s solvency.
  - Concerns exist about potential cuts to the Social Security
    Administration\'s workforce and office closures, which could affect
    access to benefits.
- **Medicare:**
  - Trump has stated he will protect Medicare and ensure seniors receive
    care without excessive costs.
  - Budgetary measures have been proposed to reduce the **cost** of
    Medicare but not **benefits**.
  - Some Republicans have supported Medicare Advantage, a private
    alternative.

While some unscrupulous sources link Trump to **Project 2025**, which
includes Medicare reforms, Trump and his campaign have publicly
denounced the program.
