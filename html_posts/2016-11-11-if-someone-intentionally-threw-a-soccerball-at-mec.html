Look, Nicholas, I know that the United States is a very litigious
society. But c'mon, man, really? Someone threw a soccer ball at you and
you want to sue?

Applying what Dr. Malcom said to your situation, you're so preoccupied
with whether or not you could, you didn't stop to think if you
**should**.

*Can* you sue? Of course you can. *Should* you sue? In my opinion, no.

You can sue for assault and battery in civil court. You might get some
money for pain and suffering, if you can prove that you have suffered
because of the attack. But you've got an uphill battle in front of you.
You may have also been doing something illegal too. Did you know that
using vulgarity in a school zone may also be illegal in your
jurisdiction? You would now have the crime you committed up against a
civil infraction your opponent committed, and your misdemeanor trumps
his civil infraction. So you ought to be careful wielding the lawsuit
stick. You may get some blowback onto yourself going that route.

My advice to both of you: **grow up.** You're not little kids anymore.
It's time to brush it off, admit your own culpability, accept it for
what it is, and **move on**.
