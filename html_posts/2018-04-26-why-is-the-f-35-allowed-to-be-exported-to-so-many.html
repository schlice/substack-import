**Why is the F-35 allowed to be exported to so many countries, since
it\'s supposed to be such an advanced fighter?**

I'm confused. Are other countries not *worthy* enough to own advanced
fighter technology to safeguard their own countries? I mean, if they're
in the market to buy some new fighters for their own air force, should
we only sell them F-4s or F-104s (great aircraft in their own right,
mind you) because they're less advanced?

Or maybe you're concerned that they might use that advanced technology
*against us*? Don't worry. It may be the same plane, but 1. we have more
than them, and 2. we fly them far better than they do. They won't risk
that much of a financial investment by turning around and attacking *us*
with it. Then we destroy the plane and they don't get a refund.

I guess I don't understand why we feel the need to restrict what other
people buy. Granted, there are of course export restrictions on
sensitive technology (such as encryption technology), and those
particular parts of the plane's avionics are not resold to other
countries, but the airframe is not something we don't sell because it's
"too advanced."
