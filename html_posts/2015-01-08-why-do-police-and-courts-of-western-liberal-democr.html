**Content:** [There are definitely limitations on free speech. You
can\'t shout \"Fire!\" in a crowded movie theater if there is no fire
(the classic example). You can\'t incite a riot. You also can\'t lie
about someone (this is a separate crime called slander). So there are
limitations on free speech.\
\
Inciting a riot is one thing. Inciting hatred is another thing
altogether. Under the Constitution, it is legal to incite hatred. If I
speak and it causes you to hate someone else, that\'s legal. If I speak
and it causes people to inflict injury on others, that\'s illegal.\
\
In 1969, the Supreme Court developed the \"imminent danger\" test in the
[[*Brandenburg v.
Ohio*](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=40da47&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandenburg_v._Ohio){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container} case that states, in
part, \"the constitutional guarantees of free speech and free press do
not permit a state to forbid or proscribe advocacy of the use of force,
or of law violation except where such advocacy is directed to inciting
imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or produce such
action.\" This theory has been tested many times, most recently in 2011
in Snyder v. Phelps, where hate speech was again protected because it
did not immediately incite dangerous or lawless action.\
\
The Internet is also being tested as to how the Constitution applies to
speech there. But regardless, the speech has to incite \"imminent
lawless action\" in order to be a 1A violation, which, while
hate-filled, Islamic clerics do not do. Therefore, their speech is
protected under 1A.]{.rendered_qtext}
