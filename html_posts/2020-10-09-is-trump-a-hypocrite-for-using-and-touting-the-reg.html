**If you are against abortion, would you use the Regeneron treatment for
COVID-19 that Trump is touting? Aborted fetal cells were used in its
development. Trump even banned Federal funding for fetal cell research**

Oh yes, in a hot second, and without any cognitive dissonance either.

The cells used in Regeneron's testing are cells from an abortion which
took place in the Netherlands in the 1970s. The cells have been
"immortalized," set to continuously regenerate in the lab (like a
cancer) and have now been doing so for so many years that they have
essentially transcended the abortion debate and are essentially
considered by scientists to be ***outside of abortion politics.***

Trump's administration has worked against funding programs which use
***recently aborted fetal tissue*** in an effort to prevent the
abortion-for-profit schemes we see with organizations like Planned
Parenthood (even though abortion supporters will deny that this ever
happened). The videos of PP employees bargaining over the prices of
aborted fetal body parts is...interesting to watch.

The fact that aborted cells were used to create virus-like structures on
which to test the treatment does not change my opinion about abortion,
or the treatment, or Trump, or funding for research which uses aborted
tissue.
