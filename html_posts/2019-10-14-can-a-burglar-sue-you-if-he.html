**Can a burglar sue you if he\'s injured in your house?**

The short answer is yes, but this is a very complex answer, and yes is
far too simplistic to be illustrative, and as with every legal question,
the answer is "it depends."

First of all, a property owner can always face negligence charges for
failing to address known hazards on his property that caused someone
injury. This is called "ordinary care." For example, if there's a hole
in my floor and I simply cover it with a rug, anyone hurting themselves
in that hole can claim that I did not take ordinary care to prevent
someone from hurting themselves on that hole. It doesn't matter what
their legal status is, pertaining to whether or not they were authorized
to be in that location. Owners are required to take ordinary care to
ensure that people are not injured by known hazards in their owned
facilities.

As I mentioned, the legal status of the person entering the location is
not really applicable. For example, what is a trespasser? If you have a
house party and I wander into an area in which I was not specifically
authorized to be, I am technically a trespasser. If I'm legally present
in your place of business and I inadvertently wander into an Employees
Only area in search of an employee, again I am technically trespassing.
Just because I'm in an area in which I was not supposed to be, is the
owner no longer liable if a hazard hurts me? And what about police or
fire personnel? They have not specifically been granted authority to
enter my home or business, but exigent circumstances may allow them to
enter without my permission. What if they get hurt? Am I liable then?

Secondly, there is a doctrine called "attractive nuisance" which puts
even more onus on the property owner to provide additional protection
for "attractive nuisances;" the most common ones are things like
swimming pools or backyard trampolines. The person entering those spaces
is clearly trespassing, but this does not alleviate the owner of the
responsibility to protect those areas.

So it is not at all cut and dried as to whether or not a person can
recover damages notwithstanding his legal permission to be in the
location in which he was injured. A burglar can indeed sue the owner of
the building he was attempting to rob if the owner was negligent in
addressing known hazards and not taking ordinary care that anyone
entering that premises might not be injured there.

Remember though, the devil is in the details, and while the burglar can
sue, only a competent court can determine whether or not that person can
collect.
