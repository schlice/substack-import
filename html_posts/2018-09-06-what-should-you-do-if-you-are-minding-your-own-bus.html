**What should you do if you are minding your own business and an armed
police officer approaches you, out of the view of others, and speaks to
you in a threatening manner?**

Answer his questions. Don't be a jerk; don't provoke him or snub your
nose at him.

If he arrests you, don't resist arrest.

If you really felt that his behavior was unacceptable, feel free to
report him. If you weren't arrested, you'll have to go down to the
station to file an official report. Be prepared to be interviewed in an
interview room. Be prepared to give your real name, address, and phone
number. If you were arrested, inform your lawyer of the issue you have
with the officer's conduct, and ensure that while your lawyer is
addressing the charge at hand, he is also, separately, addressing the
officer's conduct during the incident.
