**Can we share data from one phone to another phone with a**
***Li*-*Fi*** **system?**

Today? No. No phones currently support the Li-Fi standard.

In the future, I can see phones supporting Li-Fi, but I still think
we're maybe 5--10 years out before a phone starts to embed the
technology.

The infrastructure needs to support it first, and then you'll see
handsets picking it up. I could see it used in specialized equipment
first, and then rolled out to phones later on.

It's a promising technology though.
