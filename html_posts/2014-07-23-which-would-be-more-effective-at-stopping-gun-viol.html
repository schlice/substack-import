**Content:** [I\'m not even going to address the second side of the
\"or.\" It\'s disturbing to say the least. But to assuage your aching
conscience, I\'d like to address the first part.\
\
***Cracking down on guns will reduce gun violence.***\
\
Was that the answer you were looking for?\
\
It\'s true. If you\'re looking to reduce violence caused by guns,
reducing the amount of guns in the world will reduce gun violence.\
\
How, exactly, you reduce the amount of guns in the world, is the trick.\
\
Guns used in crimes are not legal guns. They are either imported into
this country illegally, or are stolen from law-abiding gun owners. So
reducing ownership of legal guns won\'t put a dent in gun crime. Legal
gun owners do not commit crimes with their guns. You might lessen the
amount of crimes committed using guns stolen from law-abiding citizens\'
residences, but that\'s about it. The vast majority of illegal guns are
not stolen, but are purchased on the black market. So restricting
private ownership of firearms is going to do little to lessen gun
violence.\
\
(By the way: concealed-carry gun owners are the least likely to commit
crimes. The murder rate among CCW gun owners is [[even lower than the
rate of police-involved
homicides](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=b606c6&url=http://www.thetruthaboutguns.com/2013/11/dean-weingarten/note-to-vpc-have-you-looked-at-police-involved-homicides){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="thetruthaboutguns.com"}]{.qlink_container}. Legal gun owners
= safer than cops. \<wink\>)\
\
So if you can find a way to stem the illegal flow of guns into this
country, you might eventually be able to reduce gun violence. But it
will only be supplanted by knife violence, blunt object violence, and
frying pan violence.\
\
The problem is you\'re focusing on the gun, and it makes sense why. The
gun is purpose-built to kill. It does this very effectively. But if
killing is at all justified in any situation, then using the most
efficient tool is not a problem. I can drive a screw in with a hammer,
but it\'s not the most efficient tool for the job. I can kill someone
with a spaghetti noodle, but there are more efficient ways to do so. If
killing can be justified, the tool with which I choose to kill is up to
me.\
\
If you just focus on the gun, you\'re focusing on the symptom of the
problem, not the problem itself. The \"iceberg effect\" is at play here.
You\'re focusing on the \"gun\" in \"gun violence.\" The 90% of the
iceberg that is underneath the water is the \"violence\" portion, and
that\'s much harder to tackle than the \"gun\" part. It\'s easy to
tackle the \"gun\" part, but it\'s codified in the Constitution that
Americans have a right to keep and bear arms. You can\'t restrict gun
ownership without violating the Second Amendment.\
\
If you want to restrict gun ownership in the United States, you first
have to repeal the Second Amendment.\
\
Once you\'ve done that, then come back to us and ask again about
cracking down on guns.]{.rendered_qtext}
