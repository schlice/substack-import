**Do you have a positive experience with an HOA?**

*As you can see from my credential, I was President of our Colorado HOA
for three years. I also was a Board member for an additional six. I was
then a Vice President of our Florida HOA for two years. I don't know if
that makes me "biased," but I think it does make me a knowledgeable
answerer.*

Nearly every experience I had with our HOA was positive. We actually
started with *no* HOA in our community, and we homeowners opted to form
one.

I know, right? That's totally weird. You mean to say you had no HOA and
you *chose* to make one???

Yep.

Here's how it happened.

When our neighborhood was built, the builder tried to make it as easy as
possible for us. He and his legal team created a pseudo-HOA, not run by
the homeowners, but run completely by a property manager. All we'd have
to do is pay the money, and everything would be handled by someone else.

However, we started asking questions, such as "how much are you paying
for snow removal?" "Have you looked at better options for landscaping?"
"Are the sprinklers able to be paused during wet weather?" The
particular property manager in question not only did not have good
answers as to how our money was being spent, he was in some cases openly
hostile to our concerns.

For those of us who cared, that was untenable.

The neighborhood was still under construction, so we contacted the
builder, who owned about 50% of the remaining properties. We told him we
wanted more control over how the money was being spent, and he offered
to pay the legal fees so that the neighborhood could transition back to
a traditional HOA, with a homeowner Board. The builder voted yes for the
50% of properties he owned, and we held a few meetings of remaining
homeowners at some of our houses, and we got the signatures we needed to
make the transition.

That's not to say our HOA has been perfect. One Board decided that
homeowners should not park their cars on the street. We don't own the
street, but they decided that anyway (and it's legal). It's probably our
most controversial of rules. We've had people join the Board
specifically to try to reverse that one rule. When they failed, they
left the Board (actually, moved out of the neighborhood).

I always tried to be very available as HOA president. My email was
linked to the HOA email, so my phone received any direct emails, and I
tried to respond within a day. For me, I tried to *create* positive
experiences with the HOA. Not everyone was perfectly thrilled, but that
was my goal.
