There couldn't have been a bait and switch, because there was no bait.

Jesus said clearly that no one knows the day of His return, not even the
angels. Only God the Father knows when that day will be.

Only God knows when Jesus will return. Only God knows when Satan will be
cast into hell with the demons. Only God knows when this will all
happen.

So if someone thought that Jesus was coming right back, that wasn't
something they heard from Jesus. He said that no one knows.
