**Which amendment guarantees the right to a lawyer even if a person
can\'t afford one?**

The 6th Amendment:

> In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a
> speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the state and
> district wherein the crime shall have been committed, which district
> shall have been previously ascertained by law, and to be informed of
> the nature and cause of the accusation; to be confronted with the
> witnesses against him; to have compulsory process for obtaining
> witnesses in his favor, **and to have the assistance of counsel for
> his defense.**

That last part of that last sentence codifies the *right* to an attorney
for criminal cases. The right exists whether or not the person can
afford an attorney, as rights are not purchase-able. The court will
determine if you are poor enough to require appointed counsel. You may
have to gather financial records to prove to the court that you lack the
funds to hire a private lawyer. Some courts will take you at your word,
especially if you are homeless and don't have access to the required
documents.

Notice too that it doesn't say that you get the assistance of counsel
"at trial" or "in the courtroom," but "for his defense." This defense
begins, according to the court, the moment you are in custody *and*
being questioned. This is why you can remain silent when police begin to
question you (you don't have to answer their questions) until you've had
the chance to get "the assistance of counsel."

By the way, I strongly suggest you do this if you are arrested for a
crime.

and address with ID as required) until you get a lawyer or cooperate
fully with the police and answer all their
