**Content:** [I would absolutely suggest looking up *Inherit the Wind*,
which was a play based on the famous [[Scopes
Trial](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=70f914&url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scopes_Trial){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}. The seminal part of the
trial was when Clarence Darrow, an acknowledged agnostic, called the
prosecutor, Col. William Jennings Bryan, to the stand, and proceeded to
\"demonstrate\" how it was possible that evolution and the Biblical
account could actually be related.\
\
For example, the Genesis story of the creation of the earth talks about
how long it took God to form each part of the earth. In particular, he
asked about the first day when God separated the waters in the heavens
from the waters on the earth, and then the second day when he formed dry
land. He asked if those were typical 24-hour days (the Bible, of course,
does not specify). He asked if it was possible that they were 25 hours,
since the sun, in the biblical account, was created on the fourth day.
As he said, there was no sun, no way to count the hours, so isn\'t it
possible that the creation of the earth took exactly the same geological
amount of time that we can measure through carbon
dating?]{.rendered_qtext}
