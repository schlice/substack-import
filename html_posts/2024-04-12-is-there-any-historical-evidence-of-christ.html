There are extra-biblical sources which mention Christ and which also
mention that His disciples believed He rose from the dead. The proof is
circumstantial, and the best evidence of it is found in the Bible. But
there are at least ten sources outside of the Bible which not only
mention Jesus, but discuss the fact that His disciples believed He rose
from the dead.

Those ten sources are:

- Josephus
- Tacitus, the Roman historian
- Pliny the Younger, a Roman politician
- Phlegon, a freed slave who wrote histories
- Thallus, a first-century historian
- Seutonius, a Roman historian
- Lucian, a Greek satirist
- Celsus, a Roman philosopher
- Mara Bar-Serapion, a private citizen who wrote to his son
- the Jewish Talmud.

*NOTE: For a complete listing of mentions of Christ from these sources,
see Norman L. Geisler,* ***Baker Encyclopedia of Christian
Apologetics*** *(Grand Rapids, Mich.: Baker, 1999), 381-385; see also
Gary Habermas,* ***The Historical Jesus*** *(Joplin, Mo.: College Press,
1996), chapter 9.*

These ten sources collectively admit certain facts about early
Christianity that help us piece together a storyline that is
surprisingly congruent with the New Testament. Piecing together all ten
non-Christian references, we see that:

1.  Jesus lived during time of Tiberius Caesar.
2.  He lived a virtuous life.
3.  He was a wonder-worker.
4.  He had a brother named James.
5.  He was acclaimed to be the Messiah.
6.  He was crucified under Pontius Pilate.
7.  He was crucified on the eve of the Jewish Passover.
8.  Darkness and an earthquake occurred when he died.
9.  His disciples believed he rose from the dead.
10. His disciples were willing to die for their belief.
11. Christianity spread rapidly as far as Rome.
12. His disciples denied the Roman gods and worshiped Jesus as God.
