Whoa, I thought I was on top of the news cycle! When did Congress
declare war on a friendly democratic nation? When did we start deploying
troops to a friendly democratic nation to take them over? Can you please
tell me what you're talking about?

Oh, wait. Are you talking about the Greenland thing? Yeah, you do know
that was a *negotiating tactic*, right? Once Trump started calling out
Denmark for failing to invest heavily enough in Greenland, Denmark
responded. In response to Trump's threats to annex Greenland, Denmark
announced a \$2 billion investment in defense on the island in January.

Denmark's defense intelligence service has determined Greenland to be
\"a priority for Russia, and it will demonstrate its power through
aggressive and threatening behavior, which will carry along with it a
greater risk of escalation than ever before in the Arctic.\"

\"We have not invested enough in the Arctic for many years,\" Danish
Defense Minister Troels Lund Poulsen admitted recently. \"Now we are
planning a stronger presence.\"

So, in short, the tactic *is working.* Denmark is committing more
resources to bolster security around Greenland.

Oh, maybe you're talking about making Canada the 51st state? It's cute
to watch Justin Trudeau squirm and blanche at the idea, but seriously,
we don't really want Canada as the 51st state. Once again, it's a
*negotiating tactic.* Let's take a look at the history here since Trump
was elected. Trump told Canada that he was going to impose a 25% tariff
on Canada, which Trudeau said would really hurt our northern allies. So
Trump floated the idea of Canada joining us. They wouldn't face any
tariffs if they were part of the United States. So why not?

Clearly, that idea is unpalatable to Canada. And it's unpalatable to
Republicans too, as most Canadians would actually lean Democratic if
they were thrust into US politics. So in actuality, it's *Democrats* who
would really want Canada to join the US, as it would solidify Democrat
control of Congress and the White House for the foreseeable future if
they did.

But since clearly Trump doesn't want that, and neither does Trudeau or
the Canadian government, why say it? Because it forces Trudeau to
negotiate. It shows Canada that there are worse things than engaging in
a tit-for-tat trade war. They could simply eliminate all tariffs by
becoming part of the US. So if we don't want to kill our economy, and
the only other option is to become part of the US, I guess we have to
negotiate with the US. That's what Canada is thinking.

So, in short, the tactic is *working*. Canada is actually coming to the
bargaining table ahead of the renegotiation of the USMCA (that's the US
Mexico Canada Alliance, the treaty which replaced NAFTA).

\

So in two instances, we're not actually taking over other countries.

In case you have forgotten in all the hateful Trump rhetoric from the
progressives, you are literally talking about the man who wrote the Art
of the Deal. You may not like him personally, you may think him brash
and boorish (which may be true), but at the end of the day, he makes the
deals. And that's why he was elected. He's setting the country up for
greatness for a long time to come.

Democrats, for all of their faults, are *really good* at playing the
long game, and we have to get better about it. These moves Trump is
making will secure our future for *decades*. We're making bold moves
that have some short-term effect, but definitely have long-term
benefits. That's why he was elected. We need to drain the swamp, fix the
runaway spending, reduce the size and scope of government, and
reintroduce common sense into how government works. These won't be fixed
in a day. But when they do get fixed, they will be fixed for the
foreseeable future.
