**Content:** [You are using a public service, funded 100% with taxpayer
dollars. Your use of that service can and should be audited to ensure
you or the police are not wasting taxpayer dollars.\
\
The media takes advantage of that fact to boost ratings, which is its
primary job (and I bet you thought their primary job was to report the
news). 911 calls, at least the ones they play on TV, are inflammatory.
That gets more eyeballs on your news show, which boosts ratings and
ultimately makes more money.]{.rendered_qtext}
