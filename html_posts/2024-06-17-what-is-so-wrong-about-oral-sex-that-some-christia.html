The original prohibition on oral sex came from a misunderstanding of
Genesis 38, which persists in some Christian sects today.

So to understand what the Bible says and where the misunderstanding came
from, we need a little history lesson.

During the time of Jesus, the Jews had a religious practice called
**yibbum (pronounced \[jibum\], Hebrew: ייבום)** As specified by
Deuteronomy 25:5--10, the brother of a man who died without children is
permitted and encouraged to marry the widow. At the time, a woman who
was not a virgin and not a mother was no longer "marriage material." She
would be destitute, unable to marry, unable to work. She'd either turn
to prostitution or die on the streets. Yibbum would give the widows life
purpose, and she wouldn't be a societal outcast, unable to marry and
unable to work.

So with this knowledge, let's look at the story. It's the story of
Judah, Er, Tamar and Onan in Genesis 38. Judah (the father) gets a bride
for his son Er, and her name is Tamah. Onan is Judah's second son. We
pick up the story there:

> Judah got a wife for Er, his firstborn, and her name was Tamar. But
> Er, Judah's firstborn, was wicked in the Lord's sight; so the Lord put
> him to death.
>
> Then Judah said to Onan, "Sleep with your brother's wife and fulfill
> your duty to her as a brother-in-law to raise up offspring for your
> brother." But Onan knew that the child would not be his; so whenever
> he slept with his brother's wife, he spilled his semen on the ground
> to keep from providing offspring for his brother. What he did was
> wicked in the Lord's sight; so the Lord put him to death also.
> (Genesis 38:6--10 NIV)

So without understanding the historical context and the Jewish faith,
you could easily misunderstand what Onan did that God thought was
"wicked." The early Church thought that the pull-out game was the wicked
part, and they condemned it (interestingly, they called the practice
*onanism* in honor of Onan's supposed sin---onanism is a synonym for
masturbation). Thus, oral sex and masturbation, because they did not
allow the "seed" to go where it was supposed to go, were considered
sinful.

However, we have a different understanding, and that comes *after*
Jesus' ministry on earth. The New Testament gives us a better
understanding than the early Jews had for God's purpose for marriage and
sex. Though the Bible nowhere explicitly addresses masturbation, it does
outline the purpose of sex. According to 1 Corinthians 7:2--5:

> Each man should have sexual relations with his own wife, and each
> woman with her own husband. The husband should fulfill his marital
> duty to his wife, and likewise the wife to her husband. The wife does
> not have authority over her own body but yields it to her husband. In
> the same way, the husband does not have authority over his own body
> but yields it to his wife. Do not deprive each other except perhaps by
> mutual consent and for a time, so that you may devote yourselves to
> prayer. Then come together again so that Satan will not tempt you
> because of your lack of self-control.

Implicit in this passage are these truths:

- God's plan for sex requires relationship, namely, that of a husband
  and wife (verse 2). Solo masturbation is sex disconnected from
  relationship.
- Foundational to God's plan for sex is giving one's body to another
  (verse 4). Solo masturbation is the keeping of one's body to oneself.
- The solution to a time of deprivation is to "come together" (verse 5).
  Solo masturbation is done alone, not together.

So right away, we see that solo masturbation is not in keeping with
God's plan for us, and the answers for married couples are all right
there. However, ***couple's masturbation*** **and** ***oral sex***, when
it is done within the boundaries of a man/woman marriage, meets the
truths listed above (sex as part of a marital relationship, giving one's
body to another, coming together with sex). **So in the modern context,
couple's masturbation and oral sex is acceptable so long as it is
between a married couple, but solo masturbation is not.**

But there are so many who say that solo masturbation is good to equalize
the libidos of two sexual partners. It releases marital tension when one
spouse is more sexually active than another, and therefore builds a
healthier marriage. The biblical description of sex in marriage,
however, doesn't allow for that. It says that the woman yields her body
to her husband; it's her responsibility to take care of his needs, just
as it's his responsibility to address her needs. Remember, God's plan
for sex is that spouses give themselves to each other. Any sexual
activity apart from that goal is, therefore, sinful.

Singles say that it's a *physical need* that they must fulfill or they
can't sleep, their work suffers, etc. However, the Bible never presents
sexual fulfillment as a need. On the contrary, Paul says to the
unmarried, "It's better to stay unmarried" (verse 8). Paul continues in
verse 9, where he identifies the proper outlet for single people who
struggle with sexual desire: "If they cannot control themselves, they
should marry, for it is better to marry than to burn with passion." Paul
suggests that self-control (one of the gifts of the Holy Spirit) is the
best answer. To singles who lack self-control, Paul does not say, "Let
them masturbate;" he says, "Let them marry." Again, marriage is the
God-given outlet for sexual tension, not solo masturbation.

While the Bible does not directly answer whether any form of onanism
(masturbation or oral sex) is sinful, there definitely are some biblical
principles to apply:

1.  "So whether you eat or drink or whatever you do, do it all for the
    glory of God" (1 Corinthians 10:31). If we cannot give God glory for
    something, we should not do it.
2.  "Everything that does not come from faith is sin" (Romans 14:23). If
    we are not fully convinced that an activity is honoring to God, it
    is a sin.
3.  "I will not be mastered by anything" (1 Corinthians 6:12).
    Christians have a responsibility to avoid anything that might
    enslave them.
4.  "I discipline my body and keep it under control" (1 Corinthians
    9:27). Self-denial is difficult, but self-discipline is worth it.
5.  "The fruit of the Spirit is \[...\] self-control" (Galatians
    5:22--23). Masturbation is almost always a sign of a lack of
    self-control.
6.  Do "not gratify the desires of the flesh. For the flesh desires what
    is contrary to the Spirit, and the Spirit what is contrary to the
    flesh. They are in conflict with each other, so that you are not to
    do whatever you want" (Galatians 5:16--17). We are called to
    self-denial, not to self-gratification.

These truths should have an impact on what we do with our bodies. In
light of the above principles, it is doubtful that **solo masturbation**
can be a God-honoring activity. But while this new paradigm in the New
Testament tells us that solo masturbation **** is definitely not in
keeping with God's plan for us in marriage, ***couple's masturbation***
*and* ***oral sex,*** *within this context* would be acceptable. Notice
that the truths about sex in marriage say nothing about "where the seed
goes" or "it has to be penis-to-vagina (P2V) sex or nothing." It
emphasizes the marital relationship and doing things **together, as a
couple,** to keep the marital relationship strong and healthy.
