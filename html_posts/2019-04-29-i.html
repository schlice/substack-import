**I\'ve seen videos of unsuspecting people being pranked by having
someone jump out in front of them with knives or axes. If someone shoots
them because they feel threatened, can they be charged with murder?**

*Can* they be charged with murder? Of course they *can*. It's unlikely
that they *would*, however.

With any case in which force is used in self-defense, there must be a
**reasonable** fear of **death** or **grave bodily harm**.

So let's check the elements required for a self-defense claim:

1.  Is the fear **reasonable**? To answer this, we use the "reasonable
    person test." Would a reasonable person possess the same fear if
    they were in the same situation? If someone jumped out in front of
    you with a knife or an axe, would you reasonably experience fear?
    The answer is **yes**, the reasonable person would be in fear at
    that point.
2.  Is there a reasonable fear of **death or grave bodily harm?** The
    "attacker" was wielding a knife, or in some cases an ax. Since these
    items can indeed cause death or grave bodily harm, **yes**, the fear
    from bullet 1 is one of death or grave bodily harm.

Therefore, the person firing in self-defense has a reasonable.
supportable claim, and it's likely that the DA wouldn't even pursue
murder charges, or if he did, it's likely the person would be found not
guilty because he acted in self defense.
