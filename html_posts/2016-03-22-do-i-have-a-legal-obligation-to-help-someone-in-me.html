Short answer: no.

Longer answer: There is no legal \"duty to assist\" in the United
States. I believe one or two states may have a law requiring
notification of authorities if you witness a crime (and even those are
rarely, if ever, enforced), but beyond that, there is no affirmative
legal duty to render aid.

Most states do have some form of \"Good Samaritan\" clause which
releases the untrained bystander from any civil or criminal liability if
they do choose to render assistance and something goes horribly wrong.
The statutes are supposed to encourage more people to assist in a
crisis. I\'m not sure of their effectiveness.

Your decision to render aid is a personal one, and there is no
requirement under the law to do so.

The only way you can be held responsible in any case is if you are a
medical professional. In many states, medical professionals are under
some form of legal obligation to assist in an emergency involving their
medical profession, and failure to act can potentially be a cause for
civil action, if not criminal liability.
