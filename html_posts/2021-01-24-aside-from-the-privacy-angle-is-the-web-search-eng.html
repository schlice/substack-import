**Aside from the privacy angle, is the web-search engine DuckDuckGo
really all that better than Google Chrome?**

No, I don\'t think so. Part of that is due to the technology, and the
other part is due to economies of scale.

DDG suffers from what everyone taking on the 600 pound gorilla suffers
from: they are simply dwarfed in size. Google is just *so big* and *so
connected* that their systems simply work better. The integration
between Google search and Chrome is exceedingly tight, such that it is
noticeably absent when you use DDG.

So you recognize that and you accept it because you want the privacy.
You don\'t want your search results or your metadata sold to the highest
bidder, or purloined to be used to piece together information which is
truly private.

It\'s not as good, but overall it is arguably safer. That\'s the trade
off.
