Firstly, it\'s not a \"single\" contract to build a plane. There are
multiple contracts involved, delivering the components of the aircraft,
and then there are contracts to deliver the follow-on maintenance and
follow-on replacement parts. From

Also, Lockheed recently won a \$84.4 million follow-on cost plus fixed
fee contract to provide special tooling and special test equipment that
will be important to maintain current production rates.

Second, all government contracts are covered by the Federal Acquisition
Regulations (FAR), which is an *exhaustive* set of rules which must be
followed when writing, bidding, awarding, and fulfilling government
contracts. The FAR is what keeps companies like Boeing, Lockheed,
Grumman, and others alive and kicking. There are lots of different
contract types; some place more risk on the contractor, some place more
risk on the government.

(from [[Government Contracting - The
Basics](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=f7250c&url=http://www.acq.osd.mil/osbp/docs/government_contracting_the_basics.pdf){.external_link

Fixed price contracts place more risk on the contractor, as cost
overruns are paid for by the contractor. Cost Plus contracts place more
risk on the government because deadline overruns are not penalized, and
some cost overruns are paid for by the government, depending on contract
type. So depending on how the contract is written, risk of cost overruns
or risks due to subcontractors not delivering, or risks due to projected
solutions not being produced can either be placed on the government, the
contractor, or both. All of these things happened in the F-35 program:
cost overruns, subcontractors not delivering, solutions required for
proper functioning not being developed in the aggreed-upon timeframes,
etc. Additionally, hackers and Edward Snowden caused some of the
classified components of the project to be released, causing the
government to have to trash those components and develop new ones,
delaying the project further.

It\'s easy to look at the total overruns and say \"Well, clearly someone
screwed up in writing *that* contract\" or \"Well, that\'s just the
government wasting our money again\" but it\'s far more complex than
that. It\'s an integrated set of contracts that all work together, and
there were failures across the board: the contractors did not properly
report when they were going to slip, the government contracting agencies
did not provide proper oversight and demand updated reports on subs,
etc.
