**Is it possible to program a \"safe word\" into Amazon Alexa that will
dispatch the police if you feel too unsafe to call?**

Not yet.

Alexa can make landline calls for you if you add the optional [[Echo
Connect](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=efa1b8&url=https://smile.amazon.com/Echo-Connect-requires-service-smartphone/dp/B076ZRFP6Y){.external_link

onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="amazon.com"}]{.qlink_container}, but even that still
requires you to ask Alexa to "call 911."

I'm sure at some point there will be something that will allow you to
add a panic word or a panic phrase to your Alexa or Google Home or other
smart home speaker that will allow you to make an emergency call.

There are apps that will send text messages to contacts if you need
help, but that's a far cry from being able to contact 911 for you.
