The answer, as with all legal answers, is "it depends." And primarily it
depends on the evidence the petitioner has against you.

You will get this evidence by submitting a "request for production of
evidence," which is part of pre-trial discovery. The petitioner will
have to turn over copies of the evidence they have which proves that it
was your dog entering their property and attacking their dog.

Once you see their evidence, you can mount a defense against it. If they
claim that, for example, there is a hole under the fence that allows
your dog access, you could measure the hole and show that your dog
cannot possibly fit through that hole.

You could also submit your own affirmative defenses, such as showing the
area your dog is confined to while he or she is outside, showing that
the boundaries of that area are not permeable enough to allow your dog
to escape, using testimony to explain that your dog is never off-leash
outside, etc.

Good luck.
