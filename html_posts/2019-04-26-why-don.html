**Why don\'t people demand the right to own serious military weapons, if
the Second Amendment is about countering government tyranny?**

1.  We already can own "serious military weapons," or haven't you heard
    that the AR-15 is still legal?\
    \
    There's really very little difference between the rifles the
    military can use and the rifles civilians can use.\
    \
    Maybe I'm unclear on what you mean by "serious military weapons."
    You mean tanks? [[Yes, we can own
    those](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=c6ad9b&url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324432004578302480951570270){.external_link

    [[Yes, we can own those
    too](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=11c10b&url=https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/9311/can-civilians-buy-military-aircraft){.external_link
    rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
    onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
    qt-tooltip="stackexchange.com"}]{.qlink_container}. Maybe if you
    quantified "serious military weapons," we could better answer what
    you're thinking, instead of just assuming that because it's labeled
    "military," we can't buy it.\
    \
    We've also accepted the fact that certain weapons which were *not*
    routinely used by the military, could be outlawed, such as
    short-barreled shotguns.\
    \
    In summary, I think we already can own the vast majority of weapons
    which are in regular use by the military.
2.  While the 2nd Amendment includes the ability to defend ourselves
    against tyranny, that's not all it is there for. Yes, the 2nd
    Amendment recognizes the fact that the first thing a tyrannical
    government does is disarm its populace. Go ahead, check your history
    texts and see what Hitler and Mussolini and Stalin did first when
    assuming power.\
    \
    Remember too that it was **civilians who owned military weapons**
    who bought and paid for the freedom in the United States we enjoy
    today, with their blood. The framers of our new government wanted to
    ensure that no government would ever have the ability to remove that
    right from the people.\
    \
    So why else, then, do we have a 2nd Amendment? Because besides
    recognizing our right to never be enslaved by a tyrannical
    government, we also recognize **the natural right to self defense.**
    This is one of the natural rights on which the Bill of Rights was
    written. Remember that the Bill of Rights does not *grant* rights.
    It recognizes that rights have existed long before the Constitution
    was written, and the Bill of Rights exists to *prevent government
    from infringing* those rights. The natural right to self defense is
    one of those rights. Remember the logic: you have the absolute right
    to life. If you have the right to life, you have the right to not
    have your life unjustly taken. If you have the right to not have
    your life unjustly taken, you have the right to defend your life. If
    you have the right to defend your life, you have the right to use
    whatever tools you choose in order to do so.
