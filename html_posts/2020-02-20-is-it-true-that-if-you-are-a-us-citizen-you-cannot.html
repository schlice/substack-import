**Is it true that if you are a U.S. citizen you cannot legally call
yourself a psychologist, even if you do not claim to have credentials or
to be a therapist?**

You can call yourself whatever you want. The 1st Amendment protects that
right. If you want to call yourself a psychologist, feel free.

However, the moment you try to ***act as if you are a licensed
psychologist***, you are in violation of the law.

In other words, feel free to tell anyone who will listen that you're a
psychologist. But the moment you try to treat patients in any way, you
are in violation of the law, primarily practicing medicine without a
license.
