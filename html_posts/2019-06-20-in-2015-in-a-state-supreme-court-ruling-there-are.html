**In 2015, in a state supreme court ruling, there are mentions of
reimbursement of attorney fees owed to one of the parties. How do you
collect this payment?**

Most financially stable people will pay their court fees because they
know that it can become very legally cumbersome if they don't. It can
hurt their businesses and their credit in the long term if they don't
pay awarded judgments against them.

In most states, if you have been awarded a judgement that has not been
paid, you must hire an attorney (specifically a collections attorney) to
assist you with collecting what you are owed. These attorneys either get
paid hourly, or will keep a portion of what they collect.

They will start by sending certified letters reminding the person that
they owe a judgement and must pay or that legal processes will commence.

If they still do not pay, the lawyer will begin a post-judgement
discovery process, which is a legal process that examines the person's
ability to pay. It discloses all sources of income and all assets. In
some states, this happens in court.

Once you have completed the discovery, you can petition the court to

- garnish wages
- seize cash or assets from a business
- garnish bank accounts

in order to repay the judgement.
