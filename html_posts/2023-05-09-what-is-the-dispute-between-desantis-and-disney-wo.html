You can tell the DeSantis haters from those of us who simply are
watching history play out and accurately documenting it, especially when
they use words like "DeathSantis" or "DeSatan" when they try to describe
the Governor.

Anyway, let's set the stage for what happened in Florida. Less than ten
years ago, corporations were using their considerable funds and lobbying
power to push their woke agendas onto states. Remember the fights over
religious freedom which morphed into fights over gay rights?
Corporations were pulling out of locations left and right in an effort
to exert their will over that of the state. Atlanta lost the All-Star
game over the Georgia legislature correcting their voter laws and
returning them to pre-pandemic sanity. North Carolina lost NBA and NCAA
events because of House Bill 2 defining bathroom usage.

Republicans would previously cave to such pressure, despite being
frustrated about it. And doesn't it strike you as odd that woke
corporations only target Republican-led bills, and states led by
Republicans? Seems like an oddly politically-polarized climate, don't
you think?

That said, even though Atlanta lost the All-Star Game, Georgia's voting
laws still stand. Even though Greensboro lost the NCAA tourney, its
bathroom rules still stand. In other words, *in the historical context,
states always win against big corporations flexing woke ideology.*

Republicans these days *must* stand up to woke corporations flexing
their muscle against the will of the state (and thus the people in that
state).

DeSantis was reading from the same playbook when handling Disney. The
Parental Rights in Education Act didn't affect The Walt Disney
Corporation at all (it is about schools, not businesses), but Disney
(under pressure from its "not-so-secret gay" employees) still decided to
speak out over the state's actions. What frustrated the Governor was not
so much that they dared to have an opinion, but that a California
corporation was "going to do everything in its power" to prevent the
Parental Rights in Education Act from becoming law in Florida. A woke
corporation trying to flex its muscle against the state to advance their
own queer agenda is bad enough, but a *California* corporation trying to
tell *Florida* how to run its state? That was a bridge too far for
Florida. DeSantis contends that corporations should not meddle in state
politics, and that as a purportedly family-friendly business, Disney (of
all corporations) should understand parents not wanting young children
taught about gender identity in public schools.

The state decided that if Disney is allowed to flex its muscle and
threaten the state, the state should similarly be allowed to take a
fresh look at the special district which allows Disney to operate in
complete autonomy, outside of the rules that govern every other
corporation in the state. Maybe Disney feels so emboldened because they
know that the state has no power over them, because they are not subject
to state rules like every other corporation in the state. The
Legislature decided to strip Disney of its special district (in fact,
what it did was to cause all special districts which were formed before
a specific law went into effect were to be dissolved and re-formed in
accordance with that law). The law affected nine special districts
around the state, including Reedy Creek. The state re-formed Reedy Creek
into the Central Florida Tourism Oversight District (CFTOD), which
basically has the same authority as Reedy Creek, but under the control
of the state instead of under Disney's control.

But before this law could go into effect and CFTOD could take over,
Disney and Reedy Creek entered into a legal agreement called a
Developer's Agreement and Protective Covenant which basically gave
Disney all of the powers that Reedy Creek had, thereby making the
District replacing Reedy Creek useless as all changes that CFTOD would
seek to make would have to be approved by Disney.

When the date came around and Florida realized what Disney had done,
they immediately moved to terminate the agreement between Reedy Creek
and Disney. Disney sued the state of Florida, claiming that the
dissolution of Reedy Creek was unlawful retaliation following the
corporation exercising its 1st Amendment right to speak out against the
government. \"The government action was patently retaliatory, patently
anti-business, and patently unconstitutional,\" Disney said in its
lawsuit.

The CFTOD Board countersued to enforce the dissolution of the protective
covenants. "In an effort to stymie Florida's elected representatives,
Disney covertly cobbled together a series of eleventh-hour deals with
its soon-to-be-replaced puppet government," the lawsuit alleged. "Disney
hoped to tie the hands of the new, independent Board and to preserve
\[...\] its own government in the District for at least the next 30
years.\" The Board said the agreements were \"riddled with procedural
and substantive defects\" that render them void and unenforceable. The
lawsuit argues the prior board failed to provide adequate public notice
or follow proper procedures.

Meanwhile, the Florida Legislature passed a new law which gives CFTOD
the authority to nullify developer agreements and protective covenants
which were signed within three months of the Board taking control of the
district.

If history shows us anything, the state will indeed ultimately prevail,
but the fight being put up by Disney against the state's authority will
leave them both bruised.
