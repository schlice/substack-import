First off, the whole argument about magazine size is a red herring,
perpetrated by people who have no clue about firing weapons. They get
their ideas about guns from Hollywood, where bad guys actually wield
fully automatic weapons and spray thousands of rounds from a 30-round
magazine without ever changing mags. It's pure fantasy. A single
30-round magazine is no more deadly than three 10-round magazines.
Period. The whole argument is silly.

Secondly, we need to define what "large magazines" are. Since there is
no definition, it should stand to reason that a "large magazine" is one
which is bigger than the standard sized magazine. For an AR-15 (since
they seem to be the current target these days), a 30-round magazine is
standard. Therefore, a "large magazine" would be larger than 30 rounds.
But I assume that by "large magazine" you consider it to be any number
of rounds in one magazine that you find objectionable. So let's figure
out how a manufacturer determines how many rounds to put in one
magazine.

The short answer is **efficiency**. Based on the type of ammunition, the
"standard magazine" holds enough rounds to be efficient without being
too heavy and changing the firing characteristics of the weapon. If the
magazine is too heavy because it has too many rounds, it makes the
entire weapon unwieldy. If you have too few rounds in one magazine, it
becomes more unwieldy to carry multiple magazines to hold the same
number of rounds.

It often seems that the arguments for smaller magazines center around
the idea that "you simply don't need that many bullets." The question
becomes: by whose standards? In my opinion, I need at least one more
bullet than the bad guys have. They also hold the opinion that one
bullet equals one dead person who should not be dead. Again: by whose
standards? If he was shooting at me, I can shoot back at him. The entire
argument surrounding "high-capacity" magazines is simply a red herring.
