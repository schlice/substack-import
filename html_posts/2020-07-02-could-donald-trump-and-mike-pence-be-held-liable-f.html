**Could Donald Trump and Mike Pence be held liable for behavior
encouraging the spread of COVID? What would need to be shown to secure a
civil judgment against them?**

A2A

Not likely.

You can sue the United States in Federal court for most torts committed
by persons who act on behalf of the United States. The Federal Tort
Claims Act is the \"exclusive means by which a party may sue the United
States for money damages \[\...\] in tort\" (28 USC ยง 2679.
Exclusiveness of remedy). Also, an FTCA action \"can be brought only in
a United States District Court\" (28 USC ยง 1346(b)) and it states that
the action must be brought \"within two years after the claim accrues,\"
or \"within six months after \[\...\] notice of final denial of the
claim by the agency\" (28 USC ยง 2401(b)).

However, the FTCA limits liability for intentional torts, as well as
claims based upon the performance, or failure to perform, a
\"discretionary function or duty.\"

So it's unlikely that any person would be able to claim monetary damages
due to Trump and Pence "encouraging the spread of a virus."
