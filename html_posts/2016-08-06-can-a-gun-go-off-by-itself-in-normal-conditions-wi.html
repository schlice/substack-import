When I was in the military, we learned to fire the M9, which was
essentially a Beretta 92F. That weapon has no fewer than one external
and three internal safeties which only moved when the trigger moved.
Although no one ever tried it, my instructor claimed that you could
**hammer nails** with a loaded M9, striking right on the hammer at the
rear of the firearm, and it would not discharge.

Assuming a normally functioning firearm, and under normal conditions, if
the trigger does not move, the gun does not fire. Period.
