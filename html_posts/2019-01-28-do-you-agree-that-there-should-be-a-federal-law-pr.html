**Do you agree that there should be a federal law prohibiting public
nudity, and indecent exposure in the United States?**

No.

Laws tend to work best at the local level. I'm pretty sure that what
should apply in New York City probably shouldn't apply in Boulder,
Colorado, or in San Francisco, California, or in Miami, Florida.

Allow cities to regulate their nudity laws, in exactly the way they do
today. There is no need for federal regulation, as there is no
compelling Federal interest in forcing states into one policy.
