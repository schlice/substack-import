1.  It's because of a misunderstanding of what misogyny is. **Misogyny**
    specifically means "a hatred of women." There is no evidence that
    either the charity, or its members, hate women.
2.  It's also because, while abhorrent and horribly misguided, misogyny
    is not illegal, so even if the charity was misogynist (which it is
    not, see #1), it is not illegal. There is no law requiring charities
    to address men's and women's issues equally.
