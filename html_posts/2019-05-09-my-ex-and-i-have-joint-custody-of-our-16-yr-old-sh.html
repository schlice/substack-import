**My ex and I have joint custody of our 16 yr old. She lives with him.
He lets her drive alone with only a permit that she\'s had for a month.
Can I be held liable if she has an accident?**

The answer to that is "it depends."

Liability insurance typically follows the driver, and
comprehensive/collision insurance follows the car. In a joint custody
arrangement, the parent who has more visitation, especially during
school months, typically carries the child on their policy.

To that end, financial responsibility for a driver with a GDL (graduated
driver's license) will be with the parent who has that driver on their
policy. If that policyholder did not follow the rules when it comes to
their teen driver, that insurance company could increase that parent's
rates, or could potentially drop them from coverage. This is true
whether or not the child got into an accident; if the child is stopped
by the police and they are found to not be in compliance with the GDL
law, insurance can still act.

If the child gets into an accident and their GDL doesn't allow them to
be driving without an adult, the child will be fined and will likely
lose her license for a period of time. Additionally, if someone is hurt
in the accident, the child could be labeled as a "youthful offender"
under the juvenile justice system and could face probation, mandatory
court-ordered counseling, community service, or even juvenile detention.
The child's guardian at the time of the incident could also face
punishment, especially if that guardian was supposed to be in the car at
the time.
