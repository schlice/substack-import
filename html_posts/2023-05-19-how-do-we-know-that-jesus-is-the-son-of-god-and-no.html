The Bible says that Jesus is God's son. But the Bible also says that
Jesus is God in the flesh.

*wait...what?*

The Trinity is a really difficult concept to understand. It simply does
not make sense in a human context.

To try to end some of the confusion, I'll call God the Father by His
name, Yahweh. Yahweh is God. Jesus is God. The Holy Spirit is God.

But Yahweh is not Jesus. Jesus is not the Holy Spirit. And the Holy
Spirit is not Yahweh.

One God, three persons, wholly distinct, yet one and the same. This is
literally a concept that is antithetical to our human experience. Either
they are distinct or they are not.

What's even weirder is that God exists as all three persons of the
Trinity *at the same time.* It's not that God can only exist as one or
the other. The example of water is only useful if you consider a glass
of water, with an ice cube in it, and water vapor at the surface. Three
states of water, all existing simultaneously. It may not be the best way
to describe a triune God, but it is one way.

**Jesus is God, and Jesus is Yahweh's son**

We know Jesus is Yahweh's son, because He told us so.

> Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to be baptized by John. But
> John tried to deter him, saying, "I need to be baptized by you, and do
> you come to me?"
>
> Jesus replied, "Let it be so now; it is proper for us to do this to
> fulfill all righteousness." Then John consented.
>
> As soon as Jesus was baptized, he went up out of the water. At that
> moment heaven was opened, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like
> a dove and alighting on him. And a voice from heaven said, "This is my
> Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased." --- Matthew 3:13--17
> NIV

Not only do the words explain that Jesus is God's son, but we see the
Holy Spirit in the form of something that looked like a dove. All three
persons of the Trinity, all separately represented, but all three are
God.

Jesus also admits that He is God. The most famous, in my opinion:

> Jesus answered, "If I glorify Myself, My glory is nothing; it is My
> Father who glorifies Me, of whom you say, 'He is our God'; and you
> have not come to know Him, but I know Him; and if I say that I do not
> know Him, I will be a liar like you, but I do know Him and keep His
> word. Your father Abraham rejoiced to see My day, and he saw *it* and
> was glad." So the Jews said to Him, "You are not yet fifty years old,
> and have You seen Abraham?" Jesus said to them, "Truly, truly, I say
> to you, before Abraham was born, I am." --- John 8:54--58 NASB

That term "I AM" in the Bible refers to God. It is an Old Testament
reference from Moses, when God sent him to the Israelites:

> God said to Moses, "I am who I am. This is what you are to say to the
> Israelites: 'I am has sent me to you.'" --- Exodus 3:14 NIV

So when Jesus said "Before Abraham was born, I am," He was referring to
Himself as God. The Jews listening to Jesus speak knew *exactly* who He
was referring to when He said that, because their response is recorded
in the very next verse:

> At this, they picked up stones to stone him, but Jesus hid himself,
> slipping away from the temple grounds. --- John 8:59 NIV

Blasphemy was a crime punishable by death by stoning. When the Jews
heard Jesus refer to Himself as God, they immediately picked up stones
to kill Him. The only way Jesus could have slipped away was if there was
a commotion when He spoke those words. So clearly, they fully understood
what He said, and it caused quite a stir. It caused so much commotion
that Jesus was able to blend in to the rioting crowd and slip away
before He could be stoned.
