1.  I don't understand what "can't be rebuilt" means. You can always
    raze the rubble and build a totally new building where the old one
    stood. Thankfully, HOAs have insurance on their buildings, just like
    you do on your house. If the property is destroyed, insurance will
    pay most of the cost to rebuild it. Your HOA may need to do a
    special assessment to raise money to furnish it again, but insurance
    will cover most of the cost.
2.  What happens to the HOA? Nothing. The HOA still exists even if the
    clubhouse gets destroyed. The bylaws don't burn; they're on file
    with the county government.

Don't worry, your HOA will be fine. They will survive a fire.
