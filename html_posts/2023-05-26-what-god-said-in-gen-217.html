No, and even so, I think the "who planted the tree" question is a red
herring. There was a reason that God said to not eat from the Tree of
the Knowledge of Good and Evil:

***In order for man to truly have free will, there would have to be a
compelling alternative to following God's rules.***

In other words, if you are in an environment in which you can do no
wrong, then you have no *choice* but to do good.

*But*, you're probably asking, *God is omnipotent! Didn't God know that
Adam and Eve would disobey?*

The answer to that is yes, of course He did.

Now you're probably screaming at your screen, *THEN WHY DID HE LET IT
HAPPEN?*

And the answer is **because it was all part of His plan.**

God, through Adam and Eve's disobedience and descent into sin, made
**the perfect free will environment:** enough evidence of His existence
to convince anyone willing to believe, but enough ambiguity so as to not
coerce the unwilling. And that's exactly what He wants: *only willing
believers. And the only ones who will be saved from their*
***pre-existing*** *life of sin are the ones who truly, freely,
willingly choose to love Him.*

And how do you get only willing believers? Set up a system whereby the
only people who will believe are **truly** willing to believe. You will
not see the truth until you are willing to see the truth. And the
alternative is equally as compelling (in your own eyes) as God's truth.
So if you don't want to see the truth, you can be perfectly content in
your disbelief.

It's the perfect free-choice environment. If you choose not to believe
in the truth of Christianity, you can freely reject it. And to make sure
your choice is truly free, He places you in this environment filled with
evidence of His existence, **but without His direct presence**, which
would be so overwhelming and powerful as to override your free will and
coerce you into belief.
