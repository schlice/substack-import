I don't understand your question. What a criminal does to my mother has
no bearing on the existence of God.

Yes, bad things happen to good people. No, I don't understand where
everyone has gotten the crazy idea that believing in God makes all bad
things go away. I don't understand where people have gotten the idea
that God is supposed to make all bad things stop. I don't understand the
idea that God is somehow beholden to act in the way people think he
should act, or expect him to act. And I have no idea how you think that
this is logical:

- If I were God, I'd make all bad things go away.
- Therefore, if God exists, all bad things should go away.
- Bad things happen.
- Therefore, God does not exist.

God acts as God acts. Man acts as man acts. Don't hold God to man's
rules. God doesn't hold you to his. He gives you the choice to follow
his rules. That's called "free will," by the way.

But he offers something way better than anything you can possibly
imagine if you do.

**Eternal life**.

It's something worth considering before you do whatever you were
planning on doing next.
