**Trump has threatened to send U. S. military to close the southern
border. Would this be a violation of The Posse Comitatus Act of 1878?**

No.

The Posse Comitatus Act says that the military cannot enforce state law.
The military can indeed enforce Federal law and can defend the country
in general.

Border protection falls under the purview of the US government, not the
state; therefore, it is not a violation of Posse Comitatus to enforce
the nation's border.

(EDIT) But if that's not enough, I give you The Constitution, Article
IV, section 4:

> The United States shall guarantee to every state in this union a
> republican form of government, **and shall protect each of them
> against invasion;** and on application of the legislature, or of the
> executive (when the legislature cannot be convened) against domestic
> violence.

I'm pretty sure that it would be drop-dead easy to make the case that
tens of thousands of migrants attempting to illegally cross the border
would constitute an invasion.

The US Armed Forces exist to defend the United States against all
enemies, foreign and domestic, which is expressly authorized by the US
Constitution. In fact, guarding the Southern border was the Army's
primary peacetime mission until 1940, and no one ever declared that
doing so was in violation of Posse Comitatus. The Border Patrol wasn't
even formed until 1924, so claiming the intent of Posse Comitatus was to
prevent US Army troops from guarding the border is nonsense.
