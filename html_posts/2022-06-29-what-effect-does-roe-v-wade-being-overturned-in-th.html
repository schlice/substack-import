Absolutely none. And that fact is ***critical*** for pro-life males to
understand.

I will never know what it feels like to be pregnant.\
I will never know what it feels like to grow a human being inside my
body.\
I will never know the (albeit temporary) pain of childbirth.\
I will never know what it feels like to feed a baby with my body.

In short, I will never know what it feels like to be *a mother*.

I know what it feels like to be a father. I am a father three times
over. I've had some great successes, and I've made some monumental
errors. Some of those were even my fault (gee, how humble of me). But
through all of it, I've *grown*. And based on how my boys turned out,
I'd say we did a pretty decent job.

But this decision has zero impact on my personal life. None. Even if I
had the opportunity to have sex with another woman, I can't have any
more children. So this *literally* has zero impact on me.

But as pro-life men, this doesn't mean that it has zero impact on my
brothers and sisters. And it certainly has a tremendous impact on the
pre-born human beings whose rights we have come closer to protecting.

What I'm getting at is that while we champion the cause of the pre-born
humans who have no voice, we must remember that this decision
*profoundly* and *uniquely* impacts **a woman**. Often, the charge that
"men just want to control women's bodies" is made because women feel
like men make these decisions that do not impact them, so there can be
no other reason for such a decision other than that they want to control
women. We must be sensitive to this fact while we fight for equal rights
for the pre-born.

Men really don't want to control women's bodies. Seriously. If that were
true, we'd be advocating for all sorts of laws which have nothing at all
to do with pregnancy. I thought the old trope was "barefoot and pregnant
in the kitchen." Where's the legislation to keep women barefoot? Where's
the legislation to keep women in the kitchen, or at least out of the
workforce? Surprisingly (it seems), it's not there, nor are there any
calls for such legislation to pe passed, outside of some very, very
fringe people.

What you do with your body is your decision. But that's *your* body.
What you do with *other people's* bodies is **decidedly not** your
decision. Morally speaking, your bodily autonomy has limits, just as
mine does. Equally, we cannot make decisions about our bodies which
affect the lives of other humans. Remember, "the right to swing your arm
ends at my nose." Your rights are absolute *until they begin to impact
my rights.*

So while I'm glad that the Court has finally reversed a Constitutionally
fraught decision, we're not done. This is a *checkpoint*, not the
*finish line.*
