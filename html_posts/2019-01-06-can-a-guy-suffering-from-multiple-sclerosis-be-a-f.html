I don't want to steal [[David Perlmutter,
MD](https://www.quora.com/profile/David-Perlmutter-MD)]{.qlink_container}'s
thunder, but I was asked to answer, so I will proffer an answer. If Dr.
Perlmutter wants to elaborate further during his session, he certainly
can.

There are several questions which are implied in this question, so let
me see if I can break them down and answer them in relation to someone
with MS:

- Can a man with MS actually create a child?
- Can a man with MS be a good father?
- Should a man with MS have children?

These are all questions I have been asked at one time or another (or
have actually asked myself, as I am a father of three). So I'll go
through these each:

**Can a man with MS actually create a child?**

The answer is usually yes. MS can cause sexual dysfunction, so it is
possible that a man with MS may have some difficulty with intercourse.

So a brief sex ed lesson: Sexual arousal begins in the brain (your
body's largest sex organ). The brain sends signals down the central
nervous system to your sexual organs to begin the physical process of
sexual intercourse.

If MS damages the pathways between the brain and the sex organs, sexual
responses, which include both arousal and orgasm, can be directly
affected.

Tangentially related, but not directly related to the physical process
of intercourse, is the fact that MS also causes fatigue and depression,
which may mean that a man is either too tired for, or is not interested
in, sex.

A fascinating little snippet offered by the National MS Society that
really makes you pause:

Treatments are available to assist men with sexual dysfunction.

- Oral meds like Viagra or Cialis
- Injectable meds like papaverine and phentolamine which also increase
  bloodflow to the penis
- The

  small suppository in the penis
- Implants, most notably inflatable devices.

**Can a man with MS be a good father?**

My first symptom with MS was optic neuritis. The swelling on the optic
nerve of my right eye caused a number of symptoms. One of those symptoms
was a decrease in speed of signals traveling from my cornea to my brain.
This caused a double-image when I looked at things moving quickly. This
presents a problem when you're talking about the functioning of stereo
images. We use both of our eyes together to determine *distance* from
objects. If the signal from one eye is reaching the brain at a different
time than the signal from the other eye, you get a double image, and you
can't accurately determine the object's distance away from you.

This becomes critical when someone throws a baseball at you. When I was
in full relapse, I couldn't catch a baseball. I couldn't accurately
determine where the ball was.

This was extremely depressing to me, as I had one more son who was just
getting interested in baseball. I feared I'd never be able to play catch
with him. I can count on one hand the number of times my own father
played catch with me, and when I had children, I vowed to not make the
same mistake with them. I'd play any time they wanted. I'd make time if
I had to. And now, something was preventing me from playing catch. It
was devastating and depressing.

I did get through it. Not only did the optic neuritis remit (allowing me
to see well enough out of that eye to catch a ball again), but I was
able to play catch with my youngest son while he was in his little
league years.

So back to the question. Yes, a man with MS can be a great father. You
must understand that your ability to be a good father is not related to
what you can or can't do physically. You can still love your children,
and you can still guide your children and be a mentor and role model for
your children. Show your children, through your actions, that while you
may have MS, your MS does not have you. Show your children what you
*can* do, as opposed to what you can't do. Do that, and you'll be an
excellent father.

**Should a man with MS have children?**

I struggled with this question myself. The odds in society of someone
developing MS are around 1 in 750. Having a first-degree relative with
MS (either a parent or sibling) changes those odds to anywhere between 1
in 100 and 1 in 40. Of course, it's not all genetic, but we know that
there is a genetic component to MS.

I was already basically done having children by the time I developed MS.
My youngest child was 3 when I was diagnosed. Knowing that I was
basically done having children by the time I was diagnosed made my own
decision a little easier.

Understanding the risks (which are small), you have to decide for
yourself whether or not you want to have children.

You can still be a good father (as we discussed above). And while we can
see that there may be an increased risk of your children developing MS,
we still don't know why. It could be that they are growing up exposed to
the same environmental triggers as you were, but if you moved away from
your childhood home, you may now be exposed to different triggers. There
are many factors that play into an individual's risk of developing MS,
and your children may be exposed to different ones than you. Also, don't
forget that treatments are advancing quickly, and have been since the
90s. Being able to live with MS is getting easier every day. Eventually,
we will get to a point where we will either have full control over the
disease process, or we eliminate the disease entirely. All of these are
things to factor in to your decision.

You and your wife should discuss this together before deciding on
whether or not you are going to have children (or continue having
children).
