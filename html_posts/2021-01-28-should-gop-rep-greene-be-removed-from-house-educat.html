**Should GOP Rep. Greene be removed from House Education Committee
because she believes all mass shootings and school shootings are faked
by Democrats to promote gun control?**

I'm going to take a hard pass at looking at the actual beliefs, because
no one should be denied a position simply because of how they think.

We have not yet progressed to Orwell's Thought Police in the United
States, though that's the direction we are headed. It is questions like
this which seek to demonize "wrongthink" and punish people for holding
unpopular opinions.

And who's to say that she can't be persuaded with eloquent and
well-structured arguments? People do change their minds, on occasion.
