There are no instructions from Christ telling Christians to fast. If you
can find one, I'd be interested to hear it.

**Fasting is** **taking your mind off of the things of this world so
that you can focus more on God.**

Fasting is often in conjunction with periods of prayer (cf Luke 2:37;
5:33). In Acts, the apostles would often fast before making big
decisions (cf Acts 13:2; 14:23).

Fasting is most frequently associated with food, but it is not
necessarily about food, because you can "fast" from anything. Anything
you give up temporarily so that you can focus your attention on God can
be considered a fast (cf 1 Corinthians 7:1-5). Fasting should only be
done for a limited time, especially if you are fasting from food,
because it can be unhealthy and dangerous otherwise.

Fasting doesn't make God do what we want, either. It also doesn't make
God like our ideas more. Fasting is about **us**, not about God. Fasting
is about removing the distractions of life so that we can focus more
clearly on God.

In the part of Romans 14 you referenced, Paul used the example of food,
but it's not about eating or not eating. It's about *judging each
other.* Paul says that some people might eat meat, and some people might
not. But if you eat meat, don't judge the people who don't eat meat. God
doesn't, so you shouldn't either.

And as far as the Sabbath goes, Paul says that some people might
consider one day more holy than the rest. Some other people might
consider all the days to be equally holy. But regardless of where you
stand on the issue, don't judge each other because of those beliefs. God
doesn't, so you shouldn't either.

> Whoever regards one day as special does so to the Lord. Whoever eats
> meat does so to the Lord, for they give thanks to God; and whoever
> abstains does so to the Lord and gives thanks to God. --- Romans 14:6
> NIV
