You can tell a lot from a launch event from the information that they
give, but you can tell just as much from the information that they
*don\'t* give.

For example, in today\'s launch event, Apple did not tell you the exact
milliamp hour (mAh) rating of any of the three phones batteries. They
only said some obscure things like "this phone will last for 1.5 hours
longer than the iPhone 8.". If they had made great strides in their
battery technology, or they had included a battery that was incredibly
larger than the battery in the iPhone X, they would be making a big deal
of it. The fact that they did not says that the new batteries probably
aren\'t very much bigger than the batteries in the current iPhone X.

To answer the question, Apple didn\'t say specifically in today\'s
launch event that they were using an AMOLED panel from a different
manufacturer than Samsung. You would think that if Apple had chosen an
AMOLED panel from a different manufacturer than Samsung, they would make
a bigger deal about it (considering that Samsung overall is a direct
competitor). The fact that they haven\'t leads me to believe that
Samsung is still the manufacturer of the new phone's AMOLED panel.
