**Content:** [There are several things you can do.\
\
1. Sit somewhere where there is an open seat next to you so you can
place your carry-on under that seat instead. Or sit in the last row and
put your carry on under your own seat. This leaves the area at your feet
open for you to stretch out.\
\
2. If you\'re tall like me, you can bring your knees up and place them
on the seatback in front of you, like kids do on school buses.\
\
3. If no one is in the seat next to you, stretch your legs into the
underseat area of the seat in front of you.\
\
4. Or if all else fails, get up once or twice during the flight to
stretch your legs.]{.rendered_qtext}
