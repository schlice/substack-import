**Does doctor-patient confidentiality have the same definition across
all US states?**

No, it does not.

The Federal Rules of Evidence do not recognize doctor-patient
confidentiality.

At the state level, doctor-patient privilege is dependent on state law,
and it does vary. For example, in Texas, doctor-patient privilege is
limited.
