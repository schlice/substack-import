Rape is a crime against society only insomuch as it "shocks the
conscience" of society. Therefore, society is a victim insofar as
society in general is harmed by rapes which occur in society. Society is
not the actual victim.

Rape victims have the ultimate choice whether or not they file a police
report. I will never bemoan a rape victim if he or she chooses to not
file a report for one reason or another. It's their choice.
