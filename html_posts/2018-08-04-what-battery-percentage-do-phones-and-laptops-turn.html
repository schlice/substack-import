**What battery percentage do phones and laptops turn off at (it\'s more
than 0)?**

It is different for every device.

The reason that phones and laptops turn off without completely draining
the battery is twofold:

1.  To protect the electronics which can be damaged if they are forced
    to run with too low of a voltage, and
2.  To protect the battery, which can be damaged if it is drained too
    far.
