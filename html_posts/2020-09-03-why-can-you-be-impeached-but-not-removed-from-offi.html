**Why can you be impeached but not removed from office?**

Impeachment can be roughly equated to an indictment in the legal system,
even though impeachment and removal from office are political actions,
not legal ones.

An impeachment simply says that the House found enough evidence to start
a "trial" in the Senate. The person must still be "convicted" in the
Senate in order to be removed from office.

In every other impeachment before Trump, a majority of Representatives
on both sides of the aisle found that there was evidence to proceed to
trial. In Trump's impeachment, not a single Republican voted to impeach.
Zero. This shows that this particular impeachment was 100% politically
motivated and did not actually have enough evidence to succeed on its
merits. Basically, it was dead on arrival at the Senate.

Some people like to comment. Some people like to engage with me in a
civil manner, and I did kinda miss that\...a little. But do not
misunderstand, I take this step very cautiously. My mental well-being
isn\'t worth your harassing, inane behavior. If you don\'t like what I
wrote, tough shit. If my answer is grammatically low-quality or is
un-cited opinion masquerading as fact, downvote it. If you think I\'m
wrong, write your own answer. But Quora is a question-and-answer site,
not a debate site. If you are simply commenting to tell me \"ackshually,
you\'re wrong,\" don\'t be surprised if I quietly delete your comment.
Put anything vaguely harassing in there, and your deletion will be
followed by a block and a mute, and a BNBR report. I will do this
immediately and with no compunction. You have been warned. Be nice.*
