**A security guard at a strip mall denied access to stairs for my child
with prosthetic legs. He said the owners told him they didn't want kids
with prosthetics using their stairs. Is this okay in California?**

In the United States, businesses must provide reasonable accommodations
to those with disabilities. So long as there is an alternate method to
get upstairs, a business can certainly restrict stairs to those with
prosthetics, especially considering the liability involved should that
person fall.

If there is no elevator or other method for the disabled child to get
upstairs, the business could get in trouble for the denial.
