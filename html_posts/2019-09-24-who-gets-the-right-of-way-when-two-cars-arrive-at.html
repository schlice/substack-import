**Who gets the right of way when two cars arrive at a two-way stop from
opposite directions but one car is make a left while the other is going
straight?**

The laws in nearly every state in the United States say that the vehicle
going straight has the right of way over the vehicle turning, but
remember these are all dictated by state law, and each state can be
different.
