**Can multiple sclerosis cause strange sensations in the head?**

[[Erica

is, as always, spot on.

The short answer is **we don't know**. The longer answer is *it could,
but you need a neurologist to confirm*.

No two people who get MS will experience it in exactly the same way.
Everyone's MS is different, and even for people who have the same
symptoms, they will experience those symptoms differently. For example,
let's say Erica and I both experience fatigue (a common MS symptom, also
called MS Lassitude). She may experience her fatigue constantly
throughout the day as a persistent weight on her body, while I may
experience it as getting hit by a freight train at night that I better
be near a bed because I'm goin' down and nothing is going to stop me
from going to sleep.

So could your "strange sensations in your head" be MS-related? Yes, it
could, but you need a neurologist to help you diagnose what *else* could
cause those symptoms before MS is declared the cause. MS is a diagnosis
of exclusion, as every symptom caused by MS can also be caused by other
diseases or conditions. You must rule out all other causes before you
can say that any particular symptom is caused by MS. In general, you
need a neurologist's help to do that, either through physical exam, or
through blood tests or other diagnostic testing.
