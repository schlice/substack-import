You are correct, the Bible says clearly that Jesus did not sin (c.f. 2
Cor 5:1, 1 Peter 2:22). The question you pose, of course, is *how* did
Jesus not sin.

And the answer comes down to whether or not Jesus was *capable* of sin.
**We believe the clear teaching of the Bible is that Jesus was**
***impeccable*; He was not capable of sin.**

Jesus was born sinless because He did not inherit the sin of Adam by
being conceived of a man. Therefore, He did not have sin within Him. Sin
is, by definition, breaking God's law. Since Jesus is God, Jesus cannot
sin because Jesus (God) cannot violate His own nature and break His own
law.

Jesus was indeed tempted, but He never sinned because He is incapable of
sin. Temptation alone is not sin, as Satan tempted Jesus in the desert
and He still did not sin. Temptation is experiencing an outside
influence suggesting that you sin. *Going beyond the temptation* would
be to consider actually sinning and to consider the possible pleasures
and consequences of such an act, *to the degree that the act is already
taking place in your mind*. **That** is sin. Jesus never did that.
