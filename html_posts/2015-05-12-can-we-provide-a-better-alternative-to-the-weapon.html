**Content:** [Many of these things have been tried over the years. Most
often, they fail because they are ineffective against deadly force. Any
weapon which can fire as fast as a bullet will have as devastating an
impact as a bullet, because of the kinetic energy involved in propelling
the projectile. Tranquilizers take too long to work, are too variable
amongst people, and have little effect on people high on certain drugs.
And if someone has an allergic reaction to the tranquilizer, they can
still die.\
\
We need to determine why we are looking to replace the firearm. Are you
concerned that people are dying when they shouldn\'t? Or are you saying
that cops shouldn\'t be allowed to wield deadly force? Or are you saying
that cops don\'t have enough tools on their continuum of force to
effectively stop someone without so much of a potential for causing
death?\
\
Cops have a number of tools at their disposal that comprise the
\"continuum of force\" from least to greatest force:\

- Bare hands
- Pepper Spray
- Baton/impact weapon\
- Taser
- Firearm\

Are you proposing to make a tool that *supplants* one of these tools, or
is an *addition* to the bag-o-tricks that an officer has at his
disposal?\
\
If you are going to supplant (replace) an officer\'s firearm, the weapon
has to have similar characteristics. It has to be a weapon that:\

- fires as fast as a bullet. A .40 S&W Remington Golden Saber 180 Grain
  Jacketed Hollow Point has a muzzle velocity of **1015 fps.** For
  comparison, a Taser dart flies at about 150 fps, about 1/10th of the
  speed of a bullet.
- has the stopping power of a bullet. A .40 S&W Remington Golden Saber
  180 Grain Jacketed Hollow Point has muzzle energy of **412 ft/lbs**.
  You have to be able to knock down and stop large attackers who may be
  high on drugs and immune to a great deal of physical pain.
- Has the range and accuracy of a bullet. A decent marksman can hit
  targets at 30 yards (around 90 feet) consistently. Tasers are only
  effective at a much closer range (around 25 feet for the police
  model), so if you stand outside the range of the Taser, it\'s useless.
  Granted, this is a greater range than a baton or pepper spray, but it
  has to be something that is highly accurate at 30 yards.\
- is as reliable as a firearm. It can\'t have complex electronics that
  could fail. It should be a simple mechanical device to ensure that it
  can be deployed consistently, and has at least four 9\'s reliability
  (i.e. will work 99.99% of the time).\

Unfortunately, something that fires at 1000+ fps and with a stopping
power of 400+ ft/lbs is going to be a deadly weapon. Therefore, the
firearm is used as the method to apply deadly force.\
\
There are two main reasons why firearms are the preferred method for
applying deadly force:\

- ***Firearms are the most reliable method to stop the act***. Firearms
  are simple, reliable, compact, and have the largest degree of
  certainty that they will stop the act. No other method has such a high
  degree of certainty. When you hit the top of the force continuum, you
  have to have something that will reliably stop the act. If your pain
  tolerance is high enough and the darts don\'t land correctly, then
  it\'s possible that a Taser will be ineffective. Cops who have reached
  for their Taser instead of their firearm have been killed by criminals
  who used deadly force. A firearm is the most reliable method to
  deliver force to stop an act. If you are performing an act that could
  cause great harm to the public or the officer, and you\'re refusing to
  listen to reason, and you won\'t stop, the officer is duty-bound to
  stop you through whatever means is at his disposal. Yes, causing
  someone\'s death is unpleasant. We never intend to cause death, but as
  you rightly note, being shot leaves someone with a high probability of
  death. However, Tasers can also cause death. They cause death far less
  often than bullets, but Tasers are less-than-lethal force that can
  still cause death.\
- ***Cops meet deadly force with deadly force***. If someone comes at me
  with deadly force, I can respond with deadly force. At that point,
  does the tool that provides the deadly force really matter? And what
  does \"deadly force\" look like? It looks like any act that could
  cause great harm to the public or to the officer. An act that can
  cause great harm combined with a suspect who is belligerent, fails to
  follow directions, and is uncooperative are a recipe for getting shot.
  Understand that using a Taser leaves an officer or the public
  vulnerable to harm. It\'s not foolproof. If it doesn\'t work quickly
  and reliably, it\'s not useful as a tool to stop someone; you\'re
  still going to need deadly force. You don\'t meet lethal force with
  less-than-lethal force. That\'s a recipe for disaster.\

In a continuum of force where the upper limit of that force is deadly
force, a firearm is still the most effective method to deliver that
deadly force.
