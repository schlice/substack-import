Have you actually spoken to them? They probably already know that you
have enough real capital to pay the bill. In their eyes, you're simply
choosing to not pay the bill. But I have a hard time believing that they
are simply refusing to put a payment plan together for you. Unless you
have so much real capital that they **know** you are not financially
hurting and can easily pay, I do believe they would help you.

You should call their billing department and try to work out a plan. If
they refuse, you could allow the bill to go to collections who will be
more likely to work out that plan for you (at a cost to your credit
score). You can also enlist the services of a debt restructuring or debt
consolidation company who can sell you a product which will cover all of
your bills and you then make monthly payments towards. You may find this
to be more palatable than convincing the hospital that you need a
payment plan.

As a last resort, you can declare bankruptcy and have the courts force
the hospital to work out a payment plan, if you literally do not have
enough real capital to cover the bill. But that's only if you don't have
enough real capital to cover the bill. You own a car? Sell it. You own a
house? Sell it. You own any other real property? Sell it. At that point,
if you simply don't have enough real property to cover the bill, you
declare bankruptcy which triggers all sorts of debt restructuring. Some
debtors may simply choose to excuse the debt. Most will opt to establish
a court-overseen payment plan where you and any other debtors you have
work together to come up with a payment plan you can afford. Believe me,
you'll be eating popcorn and Mac 'n' Cheese for the whole time you're
paying, because every last nickel will go towards paying those debts.
But it can work if you can tough it out.

There is a difference between "can't pay" and "don't want to pay."
Debtors of all flavors know those differences, and most consumers do
not.
