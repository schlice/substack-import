**Has the 2nd Amendment ever helped America? (ex. has any mass shooter
been taken down by a civilian gun)**

I think you artificially limit yourself when you focus on mass
shootings. The number of people who die in mass shootings every year
*pales* in comparison to the number of people who die at the barrel of a
gun, and that number is *orders of magnitude* smaller than the number of
people who use a gun to **stop** crime, in most cases without a single
shot being fired.

In other words, guns are used ***far*** more frequently to prevent crime
than they are to commit crime.

So does the 2nd Amendment help America? **Absolutely.**
