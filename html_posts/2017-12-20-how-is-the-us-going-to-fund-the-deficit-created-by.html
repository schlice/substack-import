**How is the US going to fund the deficit created by the new tax
legislation that was recently passed by Congress?**

*It won't! We've just indebted our children and our children's children
for the next 1245607656.7 years!*

*We're just going to borrow more money from China!*

*Duh! Corporations aren't going to re-invest that money! They're going
to line their own pockets with it!*

Thankfully, there are some people in the world who are still rational
thinkers.

The figures that are being used to show that these tax cuts will raise
the deficit come from the Congressional Budget Office. It still amazes
me that such a group exists, since Congress hasn't passed a Budget in
decades. But that's neither here nor there. The CBO also doesn't know
how to factor time value of money or discounting.

But in all cases, **it is above-average spending, not below-average
revenues,** which accounted for 92 percent of rising budget deficits by
2014 and will account for 100 percent by the end of 2017.

So it's cool that we're really worried about the tax cuts causing
deficits in the same way that dropping a rock into the Pacific will
cause a tidal wave.

So, a few takeaways to quash the nay-sayers:

**1. Declining revenues do not drive future deficits.**

In fact, it is *runaway entitlement spending*, **not** declining
government revenue, that drives the deficit. Even with the tax cuts,
revenues are still expected to outpace their historical averages.

**2. You can't tax your way out of a deficit.**

If we're going to stick with numbers from the CBO, in order to finance
the Obama administration's 10 percent of GDP long-term cost increase for
Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, it would require permanently
raising taxes by \$12,000 per household (adjusted for both inflation and
income growth). You must stop runaway spending in order to fix the
deficit.

**3. Even with modest GDP increases caused by tax cuts, they do pay for
themselves.**

If the tax cut adds 0.3% to the GDP (and everything else stays the same,
which is not true either), the deficit caused by the tax cuts would be
paid off in 27 years. But even that fails to take into account the
discounting factor (future money is less valuable than today's money) so
that figure is still too high.

Over the past 50 years, Washington has collected an average of 18% of
GDP in revenue, spent 20.3% of GDP, running a sustainable deficit of
2.3% of GDP. And even as tax revenue changes, government revenue from
taxes has rarely strayed from that 18% figure.

So if you want to fix the deficit, focus on fixing the plank of runaway
entitlement spending, don't worry so much about the speck of tax cuts.
