**Do the majority of gun owners support some form of background checks,
safety and training instruction, testing, permits, documentation of
transfer/sale, registration and/or psychological evaluations as a
condition of firearm purchase or ownership?**

*As a condition of firearm purchase or ownership?* **No.** There are no
rights which should be subject to conditions. The whole purpose of the
Amendment is to prevent government infringing on the right to "keep and
bear" arms. Infringing on the right can only be done in the least
restrictive way to accomplish a compelling state interest, and none of
those things can be proven to further a compelling state interest. The
state must also do so in the least restrictive way possible, and forcing
tens of millions of Americans to do all that stuff is arguably (and
clearly) not the least restrictive way to accomplish whatever compelling
state interest such tasks purport to accomplish.

*As a condition of carrying a firearm in public?* **Yes,** **with
caveats.** The right to keep the public safe is why the state would want
to do all of those things. Before you can do any of those things,
however, you have to be able to articulate what compelling state
interest is served by doing any one of those things:

- background checks
- safety and training instruction
- permits, which may include safety and instruction, and testing
- documentation of transfer/sale
- registration of firearms
- psychological evaluations

If you cannot articulate clearly (and include clear evidence which
shows) that a compelling state interest is served by doing those things,
and that doing this to all gun carriers is the least restrictive way to
accomplish that interest, you can't do it. That's why we have what we
have, and we don't have what we don't have. It's not because of any
collective laziness or NRA pushback that we don't have these so-called
"good things." It's because they either don't accomplish what the
proponents believe they accomplish, or it's not done in the least
restrictive way possible to the right upon which you are encroaching.

Also, be aware that as a condition of carrying a firearm in public
(either openly or concealed), most jurisdictions do many of these
things.

I'm also not going to go into each one of these; they've all been pretty
well drilled to death here on Quora; search around on each individual
item and you'll find some pretty lengthy discussions about whether we
should or should not do it.
