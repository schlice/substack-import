Let me explain how taxes and tax cuts work. I'll do this using a story.

\

Ten men go to dinner every night. They all eat together, and their bill
is \$100 every night. The men decide that they will split the bill in
the same way that taxes work, based on the amount of money each man
makes. Therefore, the first four (who earned the least) paid \$0, the
fifth paid \$1, the sixth paid \$3, the seventh paid \$7, the eighth
paid \$12, the ninth paid \$18, and the tenth (the richest man there)
paid \$59. The men all agreed that this would be a fair way to split the
bill.

This arrangement went on for quite some time, until one day the owner of
the restaurant approached their table. He said, "You men are great
customers; you're in here every night and you never had a problem paying
your bill. Because I want to give something back to my most valued
customers, I'm going to take \$20 off of your bill. Your new nightly
bill will be \$80."

The men struggled as to how they should divvy up this newfound wealth.
Should they just give \$2 to everyone at the table? Well, that wouldn't
be fair, they thought, because there are four men at the table who paid
nothing to begin with; they'd be ***making*** money off of the deal. So
they decided to divide the \$20 in the same way that they paid the bill,
based on how much money they contributed to the bill.

So under the new arrangement, the first four men (who earned the least)
still paid nothing. The fifth man, however, now also paid nothing The
sixth man now paid \$2, the seventh man now paid \$5, the eighth man
paid \$9, the ninth man paid \$12, and the tenth man now paid \$52.

As the men left dinner that night, they examined the bills and spoke
amongst themselves.

The first four men said, "Hey, there was a \$20 rebate and we didn't get
any of it! The system doesn't help the poor to improve their condition
in life!"

The sixth man said, "Yeah, I only got one dollar back, but the richest
guy got \$7! The system unfairly rewards the rich! Let's get 'em!"

So they all ganged up on the rich guy and beat him up.

The next night at dinner, guess what? The rich guy was *gone!* He had
taken his money and moved out of the United States.

\

While this story is slightly simplified, this is basically how taxes and
tax rebates work in the United States. It appears terribly unfair
initially, but if you give tax rebates in the same way you charge taxes,
it's actually quite fair (assuming you consider progressive taxes "fair"
to begin with).

And if you beat up the rich guys just because they're rich and appear to
get the biggest benefit from tax cuts and tax rebates, don't be
surprised if they take all of their money and leave.
