**Content:** [Officers can balance the need to execute the law with
professional discretion. Line officers are the \"gatekeepers\" to the
legal system, and professional discretion is part of the job. There are
certain mitigating circumstances that could lead an officer to not
arrest an individual. Some of them may be:\
]{.rendered_qtext}

- The seriousness of the crime
- Prior criminal record
- Strength of the evidence
- Preference of the victim
- Relationship between the victim and suspect
- Demeanor of the suspect
- Characteristics of the victim
- Behavior
- Visibility of the event (i.e. media or witnesses)\
- Neighborhood characteristics
- Individual officer characteristics \[1\]\

However, if an officer was supposed to arrest someone and they chose to
exercise professional discretion, they can certainly face repercussions
from that decision. If the decision was found to have been inappropriate
for any number of reasons, the officer could face re-training,
reassignment, or other disciplinary actions.\
