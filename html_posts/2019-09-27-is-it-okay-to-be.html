It's never okay to be anti-Semitic.

Ever.

Well, I really don't need to say much more than that, but the Quora
Collapse-o-Bot will do its dirty work if I don't add more stuff.

So I tried to use my traditional *Lorem Ipsum Generator* to add words,
but my answer got collapsed because it wasn't in English.

Sigh.

So instead, I went to my favorite English gibberish text generator,
[[dummytextgenerator.com](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=9c78a1&url=http://dummytextgenerator.com){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="dummytextgenerator.com"}]{.qlink_container}, and replaced
the Latin with English. So there you are.

*Sea night a given moving very face give firmament. Us cattle image sea
wherein tree creeping, air shall. Created upon moveth and set dominion
firmament that she\'d blessed above. Make morning give made. Very,
without in day first darkness fish also.*

*Fowl blessed his great whales them great. Divided cattle let upon forth
grass man shall also. Given bring whales fourth make. Whales forth was
kind very, given i stars set every. Creepeth beast place moveth the
replenish called fruit given yielding deep. Isn\'t. That divided bearing
itself replenish likeness, it thing whose they\'re isn\'t, behold for
firmament their fill.*
