<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [To Bill Moyers\' point, a corporation is a legal<br>construct; a corporation is not a person. A corporation is considered a<br>legal entity separate from the people that make it up, but a corporation<br>is not a person. In some cases, a corporation can be considered a<br>person, but not for all things that people are considered people.\<br>\<br>Under common law, the definition of murder is \"the unlawful killing of<br>a human *by another human* with malice and forethought.\"\<br>\<br>Since a corporation is not a human, it cannot technically be charged<br>with murder. The officers of the corporation, on the other hand, can be<br>charged individually (usually) with conspiracy to commit murder.<br>Probably much safer legal footing than trying to charge a corporation<br>with murder.\<br>\<br>On the other hand, it is possible (however unlikely) that a corporation<br>could be charged with manslaughter. For example, an automobile<br>manufacturer could be charged with manslaughter if it knew that<br>implementing a change, or failing to implement a change, would cause<br>death and, for the sake of the corporation, it chose not to do so, that<br>corporation could potentially be charged with manslaughter.\<br>\<br>Jennifer Arlen, a professor at NYU Law School, says that while<br>difficult, [[a corporation can be charged with<br>manslaughter](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=5ef472&url=http://fortune.com/2014/06/05/could-gm-be-charged-with-murder/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="fortune.com"}]{.qlink_container}:\<br>]<br><br>> For a company to be charged with manslaughter, Arlen said, a few<br>> things have to happen. First, prosecutors would have to be able to<br>> find a specific person whose actions led to people dying. Second, that<br>> person would have to have taken those actions for the benefit of the<br>> company and within the scope of their employment, and have been "in<br>> the right mental state" when they took the actions.<br><br>> For instance, Arlen said, if a postal employee walks into a post<br>> office and shoots innocent bystanders, they are not acting "on behalf<br>> of the company." So, even though it happened in a post office and was<br>> committed by a postal employee, the post office would not be guilty of<br>> homicide because the shooter was not acting on behalf of the company.\<br><br>So while it\'s unlikely but possible that you could charge a corporation<br>with manslaughter, it\'s extremely unlikely, if not impossible, to<br>charge a corporation with murder.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
