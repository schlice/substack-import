**Content:** [To Bill Moyers\' point, a corporation is a legal
construct; a corporation is not a person. A corporation is considered a
legal entity separate from the people that make it up, but a corporation
is not a person. In some cases, a corporation can be considered a
person, but not for all things that people are considered people.\
\
Under common law, the definition of murder is \"the unlawful killing of
a human ***by another human*** with malice and forethought.\"\
\
Since a corporation is not a human, it cannot technically be charged
with murder. The officers of the corporation, on the other hand, can be
charged individually (usually) with conspiracy to commit murder.
Probably much safer legal footing than trying to charge a corporation
with murder.\
\
On the other hand, it is possible (however unlikely) that a corporation
could be charged with manslaughter. For example, an automobile
manufacturer could be charged with manslaughter if it knew that
implementing a change, or failing to implement a change, would cause
death and, for the sake of the corporation, it chose not to do so, that
corporation could potentially be charged with manslaughter.\
\
Jennifer Arlen, a professor at NYU Law School, says that while
difficult, [[a corporation can be charged with
manslaughter](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=5ef472&url=http://fortune.com/2014/06/05/could-gm-be-charged-with-murder/){.external_link

So while it\'s unlikely but possible that you could charge a corporation
with manslaughter, it\'s extremely unlikely, if not impossible, to
charge a corporation with murder.
