**Is it right for homeowners associations to regulate how long you can
have holiday lights hung and in use?**

Let's answer this question by understanding what the purpose of a
Homeowner's Association actually is.

*Homeowner's Associations exist to keep your home value as high as
possible.*

They do this not by telling you what *you* can do with *your* home, but
by ensuring that your *neighbors* don't do wacky stuff to *their* homes,
which can, in turn, lower *your* home's value.

While it's challenging to make generalizations (as every neighborhood is
different), we can generalize and say that "a neat neighborhood
generally has higher home values than a messy neighborhood."

You can tell a messy neighborhood: you can barely drive up the street
because there are cars everywhere. One person painted his house hot
pink. Another has weeds as tall as the windows. A third has seven cars
in the driveway, and only three have wheels.

Then you drive to a neighboring community: the streets are (relatively)
car-free. The lawns are all (at least) mowed. No one's house is hot
pink. No one has an auto repair shop in their driveway. The neighborhood
at least appears to be a place where people would *want* to live.

Which neighborhood do you think could command a higher price for a
similar house?

Making sure that holiday decorations are only visible *during the
holidays* makes for a neat neighborhood. This is definitely squarely
within the purview of an HOA.

To bring the analogy home: when you have a house with year-round holiday
lights, what do you think that might do to the neighbors' home values?
Is it really fair to them? The HOA exists to keep *their* home values
high by preventing *you* from doing wacky things to *your* house which
might lower *their* property values.

**TL;DR: Making sure neighborhoods stay neat is an important part of an
HOA's job, so it is right for them to regulate how long before and after
the holidays you can have holiday lights hung.**
