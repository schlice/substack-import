**How do police radar/laser speedometers work while the police car is
already in motion?**

You asked two questions. I'll answer them individually.

1.  **How do\[es\] police radar work while the police car is already in
    motion?\
    \**
    The police car's in-car mounted RADAR system reads the speed of its
    surroundings to determine the speed of the vehicle. It can do this
    since it is "always-on" and it can determine the "speed" of the
    largest variety of objects in its beam, computing the speed of all
    of those similar objects as the speed of its surroundings, which
    means that that is the speed of the cruiser. It then uses some
    rather un-complicated maths to read the speed of the target vehicle,
    convert it to the vehicle's actual speed (either in addition to or
    subtracted from the cruiser's speed), and puts several numbers up on
    the screen: the speed of the cruiser, the speed of the *fastest*
    vehicle in its beam, and the speed of the *closest* vehicle in its
    beam.
2.  **How do police laser speedometers work while the police car is
    already in motion?\
    \**
    They do not. LIDAR requires the police cruiser to be stationary. The
    officer aims and scans vehicles using a "scope" not unlike a hunting
    scope. This allows the officer to accurately measure speed of
    individual vehicles. LIDAR can't be used in a moving vehicle since
    the LIDAR unit does not "know" the speed of its surroundings. It is,
    unlike RADAR, an "instant-on" beam, which only activates when the
    officer pulls the trigger to activate the beam. It can only tell the
    speed of the object upon which it is focused.
