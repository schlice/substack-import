**Why do alcoholics, even ex-alcoholics, have similar appearances? It
seems I can usually guess with good accuracy if a person has or had a
serious long-term drinking problem but I am not sure why.**

You're not wrong. Alcohol abuse, and the liver disease it causes,
actually causes several signs and symptoms on the skin that you've
probably subconsciously noticed in alcoholics, but really never put the
two together.

For example, one of the earliest signs of alcohol abuse is a
persistently red face due to enlarged blood vessels (telangiectasia).
This occurs because regulation of vascular control in the brain begins
to fail with regular alcohol abuse. I often notice the redness of the
nose and the cheeks first.

Flushing of the skin often occurs with alcoholics due to acetaldehyde,
the main chemical result of the breakdown of alcohol. A histamine
response to acetaldehyde causes the flushing.

If the alcohol abuse continues on to liver disease, other skin changes
can be noted, such as:

- spider telangiectasis (spider veins) appear on the face, the v of the
  neck, arms, chest, hands, and abdomen.
- Jaundice
- skin darkening around the eyes, mouth and legs
- nail changes
- skin cancers

There are others, but these are probably the ones you've noticed.
