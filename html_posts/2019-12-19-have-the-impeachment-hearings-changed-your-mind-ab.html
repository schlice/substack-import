**Have the impeachment hearings changed your mind about whether
President Trump should be impeached and/or removed from office? If so,
what specific facts or testimony swayed your opinion?**

For the vast majority of Americans, the hearings haven't changed their
minds.

If you already believed that Trump committed impeachable offenses, the
hearings galvanized your position.

If you already believed that Trump did not commit impeachable offenses,
the hearings galvanized your position.

It's the Independents that I'm interested in, and poll after poll shows
them flipping from supporting impeachment to opposing it.

In other words, as the impeachment hearings progressed, support for
impeachment waned. This is an indication that the hearings did not
positively change anyone's opinion about impeachment.
