excellent answer, it makes no difference whether or not you actually
called the police. It\'s unlikely that police would be sent to your
house from a prank call, but even assuming that they did, they wouldn\'t
be illegally entering your house unless *exigent circumstances* existed
that made them go in. They\'d check it out from the outside and then
leave.

If you shoot them when they\'re outside your house, you\'re going to
jail.
