**Content:** [Depends. If you\'re refurbishing them yourself, then eBay
is probably your best bet.\

You might also think about Asurion (the phone insurance retailer), and
find out where they get their refurbished devices from. If your devices
are refurbished, you can sell them directly to Asurion; if they are not,
you can sell your devices to the refurbisher.]{.rendered_qtext}
