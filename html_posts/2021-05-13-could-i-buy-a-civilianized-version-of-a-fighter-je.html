Of course. You can buy any airplane that is commercially made, if you
have the money.

Frequently, it is older fighter planes that are purchased by civilians,
as they are both easier to work on and to fly. Today's fighters require
a large maintenance presence and are more agile and challenging to fly
safely.

Original question:

**If money was not a problem, could a civilian buy a fighter jet and
learn to fly it?**
