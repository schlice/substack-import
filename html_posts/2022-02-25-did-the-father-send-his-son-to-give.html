This is an excellent question. We can rephrase it to a more basic
question:

***Is salvation a license to sin?***

The short answer is **no**. I think intuitively we probably knew that.

To understand the longer answer, we need to understand what happens when
a person is "saved."

When a person is truly saved, two things must happen: they must
**repent** of their sin, and they must **accept** Christ as their lord
and savior.

- **Repentance** means a "turning away" from your past life and your
  past sinful acts. Think of "turning your back on" your past life. The
  language about repentance is very figurative and descriptive,
  especially when it talks about "dying to your sins." Your old life is
  *over*. The old you **dies**.
- **Acceptance** means recognizing you are a sinner, you will always be
  a sinner (human nature being what it is), and you have **zero hope of
  salvation** without Christ.

Romans 6 (the whole chapter) discusses this concept. It is a *really
great read*, and I would recommend you read the New International
Version, as it is easy for the average English-speaking person today to
understand:

Just look at verse 1: "What shall we say, then? Shall we go on sinning
so that grace may increase?" What a fascinating thought! I mean, if some
grace in forgiving my sins is good, should I keep sinning so that I get
*more grace*? Verse 2 gives you the answer: "By no means! We are those
who have died to sin; how can we live in it any longer?" **By no
means!** Because we *died to sin*. Our old life is **dead**. We are
reborn as new people in Christ.

And now, the big question: ***Does this mean that once we are saved, we
automatically never sin again?***

**No.**

We are still human. Salvation doesn't change our human nature. We are
still sinful by nature. Salvation instead assures that Christ *paid for
my sin with his death and resurrection, past, present, and future.* I
certainly don't live in my old ways any more, but I still sin. I sin in
thought and I sin in action. I still get angry with that stupid driver
doing 15 miles an hour below the speed limit on the Interstate, or the
oblivious self-obsessed shopper blocking the entire aisle with her cart.
It happens.

But I try to stop it. Instead of snapping to judgement, I try instead to
pray for that person, that whatever is going on in their lives can be
handed over to God, as I did, so that they can experience the fullness
of God's grace, as I have.

Instead of thinking "What a Karen," I try to actively think, "Does she
even know how much God loves her?" It takes work, but you can improve on
your sinful nature.

Even so, I still go to God and ask forgiveness for the sins I committed
in thought and deed. I am still human, and I recognize that I still,
daily, need Christ's healing and power to transform lives. I'm being
transformed a little bit at a time, in a process called
*sanctification*. Salvation was a one-time, instantaneous action, while
*sanctification* is the process by which we, through faithful study and
prayer, are transformed into the person God wants us to be. It is
normally a lifelong process, but the results get more and more beautiful
every day.

I'm still a work in progress. Ultimately, *I'm not where I want to be,
but thank God I'm not where I* ***used*** *to be.*

Original question:

Did The Father send His Son to give \"Christians\" license to continue
living in repeated sin or do we use Christ to cease our repeated sin and
become children of God?
