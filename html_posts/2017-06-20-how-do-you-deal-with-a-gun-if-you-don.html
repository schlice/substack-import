1.  Meet your girlfriend somewhere else. You could potentially meet her
    in a more "gun-unfriendly" state like New York or California, where
    only the bad guys have guns. You'll be much safer then. You know
    those bad guys, always following the law and such.
2.  Get over your fear. It's irrational; no one is going to shoot you
    unless you threaten their life. Don't threaten anyone's life, and
    you won't get shot. Somehow, I've managed to live over 40 years
    without threatening anyone's life; you can probably survive one
    visit to America without doing it. Perhaps you can't; I don't know.
3.  If you simply can't get over your fear and you can't meet your
    girlfriend somewhere else, get a new girlfriend who doesn't live in
    the United States. But watch out for Switzerland. They all have guns
    there. It must be utter chaos, blood in the streets there too. We
    probably just don't hear about it.

This doesn't really seem that difficult to sort out.
