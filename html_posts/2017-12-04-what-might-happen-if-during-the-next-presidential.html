**What might happen if during the next presidential elections, a vast
majority does not vote for the offered candidates but instead, voted in
an online poll for who they actually wanted?**

Online polls don't count for elections.

The people who do vote (regardless of how small a minority they are)
will actually then choose the next president. The online poll is
useless.
