**Content:** [As [[Scott M.
Stolz](https://www.quora.com/profile/Scott-M-Stolz)]{.qlink_container}
indicated, New York and New Jersey had previously been a red-only state
for police and fire, green for volunteer medical personnel, and amber
for slow-moving vehicles or caution. The police at the time (mid 80\'s)
commissioned a study on visibility of lights at distance, and found
that, as indicated, blue lights are easier to see at greater distance at
night. The New York Chiefs of Police petitioned the State Assembly to
change the law regarding colors of lights because of safety. It took
them more than 20 years to take action on that, and are now just
starting to allow blue lights on police vehicles.]{.rendered_qtext}
