Ultimately, I think the Texas law has some challenges it will have to
overcome, but I support the rights of states to make rules that best
benefit the residents of that state. And I believe that abortion laws
are best left up to the individual states to decide.

Let me explain why I believe this.

I believe that *Griswold v. Connecticut* was wrongly decided: I do not
believe that there is a right to privacy in the Constitution. Since *Roe
v. Wade* was based largely on the findings in *Griswold*, I think it was
also wrongly decided.

Does this mean that we should restrict *all* abortions? Personally I
think we should, but honest people can disagree about this. Perhaps we
impose a limit, like viability. This is precisely what *Planned
Parenthood v. Casey* established.

Texas decided to impose a viability limit, and that limit was *fetal
heartbeat*. Texas becomes the **ninth state** to have a fetal heartbeat
law. They join Alabama, Georgia, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi,
Missouri, and Ohio, which also restrict abortion based on fetal
heartbeat.[\[1\]](#YulFw){#cite-YulFw .citation_link}

As far as the decisions around Constitutionality go, *Roe* is not the
governing case law any more. Actually, with respect to privacy, *Roe*
tried to balance the right to privacy with the state's ability to
restrict abortions. It's the subsequent decisions which tell us more
about how abortion can be restricted in the US.

The main governing case in the US is *Planned Parenthood v. Casey* from
1992, which said that restrictions on abortion are unconstitutional if
they place an "undue burden" on a woman seeking an abortion **before the
fetus is** ***viable***. The Court upheld what it called the "essential
holding" of *Roe*. The "essential holding" consists of three parts: (1)
Women have the right to choose to have an abortion prior to viability
and to do so without undue interference from the State; (2) the State
can restrict the abortion procedure post-viability, so long as the law
contains exceptions for pregnancies which endanger the woman\'s life or
health; and (3) the State has legitimate interests from the outset of
the pregnancy in protecting the health of the woman and the life of the
fetus that may become a child.

Texas, in its new law, has decided to declare *viability* at the point
where a fetal heartbeat can be detected. I think that if this law is to
be challenged, it will be to determine whether or not a fetus is viable
(i.e. can survive outside the womb) at the point at which a fetal
heartbeat can be detected. "Heartbeat" is a nebulous term, since there
really isn't a heart developed until somewhere between the sixth and
tenth weeks of pregnancy. Before the sixth week, there simply isn't a
heart yet.

The Texas law defines a "fetal heartbeat" as the point at which
ultrasound can detect what lawmakers describe as a heartbeat, which can
be as early as six weeks. However, while they can detect fluttering of
the tissue which will eventually become the heart, they actually aren't
detecting a "heartbeat," as there really isn't a heart moving fluids
yet.

So I think that this will be the first portion of the law to be
challenged: that there is actually a heartbeat, or is it just a
fluttering of heart muscle which will eventually become a heart.

The second portion of the law which will be challenged is whether or not
a fetus is viable at the point at which a "fetal heartbeat" is detected.
The Supreme Court's standard in *Casey* is that abortion can take place
prior to viability, so the Texas law will be challenged on whether or
not the fetus is actually viable at the point of "fetal heartbeat" at
about six weeks.

Original question:

Are there any Quorans who actively support the new Texas abortion law?

\

*This is a contentious and emotionally-charged topic. I have taken the
(unusual for me) step of leaving comments open.*

*Some people like to comment. Some people like to engage with me in a
civil manner. But do not misunderstand, I take this step very
cautiously, and I have no tolerance for harassing or inane behavior.*

*If you don\'t like what I wrote, tough shit. If my answer is
grammatically low-quality or is un-cited opinion masquerading as fact,
downvote it. If you think I\'m wrong, write your own answer. But Quora
is a question-and-answer site, not a debate site. If you are simply
commenting to tell me \"ackshually, you\'re wrong,\" don\'t be surprised
if I quietly delete your comment. Put anything vaguely harassing in
there, and your deletion will be followed by a block/mute, and a BNBR
report. I will do this immediately and with no compunction. You have
been warned. Be nice.*
