**Content:** [Yes, you will have to root your phone and apply one of the
hacks that enables the call recording functions. If you are not
comfortable doing this, don\'t. I don\'t want you to damage your phone.
But if you are comfortable rooting your phone and applying changes that
require root, that is how you enable call recording.\
\
I need to say this again: the only way to enable call recording is to
root your phone and install additional software that uses the root
functionality of your phone to bypass certain protections put in place
by your carrier\'s software. If you are not comfortable doing this, I
would try to find another way. Perhaps you can use your speakerphone
whilst sitting at your computer, and you could use your computer\'s mic
to record the call.\
\
If you want to set your mobile up for call recording, look for Xposed
Additions in the Google Play store. This requires the Xposed Framework,
which is not available in the Play Store; you must download it directly
from xda-developers online. Search Google for Xposed Framework. Before
you can use Xposed, your phone has to be rooted.\
\
Once you install Xposed Additions, you can enable call recording, along
with many other great tweaks.]{.rendered_qtext}
