*(US Answer Only. Outside of the US, your mileage may vary)*

Only if it is contract employment and you both signed the contract, and
there is no unique termination procedure in the contract.

If it is at-will employment, **your employer can fire you at any time
for any reason, and you can quit at any time for any reason** (except
for legally protected reasons).

So if you accepted the position, you agreed on all the details, *and you
even showed up for the first day of work,* the employer could say, "Oh
we're so sorry, but we're not going to fill this position any longer,
we're going to take this business unit in a different direction. But
please keep an eye on our job board, as we'll be creating new positions
in the near future, and if you made it this far in the employment
process, you'll be a shoo-in for the new position," and that would be
perfectly legal.

That said, you could make a case that you bought a bunch of stuff on the
expectations of the accepted job, considering you may have had to buy a
new wardrobe, or a new computer or something. You may request that the
employer reimburse you for those, and if they do not, you may have to
sue them in small claims court to get your money back. You likely won't
get all of it back, but if you had to foot a significant outlay to get
yourself started in this position, you may be able to recoup some of it.
