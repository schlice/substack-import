*(Note that this question is asking for an opinion. It's likely that
your opinion is different. This is mine. You are free to write your own
opinion. Thank you.)*

You should never be *required* to wear a mask. Masking should be your
*choice*. Period. Whatever your reasons, whether you want to protect
yourself or others, you should be able to choose whether or not you wear
a mask.

The government should never require you to wear a mask.

That said, can a *business* still force customers to wear masks? Yes, of
course they can. Businesses can set whatever requirements they like for
their businesses. If you can't wear a mask because of a disability, they
must provide some form of accommodation, like contactless ordering or
pickup, or they could be in violation of the ADA. But they can still
force you to wear a mask in their establishment.

Original question:

If you're vaccinated, should you still be required to wear a mask?

*Sorry, no comments on this one.*

*If you don't like what I wrote, tough shit. If my answer is
grammatically low-quality or is un-cited opinion masquerading as fact,
downvote it. If you think I'm wrong, write your own answer. But Quora is
a question-and-answer site, not a debate site. If you were simply going
to comment to tell me "ackshually, you're wrong," then youre the reason
why I disable comments. Well done, Karen. You ruined it for everyone.*
