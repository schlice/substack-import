There are plenty of things unique about Christianity. Let me give you
just a few.

- In every other world religion, you earn your way into
  heaven/salvation/the afterlife. You have to live a certain way in
  order to get your reward. And you never know if you're "good enough"
  to make it. In Christianity, you can do nothing to earn your
  salvation; it is a gift to you. All you have to do is accept it. This
  creates a changed life and your right living follows your salvation.
  We could never be good enough to be saved. We couldn't earn it, we
  don't deserve it. But He saves us anyway.
- Only in Christianity did God sacrifice Himself to save us. He took on
  flesh and died on a criminal's cross to redeem us. This concept of
  God's grace and His sacrifice is central to Christianity and is only
  found there. In every other religion, you seek God. In Christianity,
  God seeks *you*.
- Christianity offers an open door to salvation, anyone can choose to be
  saved, and Christ can meet you where you are whatever your language or
  cultural background. You are not saved by works, you are saved by
  faith. A saved person does good works *because* of his salvation, not
  *in order to gain* it.
- In Christianity, God meets us where we are. He saves us while we are
  still sinners. We don't have to become perfect in order to be saved.

Ultimately, no one can tell you why you should live your life a certain
way. To me, however, the Christian worldview fits the evidence we have
better than any other worldview.
