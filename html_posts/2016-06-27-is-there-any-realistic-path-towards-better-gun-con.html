Of course there is!

The answer is **propose better laws.**

And oh by the way, the laws have **nothing to do with guns**.

If all you want to do is limit the guns that law-abiding citizens can
buy, yeah you're pretty much not going to get anywhere.

But if you were to, perchance, start to focus on the ***real*** issues
instead of incessantly focusing on the tool, you'd be much better off.

If you could magically eliminate all guns right now, people will still
kill other people. If you had magically eliminated all guns before
Orlando, you'd have a mass ***bombing*** instead of a mass
***shooting***. The tool is not relevant. The issue is the **criminal**.

Start proposing some ideas around how to better handle **criminal
insanity**, and you might have a better chance at reaching consensus.

But pulling stupid stunts like sit-ins in Congress (which actually make
you look childish and *hurt* your candidate's chance at getting elected)
accomplishes less than nothing.
