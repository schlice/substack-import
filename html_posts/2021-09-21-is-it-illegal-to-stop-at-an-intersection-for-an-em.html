Not only is it not illegal, it is *required*.

- If an emergency vehicle is approaching you from *behind*, safely pull
  over to the side of the road and allow them to pass.
- If an emergency vehicle is approaching you on the *other side of the
  road* (i.e. coming towards you on a two-way road). also pull over on
  your side, **unless it is a divided highway** (i.e. a road with a
  median in it), then you don't have to stop.
- And of course, if you approach an intersection and you hear an
  emergency vehicle coming, **STOP**. Wait for the vehicle to pass, and
  then you may proceed.

There isn't a set of vehicle and traffic laws in this country that I am
aware of that is not written like this. They must be uniform across the
country to enable safe passage of emergency vehicles.
