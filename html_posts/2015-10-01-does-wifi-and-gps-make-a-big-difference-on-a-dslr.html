**Content:** [Wi-Fi allows you to upload your pictures to a cloud
picture hosting provider real-time, effectively giving you unlimited
storage capacity while you\'re connected to a Wi-Fi access point.\
\
GPS allows you to \"geotag\" your pictures, which will place the
latitude and longitude of your current position in the metadata of the
picture. Your cell phone already does this. It allows for intelligent
photo software to organize your photos based on the location the photo
was taken.]{.rendered_qtext}
