<h2>Answer Comment</h2>

**Content:** [You contradicted yourself. You can call it semantics, but
you said \"**Guns kill people**\" and then you said \"They are built,
designed, \[\...\] distributed, and employed **to give one the means to
take the life of another**\" (emphasis mine). This is a very important
distinction, because on one hand you said that \"the gun killed
someone\" and on the other hand you said \"someone used a gun to kill
someone else\" which means \"someone killed someone else (with a gun)\".
That\'s more than just semantics; that\'s the difference between someone
killing someone and a gun killing someone.\
\
You are correct that a gun is purpose-built to kill, just as a car is
purpose-built to drive. While cars and knives can cause death, they are
not purpose-built to kill. This is the reason that guns are so often
targeted: because they are purpose-built to kill. However, **homicide**
is a crime in which one **person** takes the life of another **person**
using a tool. Guns, of their own volition, do not take the life of
another person. A gun cannot commit homicide. A gun can be used by
someone to commit the crime of homicide, but a gun, by itself, cannot
kill. Despite what you might hear in the media, guns do not mysteriously
\"go off\" without someone pulling the trigger. There are numerous
internal safeties within a gun to prevent such an occurrence. The
trigger has to actually be pulled in order for the gun to fire (with the
notable exception of some automatic weapons with free-floating firing
pins, but that\'s outside the scope of the question).\
\
Therefore, a gun cannot kill, just like \"pencils do not misspell words
and forks do not make people fat\" (thanks [[Chris

It\'s people that do all these things, not the implements they use to do
them.]{.rendered_qtext}
