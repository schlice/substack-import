Yes. Don't rent in a neighborhood controlled by an HOA.

I wish I could give you some snazzy workaround, but there is none.
You're either going to pay the HOA dues separately, or it will be rolled
into your rent. One way or another, you're going to pay HOA dues.

And why wouldn't you? You're enjoying (or have access to) the same
amenities as the permanent residents, even if you never use them. You're
covered by the same insurance in the common areas. Everyone is covered;
everyone pays.
