While Jesus never said the exact words, "I am God," he made the claim
that he was God in many different ways.

For example, in John 10:30, he said, "I and the Father are one." The
people who heard him knew that he was saying that he was God, and you
can tell by their reaction: they picked up rocks to stone him (v31).
When he asked them why they were picking up rocks, they said, "For
blasphemy, because you, a mere man, claim to be God" (v33). Stoning was
the punishment for blasphemy in that time, and the Jews were picking up
stones because they believed Jesus had just committed blasphemy by
claiming that he was God.

Literally, the same thing happened again, when Jesus said, "Very truly I
tell you, ... before Abraham was born, I am!" (John 8:58) In this
statement, not only was he claiming to be God, but claiming to be Yahweh
by name, the "great I AM." Once again, they attempted to stone him for
blasphemy, so everyone at that time knew exactly what he was saying.

There are many other examples throughout the Bible where Jesus shows,
through word and deed, that "he and the Father are one." While he never
actually said "I am God," he didn't have to.

Original question:

Jesus never said He was God to me. Not in the Bible, so why do we
worship and call Him God?
