Anyone can take legal action against you for any reason. The question is
whether or not they have any standing, or whether or not they have a
case.

Generally, the rule in the United States is **if you can see it, you can
shoot it**. In general, if you are in a public place, you can record
video and post it online.

There are some places in which video recording is prohibited; usually
these places are clearly marked as such. Some government buildings
cannot be videoed inside them.

Also, be aware that there is a difference between a "public place" like
a sidewalk and a "private facility which is open to the public" like a
restaurant. If you are truly in a public place, like a sidewalk, or a
park, or a common area, you're good to go. If you are in a private
facility which is open to the public, like a restaurant or a store, you
may have to defer to the wishes of the facility management.

Note that some public places (like public bathrooms) have an established
*expectation of privacy*, so you cannot video there. Also, if you are in
a public place, and you are videoing things that are occurring in a
private place (or where there is a reasonable expectation of privacy),
you also cannot post that video. For example, if you are videoing
through the slats of a fence, or if you are standing on the sidewalk
videoing into the window of a house. Note that state laws differ on
whether or not this constitutes an invasion of privacy. Some states say
you cannot video anything inside the house, others say that the
occupants must take reasonable steps to ensure that there is an
expectation of privacy (i.e. closing blinds).

You also cannot *slander* someone; that is, paint them in a negative
light. For example, if I was fake-punching the President and you snapped
a picture of it and subtitled the picture, "the moment before Bill
punched the first black President of the United States" and this caused
me to lose my job because of the negative publicity, I could sue you for
slander (well, I'd actually sue for libel as the libelous content was
printed).

You also cannot use the likeness of someone else for **profit** without
their expressed permission. There is an exception for media and
education (and the photographer can be compensated as well), but
shooting a movie which will be sold constitutes making a profit, and
everyone depicted in that movie must sign waivers or be compensated for
the use of their image.

So there are some restrictions, but beyond those, if you're out in
public, the general rule of **if you can see it, you can shoot it**
applies.
