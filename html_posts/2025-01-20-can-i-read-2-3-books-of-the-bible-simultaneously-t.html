There is no "right way" to read the Bible.

- You can read the Bible cover to cover.
- You can read two or three books at a time.
- You can read one book at a time.
- You can even read one ***verse*** at a time.

The important part is that ***you're getting into the Word daily!***

So long as you are daily getting in to the Word, and praying through
your reading, you are doing WAY better than many people who call
themselves Christian.

If you like, [[the Bible
app](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=89cdcd&url=https://www.bible.com/){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="bible.com"}]{.qlink_container} has a "Verse of the Day" you
can use to get into a single verse a day, and to pray through it. It
helps to develop the habit of getting in to the Word every single day.

Get after it, every day!
