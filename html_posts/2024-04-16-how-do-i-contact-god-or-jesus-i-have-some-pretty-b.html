It sounds like you're hurting. It sounds like you've been hurt, and it
sounds like you believe that God abandoned you.

First of all, **we hear you**. We don't know what your pain is, but we
can appreciate the fact that you have it, and it's very personal to you.
We get it, and you might be surprised to hear that we all grieve with
you.

Next, let's address the elephant in the room: why didn't God help you?
It doesn't make sense, right? If this so-called God is so omnipotent and
omnipresent, why doesn't He stop bad things from happening? It seems all
so pointless.

First of all, it's the existence of the question which proves the
existence of God (i.e. in order to know that something is bad, you must
have some knowledge of what is good), but we'll put that answer aside
for now.

For now, let's just phrase your ultimate question in another way: **why
do bad things happen to good people?**

First of all, **if you believe that somehow God is obligated to explain
Himself to us, you ought to do a better job reading the Bible**.
Proverbs 25:2 says, "It is the glory of God to conceal a matter." Isaiah
45:15 says, "Truly You are a God who hides Himself." First Corinthians
2:11 says, "No one knows the thoughts of God except the Spirit of God."
Deuteronomy 29:29 says, "The secret things belong to the Lord our God"
(NKJV). Ecclesiastes 11:5 says, "As you do not know the path of the
wind, or how the body is formed in a mother's womb, so you cannot
understand the work of God, the Maker of all things." Isaiah 55:8--9
says, "'For My thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways My
ways,' declares the Lord. 'As the heavens are higher than the earth, so
are My ways higher than your ways, and My thoughts higher than your
thoughts.'"

It appears as if the Bible is telling us we don't have the capacity to
understand God's infinite mind or the plans He has for us. It's
*arrogance* for us to believe we have the ability to understand the mind
of God. It's like you standing over a pregnant mother's womb and trying
to explain what life is like on the other side, in such a way that the
baby in the womb would understand. That baby simply doesn't yet possess
the capacity to understand. Paul told the believers in Corinth, "Now we
see but a poor reflection; then we shall see face to face. Now, I know
in part; then I shall know fully, even as I am fully known" (1 Cor.
13:12). Paul was basically saying that we may not ever gain full
understanding while we are alive on earth, and we probably need to learn
to accept that.

We simply don't know what God's plans are right now, and we may never
know until we're standing face to face with Him and can ask. God doesn't
often reveal His plans to us, so we must continue to live in this state
of less-than-complete understanding, but knowing that God will keep His
promises in the end.

Secondly, **no one ever said that being a Christian would mean a
problem-free life**. If you've ever looked into any of the lives of the
great men and women of the Bible, their lives were not the most
glamorous. Look at Joseph. His brothers and sisters hated him so much,
they sold him into slavery. When in Egypt, he was thrown in prison,
falsely accused of rape, and threatened with execution. During the
entire ordeal, there is no indication in the Bible that God explained
His plan to Joseph. He was simply expected to live out his life in
less-than-complete understanding, as you and I are. *What pleased God
was Joseph's faithfulness when nothing else made sense*. Stephen was
stoned because he proclaimed God's name. James was put to death with a
sword for his faithfulness. Paul was persecuted, stoned, flogged, and
beheaded in a Roman prison. During their lifetimes, they never knew
God's great plan for them. Jesus said that life wouldn't be easy. He
said, "I have told you these things, so that in me you may have peace.
In this world, you will have trouble. But take heart! I have overcome
the world" (John 16:33).

Throughout the Bible, it tells us not only that bad times can happen,
but that we should ***expect*** bad times to come because they will. Yet
somehow, we still expect God to take away all of our problems,
spearheading our walk through life with his massive cosmic leaf-blower,
clearing our path of any trials, hardships, or pain. This causes a great
deal of anxiety, even among long-time faithful, **because life is
hard.**

The Bible tells us to not worry so much about trying to understand or
make all the pieces fit together. "Trust in the Lord, lean not on your
own understanding" (Prov. 3:5). We are not told to not try to
understand, just don't "lean on" your understanding, which means don't
make it an ultimatum. Leaning is that pesky desire for answers---or
else! "God, you'd better explain yourself, or I'm outta here!" Or as you
put it, "I have some pretty bad question for them, I also hate them deep
down my heart, I hate them at the point I would refuse go heaven if it
means they\'re there, they left me for die." That would be "leaning" on
your own understanding, and we are admonished against that.

So what does this all mean? Basically, expect trouble in life, and
expect that there will be situations we do not understand. **Faith is
the point at which logic stops making sense**. We must have faith that
God will keep His promises, and that everything we go through in this
life has a purpose, even though our minds do not have the capacity to
understand it.
