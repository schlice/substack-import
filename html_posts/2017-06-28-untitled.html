This is actually in the CBO scores. You do have to go read the scores
yourself; you can't rely on anyone (especially news agencies which have
agendas) to give you the full picture. And in re-checking my figures,
it's 15 million, not 16. (Math --- not my strong suit).

And what those CBO numbers tell you is that repealing the tax on the
uninsured would next year induce 7 million people to cancel their
individual insurance policies, 4 million to drop their job-based
coverage, and 4 million others to dump Medicaid, **even though the
government provides it free of charge** in most cases. If the CBO is
right (and that's fairly questionable anyway), then 15 million people
would immediately take advantage of a provision of the new law which
would no longer require them to purchase a product they don't want and
don't feel they need.

As for the tax numbers, last January the IRS commissioner reported to
Congress on the number of uninsured people who paid the tax, got a
waiver, or simply refused to indicate whether or not they had insurance.
Those specific numbers for you:

- 6.2 million uninsured people paid the tax on the uninsured
- 12.7 million uninsured people got waivers
- 4.3 million people simply didn't check the box indicating whether or
  not they had insurance. Incidentally, the IRS did not penalize these
  people for failing to disclose whether or not they had insurance.

That's 23.2 million Americans who paid the tax, avoided the tax with a
waiver, or simply ignored the law.

So as I read this, this law will instantly make 38.2 million people
happy, and it's rare that Congress can pass a single law which would do
that.

Do you remember when they had debtor's prison in England? That was a
stupid idea, wasn't it? Put people in jail when they can't pay their
debts. You're guaranteed to not be able to pay your debts in prison.

The Obamacare mandate was debtor's prison for the poor. You can't afford
health insurance because we've forced so many provisions into it that
we've made it quite unaffordable. Can't afford it? We'll increase your
taxes instead!

What I'm trying to say is that Obamacare was lose-lose for the poor. The
only way they could afford these expensive plans was subsidies, paid for
by the government, because you forced everyone else to buy insurance.
But that didn't work because the economies of scale failed. Forcing
people to buy a product they don't want is a losing proposition.

The only way to fix that is to make less expensive plans. And the only
way to do that is to repeal Obamacare's mandates for what must be in an
insurance plan, allowing insurers to offer cheaper plans, which was the
goal in the first place, right?
