**If during a traffic stop the driver does not give consent to search
the vehicle, how long can you legally detain the driver to allow a K9 to
arrive?**

First of all, if the police already have probable cause to search the
vehicle, they don't need your permission. In such a case, you can say as
many times as you want that you don't consent to a search, but it
doesn't matter. The issue (which you are highlighting by saying that
you'll have to wait for a K9) is when they don't have probable cause.

The Supreme Court ruled in *Rodriguez v. United States* that the police
cannot hold a driver "beyond the time reasonably required to address the
traffic violation." In other words, the police cannot unnecessarily
delay the stop to wait for a K9 to sniff the vehicle.

Also, delaying actually issuing the citation doesn't count as
"reasonable" in whether or not an officer "reasonably" addressed the
violation. It pertains to the amount of time the police should
reasonably take in order to complete all of the required functions in
the traffic stop itself.

This doesn't mean the department cannot use K9s to sniff the outside of
a vehicle. It simply means that they can't prolong the traffic stop to
wait for one to show up. If the officer has completed all of his
requirements for the traffic stop, he must let you go, or there's a good
chance that the delay is in violation of *Rodriguez*. Butt they
certainly can have a dog sniffing the car while another officer is at
the window writing you a ticket.

So what do you do? *Always comply with the officer on the scene, even if
he is violating your rights.* We've said this a bzillion times on Quora
(yes, that's a real number, it was in *Toy Story*), but I'll say it
again: **you will never win an argument at the side of the road**.
Period, full stop. If you want to argue the Constitutionality of a
police action, you do it with your lawyer later on. You don't do it at
the side of the road. Comply with the police. And yes, if they arrest
you, comply with your arresting officer. ***THEN*** tell your lawyer all
about what happened, and let him fight it. Yes, it sucks, but it will
suck way worse if you fight a cop, because all you're doing is adding
charges. You also don't need to say, "you're violating my rights" in
order for a violation of rights to be challenged later on. And in some
cases, drivers who frequently point out to the arresting officer that
their rights are being violated may appear to that officer as
uncooperative, so in some cases, it's best to just keep your mouth shut
and focus on remembering what happened.

You may *know* that the police are in violation of *Rodriguez*, but save
your outrage for the courtroom.

What you can do is to remember as many details as you can, or write them
down if you have an opportunity.
