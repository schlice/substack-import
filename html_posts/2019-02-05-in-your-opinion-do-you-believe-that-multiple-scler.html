**In your opinion, do you believe that Multiple Sclerosis is an
inflammatory or mainly neurodegenerative disease?**

It is both, but at different times.

Initially, it is an inflammatory response which causes the actual
symptoms of the disease. In relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS), it is the T
cell binding to myelin and the actual myelin destruction in itself,
which creates an inflammatory response. This inflammation produces the
symptoms of the disease during a relapse.

During later disease courses such as secondary-progressive MS (SPMS), it
is thought that the "neural load" of reserve neurons has been exhausted,
and as nerve damage occurs, replacement nerve cells cannot be inserted.
It is thought that this is actually a neurodegenerative response which
causes the symptoms in this disease course.
