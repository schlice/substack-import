**To keep my smartphone or computer running fast and with the best
security, should I always install the latest upgrade?**

Upgrades don't always slow down your phone, nor do they necessarily
speed it up. Besides, you upgrade your other apps, and they are
regularly upgraded to perform *best* on the newest released code
versions for your platform. That doesn't mean they won't work at all;
most apps are to a certain degree backwards-compatible with previous
(but still supported) code versions on your platform. But they will
perform *best* on the newest code versions.

And as [[Dave

suggested, you don't have to do anything to keep your phone up-to-date.
Just make sure that your phone is always available for automatic
updates. On iPhone, that means plugged in and on Wi-Fi during convenient
non-busy hours (like overnight) so that updates can automatically
download and install while you're sleeping. On Android, it's whenever
you've chosen to set upgrades (which, by default, is in the middle of
the night.

As for "best security," yes, you should always have the latest code
versions installed on your phone or computer. Manufacturers are
constantly "plugging holes" that they find, and as new vulnerabilities
are discovered, patches are released fixing those vulnerabilities.
