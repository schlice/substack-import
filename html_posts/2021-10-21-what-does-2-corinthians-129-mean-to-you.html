The best way to answer this is *in context.*

Let's read 2 Cor 12 7--10:

> Therefore, in order to keep me from becoming conceited, I was given a
> thorn in my flesh, a messenger of Satan, to torment me. Three times I
> pleaded with the Lord to take it away from me. But he said to me, "My
> grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in
> weakness." Therefore I will boast all the more gladly about my
> weaknesses, so that Christ's power may rest on me. That is why, for
> Christ's sake, I delight in weaknesses, in insults, in hardships, in
> persecutions, in difficulties. For when I am weak, then I am strong.
> --- 2 Cor 7--10 NIV

One way of looking at this reveals that *my* strength, *my* power, must
take a back-seat so that *God's* power can shine through. Another
interpretation is more broadly targeted at the whole passage. And it is
summed up in God's statement to Paul in the first part of verse 9:

**My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in
weakness.**

What exactly does that mean?

As Christians, we should be content with God's grace, even when we go
through the trials of our life. God brings us difficulty so that we
don't think that we are too powerful or too capable. We remember that
God is from whom our power flows, it is not our own hands by which we do
these great things. In this way, God receives the glory from the work of
our hands, not us.

Our weaknesses (or our diseases) don't need to be taken away in order
for us to showcase God's glory. Our weaknesses don't need to be taken
away for us to be happy. We are happy knowing we have God's grace and
salvation, and he can accomplish so much more through us, in spite of
our weaknesses.

It is God's power which allows us to say "I can do all things through
him who gives me strength" (Phil 4:13).
