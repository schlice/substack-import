**Can you be held responsible for laws and ethics that you knew nothing
about and were instructed by your employer to violate?**

Yes. Ignorance of the law is not an excuse. Also, "I was just following
orders" is not an excuse.

Your employer cannot instruct you to violate law.

When your employer instructs you to violate law, you may refuse. If your
employer fires you for failing to follow instructions, they can be sued.

I would quit and run, fast, from that employer. I think revealing to
another employer why you left would be justification enough for why you
quit.
