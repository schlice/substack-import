**Trump seems to be winning on every front. Is that fair?**

You answered your own question, because you said that Trump ***seems***
to be winning on every front.

Therefore, whether or not Trump is *actually* winning is very dependent
on the glasses through which you view Trump's actions, and those glasses
are colored by your political viewpoint.

If you're a liberal or a Democrat, you'll clearly see everything that
Trump does, with few exceptions, to be childish buffoonery, and with
each passing day, you'll see the country falling further and further
backwards in social progress. You'll declare "NOT MY PRESIDENT" because
he didn't win fairly, because Russia helped him win, and you'll see that
the whole Stormy Daniels thing is *totally and completely unrelated in
any way to Bill Clinton and Monica Lewinsky.* You'll see that Hillary
and Bimbo Eruptions is *totally and completely unrelated in any way to
Michael Cohen and his payouts.* And you'll continue to wait for the day
when Robert Mueller comes forward with that all-convincing proof that
Trump colluded with Russia to steal the election from Hillary, because
everyone knows it's true.

In the meantime, while liberals can only see Stormy Daniels and Robert
Mueller through their glasses, if you're a conservative or a Republican,
you'll see far more "wins" than Democrats see. You'll see the tax cuts
putting money back in your pocket and jobs back into society. You'll see
that his tough talk on Twitter and elsewhere, along with a no-compromise
attitude, actually convinced a murderous little tyrant to come to the
table and discuss peace. You'll see that he has no qualms using the very
same tactics that Obama used to undo some of the terrible decisions that
Obama made, and will do so unapologetically. You'll see far more
#fakenews in daily life than a liberal would ever admit to. And you'll
be proud that Trump is putting our nation back on to a path to being one
of the greatest nations in the world, again, unapologetically.

So whether or not you see Trump as a laughing stock or as a success will
depend largely on which glasses you wear.
