The United States foreign policy is not based on *forcing* other
countries to agree with our way of life. Our foreign policy is based on
*convincing* other countries that it is in their best interest to do
things that more closely coincide with our way of life. The easiest way
to do that is to stop trading with them. We are the world\'s superpower.
We are not, however, as you say, the \"humanitarian and global police
force.\" We get no money from the world to be their police, so whatever
military action we take has to be in *our* best interest, not just
*theirs*.

And we have *never* invaded a country without either a) provocation, or
b) a direct and grave threat to national security, or both. If they are
not a direct threat **to us**, we do not \"invade\" anywhere. They may
be a threat to their own people, but that, to be fair, is not actually
our concern. As I already mentioned, we are not the world\'s police
force. Unless we are asked, we don\'t just drop in and impose our values
on a country. If a sovereign nation requested assistance, we would
provide it. If US interests were at risk, we would protect them.
Otherwise, we don\'t just invade other countries. We have neither the
time, the inclination, or the money to be the world\'s morality police.

(EDIT) Let me qualify the \"we never invade\" statement. In the
discussion around foreign policy, we do not invade other countries. In
practice, what some administrations have done in furtherance of their
particular interpretation of that foreign policy objective have held
slightly less closely to the original meaning of \"we never invade.\"
For instance, the Clinton administration felt that \"humanitarian aid\"
was not \"invasion\" no matter how it looked. And we could provide
\"humanitarian assistance\" whether it was requested by the host country
or not. I do not necessarily agree with those interpretations of foreign
policy. But as a military officer, I deploy where the boss says to
deploy, regardless of how I personally interpret US foreign policy
objectives.
