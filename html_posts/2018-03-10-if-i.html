**If I\'m getting pulled over, but the road is very poorly lit and the
next well-lit area is five miles away, would it be legal to pull over
five miles down the road?**

The short, uninformed, simple answer is no, it is not legal.

This simply means that in most jurisdictions (there may be some out
there that have been modifed), there is no law which allows you to
determine that the area in which you are being stopped is unsafe, so you
can proceed to an area you think is safer.

Legally-speaking, any time you attempt something like this, you risk
being charged with failure to stop, since like we mentioned, the law
doesn't allow for your choice.

But reality is ever-changing, and the law doesn't always keep up with
it.

If you feel so strongly that you cannot stop because you believe it is
unsafe, your best bet would be:

- Slow down, move over towards the shoulder, turn on your hazard
  flashers.
- Immediately call 911 and inform the dispatcher of the situation

If you can't do both of these things together, I would suggest stopping
but telling the officer of your concern as soon as he makes it to the
window. Telling him something like, "I think it would be safer for both
of us if we proceed down the road to the next well-lit area" is an idea.
Remember that legally it's up to the officer where you stop, not you, so
he may refuse your request, and you'll have no choice but to be
uncomfortable with his choice of stopping location. You can always feel
free to report him to his supervisor if you believe his conduct was
incorrect at best, or violated department policy at worst.

Again, you must understand that there is no law which allows you to do
this, but common sense (and current events) necessitate a deviation from
what is written in the law. *Even if you're right*, you can still be
charged with failing to stop. If you have a good lawyer, you may be able
to get that charge dropped for those reasons, if it's well-argued and
you did everything else you were told to do.
