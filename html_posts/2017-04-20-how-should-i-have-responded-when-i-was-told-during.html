Tell them that you will give them your salary history when they give you
the salary histories of all the people who previously held that
position.

Don't worry, they will never do that. It's confidential information. But
so is your salary history. That's personal financial information. It's
not a "perfectly reasonable" question to ask someone in a job interview.
It's a "highly personal" question to ask someone, and it's exceedingly
impolite to ask someone you just met about highly personal things.

If you were selling your car, and someone asked you, "What other offers
have you gotten on your car, and what were you offered?" you'd probably
tell them to get lost, right? That information is *your bargaining
chip.* You're the one offering your services. The company is not in the
position of power just because they have a job opening. You are on equal
footing with the company. They have a job, you have the talent. They
need you just as much as you need them, or they wouldn't be bothering to
interview you! You must maintain that mindset.

To be fair, the more important issue is that **if a recruiter can't
figure out how much you are worth without knowing what someone else paid
you, they're a really bad recruiter.**

Once someone has your salary history, you lose all of your negotiating
leverage. Some employers have a policy that they won't pay you more than
10% more than what you were previously making, because they feel that a
10% pay bump is sufficient when moving from one company to another. If
they simply refuse to move you forward in the hiring process until you
provide that information, *leave*. There is clearly too much distrust
and improper employment practices (or apparently in New York, *illegal*
hiring practice) to be worth your efforts. Move on. Understand your
worth, and know when it is not being respected.

face the fear of telling a recruiter that your salary history is
personal financial information. She poses a possible script to use:

> INTERVIEWER: What were you earning at your last job, Derek?
>
> YOU: In this job search, I\'m focusing on jobs in the \$50K range. Is
> that in the ballpark for this position?
>
> INTERVIEWER: I think it is. I think that could work, but I\'m not the
> manager, of course. I have to ask you what you earned at your last
> job.
>
> YOU: I completely understand. I know you have questions you\'re
> supposed to ask candidates. I think that the \$50K salary target I
> mentioned is the right number to write down on your form, because
> that\'s what I require in order to come and work here.
>
> INTERVIEWER: Okay, but I\'m supposed to find out what you earned at
> your last job, specifically.
>
> YOU: My accountant would kill me if I shared my personal financial
> information \-- you can understand. Luckily if the job pays around
> fifty thousand it makes sense for us to keep talking.
>
> INTERVIEWER: Okay, I\'ll write that down.[\[1\]](#mhqhZ){#cite-mhqhZ
