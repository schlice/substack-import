There is none. Sex is not necessary to make a marriage. You can still be
married without sex.

But sex is designed to take place only *within* a marriage.

There was a period of time that Paul dealt with in the early church in
Corinth when married couples were binding themselves to **asceticism**,
or sexual purity, within their marriages. They were doing this so that
they could be *more pure* and become *more acceptable* to God, so they
were keeping themselves from each other.

Paul advises them that this is dangerous. It's in his first letter to
the Corinthians (7:2--5):

> *Each man should have sexual relations with his own wife, and each
> woman with her own husband. The husband should fulfill his marital
> duty to his wife, and likewise the wife to her husband. The wife does
> not have authority over her own body but yields it to her husband.*
>
> *In the same way, the husband does not have authority over his own
> body but yields it to his wife. Do not deprive each other except
> perhaps by mutual consent and for a time, so that you may devote
> yourselves to prayer. Then come together again so that Satan will not
> tempt you because of your lack of self-control.*

That whole "authority over" thing tends to get very confused. The word
used is sort of *lazily* translated as "authority," but it is better
translated as "responsibility." In other words, the husband has the
responsibility for the needs of the wife, and the wife has the
responsibility for the needs of the husband.

And we already know that sex outside of marriage is a sin:

> Let marriage be held in honor among all, and let the marriage bed be
> undefiled, for God will judge the sexually immoral and adulterous. ---
> Hebrews 13:4
