**Content:** [Basically, you don\'t \"get away with it.\" Because
cannabis is still illegal under Federal law, you are SOL. If your
employer says you can\'t use it because they follow Federal law, you
can\'t use it, especially recreationally. If you are a medical user, you
have two options.\
\
1. Try to get a medical waiver from your employer. You will have to make
the case that medical cannabis is legal where you live and you have met
all of the state requirements for it. Your employer can still refuse to
exempt you if they choose it\'s too big of a legal risk for them to
take, but you won\'t know until you try. I have heard of medical
cannabis users getting waivers from their companies. It\'s a mixed bag:
employers are under no obligation to grant you a waiver.\
\
And if that fails, or your second option:\
\
2. Don\'t work for that provider. An employer can always claim that
cannabis is still illegal under Federal law and they can still refuse to
hire you, or they can fire you after you\'ve been hired, if you test
positive during random drug testing. Making the claim that it is legal
at a state level doesn\'t hold water because the drug is still illegal
at the Federal level.]{.rendered_qtext}
