**Is forcing people to wear masks against ADA?**

Let's see if we can bring all this together.

- Businesses are required under ADA to provide **reasonable**
  accommodations to those with disabilities.
  - Disabilities are well defined
- The inverse of that is that businesses are not required to do business
  with someone when **reasonable** accommodations cannot be met.

To that end, there are HHS guidelines around acceptable accommodations
for those who cannot wear masks; primarily, this is face shields. The
business is **not** required to provide those face shields. In other
words, if you can't wear a mask, it is your responsibility to provide a
face shield in its place.

**If you cannot wear either, there is no requirement that the business
allow you entrance.** The business does not have to alter its business
so drastically that it affects others. Allowing disabled patrons to
simply wear nothing is too great a risk to the business and to other
customers. Therefore, the business must provide some other accommodation
for those who cannot wear a mask: service at your car, home delivery,
curbside pick-up, etc.
