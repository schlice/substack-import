[[Michele Camera\'s
answer](https://www.quora.com/Is-multiple-sclerosis-a-major-cause-of-nystagmus/answer/Michele-Camera)]{.qlink_container}
is spot on. Nystagmus can be caused by a problem present at birth, or
developed in early childhood.

However, *acquired nystagmus* occurs later in life, and is caused as a
symptom of another condition, such as stroke, MS, or physical trauma.

MS is one of the causes of acquired nystagmus, but as Michele stated, I
think that "major" is likely an unsubstantiated adjective.
