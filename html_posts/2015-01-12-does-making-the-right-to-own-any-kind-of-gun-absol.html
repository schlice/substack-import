**Content:** [Your rights to free speech are not limited by someone
else\'s right to carry a weapon. Can you call the police and tell them,
\"he\'s violating my right to be free from intimidation\"? (HINT: nope).
There are laws protecting you against someone verbalizing a threat, but
someone\'s imposing presence is not illegal.\
\
You have no right to be free from intimidation. Anyone has the right to
intimidate you, either overtly or covertly. If you want to continue to
make that assertion, please provide some case law that shows that a
right to be free from intimidation exists in the Constitution. Because
there is certainly no text in the Constitution that enumerates such a
right.\
\
If you are intimidated by someone\'s presence, hire a bodyguard. Or
carry your own weapon. Or grow a spine. You have as much right to speak
as he has to carry a gun. Those two are not mutually exclusive. The
simple act of him carrying a gun does not change your rights.\
\
No one has the right to \"wave guns in the air.\" That\'s called
\"brandishing a weapon,\" and is illegal everywhere. There is a big
difference between someone \"waving a weapon in the air\" and someone
with a pistol on his belt. But those people are not arrested because
they \"violated your right to not be intimidated,\" but because they
\"brandished a weapon.\" Big, big difference.]{.rendered_qtext}
