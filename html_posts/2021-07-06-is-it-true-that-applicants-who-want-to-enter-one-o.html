Yes.

In addition to being accepted by the academy's Admissions Board, each
candidate must be *nominated*. Nominations come from members of
Congress, and the Vice President. This is done to give candidates from
around the country a fair shot, and to ensure that there is not one area
of the country which provides all the candidates.

Each member of Congress, and the VP, can have up to **five** active
cadets in each of the service academies, with the exception of the VP,
who cannot nominate for the Merchant Marine Academy. Nominating
authorities usually nominate more than one candidate for each available
academy slot they have, and then the academy determines which candidate
will be accepted. I have seen Congressional representatives nominate up
to ten candidates per slot.

To get a nomination, you talk to the Congressperson's office and apply
directly to them. They will have a window of time that they accept
applications, and they will usually convene a selection panel to present
the nominees to the Congressperson.

*(NOTE: This does not apply to the US Coast Guard Academy, which does
not require nominations)*

Original question:

Is it true that applicants who want to enter one of the United States
military academies need to have the support of a congressman? Can
someone explain to me how that works?
