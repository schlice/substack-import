**Content:** [So there are two questions here; let\'s answer them one at
a time.\
\
*1. If a military police officer witnesses a crime being committed by a
civilian, can he or she arrest that civilian?*\
The answer, as always, is \"it depends.\" If the military police officer
is on a military installation stateside, he can detain the civilian and
contact local authorities to come pick up the criminal. This is because
stateside, military installations are under \"concurrent jurisdiction;\"
the base is both a military installation and a part of a city or county.
If the military police officer is not on a military installation, he has
the same \"citizen\'s arrest\" powers that anyone has, except that he
may be armed under the provisions of the Law Enforcement Officer\'s
Safety Act (LEOSA).\
\
*2. If a member of the military commits a crime and there are no MPs
around, like deserting in a combat zone, can superior officers
detain/arrest them until there are MPs around?*\
Yes, though it\'s unlikely. Normally, a superior officer would order the
military member to report to the MPs, and he can be escorted to the MPs
by an NCO. He does have the authority to detain a deserter, but like I
said, it would be challenging in a war zone.\
\
If a military member commits a crime under the Geneva Convention or he
violates a local law, the superior officer can order the military member
be detained and transported to the MPs.]{.rendered_qtext}
