Nihilism is the belief that all values are baseless and that nothing can
be known or communicated. A true nihilist would believe in nothing, have
no loyalties, and no purpose.

Atheists have morals and values, and they are indeed purposeful. They
simply believe that their morals and values did not come from a god,
because atheists believe that gods do not exist.
