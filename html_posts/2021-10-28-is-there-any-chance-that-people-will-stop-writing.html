Nope.

Quora makes changes to its platform on a regular basis. Lately, it
appears that platform changes have been appearing weekly, sometimes
multiple times per week. There is no guarantee that the banner you
specified will remain on previous questions, and it's a simple macro I
programmed which pastes the original question at the bottom of my
answer, so it's only a combination keystroke to splat it at the bottom
of my answer.

It's simple, it's quick, it doesn't detract from the answer, and it
conclusively shows you the question I answered, even if the question is
changed, and even if Quora removes or changes its "original question"
banner.

Original question:

Is there any chance that people will stop writing, \"Original question:
blah...blah...blah...\"? For years Quora has posted when the original
question changed at the beginning of all previous answers.
