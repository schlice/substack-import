**What do you think of Nancy Pelosi posting this tweet after Donald
Trump announced that he is going to declare a national emergency:
"Another demonstration of his naked contempt for the rule of law."?**

She's on the right track, but barking up the wrong tree.

The President does have the legal authority to declare a national
emergency. She should know. It's her organization that *gave* him the
authority to do so. Congress wrote the National Emergencies Act in 1976,
giving the President the authority to declare a national emergency.
Congress even wrote 470 different provisions into Federal laws that the
President can invoke by declaring a national emergency.

Congress gave the President the authority, by law, to declare national
emergencies. **So she is 100% wrong when she declares that the President
is acting in contempt of the law.**

However, the President *may* be doing something else: he may be
**abusing his authority** under the National Emergencies Act in order to
bypass the provisions of the Constitution in Article I. ***This*** is
the tree up which she should be barking. She should be organizing her
compatriots in order to file Articles of Impeachment against the
President for abuse of power. They will rightly be able to claim that
the President is using the national emergency authority (which he
legally has) in order to bypass Article I of the Constitution and seek
funding for his border wall. This would be a valid cause for
impeachment. Russia collusion be damned, even if the courts find the
President's actions legal under the law, if the President is abusing the
national emergency power just to bypass Congress and get more funding
for the wall, this would be an act worthy of Articles of Impeachment.
