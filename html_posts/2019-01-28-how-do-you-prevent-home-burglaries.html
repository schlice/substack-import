**What do people use to deter burglars?**

Defense in depth.

There's an old story about two hunters in Africa accidentally stumbling
into a den of lions. As the lionesses started stirring to go collect
their newly-presented dinner, one of the hunters knelt down, took off
his backpack, and retrieved a pair of running shoes.

The other hunter said, "What are you doing? You can't outrun a *lion*!"

The first hunter replied, "I don't need to outrun a lion. I only need to
outrun you."

Home security is much the same. You don't have to make your home a
fortress against burglars. You just have to make it less attractive than
your neighbor's house.

So how do you do that? Defense in depth. Starting from the outside and
moving in:

- Lights. Burglars love dark areas where they can take their time to
  work on the outside of your house without being seen. LED light bulbs
  use very little electricity, and put them on a dusk-to-dawn timer and
  you'll never have to worry about the exterior of your house being dark
  again.
- Shrubs underneath windows. Shrubs should never obstruct windows, for
  the same reason as lights: burglars could break in without being
  easily seen. Clear those away.
- Have good locks on your doors.
- Get a dog. Burglars are less likely to break in to your house if they
  hear a dog barking.
- Get an alarm system. I recommend
