**What is the criminal statute of limitations against a New York State
police officer, for making a false arrest?**

The statute of limitations for false arrest claims under Section 1983 in
New York is three years. It is different in other states. This means
that a person must file his lawsuit within three years of the false
arrest or his claim will be ruled untimely and dismissed by the court.

To bring claims against state employees under state law requires filing
a **notice of claim** within 90 days of the incident. Civil rights
claims brought under state law against private citizens (e.g., a false
arrest claim against a store security guard) generally must be filed
within 1 year of the incident.[\[1\]](#liemk){#cite-liemk

To put this into context: because the state holds special privilege in
lawsuits against it, if you don't file a notice of claim within 90 days
of the incident, you can't file a lawsuit against the state, or a state
agent, even though the statute of limitations is three years.
