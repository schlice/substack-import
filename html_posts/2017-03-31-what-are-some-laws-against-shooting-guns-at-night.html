Most jurisdictions don't have "time of day" requirements for shooting,
unless you're referring to outdoor, unlit gun ranges, which probably
won't operate without daylight.

Most jurisdictions are governed by both noise ordinances, and location
ordinances.

For example, most jurisdictions have noise ordinances which bar nuisance
noise, usually between the hours of 11 PM and 7 AM local time.

Some jurisdictions (mostly cities) have rules about discharging firearms
within their city limits (i.e. you can't do it unless you're in a
location specifically designed for firing weapons, such as a gun range).
As an example, we have several gun ranges (both indoor and outdoor)
located within city limits. Even though you're inside city limits and
there are city ordinances which prohibit discharging firearms within
city limits, gun ranges are specifically exempted from that ordinance.

Even locations which have no specific restrictions against time of day
will often state that you must shoot in a way that does not endanger
people or property. Shooting at night arguably does both of those, as
proper shooting etiquette requires you to know what is downrange, as
well as what is behind your target. If you shoot at night, you may not
be able to effectively see downrange, so you may still run afoul of the
limited laws that many unincorporated county areas do have.

If you plan on going shooting, make sure you have looked up and
understand your local laws surrounding when and where you can shoot, and
how you are required to transport your weapons. It is entirely the
shooter's responsibility to understand all applicable laws when engaging
in shooting sports.
