**Can you legally be sued for slander (with the person winning the case)
if you said that in your personal opinion you believe they are guilty of
a crime but state that you have no evidence to support your beliefs?**

There are lots of answers here, but let's go over what (in the majority
of states) constitutes slander.

> untruth about another, which untruth will harm the reputation of the
> person defamed. Slander is a civil wrong (tort) and can be the basis
> for a lawsuit. Damages (payoff for worth) for slander may be limited

> Some statements, such as an untrue accusation of having committed a
> crime, having a loathsome disease or being unable to perform one\'s
> occupation, are treated as slander per se since the harm and malice
> are obvious and therefore usually result in general and even punitive
> damage recovery by the person harmed. Words spoken over the air on

Under normal circumstances, slander involves two things:

- The telling of an untruth
- The untruth causing harm to the reputation of the person defamed.

In general, damages for slander are limited to actual damages unless
there is malicious intent.

That said, there are a few special cases wherein *the harm and malice
are obvious,* such as:

- accusing someone of committing a crime
- accusing someone of having a loathsome disease
- accusing someone of being unable to perform their occupation

In these cases, the person harmed can recover general damages, as well
as punitive damages (money paid specifically to dissuade other people
from doing the same thing and to financially impact the person
committing the harm).

Stating that it is *your opinion* that someone committed a crime is not
slander, it is opinion. Clarifying that you have no proof that such a
crime was committed simply shows that you have a strange opinion, one
you hold even in the face of a lack of evidence, but it is an opinion
nonetheless. Stating you have no basis in fact and then making a
slanderous statement anyway can be construed as malice.

In your case, stating that it is your opinion that someone committed a
crime is an opinion. Opinions are not slander. Stating that you *know*
the person committed the crime even though there is no proof ***is***
slanderous, and your admittance that there is no proof is enough to show
malicious intent in your slander.

There is a fine line between opinion and fact.
