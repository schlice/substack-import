**Can you drive a vehicle home without insurance?**

In short, **no**. You cannot legally drive a car on public roads in the
United States without having an insurance policy.

If you have insurance, most insurance carriers will automatically extend
coverage to your new car temporarily until you can get the car added to
your policy. Some companies automatically cover any cars you own, some
give you a set number of days of temporary coverage to get the new car
added to your policy. I was able to use my carrier's mobile app to add
the new car to my policy while I was at the dealership and print out
insurance cards while I was there, which I provided to the dealer to let
me go home with my new car.

If you don't have insurance, you will have to sign up before you can
drive home. Most carriers can sign you up as a new customer right over
the phone. Remember GEICO's ad? "15 minutes can save you 15% or more on
car insurance." Getting an insurance policy is pretty quick, and you'll
be covered and can legally drive home.
