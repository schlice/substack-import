**Why do we feel shy about being naked? Is there an explanation for
that?**

Depends on who you ask.

Christians and Jews will tell you that it was the events in the Garden
of Eden which brought about our knowledge that we were naked.

> When the woman saw that the fruit of the tree was good for food and
> pleasing to the eye, and also desirable for gaining wisdom, she took
> some and ate it. She also gave some to her husband, who was with her,
> and he ate it. **Then the eyes of both of them were opened, and they
> realized they were naked;** so they sewed fig leaves together and made
> coverings for themselves.

> ---Genesis 3:6--7 (NIV)

Science and physiology tells us that around age three or four, we begin
to differentiate between what's private and what's public, and develop a
sense of modesty not long after that.[\[1\]](#kOLFk){#cite-kOLFk

Finally, as always, there are cultural influences. In the United States,
people feel that the body is very private, and nudity has been
sexualized. The influence of the culture plays a big part in how we feel
about certain behaviors.
