Congress gets to set the rules of conduct for their own members. And
they do have both conduct rules and an ethics committee.

But what did this particular congressman do that you believe "breaks
their oath" to "protect and uphold the Constitution?"

And anyone can "give a congressman a dishonorable discharge." We have
the power to do that. It's called **the voting booth**. If you don't
like how a congressman is acting, or what he is doing, you have the
power to remove him from office. The trick, of course, is convincing
enough of your fellow constituents that he also needs to not be
re-elected.
