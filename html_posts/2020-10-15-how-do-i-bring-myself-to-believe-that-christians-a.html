**Recognize that the problem is not for the Christian to resolve. The
problem is for** ***you*** **to resolve.**

Regardless of what the Christian does or does not believe, your lack of
respect for them is exactly that: **your** lack of respect. Nothing
*they* do is going to earn your respect, because (I presume) they would
have to change something fundamental about themselves before you would
respect them. Note that you didn't tell us what about Christians is
causing you to not respect them, so I am presuming that you believe
something fundamental about them is causing you to fail to respect them.

Asking someone else to change in order to *earn* your respect is
anathema to normal human interactions.

The sherpas who accompany hikers up Mt. Everest will often say something
similar to this: "If conditions on the mountain are not to your liking,
change your liking." In other words, it's not our responsibility to
change the Mountain to suit you. It's your responsibility to change your
liking to suit the Mountain.

Similarly, it's not the Christian's responsibility to change anything
about themselves to suit you. It's up to you to change your thinking so
you can properly interact with them.

If you can't, well, then I guess you'll never respect them, and that'll
be the end of it. And the Christian will go on about his or her merry
way, you know, *still being a Christian,* and you still won't respect
them. They probably won't lose a wink of sleep over it, either. They're
not trying to please you. They're similarly not trying to harm or anger
you either. But if you choose to dislike something about them, to the
point to which you lose respect for them, you must recognize that this
is your *choice*. No one is forcing you to believe this way. The
Christian certainly does not force you to believe that way. You do that
all on your own. You are in control of you. No one else makes you
believe as you do.

Recognize that the problem here is not within the Christian, but within
yourself. **You may not control how others act, but you can control how
you respond to how others act.**

To quote from that old dusty book of stories those wacky Christians call
"the Bible":

\"Why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother\'s eye and pay
no attention to the plank in your own eye?" --- Matthew 7:3

Original question:

**How do I bring myself to believe that Christians are respectable?
Don\'t give me some \"gOd Is ReAl\" crap, I don\'t believe in that. But
how can I learn to respect Christians?**
