I can't tell you why "all the Quora members" do anything. You would be
included in that group, so you would know. But since you don't, this
answer doesn't apply to "all the Quora members."

But I can tell you why I disable comments (when I do). I will disable
comments when:

- People are being offensive or disrespectful. Quora has (technically,
  on paper) a "Be Nice, Be Respectful" policy. It used to be enforced
  very strongly. These days, with the growth they have seen, less so.
- Commenters are not having a "discussion," they are having an
  "argument." If they are being heavily argumentative (and then throw in
  a little insulting), and I just don't want to deal with it, I'll
  disable comments.

When you're outside of the rules of Spaces, the answerer owns his or her
answer, and owns the whole comments section. You may not be aware of
this. They are under no obligation to keep any of your comments on their
answer. They are also not under any obligation to turn comments on at
all. They can allow comments up to a certain point, but if the comments
do not appreciably contribute to the answer, or even if they just don't
want their comments feed clogged up with comments, they turn them off.

On heavily contentious topics or heavily emotionally-charged topics
(i.e. abortion or gun control), I'll default to having comments off.
I'll add a disclaimer to the end of the answer which says, in part:
