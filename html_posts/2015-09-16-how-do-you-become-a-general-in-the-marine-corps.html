(By the way, becoming a general in the Marine Corps is similar to
becoming a general in any of the armed forces. The numbers may be
different, but the philosophy is the same.)

Hard work, long hours, hard work, some luck when it comes to
assignments, did I mention hard work?

To become a general, you first must be an officer in the Marine Corps.
This means you must first be commissioned into the Marine Corps. There
are several ways to get a Marine Corps officer commission:

- Graduate from any US Service Academy (Naval Academy usually)
- Cross-commission from one of the other service academies (I had
  several friends who cross-commissioned from my class into the Marine
  Corps)
- Officer Candidate School (OCS)
- Naval Reserve Officer Training Corps (NROTC)
- Enlisted Commissioning Program (ECP)
- Marine Enlisted Commission Education Program (MECEP)

Once you\'re a commissioned officer in the Marine Corps, you work your
way up through the ranks by doing your job to the best of your ability,
and then some. Once you\'ve done everything in your job that you\'re
supposed to do, then you look for the things to do in your job that will
make it work better, more efficiently.

There are some other things that we were taught by some generals about
how they got to where they were:

- Trust that the Service will take care of you, and do your given job as
  best as you can. Don\'t try to \"game\" the assignment system. The
  Service will take care of you and keep you on the best path, but the
  needs of the Service come first. In general though, Assignments won\'t
  set you up for failure.
- Do your PME (Professional Military Education) (yes, you still go to
  school even after you graduate from college) as soon as it is offered,
  as early as you can get it done. Try to go as a resident as often as
  you can rather than doing correspondence. Generally, and regardless of
  what you are told, people who go residency to PME are considered the
  top officers on the base, and your record reflecting PME in residence
  is better than PME by correspondence.
- Take the overseas billets when they are offered. Yes, they sometimes
  suck, but they always lead to goodness when you return.

Basically, take the opportunities that are given to you, push yourself,
and trust that the system will take care of you.

BAM, in 25 years, you\'re a general. Congratulations. It\'s that simple.
