This is a great question, thanks for asking!

First thing you should do right away is check to see that the IRS got
your tax return. You can visit [[Refunds \| Internal Revenue
Service](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=407dc3&url=http://irs.gov/refunds){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="irs.gov"}]{.qlink_container} and use the "Where's My
Refund?" tool to check to see that the IRS received your 2020 tax
return. If they did not, you should call the IRS immediately.

COVID-19 is causing delays in processing paper returns, especially
returns that need more information or have errors. The Where's My Refund
tool will show you that the IRS has, at least, received your return. If
they have, then please be patient, they will either mail your refund or
will mail you instructions on any corrections or additional information
you may need to provide.

Original question:

I mailed my IRS tax returns by mail 3 months ago and still haven\'t
gotten my refund. Is there a delay right now for the IRS in 2021? How
long will it take?
