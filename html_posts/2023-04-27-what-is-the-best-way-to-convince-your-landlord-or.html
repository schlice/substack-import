You will have to show them that there is benefit by showing that the
chargers will eventually *generate revenue*. One way to do this is to
open the chargers up to the public. While residents can charge for free,
everyone else pays a fee. Over time, the chargers will eventually start
to make money.

But that's the problem. The HOA or the landlord has to have the capital
up front to install the chargers, and depending on the type of charger,
that can range anywhere from \$30K to \$200K. If the HOA or the landlord
doesn't have that kind of disposable capital lying around, it's a hard
sell to try to get them to impose a special assessment on homeowners or
take out a business loan.

TL;DR: Usually, the problem isn't that they don't see the value. It's
that they don't have the capital, and installing EV chargers requires
up-front capital investment.
