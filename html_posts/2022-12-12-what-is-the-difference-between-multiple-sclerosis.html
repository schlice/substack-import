Ultimately, there is no difference. Ataxia is an MS symptom, and it is
the **lack of voluntary coordination of muscle movements**. In MS, this
can present as clumsiness, unsteady gait, impaired eye and limb
movements, and speech problems. In some cases, the lack of coordination
appears as muscle tremors. So MS-associated ataxia is simply a symptom
of MS.

There is a different, yet related ataxia syndrome, and it is called
**fragile X-associated tremor ataxia syndrome** (FXTAS). In FXTAS, there
is also brain damage visible on an MRI, but it is specifically located
in the area of the brain related to muscle movement (the cerebellum).
FXTAS is a late-onset disease, usually presenting after age 50.

The most common symptom of FXTAS is **intention tremor**, wherein a
muscle you are trying to control trembles. Also common are gait and
coordination problems (ataxia).
