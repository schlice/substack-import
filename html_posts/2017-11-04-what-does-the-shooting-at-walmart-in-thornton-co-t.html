From the news coverage I've looked at, it appears that the police were
"hampered" in their review of CCTV footage because they saw people with
guns and focused on them. Then, they figured out that the people they
were looking at were not actually shooting, so they had to rewind and
start all over.

No offense, Thornton PD, but that's a fairly inefficient way to weed out
who the shooter is, unless you have multiple people reviewing footage
looking at every person with a gun until you find the shooter.

Besides, every one of those people has the right in this country to
defend themselves, so *what does it say about "good guns?"*
***Absolutely nothing****,* other than the police focus on the wrong
things when they review surveillance footage, and it causes them to
waste time. It's certainly not an indictment of the people who used
their Second Amendment rights to defend themselves.

I know "across the pond" you're probably looking at this going, "well,
if those people simply hadn't drawn their guns (or better yet, didn't
have them at all), the CCTV footage would have been scanned faster, the
actual shooter found faster, and caught faster."

Except the people would be unable to defend themselves. And in the
United States, the people have the right (and the responsibility) to
defend themselves, as it is no one else's responsibility to do it for
them.
