The Bible sees suicide as equal to murder, which it is (self-murder).

God is the only one who gets to decide when a person should live and
when they should die. As it says in Psalms, "My times are in your hands"
(Psalm 31:15).

The Bible clearly says throughout that God gives life. It also says that
God gives, and God takes away (Job 1:21). Suicide (the taking of one's
one life), therefore, is ungodly because the person takes God's
authority on themselves to end their own life. No human should presume
to take God's authority on themselves.

Therefore, suicide is a sin.
