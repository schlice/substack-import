**Voting should be restricted to US citizens.**

**ID should be mandatory to enforce this.**

\

This shouldn't even be a question. The people who are citizens of the
United States should be the people who determine the direction and
leadership of the United States, not just someone visiting on hoiday, or
someone on a student visa, or someone who may have crossed the border
illegally, or someone awaiting an asylum hearing, or any other
classification of person lawfully or unlawfully present in the United
States.

The only people who should vote are **citizens**. It's one of the
privileges of being a citizen.

\

Since people seem to not care about our laws, then unfortunately we must
resort to voter registration and identification to prove that you're at
the right voting place, and you are registered to vote, and you are the
person you claim you are.

Government identification isn't a big lift. You require government
identification for so many different things in life in the United States
that it's actually challenging to live *without* it. And yes, it is
absolutely true that some people do not have state issued ID cards or
driver's licenses. But that number is *vanishingly rare*.

I could set up a help booth and literally give assistance to anyone who
doesn't have an ID card, and I guarantee I could make it happen one way
or another. There are so many provisions to get ID cards to people that
there is virtually no way that it can't be done.

The trope that requiring ID is discriminatory has absolutely no basis in
reality.
