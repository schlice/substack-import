Yes, most states will issue fines for jurors skipping out on jury duty.
The possibility exists that you can also be cited for contempt of court
under state law, or if you're called to a Federal jury, under 28 U.S.C.
ยง 1966(g). Contempt of court charges for failing to show up in court
could land you in jail for up to three days for a federal case. State
laws differ, but you can face jail time.

In most cases, jail is reserved for habitual jury summons ignorers. Here
in Florida, it's estimated that around 3/4 of the people served with
jury summonses will ignore them. Most of those people actually have
legitimate exemptions from jury service and are excused. In Broward
County, over a decade's time, only 33 people faced contempt charges for
skipping jury duty, and only four were jailed.

So it's highly unlikely that you'd go to jail. It's far more likely that
you'll be fined. In Florida, you'll be fined \$100 for failing to show
for jury duty.
