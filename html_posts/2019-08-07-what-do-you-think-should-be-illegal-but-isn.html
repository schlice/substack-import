**What is illegal but should not be?**

In some states, riding a motorcycle without a helmet.

Look, I get the controversy over seatbelts. Yes, seatbelts save lives,
and if I want to kill myself, that's my own business. However, seatbelts
should be mandatory for those in the front seat. The seatbelt keeps the
driver in his seat and able to continue to control the vehicle, and
keeps the passenger from becoming a very distracting in-car missile.

But a motorcycle helmet? It's a law designed to protect me from me, and
that's not a good basis for a law.

And if you're going so fast that not wearing a helmet in a crash will
kill you (i.e. highway speed), that helmet's not going to protect you
anyway. It's just a case so they can identify you using dental records,
once they locate your head (which will still be strapped firmly inside
your helmet, although somewhat disconnected from the rest of your body).
There is some degree of argument surrounding your disability, in a
slower-speed crash, becoming a public burden, but we still have private
health insurance in this country as well as Medicare, and we have
EMTALA, and we understand the costs associated with that as well, so
such public burden will be limited.
