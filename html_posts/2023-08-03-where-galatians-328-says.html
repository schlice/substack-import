No. Jesus fully understands that you were created either male or female,
and any confusion about that is due to the sin nature infecting your
body, just as it infects all of our earthly bodies.

Often, if there is confusion about a single verse, it's helpful to look
at the context. As I've said frequently in answers in this Space,
***text, without context, is just pretext.***

So let's expand out just a touch and take a look at this quote in
context:

> for all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves
> with Christ. There is neither Jew nor Gentile, neither slave nor free,
> nor is there male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus. ---
> Galatians 3:27--28 NIV

In verse 27, Paul wrote, "For all of you who were baptized into Christ
have clothed yourselves with Christ. " In other words, any person
baptized into Christ has Christ. He goes on to explain what this means:
"There is neither Jew nor Gentile, neither slave nor free, nor is there
male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus" (v. 28).

Here, Paul *grounds* oneness on the condition of baptism. Baptism unites
us to Christ. Therefore, from this perspective, every person is "all one
in Christ Jesus." The reason why baptism into Christ works, however, is
precisely because **baptism** **fulfills the Abrahamic promise**. Paul
had just stated a little earlier in this letter to the Galatians that
"the blessing given to Abraham might come to the Gentiles through Christ
Jesus, so that by faith we might receive the promise of the Spirit."
(Gal 3:14).

Therefore, when we are baptized into Christ, there are no distinctions
any longer to God. There are no lesser Christians in the family of God.
Our earthly identifiers create no value distinction between us in our
Father\'s eyes. Jews do not carry a higher rank than Gentiles. Free
people hold no greater honor than slaves. Men are not superior to women.
No race is a \"master race,\" nor any ethnicity inferior. We "are all
one in Christ Jesus."

So now that we have explained the verse, what does that mean for a
Christian being non-binary? As you've seen, being non-binary is not what
the Scripture is talking about. Paul wasn't referring to a person living
as non-binary. Being non-binary is not referenced in the BIble, because
no one at the time of the Bible's writing would have ever even
*conceived* of any such thing. No one would have ever though that they
were born into the wrong body, or would have ever considered that they
were anything other than how God created them.

More specifically to Christians, being non-binary dishonors the
commission given to you by God to live as He created you. It's an insult
to the God who created you, boldly telling Him that your *sin* nature is
more important to you than your *actual* nature. There is no
justification for those who knowingly live in sin. "For the wages of sin
is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord."
(Romans 6:23). I know that sounds a little harsh, but the ramifications
of living in sin are quite severe (eternal separation from God), so we
shouldn't sugar-coat this to spare someone's delicate feelings. That
word *eternal* is a hard one for humans to wrap their brains around.
Eternal literally means *forever*. The time to do things right is *now*.
The time to fix your relationship with God is **now*.*** Don't wait.
Don't put it off. There is no better time than the present.
