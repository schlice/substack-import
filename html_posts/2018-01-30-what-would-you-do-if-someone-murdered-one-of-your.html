**What would you do if someone murdered one of your relatives, and
nothing is being done about it?**

This is quite a hypothetical, because if you said that someone murdered
one of my relatives, you have already conceded that the police know that
this was not an accident, and it was not suicide.

Therefore, in order for the police to come back to me, look me in the
eyes, and tell me that they have literally exhausted every avenue of
investigation available to them and they cannot find the killer, I would
have expected them to do a lot of investigating.

If I felt that they had literally done everything they could, and there
was nothing more that could have been done, I would accept the fact that
there are just some things in this life that we will never know, and try
to live the rest of my own life in a way that honors my departed
relative.

On the other hand, if I felt that the police had executed a very sloppy
investigation and left many avenues of investigation untouched, there
would be no expense that I would spare to hire private investigators to
find the killer and bring him to justice.
