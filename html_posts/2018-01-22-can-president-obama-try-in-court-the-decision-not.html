**Can President Obama try in court the decision not to give his Supreme
Court nominee a hearing as a constitutional violation?**

Only if he can show where (Article and Paragraph) in the Constitution
that it says that the Senate is ***required*** to provide ***every***
candidate presented by the President with a "hearing."

I assume you are referring to the nomination of Merrick Garland that the
Senate refused to bring to the floor. The Constitution says that the
President will make nominations to the various courts with "the advice
and consent" of the Senate. There is nothing in the Constitution which
**requires** the Senate to bring every nominee before them for a vote.

So I ask you: what constitutes "advice?" If the Senate says, "We are not
going to act on this nominee," is that "advice?"

Additionally, the Constitution allows the Senate to run based on its own
rules. One of the rules that the Senate has instituted allows the
Majority Leader to set the Senate Calendar (i.e. what matters will be
heard by the Senate and what matters will be deferred). Since the
Majority Leader was following a legally-established Senate rule, in
accordance with the Constitution, it appears (without a court weighing
in) that the Senate's actions were Constitutional.

So *could* President Obama bring an action claiming that the Senate
acted in an unconstitutional manner? Sure he could, but from first
glance, it does not appear that the evidence of such a Constitutional
violation is present.
