To be fair, it's not "legal" in any state because the Federal government
still has it listed on Schedule I. What states have done is to remove
any criminal penalty for its possession in that state. Colorado put this
provision in their State constitution. But don't mistake that for a
state making something legal that the Federal government says is
illegal, because the 14th Amendment says that's not possible.

This means that, until the Federal government can get out of its own
way, states will be the ones taking the lead on this, decriminalizing
marijuana at the state level, until most states no longer carry any
penalties for its possession.

It will be a very long time before the Federal government removes
marijuana from Schedule I. It's going to be a long, uphill battle just
to get them to move it to Schedule II so it can be prescribed by a
doctor. For reference, cocaine and opium are on Schedule II (and to be
fair, a big part of the opioid crisis is derived from prescription
abuse).

Whether or not employers stop testing for marijuana remains to be seen.
Alcohol is legal but you can't be drunk at work. So even for legal
things, employers can still choose to ban them, and can fire you if you
are caught using them. If it remains illegal at the Federal level,
regardless of what states do, employers who do business across state
lines will likely still prohibit its use because of such interstate
commerce (which is Federally governed).
