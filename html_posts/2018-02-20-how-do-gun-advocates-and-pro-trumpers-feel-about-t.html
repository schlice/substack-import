**What do gun right advocates and Trump supporters think about the
President directing the DOJ to propose a law banning bump stocks?**

I am both a Trump supporter and a gun rights advocate. What do I think
about banning bump stocks?

*Meh.*

Bump stocks are a novelty.

Anyone who is well-versed in firearms knows that bump stocks are wildly
inaccurate and basically exist because it's a neat trick to show how you
can be fully in compliance with the law but still make a semi-automatic
rifle behave like a fully automatic one.

If the Vegas shooter wanted to kill three times as many people, he'd
have taken the bump stock off and aimed with a good scope instead. Using
the rifle in the way it was intended would have allowed him to actually
place shots where he wanted them, and be far more accurate in the
process. Using the bump stock causes the part of the weapon you need to
hold steady to bounce around in your hand, which makes it terribly
inaccurate. He literally *vomited* rounds in the general direction he
wanted them to go and it was nothing but dumb luck that actually allowed
him to hit anything. If anything, more people survived the thousands of
rounds he shot *because* he used a bump stock.

So you wanna ban 'em? It's literally like banning those novelty glasses
with the attached nose and mustache. It's a novelty item. It has no
serious use in modern-day firearms. I'm sure that bump stock
manufacturers might disagree with me (just like professional clowns may
take issue with the whole fake mustache disguise banning), but I don't
care.

Bump stocks are a toy and if their existence in this world bothers you
or scares you because of the Vegas shooter, then please, by all means,
ban them from being sold in the United States. It hurts me not one bit.
It provides literally zero functionality. And banning them doesn't
prevent anyone from keeping or bearing arms in accordance with the 2nd
Amendment. So go ahead.
