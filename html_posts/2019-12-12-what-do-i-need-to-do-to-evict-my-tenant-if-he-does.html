**How do you evict someone who is on your lease when they refuse to
vacate?**

First of all, you cannot evict someone if you don't own the property.

Second, if you agreed to a lease with someone, you can't unilaterally
remove them from that lease. They have as much legal right to be there
as you do.

You can *negotiate* with them and ask them to leave, but if they refuse,
and the rent continues to get paid, you can't evict them. If you
mutually agree, and the landlord agrees, the landlord can remove that
person from the remainder of the lease term.

Your best bet is to wait until the end of the lease period and then
vacate. Maybe they'll want to stay on, but they will have to
re-negotiate a new lease at that point, one which does not include you.
