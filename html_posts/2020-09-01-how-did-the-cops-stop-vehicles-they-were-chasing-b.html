**How did the cops stop vehicles they were chasing, before the use of
fish-tailing and spike strips?**

There were, and still are, a number of techniques the police can use to
stop vehicles before [[the PIT
maneuver](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=8435f1&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PIT_maneuver){.external_link

"[[spike
strips](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=fe43f5&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spike_strip){.external_link

1.  The Box Maneuver\
    \
    Officers surround the suspect vehicle with police cars and slowly
    bring all of their vehicles to a halt, with nowhere for the suspect
    to go.
2.  [[StarChase](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=3eb344&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/StarChase){.external_link
    rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"

    \
    StarChase was a less-than-lethal vehicle tagging system developed in
    2006 to track and locate fleeing vehicles
3.  Finally, there's just good ol' fashioned ramming. If you were in a
    relatively safe place away from people, you could just crash the
    suspect car.
