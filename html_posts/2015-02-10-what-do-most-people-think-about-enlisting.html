**Content:** [In truth, the military is still a great way to start your
working life. You get a great education, job skills, and experience.
These are things which are challenging to get at any time, when you\'re
just starting out. Leaving the military, you are far above people who
are unskilled, plus you are head and shoulders above similarly skilled
people because you have experience. So as far as your career goes, the
military is a great way to go.\
\
However, understand that it\'s not just a job. The military is still the
military, and we are actively fighting the Global War On Terror. You may
have to go fight for a while. You still have to be prepared for
that.]{.rendered_qtext}
