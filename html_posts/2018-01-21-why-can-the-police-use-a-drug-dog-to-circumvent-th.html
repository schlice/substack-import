**Why can the police use a drug dog to circumvent the 4th amendment by
creating probable cause? It seems unconstitutional that they can
manufacture probable cause to allow them to search your car when you do
not consent due to principle.**

I can understand how the use of the drug dog on the outside of your car
may seem like a circumvention of the 4th Amendment.

But the Supreme Court does not agree.

One of the key exceptions to 4th Amendment protection is what is known
as the "plain sight" test. For example, if an officer approaches your
car and a doobie is clearly visible in the ashtray (yes, some cars still
have ashtrays), the officer now has probable cause to search your car,
as the drugs are clearly visible from the exterior of the car. The
"plain smell" test falls into the same category as the "plain sight"
test; in other words, if it can be smelled from outside of the car
without impacting the vehicle at all (i.e. searching the interior of the
car), then the "plain smell" test is passed, and the 4th Amendment does
not apply. For example, if you roll down your window and the officer can
smell marijuana, this provides the probable cause to search the vehicle
without a warrant, as this is part of the "plain smell" exception to 4th
Amendment protections.

The use of a drug dog around the exterior of the vehicle is similarly
covered by the "plain smell" exception to the 4th Amendment.

What is **not** covered is **elongating** **a traffic stop** for more
time than the stop would normally take **in order to request a drug
dog**. For example, an officer cannot make you wait for hours for a drug
dog to arrive in order to perform a plain smell search on the outside of
your car. Any such delay is grounds for dismissal of the charges. If a
drug dog can arrive in the same amount of time that a normal traffic
stop would take, then the dog is allowed. If the dog's arrival elongates
the duration of the stop at all, the dog (and the results of the dog's
search, including any probable cause produced because of the dog) are
inadmissible.

Now, if you are stopped by a K9 officer, if one can arrive within
minutes, or if you are at a roadside checkpoint where a drug dog is
present, you're most likely outta luck. If this happens to you, make
sure you provide all these details to your lawyer and see what you can
do.
