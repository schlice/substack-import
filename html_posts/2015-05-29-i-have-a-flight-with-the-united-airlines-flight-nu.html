**Content:** [Always check in with the carrier who issued the ticket. If
the ticket says \"United Airlines\" on it, that\'s where you check in.
If it says \"Air Canada,\" that\'s where you check in.\

Some co-branded flights are indeed operated. But you always check in

co-branding.]{.rendered_qtext}
