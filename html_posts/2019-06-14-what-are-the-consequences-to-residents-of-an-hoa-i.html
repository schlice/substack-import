**What are the consequences to residents of an HOA if the HOA
Declarations and Bylaws were not filed with the state as they were
supposed to be several years ago, but the HOA has been collecting dues
and conducting elections and meetings/HOA business?**

A Homeowner's Association (HOA) is a 501(c)4 non-profit corporation. It
is run like a corporation, with bylaws adopted by the corporation, and
which runs according to those bylaws.

Additionally, the HOA is incorporated in the city in which it does
business. This means that the HOA's Covenants, Conditions and
Restrictions (CC&R) becomes part of the city charter, influencing local
zoning ordinance and how taxes are applied to that neighborhood.

If the CC&R is never filed with the city, then it never becomes part of
the city charter. This could cause problems with city zoning or city
taxes applied to the residents in that HOA.

However, the HOA still runs as a 501(c)4 independent of the CC&R being
filed with the city. The buyers still received notice of the CC&R when
they bought their homes, and that "constructive notice" still applies.

So long as the HOA operated in accordance with its own bylaws, it is
still a legal corporation, and homeowners are still bound by the CC&R
that they agreed to upon purchasing their homes.
