**Which NRA members on Quora would agree that 18-year-old Black Lives
Matter activists with AR-15s would constitute a \"well-regulated
militia\" deserving of Second Amendment protections?**

Again, that whole "well-regulated militia" clause is confusing people.

Please, please, please, take the time to read *DC v. Heller* **** **so
you can understand who is allowed to own a gun and under what
circumstances**.

*Heller,* along with *MacDonald v. Chicago,* incorporated the 2nd
Amendment to the states. It basically said that gun ownership is an
individual right, not contingent on military service. If you are a
citizen of the United States, you have that right. Period, end of story.
You don't have to *do* anything to get the right. You don't have to be
part of any group to get the right. Just as you don't have to *do*
anything to get the right to free speech, you don't have to *do*
anything to get the right to keep and bear arms.
