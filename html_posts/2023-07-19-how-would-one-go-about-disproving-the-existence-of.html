Philosopher and scholar Mortimer Adler said, "\"An affirmative
existential proposition can be proved, but a negative existential
proposition\--one that denies the existence of something\--cannot be
proved.\"

In other words, you can prove the existence of something, but you can't
prove that something does not exist.

Therefore, there is no mathematical or logical proof you can provide
which would show that God does not exist. At best, what exists is
logical arguments against the logical proofs which argue that God does
exist.
