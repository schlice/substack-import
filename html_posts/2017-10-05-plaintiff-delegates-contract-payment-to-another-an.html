It depends on the terms of the delegation. If a contract has not been
legally transferred to another party or amended to show the new payor,
than the original signatory on the contract is still legally responsible
for making the payment in whatever way that person chose to do so, and
remains legally liable should the contract fail to be paid.

Can the plaintiff sue the person who was supposed to pay? Sure, but you
will have to show the agreement that was made to make payments on the
contract, and how it was violated, and the agreement has to be something
other than "Hey, you gonna pay this, right?"
