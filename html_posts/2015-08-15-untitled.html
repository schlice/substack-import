<h2>Answer Comment</h2>
<div>

**Content:** [It is much easier to shoot straight ahead, through the
windshield (which won\'t stop the bullet at all, nor will it change its
trajectory), at a silhouette-sized torso which stays relatively in the
same place in space (although it does get progressively bigger as the
car approaches), than it is to shoot down towards the ground at a target
the size of a shoebox when viewed from the front, mostly obscured by the
nose of the car, which is very hard to hit when it\'s not moving, much
more difficult to hit (if not impossible) when the vehicle is moving,
and not guaranteed to make the car not hit you at full speed.\
\
To be fair, there is no guarantee that the car won\'t hit you if you do
shoot the driver, but if the driver loses consciousness, they will
release the pressure on their foot, causing the car to (at least) slow
down.]{.rendered_qtext}
