I guess it's up to me to give you the real answer today...

Sin isn't a created thing, so no one "created" sin. Sin is an act of
disobedience. It's an action, not a thing. It's literally "missing the
mark."

God created humans with the *capacity* to sin, which we call "free
will." Humans can use that free will to either follow Him or reject Him,
and that disobedience is what we call "sin." He sets the rules, we break
the rules. That's sin.
