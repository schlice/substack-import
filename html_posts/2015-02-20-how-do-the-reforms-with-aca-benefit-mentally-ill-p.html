**Content:** [While I am not a fan of the Affordable Care Act (because
it is anything but affordable, and doesn\'t provide needed care), there
are some provisions that benefit the mentally ill. You can find these
and more answers on the
[[http://www.healthcare.gov](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=a7ee2d&url=http://www.healthcare.gov){.external_link

\
The ACA mandates that most individual and small employer healthcare
plans, including all the plans offered in the Marketplace, have coverage
for mental health and substance abuse services. Because of this law
change, most plans must now cover preventative screenings as well, such
as depression screenings for adults, and behavioral assessments for
children. Finally, as of 2014, the ACA removed any \"pre-existing
condition\" denials from insurance, so you can buy insurance and be
covered for any pre-existing conditions you may have, including any
mental illness.\
\
I\'m also reasonably certain that there are no age limitations on this
coverage, but you should check with your individual insurance carrier
for more information.]{.rendered_qtext}
