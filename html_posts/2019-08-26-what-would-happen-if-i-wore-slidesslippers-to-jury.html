**What would happen if I wore slides/slippers to jury duty? Would they
send me home? Would I be fined?**

As with all legal questions (including the ones about jury duty), the
answer is "it depends."

If your goal in wearing slides or slippers to jury duty was simply to be
comfortable, and your court does not have a dress code which requires a
certain category of footwear, the judge will probably allow you to stay
in the jury pool with your slides on.

If your court does have a dress code and you violated it, you would be
subject to whatever penalty the dress code has attached to it.

If your goal in wearing slides is to get yourself out of jury duty, it
won't work. Because you're not the first rocket scientist to have
thought of such a ploy. In other words, judges have seen worse. And the
judge will impose a penalty on you for thinking you can inappropriately
dress your way out of jury duty. And those penalties can be many,
varied, and usually worse than actually attending jury duty like you
were ordered to.

**Pro Tip**: If you're called to jury duty, just go. Yes, it sucks. No
one likes it. But if you want to have twelve of your peers judging you
fairly if you ever find yourself at the defendant's table, then you have
to step up to the plate and be that peer judging someone else fairly
when you are called.
