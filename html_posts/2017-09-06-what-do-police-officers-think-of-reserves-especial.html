Every line cop I bump into who says they don't recognize me and I tell
them I'm a Reservist has told me, "Wow, that's really awesome." "Thanks
for what you do." "We really appreciate you guys." Or something similar.

They thank us because we're the guys who come out to sit on a crime
scene so they can get back to patrol. We're the guys who provide
security for the County Fair so they don't have to. We're the guys doing
the jobs that are "time sinks" that are serious time killers but require
a sworn deputy to do. They know that if it wasn't for us, it would be
them filling that position.

We consider ourselves "force multipliers." We are there to back them up,
relieve them when needed, and stand beside them if necessary. They know
that, and as far as I can tell, they are grateful.

I can understand some of the criticisms, but we don't "take" anyone's
paid duty assignments. Those assignments are always offered to line cops
first.\* If no one takes it (we always tend to have more requests for
paid assignments than we can reasonably fill), they go to Reserves. The
pay goes back into the Reserve budget except in extremely rare cases
when a paid duty assignment *must* be filled and we can't even find a
Reservist to fill it. The department has, on those occasions, authorized
the pay to go directly to the Reservist just so the job gets filled.
Usually it's something on a holiday when no one but the duty crew wants
to be out, and I bet that in half of those cases, even they don't want
to be there.

These days, I think they recognize that the general public sees
Reservists as filling a crucial gap, and I'm not talking about the
manpower and money gaps (although we do that). We fill that "in-between"
space between a cop and a civilian. We're your insurance agents (we have
several), your car dealership owners (we have one), your tech support
agents (again, several), military contractors, military retirees
(there's a lot of that), etc. We're not full-time cops. We don't "live
the life" of a cop. Therefore, in some respects, we provide an
"outsiders" view of life as a cop, so the public knows there's people
doing the job who have a civilian's perspective on the job, while still
being full-fledged cops. The public respects that view, regardless of
what they think of cops in general.

\

\*There is one caveat to that. Here in Colorado Springs, our department
has one big-ticket contract with 10ABW at USAFA to provide all of the
security at Air Force home football games. With few exception, all of
the deputies at the game are Reservists. And that contract is our
bread-and-butter. Not to mention, it comprises a significant chunk of
the 192 annual hours we are required to commit to the department. To be
fair, pretty much everyone puts in more than that, but I had to mention
the minimum requirement.
