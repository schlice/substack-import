I know we're talking about hypotheticals here, but let's just give you
the short answer: you can't do it.

It's not like you fill in your age on a form and they take you at your
word.

At the recruiters these days, you have to show a lot of personal
documents: your Social Security card, your birth certificate, your
drivers license, your high school transcript, etc. Then they do basic
background checks on you. Back in the day, the documentation requirement
was much lighter, and background checks did not move at the speed of
digital. Today, it would take a lot of falsification to actually be able
to join the military while lying about your age. You have to spend quite
a bit of money to get a good fake birth certificate which you could then
use to get a real fake driver's license, Social Security card, etc. Good
documents are not cheap, so trying to lie about your age to get into the
army is a pretty expensive proposition for someone who is younger than
18.

Back in the day, you could lie on your application and it wouldn't have
been so closely checked. Today, it's nearly impossible to get into the
military underage. Today, you'd be quite quickly discovered as a liar at
the recruiter's office, and you would be asked to go find employment
somewhere else. Probably politely, but there are no guarantees. The
military isn't big on liars.
