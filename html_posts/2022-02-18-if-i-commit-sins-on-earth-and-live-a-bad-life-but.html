The person who is truly "saved" *dies to their sin* and is *born again*.
They become a new person in Christ.

This isn't merely just "word imagery." This is a truth of salvation.
Your old life *dies*. You become a new person. The old person is
"crucified" (Romans 6) and a new man lives in his place (2 Cor 5:15, Gal
2:20).

Christ paid for our past sin with his death and resurrection. Yes it
happened, and yes you will face those sins on the day of judgement, *but
those who are saved have already had the cost of those sins covered*.

You don't have to "change your mind about your sins." God has given you
the gift of Jesus, and he has paid for your sin. It is done. You cannot
change what has happened. You committed the sin, but Christ sacrificed
himself, and took the punishment you deserved, clearing your way to go
to heaven.

Whoa. That's a pretty amazing gift he gave us, isn't it?

However, if you were "saved" *and yet you still live in sin,* the same
sins you lived in before you were "saved," I might question whether or
not you were actually "saved" in the first place.

Original question:

If I commit sins on Earth and live a bad life but I am saved, are the
consequences of those sins eternal? If so, how do I have a change of
mind about my sins?
