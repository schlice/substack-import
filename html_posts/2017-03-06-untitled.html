*So you are saying any method i use i will have the same problem (an app
to read...)?*

You got it! The problem is not so much the QR code, it's that you need
to have something on the distant end to decode whichever code you use.
The native camera app on nearly all smartphones, by itself, does not
read QR codes (or any barcode, for that matter). You need an app for
that.

Suggestion: Underneath your QR code, you should add some text which says
something like, "To read this code on your smartphone, download a QR
code reader from your App Store." It's not ideal, but at least if
someone wants to get the URL, this is how they can do it.

An alternative might be to shorten your URL and add that to your flyer.
So if you have, for example, a SurveyMonkey survey, and it has the
massive SurveyMonkey URL, you can use a URL shortening service like
[[Google URL
Shortener](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=66f86a&url=http://goo.gl){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="goo.gl"}]{.qlink_container} or [[bit.ly URL
Shortener](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=532929&url=http://bit.ly){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="bit.ly"}]{.qlink_container} to shorten the URL into
something manageable, like
[[http://goo.gl/U7dfQ2](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=5563b2&url=http://goo.gl/U7dfQ2){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"}]{.qlink_container} (that's not a real
link, but that's how short your new link would be, and it would look
something like that).

Good Luck!
