We know that the Bible is divinely inspired because the Bible isn't just
one book written by just a handful of guys who got together and planned
what to write. The Bible isn't one book. It's 66 books, written over the
course of almost two thousand years, by 40 different authors, in three
different languages, and on three different continents. There is
diversity in the authors. Everyone from kings to paupers, scholars,
fishermen, prophets, a military general, a cupbearer, and a priest
contributed various types of writings. Some wrote to record history,
while others wrote letters or poetry. They were written in palaces, and
prison cells, the wilderness and places of exile. They wrote poetry and
prose, laws, correspondence, prophecy, and proverbs.

But across all of that diversity, despite this vast array of topics and
circumstances, there is **unity** in the message**. Despite all of its
diversity, the Bible is unwaveringly consistent in its message, and
never contradicts itself or its common theme.** From Genesis to
Revelation, we see the same theme: God creates paradise, man rebels
against God, God redeems man. God revealed His plan for man's redemption
all the way back in Genesis with the sin of Adam and Eve. He repeatedly
promised this reconciliation throughout the Old Testament. And He
fulfilled that reconciliation through the unlikely life of a baby boy
born in the humblest of circumstances. This plan was foretold centuries
before it actually happened, and then it did, exactly as it was
foretold. This alone is impossible to have happened by chance.

Despite the vastly different times and contexts in which the books of
the Bible were written, all of its authors relay the same message about
God's plan for redemption and how that redemption was given life in the
person of Jesus.

In short, **the unity of the Bible demonstrates its supernatural
inspiration**.

In no other religion do you see God going to such lengths to seek out
His children. In every other religion, man seeks the approval of god. In
Christianity, God seeks the redemption of man.

In short, in every other world religion, you seek God. In Christianity,
God seeks you.
