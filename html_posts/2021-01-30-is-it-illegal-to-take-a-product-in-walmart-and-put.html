**Is it illegal to take a product in Walmart and put it in the store
somewhere hidden so you could come back the week or however long it sits
until you make the purchase?**

No, it is not illegal. There is no law on the books relating to
relocation of products in Walmart. It's not illegal to take product from
one area of the store and move it to another.

Not having been a Walmart employee, I'm not sure if it violates store
policy. Store personnel normally do "recovery" when they find an item in
one area of the store that doesn't belong there. It's more work for
store employees, but in general, as far as I know, it doesn't violate
store policy.
