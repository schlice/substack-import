You can\'t do anything by yourself. While laudable, you simply don\'t
have enough inertia. And if events like Columbine or Sandy Hook or
Aurora couldn\'t generate enough momentum, neither can you personally.

You should look into partnering with organizations like [[the Brady
Center](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=c0015e&url=http://www.bradycampaign.org/bradycenter){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="bradycampaign.org"}]{.qlink_container}, [[Moms Demand
Action](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=58b4fa&url=http://momsdemandaction.org/){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="momsdemandaction.org"}]{.qlink_container}, and the
[[Violence Policy
Center](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=5f280c&url=http://www.vpc.org/){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="vpc.org"}]{.qlink_container}. These organizations are all
working towards a gun-free America, albeit in different ways.

You should definitely look at voting Democrat. Hillary Clinton has a
very strong anti-gun policy. She has made plain that she wants to roll
back the *Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act* so that victims of
gun violence can sue the manufacturer of that gun. She would like to
destroy the gun manufacturing industry in the United States by suing
them out of existence. Bernie Sanders doesn\'t have quite as radical a
view against PLCAA, but as a Democrat, he is most definitely anti-gun by
definition.

You might try taking different tacks as well, like successfully suing
Ford when a drunk driver kills a family, or suing Ginsu when a knife is
used to commit a murder. You might be able to generate some anti-gun
momentum that way.

It\'s definitely an uphill climb, but \"the journey of a thousand miles
begins with just one step.\"

By the way, I\'m pro-gun. I do what I want.
