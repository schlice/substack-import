While laws are different between states, the general rule is that your
charge is based on the laws that were in place at the time you were
charged and convicted. Since you were convicted as a felon, you are
still a felon.

Some states allow citizens to seek expungement for certain non-violent
felonies. It would be best to seek the advice of a criminal defense
attorney to see what your options are in this case.
