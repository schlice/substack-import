Wow, lots of questions here. Let's see if we can do this a step at a
time.

> How do police officers know the exact law when issuing a ticket? Do

If you issued that many tickets every single day for the same
infraction, you'd have it memorized, too.

> What happens if they get the reference wrong?

The court will allow the prosecutor to amend the ticket to correct the
error. They won't throw the ticket out because of a clerical error.
That's a myth.

> Can I demand to see the book they\'re referring to before signing?

Nope. They are under no obligation to show you any of that. They would
be under obligation to show the *judge* in traffic court, but not you.

Original question:

How do police officers know the exact law when issuing a ticket? Do they
truly memorize that speeding is page 50 paragraph 25 section 12? What
happens if they get the reference wrong? Can I demand to see the book
they\'re referring to before signing?
