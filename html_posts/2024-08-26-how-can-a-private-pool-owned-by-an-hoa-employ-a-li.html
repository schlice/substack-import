In most HOA communities, a community pool is unguarded. Signs are posted
at the gated entrance to the pool that swimming is at your own risk
since there is no lifeguard on duty.

The HOA maintains general liability insurance on all common areas within
the HOA, and dues pay for that insurance. Neighborhoods which have pools
will have liability insurance commensurate with the risk.
