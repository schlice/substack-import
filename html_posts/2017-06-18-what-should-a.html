There was an inherent problem in the Castile case. Castile was working
under two separate orders: reach for your license, but don't reach for
your gun.

In my opinion, the police erred by telling Castile to simultaneously
reach for his license but not reach for his gun, making it very
difficult for the officer to distinguish between the two "reaches." The
officer still feared for his life, which was the only reason why he was
acquitted of murder charges. That doesn't make the incident any less
tragic. It also doesn't fit the BLM mantra of racist cops just looking
for reasons to kill blacks.

It makes no difference why he was in fear for his life: whether Castile
was black, whether or not the officer was racist, or because Castile had
a gun. It doesn't matter. The police officer told Castile to do
something, and then shot him for doing exactly what he was told. The
police officer should have been held accountable for causing the error
that led to Castile's death, and I'm sure he will be held to account in
civil court, when Castile's family follows with their wrongful death
suit. Murder wasn't going to stick, but I see a very clear case of
wrongful death here.

There's no evidence that the officer was afraid for his life because
Castile was black. That's not why the officer should have been
convicted. He should have been convicted because Castile died following
the lawful orders of the police.

Don't turn his death into something that it's not.
