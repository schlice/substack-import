**Does the owner of the guns used in the Texas school shooting, the
killer's father, have any criminal liability under current Texas or
federal law?**

Unless the father had prior knowledge that the son was going to commit
murder and opened the safe for him (which would fall under a conspiracy
charge), only the person committing the crime is criminally liable for
the murders.

Ownership does not confer special criminal liability for use of
something, especially if it was used without permission and without
foreknowledge. I'm certain that law enforcement is currently questioning
the father and asking him about his son's access to the gun safe (if
there was one).
