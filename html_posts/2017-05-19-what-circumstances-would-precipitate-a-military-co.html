You would have to see a wholesale repudiation of the Constitution by a
sitting president before the military would step in, and even so, the
military wouldn't be "taking over."

We have procedures in place to remove a president who commits "high
crimes and misdemeanors." Yes, it's called impeachment. It has become
somewhat of a political tool as of late, with political factions always
seeking to impeach the president of the opposing party because
impeachment is a political process, not a legal one.

Nevertheless, a president committing such acts would likely have quite
widespread animosity within Congress and they would seek to impeach that
president and have him or her removed from office.

If the president failed to leave office, the military may step in.

But a military coup and military leaders ejecting the civilian
leadership and replacing it with a military? Nope, not going to happen
in the US. I can't even foresee a circumstance under which it would.
