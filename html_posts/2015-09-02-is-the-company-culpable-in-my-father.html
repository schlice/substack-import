**Content:** [First of all, it sounds like you have a specific legal
question. In such a case, you need to consult an attorney. We can\'t
give you specific legal advice in relation to your case.\
\
We can provide general answers surrounding corporate responsibilities
and workplace law. Here are a few items for you to consider:\
]{.rendered_qtext}

- In general, employers and employees have an ***employment at-will***
  arrangement. That means in general, with certain restrictions,
  employees and/or companies can terminate the employment arrangement at
  any time, for any reason.

<!-- -->

- I can only presume that the company did not let him go because he
  \"wasn\'t of sound mind.\" I presume they let him go because his
  mental illness created a condition where he wasn\'t able to produce
  quality work. He was let go because his work wasn\'t up to par, not
  because he had a mental disease or defect.\
- Companies are not responsible for the medical care of their employees,
  even if they are aware of a particular medical condition. This does
  not mean that companies are not responsible for ensuring a healthy and
  safe workplace; they are. They are not, however, responsible to ensure
  that their employees seek medical care when they need it if an injury,
  disease, or condition was caused by something outside the workplace.
  They can provide medical insurance as a condition of employment, but
  medical issues are covered by doctor-patient privilege, and the
  company is not privvy to them just because they foot a portion of the
  medical insurance bill.

If you feel you may have a case for a wrongful death suit, consult with
a practicing attorney in your area. However, it sounds like they were
offering him an opportunity to get help by requesting that he take time
using FMLA to get medical assistance, like perhaps counseling for
alcohol addiction, or inpatient rehab. We don\'t know, and only you and
your attorney can find out.
