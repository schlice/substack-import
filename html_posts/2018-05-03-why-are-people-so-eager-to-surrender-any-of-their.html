**Why are people so eager to surrender any of their rights to their
government?**

Because whatever right they are eager to surrender (the only one that
comes to mind is the Second Amendment) is not important *to them*, they
see no usefulness in having it, and they believe that its continued
presence is dangerous, and so they have no compunction seeing it
dismantled or removed entirely.
