sufficiently answered this question. I really can't add anything to
their analysis.

> In the Bible, the word translated "fear" can mean several things. It
> can refer to the terror one feels in a frightening situation
> (Deuteronomy 2:25). It can mean "respect" in the way a servant fears
> his master and serves him faithfully (Joshua 24:14). Fear can also
> denote the reverence or awe a person feels in the presence of
> greatness (Isaiah 6:5). The fear of the Lord is a combination of all
> of these.
>
> Fear of the Lord can be defined as "the continual awareness that our
> loving heavenly Father is watching and evaluating everything we think,
> say, and do" (Matthew 12:36; Psalm 139:2; Jeremiah 12:3). As Jesus
> told each of the seven churches in Revelation 2---3, "I know your
> works." Nothing escapes His attention.
>
> In order to develop the fear of the Lord, we must recognize God for
> who He is. We must glimpse with our spirits the power, might, beauty,
> and brilliance of the Lord God Almighty (Revelation 11:17; Hosea 12:5;
> Isaiah 6:1--5). Those who fear the Lord have a continual awareness of
> Him, a deep reverence for Him, and sincere commitment to obey Him.
>
> Proverbs 1:7 says, "The fear of the LORD is the beginning of
> knowledge, but fools despise wisdom and instruction." This verse gives
> us some added insight with its antithetical parallelism---there is a
> sharp contrast between the wise life and the foolish life. A wise
> person fears/reverences/obeys the Lord; a fool despises God's
> instruction and cannot be told what to do. The wise person is wise
> because he has started at the starting place; the fool has no
> foundation on which to build wisdom.
>
> Romans 1:21--22 speaks of those who "neither glorified him as God nor
> gave thanks to him, but their thinking became futile and their foolish
> hearts were darkened. Although they claimed to be wise, they became
> fools." This is a description of people who try to obtain wisdom while
> ignoring God---it cannot be done for the simple reason that God is the
> source of wisdom.
>
> The link between the fear of God and wisdom means we cannot possess
> wisdom if we recreate God in our own image. Too many people want to
> "tame" God into a non-threatening nobody. But, if we redefine the Lord
> as a god that makes us feel comfortable, a permissive "buddy" who
> exists simply to bless us and give us what we want, we will not fear
> Him in the way He deserves to be feared. The Lord God Almighty is far
> greater than that, and the fear of the Lord begins when we see Him in
> His majesty and power (Revelation 4:11; Job 42:1--2) The Lord shows
> Job (and us) a glimpse of His power in Job 38---41 when He describes
> His absolute sovereignty over everything.
>
> When the reality of God's true nature has caused us to fall down in
> worship, we are then in the right position to gain wisdom. Wisdom is
> merely seeing life from God's perspective and responding accordingly.
> Wisdom is a priority, and we are told to seek it above all else
> (Proverbs 3:13; 16:16). Proverbs is known as the wisdom book, and the
> entire second chapter gives a detailed explanation of the value of
> gaining wisdom.
>
> Until our hearts are in a right relationship with God, we are unable
> to have the "wisdom that comes from heaven" (James 3:17). Without the
> fear of the Lord, we may gain knowledge of earthly things and make
> some practical choices for this life, but we are missing the one
> ingredient that defines a wise person (Psalm 14:1; Exodus 20:3; 34:14;
> Jeremiah 25:6; Matthew 22:37). In the parable of the rich farmer, the
> rich man had a "wise" and practical plan for his profits, but God said
> to him, "You fool!" because the farmer's plans were made with no
> thought of God and eternity (Luke 12:16--21).
>
> Without the fear of the Lord, we make final decisions based on our
> faulty human understanding (Proverbs 3:5--6). When we incorporate the
> fear of the Lord into every moment of our lives, we make decisions
> based upon His approval. We live with the knowledge that the Creator
> of the universe is intimately involved in our every move. He sees,
> knows, and evaluates all our choices, and we will answer to Him (Psalm
> 139:1--4).
>
> Our respect for God's majesty causes us to honor Him (Psalm 29:2). Our
> gratitude for His mercy causes us to serve Him well (Psalm 2:11;
> 107:15). And the understanding that our God of love is also a God of
> wrath inspires enough fear to help us stay away from evil (Romans
> 1:18; Proverbs 8:13). Sin is foolish; righteousness is wise. When we
> live righteously, we are on the path to wisdom, and everyone in our
> lives benefits (Proverbs 13:20; 19:8).[\[1\]](#IUdiQ){#cite-IUdiQ
