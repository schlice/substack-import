The motion to halt military vaccines failed. The plaintiffs are moving
forward with their lawsuit.

18 US servicemembers have filed a lawsuit against the Department of
Defense alleging that the vaccine mandate is unlawful. They also are
requesting a temporary restraining order against enforcing the mandate.

The services are working through requests for exemptions on religious
and medical grounds.[\[1\]](#fiZDF){#cite-fiZDF .citation_link}

Original question:

Will the military vaccine mandate end up being dismissed like some of
the others, or will it be held to a different standard by the courts?
