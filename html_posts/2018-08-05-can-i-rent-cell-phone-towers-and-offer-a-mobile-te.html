**Can I rent cell phone towers and offer a mobile telecomunication
service?**

Yes you can!

You would be called a Mobile Virtual Network Operator (MVNO). This is a
company who leases phone and data services from major carriers and
provides services for either business or personal use.

As of 2016, MVNOs serviced approximately 36 million subscribers in the
United States.

You can find a list of all current MVNOs operating in the US
