<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [As a junior System Administrator in an IT department, you<br>perform all of the functions required by your department. Depending on<br>the department for which you work, you could be involved in standard<br>end-user system administrator duties:\<br>]<br><br>- Creation, modification, and deletion of user accounts, including<br>  domain accounts, email accounts, SecurID accounts, and specific<br>  internal server and system accounts<br>- Backups of user home directories<br>- Restoration of lost user files from backups<br>- Addition and removal of user workstations, imaging and re-imaging<br>  workstations\<br>- Resetting user passwords\<br>- Handling user support requests<br><br>Organizations nowadays don\'t do hardware repair inside their<br>organizations. Hardware is sent out to a vendor for repair, or a vendor<br>comes on site to fix hardware. Unless you work for that vendor, you<br>won\'t be doing specific hardware repair. You may be doing hardware<br>upgrades on servers, but not usually on workstations.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
