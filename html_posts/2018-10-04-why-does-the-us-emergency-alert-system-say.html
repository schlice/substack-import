**Why does the US emergency alert system say \"Presidential Alert\"
instead of just something like \"National Alert\"?**

Alerts that come in as "Presidential Alerts" are issued by the
President. Primarily, that's why they are called "Presidential Alerts."
The government has the ability to issue three types of messages:

- Presidential Alerts, alerts issued directly from the President
- Alerts regarding imminent danger to life. There are two subcategories
  of these alerts: Extreme Threat or Severe Threat
- AMBER Alerts

According to Commercial Mobile Alert System (CMAS) regulations, end
users are not supposed to be able to disable "Presidential Alerts,"
which is why they are in a separate category from other CMAS alerts.
