**A Jehovah's Witness has been mailing tracts to my home. We are 'cradle
Catholics' & don't engage at the door. How do we stop them?**

Short answer: you can't.

Unless you can get off of their mailing list somehow, they can send you
junk mail. The problem with the mail system is that the sender has paid
the Post Office to send material to you, so the Post Office will ensure
that their mail gets to you.

Literally, your best option is to simply trash the junk mail.
