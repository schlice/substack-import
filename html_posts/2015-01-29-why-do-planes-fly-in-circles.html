is correct about holding patterns prior to landing. Same holds true as
an aircraft ascends, but normally the aircraft will not hold before
departing; normally aircraft hold in circles before they land because of
congestion in the landing pattern.\
\
An aircraft can be held in a pattern before proceeding if there is
knowledge of downstream congestion. Normally, aircraft are held on the
ground if downstream congestion is found (called a \"ground hold\").
It\'s rare that aircraft are held in the air before
proceeding.]{.rendered_qtext}
