Concrete evidence of a non-concrete God is kinda silly, wouldn't you
say? It's like using a metal detector to find a plastic cup.

It's not that religious folks *won't* provide you the concrete evidence
of God's existence that you want, **no one can**, because God is not
"concrete."

If God even exists, and if theists (religious folks) are correct that He
created the universe, He must exist outside of the universe, because you
must be outside of a thing in order to create the thing. Since all time,
all space, and all matter were created with the creation of the universe
at the Big Bang, God must be *outside* of all of those things. If He is
outside of time, then He has no beginning or no end (He is "timeless"),
and if He is outside of space and matter, then He is immaterial (He has
no form or matter). So if God actually created the universe, then He is
***necessarily*** immaterial and eternal.

So you're never going to find concrete evidence of God's existence.
You're never going to discover one of God's hairs, or see one of God's
footprints. *But that doesn't mean you can't prove beyond a reasonable
doubt that God exists*. You just have to use different tools to do it.
Because we know that things exist which are not concrete, but we are all
rational to believe in. For example, you can't prove using science that
a sunset is beautiful or that the Nazis were evil. But we are all
rational to believe in beauty and morality, despite the fact that
science cannot prove them.

It's true that some theists don't know how to explain what they know in
their hearts. I think they should learn more, but they're not any less
theists for not understanding or being able to explain what they know to
be true.
