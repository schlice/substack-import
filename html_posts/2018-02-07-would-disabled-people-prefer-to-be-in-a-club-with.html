This is a good question, and I don't take any personal offense by you
asking it. It's a common misconception, and it has a lot to do with what
the name "disabled" means. Disabled, implying the root "disability," is
a legal term, not a medical term.

Legally speaking, a disability is a physical or mental impairment that
substantially limits one or more major life activities. By this alone,
naming your group after its legal definition isn't probably the most
efficacious name.

However, it goes deeper than that. It strikes at the heart of the issue:
**how do persons with disabilities define themselves?**

Is a person with a disability *defined by* that disability? In other
words, does the disability make the person, or are they simply a person
who happens to also have a disability? I probably don't need to answer
that question, but I will for clarity: *persons with disabilities are
not defined by their disabilities.* They are people. Plain and simple.
The fact that they also have a disability is meaningless. People don't
want to be artificially sorted into boxes. People want to feel included.
People want to feel appreciated for the skills they do bring to the
table, they don't want to feel segregated by a disability. A name like
the "Disabled Sailing Club" would probably segregate more than it would
include.

Something others fail to recognize as well: naming your group the
"Disabled Sailing Club" artificially limits the membership of the group!
You probably never intended to *restrict membership to only disabled
persons.* You probably thought, "Well, anyone can join, but we cater
specifically to the disabled." That said, how does your name tell people
that anyone can join? From the looks of your name, only people with
disabilities can join. Doesn't make your club sound very inclusive, does
it.

Your club isn't about **disabilities**. Your club is about **sailing**.
Your name should reflect that reality, not create additional boxes where
none are necessary.
