So let's explain quickly a little bit about the EDSS --- the Expanded
Disability Status Scale. It is a scale from 0 (No disability) to 10
(Death from MS) in 0.5 unit increments, and defines the level of
disability. The scores of 0 through 4.5 describe people who can walk
without any aid and it describes their impairment across eight different
functional systems:

- pyramidal -- muscle weakness or difficulty moving limbs
- cerebellar -- ataxia, loss of balance, coordination or tremor
- brainstem -- problems with speech, swallowing and nystagmus
- sensory -- numbness or loss of sensations
- bowel and bladder function
- visual function - problems with sight
- cerebral functions - problems with thinking and memory
- other

Scores between 5 and 9.5 are all characterized by varying degrees to
which walking is affected. The scale is often criticized because of its
reliance on walking in these scores.

All that is to say that by the time you reach EDSS score of 9, you are
essentially bedridden.

So how many people, on average, will be diagnosed at an EDSS score of 9?
One longitudinal study estimated that by 15 years post MS diagnosis,
there is an approximately 40% probability of a patient with MS needing
some type of walking aid and a 25% probability of them needing a
wheelchair.[\[1\]](#wYYgv){#cite-wYYgv .citation_link} Fewer than 5% of
people who are diagnosed with MS will develop an EDSS score greater than
8.5. Very few people progress rapidly. The mean EDSS change over 10
years was 1 point, and only 20% of patients had a change larger than 2.0
points.

The best predictor of later disease activity is early disease activity
and time between relapses. Basically, the better you do early on will
predict how well you will do later in life. From the most recent
extensions to the Olmsted County MS [[cohort
studies](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=e190b1&url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/cohort-analysis){.external_link

onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="sciencedirect.com"}]{.qlink_container} conducted by the Mayo
group, we can see that the time to disability is not influenced by
ongoing relapses once patients achieve an apparently permanent degree of
moderate disability (EDSS 3.5). Overall, 80% patients who are still
classified as RRMS into their second decade of disease continue to do
well for 15 to 20 years with limited permanent disability. Patients
doing extremely well (EDSS â‰¤ 2.0) after 10 years of MS generally do well
in the next decade. However, very rarely patients doing well even for 2
to 3 decades may develop severe late disability.

None of this is to say that there are any guarantees when it comes to
MS. If you have MS, get on one of the approved MS therapy drugs and do
regular monitoring with your healthcare team.
