**What air force base dorms give you your own kitchen and bathroom?**

Older ones.

The Air Force, for the past 20 years or so, has been moving towards the
"1+1" model of dorm, where there is a living area with bedrooms on
either end of the unit, and a shared kitchen and bathroom in the middle.

So it is only older dorms where you have your own (albeit smaller)
kitchenette and bathroom.

If you insist on your own kitchen and bathroom and your base only offers
1+1 units, you should look at renting an apartment off-base.
