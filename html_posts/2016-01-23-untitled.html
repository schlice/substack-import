**Content:** [You want a deal that allows Iran to enrich uranium for
legal purposes, like generating power? OK, the deal is: enrich uranium.
We get 100% unfettered access to any site in Iran (military or civilian)
with no advanced notice. The trade embargo stays for five years, if
there are no violations of the use of the uranium in five years, some
limited trade may be allowed. Any refusal to allow inspectors into a
site is a violation and the sanctions remain in place.\
\
I don\'t like the deal because, like I said, the distance between
enriched uranium and a nuclear weapon is very short and easy to reach.
However, if you insist on allowing Iran to enrich uranium, this is a
start.]{.rendered_qtext}
