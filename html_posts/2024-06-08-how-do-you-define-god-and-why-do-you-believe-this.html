I define God as "The transcendent, immaterial, eternal, supremely
powerful, and intelligent cause of the universe."

I believe that because logically-speaking, this definition is required
in order to meet our scientific understanding of the universe, its
beginning, and its creation.

I'll go through these for you:

- **Immaterial** and **transcendent:** Whether you believe God exists or
  not, He is, by definition, *immaterial* and *transcendent*. He is
  *immaterial* because He is not composed of physical matter, not made
  of material stuff like you and me.
  - It is necessary for Him to be *immaterial* because He created
    matter, so He must be outside of it. He cannot be comprised of the
    matter He created, or He would have to exist before He existed, and
    there would also have to be a "before" He existed, meaning He is
    subject to time. But we know that is not true, because time was also
    created at the beginning of the universe.
  - God is *transcendent* because He exists beyond space. It is
    necessary to exist beyond space in order to create space, for the
    same reasons that He needs to be immaterial when He created matter.
- **Eternal:** It is necessary for God to be *eternal* in order for Him
  to be the "First Cause." This is due to the Law of Causality, which
  states that everything which has a beginning has a cause. It's very
  important that we get this right. Some atheists try to refute this
  premise by responding, "But if everything that exists has a cause, and
  God exists, then what caused God?" But the premise does not claim,
  "Everything that *exists* has a cause." It says, "Everything that
  *begins to exist* has a cause." Since God, by definition, and whether
  you believe in Him or not, is eternal and never began to exist, this
  does not apply to Him. Therefore, logically, God must have ***no
  cause***. So even if you did ask the question "What caused God?" the
  answer would be **nothing** and it would be logically and inductively
  accurate. Because if everything which has a beginning has a cause,
  then everything which does not have a beginning does not have a cause.
  God is the great "uncaused cause."
- **Powerful** and **Intelligent**: If this "necessary creator" has
  created something so massively complex as the universe, it must be
  tremendously powerful and intelligent.
