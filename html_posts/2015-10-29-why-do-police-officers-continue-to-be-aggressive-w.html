**Content:** [The presence or absence of a camera doesn\'t change the
situation being faced by the officer, his/her response to that
situation, and more importantly, a camera doesn\'t make anyone any
safer.\
\
The camera\'s only purpose is to document what actually happened to use
in legal proceedings later on.\
\
So in actuality, the camera ***shouldn\'t*** change behavior. Good
officers (which most are) will continue to be good, and bad officers
will be weeded out that much faster. Departments will not be able to
conceal bad officers for long.\
\
Which is the way most officers want it.]{.rendered_qtext}
