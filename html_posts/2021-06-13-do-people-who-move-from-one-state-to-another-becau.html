I don\'t know what "people\" do, I only know what "I\" do. And my
primary factor in deciding which state to which I was going to uproot
and transplant my family *began* with comparing the political climate of
the state I was leaving, and the state to which I was going.

I had lived in Colorado voluntarily for about 20 years. Other than the
enclaves of Socialism centered around the college towns (i.e. the
People's Republic of Boulder or Ft. Collins), Colorado was a pretty red
state. Governor Bill Owens made sure of it. Then it started to turn
purple, but Colorado Springs was still reliably Conservative, with
multiple military installations within its purview including facilities
like NORAD and the Air Force Academy. But that didn't stop Colorado's
slide towards Progressivism, and with the election of John Hickenlooper
and the subsequent election of Jared Polis (the first openly gay
governor in the US\*) as governors, the state had fully turned blue. We
saw the policies changing, and we wanted no part of it. The policies
they were changing were going to harm the state for decades to come. We
saw it with Hickenlooper's creation of the first ever fully-fleshed out
marijuana marketplace and universal background checks (which studies
have shown have about a 5% compliance rate, even the state sheriffs
won't enforce it), and with Polis openly supporting suppression of
freedom of religious expression with the Masterpiece Cake shop fiasco
(he may have lost that one, but the writing was on the wall: you will
publicly accept our agenda and deny your own religion or we will cancel
you) and his furthering of Hickenlooper's open drug policies by
decriminalizing virtually all drugs in Denver. Watching the state change
like that was disheartening at best and downright dangerous to our
freedoms at worst. We knew we had to get out. We just weren't sure
exactly where to go. We sold our house and moved into an apartment until
we could decide where to land.

When we were deciding where to live, we narrowed it down to region (and
we settled on the Southeast), and we considered several states there.
But ultimately, it was the political climate in Florida which drew us
here. Governor DeSantis has the courage to do the right thing in the
face of intense media and Democratic pressure, so by the end of 2019, we
had sold our house in Colorado and relocated our entire family to
central Florida.

Sorry not sorry, Colorado. We vote with our feet.

\*Let me be clear. The fact that Polis is gay is just fine. But that
fact signals the type of Progressive policies he is going to endorse,
and we were not wrong about that. He doubled down on those policies, and
in our view, the state has suffered for it.
