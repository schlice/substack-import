**If one wanted to be a U.S. military officer in an aviation-related
field, would the United States Air Force Academy be the best service
academy to go to?**

Yes, and not just because USAFA is the best service academy (I may be a
little biased in that opinion, though).

If you want to go into aviation, *you have the best opportunity of
achieving that goal by going to the Air Force Academy because the Air
Force has more pilot opportunities than any of the other service
academies.*

Don't get me wrong, this doesn't mean you can't become a Naval Aviator
after attending Annapolis, or that you can't go in to Aviation after
attending West Point, or that you can't (eventually) get into Aviation
after attending the US Coast Guard Academy, because you absolutely can.

But if you're looking for the service academy which will give you the
best chance of becoming an officer in an aviation-related field, there's
no better service than the one *dedicated as a primary mission to
aviation*.
