*So let's lay the groundwork out first.*

*You are asking whether or not it is* ***ethical*** *to* ***force***
*vaccinations on everyone. That is the question I will be answering. Not
whether or not* ***mandates*** *are* **the right thing to do** *or
whether or not* **it is good for you/others/the country/the medical
system/the planet/Mother Earth/our future** *or anything else. Clog up
my comments section with nonsense and I'll turn them off. I don't have
time for your debates, pro-vaxx, anti-vaxx, whatever. Leave your
commentary about anything besides ethics to yourself.*

*Also, this is not about me; I have no dog in this fight. I have MS and
my drugs cause me to be immunocompromised, so I am fully vaccinated by
choice. I'll probably also get a booster.*

*\<stepping off of soapbox\>*

\

Let's define terms for everyone. It is necessary to do this because it
appears that in most of these answers, people are confusing morals,
ethics, and societal goods.

**Ethics** are the set of principles and the rules of conduct defined by
society at large. In contrast, **morals** are internal principles of
right and wrong. Ethics are defined as they are because "society" says
that it's the right thing to do. Morals are defined as they are because
you personally believe that something is either right or wrong.

Ethics can vary by situation, but the **foundation** upon which you
build your ethical rules must be similar, or your ethics are useless.
Ethics are **objective**: rational, clear-cut, and impartial. In
opposition, morals are, basically, **subjective**. They are up to you,
personally, to define. They are not the same throughout a group in
society.[\[1\]](#qyWpU){#cite-qyWpU .citation_link}

One more definition in terms: **forced vaccination**. This is where we
round you up, tie you to a bed, and inject you with a vaccine, against
your will. This is different from **mandated vaccination**, where we
make it functionally impossible to exercise your right to participate in
modern society without being vaccinated.

Okay, let's get to the question.

**From a PURELY ETHICAL point of view, it is UNETHICAL to force
vaccination of the entire population.**

To determine this, we must look at similar situations in society and
find the ethical foundations of those decisions so that we can apply a
consistent standard. Normally, we look to the Supreme Court as the
ethical arbiter for us. We can't always do that, but in most cases, we
can.

You cannot apply *Jacobson v. Massachusetts* to the current debate, as
*Jacobson* discussed whether or not a state can mandate a vaccine using
its police powers (and the Court said it can). There is no concomitant
Federal police authority over the entire US population. Therefore, we
will look at the *abortion* standard, as it is the only applicable
federal standard when it comes to the question at hand.

Far from being unrelated, ethically-speaking, the foundation of the
abortion debate is what we call **bodily autonomy**, or who gets to
determine what happens to my body. The US Supreme Court has decided in
*Griswold v. Connecticut* that a right to privacy exists in the
Constitution, and in *Roe v. Wade*, that the principle of the right to
privacy extends to the human body, such that a woman's right to an
abortion cannot be infringed by the government, as it is an intrusion on
the aforementioned right to privacy within one's body.

Therefore, If it's okay for a woman to say that her bodily autonomy is
preeminent (and therefore, by extension, **everyone's bodily autonomy is
preeminent**), and it takes precedence over the life within her
(regardless of its stage of development), then it's okay for *me* to say
that *my* bodily autonomy is preeminent*,* and it takes precedence over
the lives around me. Ethically, you can't have one without the other, or
you are **ethically inconsistent.** While your ethics can vary from
situation to situation, the foundations underpinning your ethics must
remain consistent, objective, rational, clear-cut, and impartial.

*But*, you may say, *your decision to remain unvaccinated affects me!*
To which I reply: You are vaccinated, are you not? Then what I do is
completely independent of what you do. You are protected from both the
vaccinated and the unvaccinated. My decision to not vaccinate does not
harm you. The only people who should fear the unvaccinated are the
unvaccinated. But more importantly, my right to bodily autonomy is not
impacted by your desires or needs.

*But*, you may say, *you can harbor the virus and create mutations!* To
which I reply: So can you. The vaccinated can still contract COVID-19,
which also means they can create mutations. Granted, the possibility
that they could is slimmer, but it is not zero. And to force
vaccinations on a population to prevent a hypothetical variant from
happening in one person is also ethically inconsistent. My bodily
autonomy is not defined by a hypothetical possibility of creating a
viral mutation.

*But,* you may say, *you'll clog up* ***my*** *emergency room!* To which
I say, Fine! Charge me more for my emergency room stay! Hire more
doctors! Make bigger emergency departments, and fund it on the backs of
the unvaccinated! But denying me care due to a choice I am legally
allowed to make is a slippery slope we definitely don't want to begin
sliding down. My bodily autonomy is not defined by your emergency room's
capacity.

Therefore, it is **100% unethical,** by the bodily autonomy standard,
**to** ***force*** **people to be vaccinated.**

\

That is *not* to say that it is unethical to *mandate* vaccination.

There is a difference between **forcing** vaccination and **mandating**
vaccination.

- **Forced vaccination** is where we round you up, handcuff you, chain
  you to a bed, and inject you with a vaccine, against your will.
- **Mandated vaccination** is where we set rules in society such that if
  you want to participate in any activity outside of your home, you must
  be vaccinated. You basically can't leave your house unless you are
  going to the hospital to be vaccinated; otherwise, you cannot
  participate in society.

While it is entirely unethical to **force** vaccinations, it can be
ethical to **mandate** vaccinations.

If the situation were *so dire* that normal society could not function
without a vaccine mandate, then yes, mandated vaccinations could indeed
be a thing.

**But we don't actually have that situation today, do we. If we're
honest with ourselves, we really don't.**

In the US, we have near-total vaccine availability (which means you can
protect yourself if you choose). The vaccines are free-to-you, so cost
at the vaccination center is not an issue. We have social distancing. We
have masks which you are free to wear to help protect yourself against
the virus in the air. And while the *infection rate* is still somewhat
higher than I'd like to see it, the *death rate* from COVID-19 has been
precipitously falling, and continues to fall every single day. We have
*effective treatments* for COVID-19 infection, thanks to the Herculean
efforts of doctors and medical staffs across the country, and we have
cut down the time of active infection from *weeks* to *days.*

So do we *really need* a vaccine mandate? Certainly not, at this stage
of the game.

Your ability to protect yourself is high, your risk of contracting
COVID-19 is low, and the risk of a bad outcome (unless you are in a
known risk group) is *vanishingly* low.

And *none of this* even begins to discuss what happens to those who have
already been infected with COVID-19 and have recovered. Study after
study worldwide have proven and re-proven that previous COVID-19
infection provides durable, long-lasting immunity from re-infection.
Therefore, the choice for someone who has already had COVID-19 should be
even more scrupulously weighed.

All of this taken together **does not equate to the necessity for a
vaccine mandate.**

But that's beside the point. We weren't talking about a *mandate*, we
were talking about the ethics of forcing vaccination, which is
completely unethical by society's own standards.

Original question:

From a purely ethical point of view, would it be right to force the
vaccine on everyone (except those with relevant medical conditions)?
Hypothetically, what would the result be? (assuming there won\'t be a
slippery slope into a totalitarian dystopia)

*This is a contentious and emotionally-charged topic. I have taken the
(unusual for me) step of leaving comments open.*

*Some people like to comment. Some people like to engage with me in a
civil manner. But do not misunderstand, I take this step very
cautiously, and I have no tolerance for harassing or inane behavior.*

*If you don\'t like what I wrote, tough shit. If my answer is
grammatically low-quality or is un-cited opinion masquerading as fact,
downvote it. If you think I\'m wrong, write your own answer. But Quora
is a question-and-answer site, not a debate site. If you are simply
commenting to tell me \"ackshually, you\'re wrong,\" don\'t be surprised
if I quietly delete your comment. Put anything vaguely harassing in
there, and your deletion will be followed by a block/mute, and a BNBR
report. I will do this immediately and with no compunction. You have
been warned. Be nice.*
