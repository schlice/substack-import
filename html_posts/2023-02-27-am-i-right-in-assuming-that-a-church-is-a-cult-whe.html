title: "Am I right in assuming that a church is a cult when they claim that a person needs to be baptised in their church to be saved? I assume they say this because they said that they study what the Bible says instead of relying on theological views."

Britannica Dictionary definition of **cult:**

1.  a small religious group that is not part of a larger and more
    accepted religion and that has beliefs regarded by many people as
    extreme or dangerous.

I'm pretty sure that a particular church misunderstanding some of the
passages surrounding the necessity of water baptism does not make them a
cult. They're simply a Christian church who has adopted a flawed
understanding of the Bible. That makes them a *sect*, not a *cult*.

*This is not unique* among Christian churches. We have many sects which
develop over time. In fact, some have just developed in the last few
years. Christian churches which believe in women pastors or homosexual
or transsexual pastors or endorsing gay marriage by marrying gays are
examples of *sects* in the church. They have "traditional beliefs and
practices" but have deviated from the core teachings of the church. The
United Methodist Church has begun the process of splitting off into a
new sect because they have altered some of their core beliefs about the
teachings of the religion.
