**Content:** [In Massachusetts, the standard for probable cause in a
domestic assault scenario is the same as in any other crime.
Uncorroborated statements by a victim can constitute probable cause that
the crime occurred.\
\
The decision to arrest must be based on whether probable cause exists
that the crime occurred, not on whether the victim wishes to seek
complaints or wishes to testify at a future date.\
\
It is important for officers to determine who is the dominant aggressor.
The dominant aggressor is not who struck first, but who has a pattern of
domination and control.\
\
Officers will arrest anyone who has violated an emergency, temporary, or
permanent vacate, refrain from abuse, stay away or no-contact order, a
suspension and surrender order, or protection order issued by any
jurisdiction. If none of those exist, arrest shall be preferred whenever
officers witness or have probable cause to believe that a person has
committed a felony or has committed a misdemeanor involving abuse under
Massachusetts law, or has committed assault and battery on the elderly
or disabled.\
\
Officers are discouraged from performing dual arrests. Officers should
try to identify the dominant aggressor, and take action based on that
determination. They next should look for offensive vs defensive
injuries. Barring that, or if there really were two aggressors (no one
was acting in self-defense), the officer should determine who is the
dominant aggressor, and then take action based on the totality of the
circumstances, including\
