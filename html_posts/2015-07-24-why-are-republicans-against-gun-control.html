**Content:** [[[Jeff

spot on, and the assumption in your question is quite offensive.\
\
Republicans are not against gun control. Republicans are against passing
more laws which will do nothing other than restrict the rights of
law-abiding gun owners (of which it is estimated there are over
100,000,000 in the US) when doing nothing to stop actual criminals from
acquiring guns.\
\
There are sensible laws that we can pass, and sensible things we can do.
Primarily, we can start cutting down on the places from which a criminal
can get a gun:\
]{.rendered_qtext}

- Colorado recently required that all private transactions of firearms
  must be reviewed by a FFL (a dealer with a Federal Firearms License)
  so that the buyer can be vetted to ensure he meets Federal
  requirements to buy a gun, and the seller meets Federal requirements
  to sell a gun. It doesn\'t add much time to the process, and it
  certainly doesn\'t add much cost to the process. Plenty of local FFLs
  provide the background certificate, so it\'s not a huge inconvenience,
  and it ensures that transfers between private parties are tracked. I
  would love to see that system expanded.\
- I will still continue to assert that technology has advanced to a
  point where we can start requiring some sensible in-home secure
  storage requirements for firearms, reducing theft of legally-owned
  firearms.
- The government, for its part, needs to start cracking down on illicit
  FFLs who facilitate illegal sales. The ATF is woefully inadequate for
  the task, in both funding and manpower. Many FFLs go up to ten years
  between audits, and when 1% of FFLs sell guns that end up in over 60%
  of guns found at crime scenes and traced to dealers, it seems a fairly
  easy issue to tackle. But they are so behind on inspections that
  they\'ll never be able to catch up, and they very rarely revoke FFLs
  even when the dealer is found to be in violation. ATF really needs to
  clean house.\

Now, I know my gun-rights colleagues will counter that this barely puts
a dent in the flow of illegal guns; indeed, it actually increases the
popularity and the business in the black market (which is anyone who
doesn\'t follow the law, as well as illegal importers of guns and
strawman purchasers). But let\'s start with the low-hanging fruit.
Sensible storage requirements can help to curtail in-home accidental
shootings and thefts of privately-owned guns. It\'s certainly not the
largest source for guns used illegally, but it\'s a start. Enforcing the
laws we already have (looking at you, ATF) is another way we can start
to make inroads into the illegal transit of weapons.\
\
But silly laws like limiting magazine capacity or restrictions on scary
colors or scary attachments do nothing at all to stop criminals.
Republicans are wholly against laws like those. Limiting magazines to
reasonable sizes (which can be determined by croudsourcing: look at the
most popular magazine sizes in sales, and you\'ll find your answer) is
appropriate. Drum magazines should not be sold (and no one would use
them anyway as they are prone to jamming \-- just ask James Holmes).
Existing restrictions on military weapons should remain. Not
military-looking weapons, military weapons like automatic weapons and
anti-personnel weapons (grenades, mines, etc).
