**What are the odds that Donald Trump gets impeached for collusion with
Russia in the near future?**

Somewhere between slim and none.

The whole Russia collusion distraction isn't enough for Republicans to
impeach. You'd have to show something that actually rises to the level
of "high crimes and misdemeanors" while in office before Republicans
would even think about impeachment.

If Congress wants to do something useful, it can define a crime and
write a law. It can make collusion a crime. Until then, there isn't
enough to sway Republicans to vote for impeachment.

And even if they DO impeach him, do you think they will be able to get
67 Senators to vote to convict? I don't know. We'll have to see what the
party lines look like if an impeachment actually does go forward to the
Senate.
