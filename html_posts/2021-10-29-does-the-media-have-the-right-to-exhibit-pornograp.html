This depends on the medium across which the pornography is to be
broadcast. The medium provides the access controls to ensure that minors
do not gain access to the material, be it in print or on subscription TV
services.

These access controls are put in place by the particular industry, and
usually overseen by a government watchdog body like the FCC in the
United States.
