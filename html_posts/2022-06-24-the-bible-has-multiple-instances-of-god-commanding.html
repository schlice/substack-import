There's a big difference between killing and murder: *justification*.

First, part of the problem is that the King James Bible mistranslated
the word *ratsach* as "kill" instead of "murder," so that translation of
the 6th Commandment says, "Thou shalt not kill."

However, the word *ratsach* almost universally means intentional killing
without cause. The correct translation of this word is "murder," and all
modern translations of the Bible list the 6th Commandment as "You shall
not murder."

Murder is "the premeditated, unlawful taking of a life," where killing
is just "the taking of a life."

In order for God to *murder*, he would have to take life without
justification. But God is the author of justice. "His works are perfect,
and all His ways are just. A faithful God who does no wrong, upright and
just is He" (Deuteronomy 32:4; see also Psalm 11:7; 90:9). In other
words, *everything he does is,* ***de facto****, just.* This includes
the taking of the life *he created*. He created the life, he can take
the life.

Some people argue that executing the innocent is murder, so when God
wipes out whole cities, or when God killed the entire population of the
earth in the Flood, He is committing murder. However, nowhere in
Scripture can we find where God killed "innocent" people. In fact,
compared to God's holiness, there is no such thing as an "innocent"
person. All have sinned (Romans 3:23), and the penalty for sin is death
(Romans 6:23a). God has *complete and total justification to literally
obliterate every one of us where we stand.* He would be completely
justified to wipe us all out. The fact that he doesn't is proof of his
*mercy*. At the Flood, He was completely justified in killing everyone
on earth, because *He had already judged them*:

> "Then the LORD saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth,
> and that every intent of the thoughts of his heart was only evil
> continually" (Genesis 6:5).

That baby you're killing with abortion, was it judged and found lacking?
Was it given due process before receiving a death sentence? No? You do
realize that killing without justification is murder, right? We said
that just a minute ago.

**This** is why God cares about abortion. It's not killing according to
*His* will, but according to *our* will. And it's not justified in any
way.

Original question:

The Bible has multiple instances of God commanding children, infants,
and pregnant women to be killed. There\'s also instances where God kills
children, infants, and pregnant women directly. Why would he care about
abortions based on this?
