This list contains, arguably, the most comprehensive list of police
officers convicted of murder.

So it seems that your question is, on its face, wrong. The police do get
held accountable for murder, rape assault, or any other crime they
commit.

I would argue that officers you feel "got away with" some crime actually
didn't "get away" with a crime. They were either not charged with a
crime because the evidence didn't support such a charge, or a jury found
that they were not guilty.
