<h2>Answer Comment</h2>

**Content:** [I think you\'re right that eventually there will be legal
challenges to all video, and the departments will have to show the chain
of custody and prove the video was not edited. But the solutions in
place help to maintain that chain of custody and to maintain the
sanctity of the actual video.\
\
Dash-mounted video only goes so far, and yes, we can require our law
enforcement professionals to wear a video camera, both for their
protection and for the suspect\'s. That way, there is a complete video
recording of the entire proceeding being made, and the officer can
reference the video to help him when writing his reports. I think it\'s
a great tool, but I want others\' opinions who have far more experience
than I. Why would a police union say that most officers out there don\'t
want video on their persons?]{.rendered_qtext}
