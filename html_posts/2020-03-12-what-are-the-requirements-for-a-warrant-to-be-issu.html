**What are the requirements for a warrant to be issued under the Fourth
Amendment?**

The 4th Amendment states (emphasis mine):

> The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers,
> and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be
> violated, and **no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause,
> supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the
> place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.**

Therefore, the requirements for a warrant under the 4th Amendment:

- Probable cause
- Someone swearing an oath that the warrant is being genuinely issued to
  investigate and/or prosecute a crime
- A detailed description of the place to be searched and the persons or
  things to be seized.

**EDIT:** Quora Content Review keeps changing the question to "What are
the requirements for a warrant to be issued by the Fourth Amendment?"
regardless of how many times I try to fix it. I should answer the
question as written so that my answer does not get flagged for not
answering the question. The answer to the question as written is that
the Fourth Amendment does not issue warrants. The Fourth Amendment does
not grant any powers for anyone to issue warrants, which is why the
wording of the question is wrong. So if you were the original author and
you thought the Fourth Amendment gave warrant power, you are mistaken.
The Fourth Amendment defines the conditions under which warrants must be
issued in order to safeguard rights.
