**Do home security systems deter criminals better than firearms? Or are
they different solutions to different problems?**

Different solutions to different problems.

Home security systems make your home less attractive to burglars. If a
burglar is comparing two houses, and one has a security system, he'll
choose to break into the house without the security system. It simply is
one of several steps you can take to make your house less attractive to
burglars than your neighbor's house. As we've said before, you don't
have to make your house a fortress; you only have to make your house
less attractive to attack than your neighbor's house.

Firearms are not a deterrent to criminals, so they definitely are
addressing a different problem. The problem that firearms addresses is
the one that causes you to die as a victim inside your home from home
invaders who seek to kill you. Firearms do not make your home less
attractive to criminals who wish to break into a home (there's nothing
on the outside of your home that advertises that you're armed). Firearms
are your last line of defense when someone breaks into your home and
intends to harm you.
