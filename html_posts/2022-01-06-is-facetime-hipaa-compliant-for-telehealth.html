There are many components which go into whether or not a telehealth
session, in general, is HIPAA-compliant. Just conducting the session on
FaceTime does not make the entire session HIPAA-compliant or not.

But looking at FaceTime, in isolation, one can see that it can be used
in a telehealth setting and provide a HIPAA-compliant experience.

FaceTime is peer-to-peer, uses end-to-end encryption, and Apple does not
store any FaceTime sessions on their servers, nor do they have the
ability to decrypt live FaceTime sessions. With this information in
mind, we can say that FaceTime is a HIPAA-compliant video chat solution,
when employed with all of the other HIPAA safeguards that a clinician
and a patient would normally employ. Doctors must still protect Personal
Information as they normally would, and only provide it in accordance
with pre-determined sharing agreements, just as a face-to-face
appointment would work. Transitioning a traditional, fully
HIPAA-compliant doctor-patient relationship to a virtual one by
inserting FaceTime would allow the relationship to continue to be
HIPAA-compliant.
