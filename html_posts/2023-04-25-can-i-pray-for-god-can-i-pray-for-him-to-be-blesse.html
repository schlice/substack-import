You could, but who would be granting that prayer? To whom would you be
praying? And why would you think that God did not have these things? He
is all-powerful, eternal and omnipotent. He lacks nothing; he already
has everything. So you could pray for these things, but it doesn't make
much sense.

I don't mean to be a Negative Nell here, but if the prayers you prayed
for yourself were unanswered, what makes you think that the prayers you
pray for others will be answered? It doesn't make any sense to me.

Personally, it sounds like you're praying incorrectly. It sounds like
you're thinking of God like a vending machine. You put the prayers in
the little coin slot and you expect the answered prayers to come out of
the door at the bottom. But for some reason, God isn't giving you what
you're asking for.

So there's a number of reasons why you may not be receiving answers to
your prayers

- What you are asking for will eventually harm you
- What you are asking for is not part of God's good plan for you
- God may be answering you, but in a way you didn't expect.

First, it could be that what you are asking for will eventually harm
you. You may not see it now, but God does. He knows your entire future,
and along with the next bullet, He has a plan for you.

> "For I know the plans I have for you," declares the Lord, "plans to
> prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future."
> --- Jeremiah 29:11 NIV

Along with that, it could be that what you are asking for is not part of
His plan for you. We also know that God doesn't frequently tell us His
plans for us.

Finally, it may be that God is answering your prayer, but not in a way
that you expect.

> *I asked for strength,\
> And God gave me difficulties to make me strong;*
>
> *I asked for wisdom,\
> And God gave me problems to learn to solve;*
>
> *I asked for prosperity,\
> And God gave me brain and brawn to work;*
>
> *I asked for courage,\
> And God gave me dangers to overcome;*
>
> *I asked for love,\
> And God gave me people to help;*
>
> *I asked for favors,\
> And God gave me opportunities.*
>
> *I received nothing I wanted -- I received everything I needed.\
> My prayer has been answered!*

So you may not be receiving anything you asked for, but you may be
receiving everything you needed.

The bottom line is that God's good plan will be enacted in your life. So
perhaps instead of asking God for things, ask God to let you in on His
plan for you, because life goes so much smoother when you work *with*
God rather than working *against* Him. Ask him for wisdom to see His
plan for you in your life, and ask Him to bless you with the knowledge
that He will prosper you, and the comfort of knowing that He will keep
His promises.

If you still want to ask for something in specific, ask that He do
something *if it is part of His plan for us.* But tell Him that you
understand that His will will be done regardless, so if He doesn't give
you what you're asking for, it's because what you are asking for is not
part of His plan.
