**Content:** [There isn\'t a direct cause-effect relationship like you
suggest. There are lots of reasons that airlines started to tack on
additional fees, but the bottom line is that the airline industry has
one of the thinnest profit margins of any industry (on average, the
airlines make around \$4/passenger/flight), and any time there is a
change in the economy, it affects the airlines noticeably.\
\
Seeing the changing landscape of the airline industry, and seeing
\"low-cost\" or \"budget\" airlines becoming more popular (Southwest
Airlines was the only airline able to stay in the black following 9/11),
the big carriers had to do something to adjust to the changing landscape
of travel.\
\
For example, United tried to form its own \"value\" brand, \"Ted,\" in
order to compete directly with low-cost airlines, in 2004. It was
actually the spike in fuel prices that caused Ted to cease operations
after only five years (2009). Following the cessation of Ted\'s
operations, the airline started investigating moving the fee-for-service
model from on-board meals and expanding it into other areas of the
travel experience. The most visible is the baggage fee. But other fees
include the ability to move into an Economy Plus seat (individual seats
priced based on popularity), use the Premier check-in lane, or buy
travel insurance. This allows people to customize their travel
experience based on what they are willing to pay.\
\
I think that the fee-based system will probably keep. I expect soon, you
will be able to purchase an upgrade to another seat type on the plane,
using the same system they use for on-board meals. As on-board data
services expand, expect to see those services available with fees as
well.]{.rendered_qtext}
