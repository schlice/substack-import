**What are the limits for joining the armed forces as a felon? I will be
honest and have a felony for 3rd degree felony. I cleaned up my act and
finished probation. I want to serve my country, educate myself for free
and serve with my brothers in arms.**

Thanks for your question.

The military has "character standards" for their enlistees. The reason
for these standards is not prudishness or elitism. It's because people
who do not have prior criminal records are less of a risk for becoming
trouble (i.e. disruptive) while serving, or becoming security risks.

To that end, people with prior felonies will need a waiver. The waiver
process will show that the enlistee has successfully risen above his
prior circumstance and has been trouble-free for a certain period of
time.

This is what the military has to say about character standards for
enlistment:

> Persons entering the Armed Forces should be of good moral character.
> The underlying purpose of moral character enlistment standards is to
> minimize entrance of persons who are likely to become disciplinary
> cases or security risks or who disrupt good order, morale, and
> discipline. Moral standards of acceptability for service are designed
> to disqualify the following kinds of persons:
>
> - Individuals under any form of judicial restraint (bond, probation,
>   imprisonment, or parole).
> - Those with significant criminal records.
> - Persons convicted of felonies
>   - Persons with felonies may request a waiver to permit their
>     enlistment. The waiver procedure is not automatic, and approval is
>     based on each individual case. One of the considerations in
>     determining whether a waiver will be granted is the individual\'s
>     ability to adjust successfully to civilian life for a period of
>     time following his or her release from judicial control.
>   - In processing waiver requests, the Military Services shall require
>     information about the \"who, what, when, where, and why\" of the
>     offense in question, and a number of letters of recommendation
>     attesting to the applicant\'s character or suitability for
>     enlistment. Such letters must be from responsible community
>     leaders such as school officials, ministers, and law enforcement
>     officials.
> - Those who have been previously separated from the Military Services
>   under conditions other than honorable or for the good of the
>   Service.
> - Those who have exhibited antisocial behavior or other traits of
>   character that would render them unfit to associate with military
>   personnel.[\[1\]](#XPsyD){#cite-XPsyD .citation_link}

So you mentioned that your probation is over; the military will want to
see that you have successfully adjusted to civilian life *after* your
probation, so if you've been 6 months off of probation and are holding
down a job and handling yourself well, you're more likely to get a
waiver approved than if you just came off of probation last week.

Work with your recruiter to see if you can get a felony waiver. There is
no penalty for talking about your past with your recruiter, and the more
honest you are about your past, the more likely a recruiter will process
a waiver for you. And even if your recruiter puts in a waiver, MEPS will
want to review the case before they take you, so be prepared for lots of
scrutiny into your past and what you did.

Also remember that waivers are purely subjective. For example, if you
were convicted on a burglary charge, and the Colonel at MEPS reviewing
your case just had his house broken into last month, do you think he
will approve your waiver?

Finally, each service is different; if one service will not waiver you,
try another. So have a top preference for service, and then a second and
third preference. You may want Air Force first, and then Navy, and then
Army. If Air Force won't give you a waiver, go talk to the Navy
recruiter.

Good luck!
