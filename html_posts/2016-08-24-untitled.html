*Who determines that validity of that \'reason\'? Who sets the
guideline? Who delivers equally reasonably defined punishment when that
\'reason\' is defied?*

The courts determine what the "reasonable man" would do in a similar
situation.

*Who and more importantly when is it determined when that \'reason\' is
shown problematic ?*

If the people find that the courts are upholding a "reasonable man"
opinion that does not meet with their version, the people go to the
legislature to write a law directing the court to act in a specific
manner when prosecuting a specific crime.

This is how the government is supposed to work. Whether or not it
actually does in practice is another story completely.

*What happens when it is revealed to citizens that Police\' convictions
for that \'reason\' don\'t align with Society\'s depiction or
designation of Police\' duty?*

Citizens go to local government who oversees the police and makes them
re-define how the police operate. The police work for the city, the city
works for the people. You need a majority of the people to convince the
city that there is an issue.

If the city still does not agree, you replace the city government with
one that is favorable to your point of view.
