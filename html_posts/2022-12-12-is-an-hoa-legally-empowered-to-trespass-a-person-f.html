The answer is "it depends."

If there is a scenario in the Governing Documents in which a homeowner
can be forcibly removed from the subdivision, then the HOA could call
the police and "trespass" that homeowner.

Otherwise, no, the homeowner is a homeowner, and has rights.

Now, can the HOA trespass a person from ***the clubhouse***? That's a
little more likely. Many Governing Documents disallow homeowners using
shared facilities when they are delinquent on their HOA dues payments.

But I fail to see how an HOA can trespass a person from the subdivision
when they actually own a residence there.

Ultimately, the answer will be found in your Governing Documents, but
I'd rate that claim as highly unlikely.
