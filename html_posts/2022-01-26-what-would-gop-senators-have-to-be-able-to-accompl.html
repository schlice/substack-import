They can basically kill any nominee Biden sends in.

Here's how you do it:

In a deal brokered by McConnell and Schumer, the Senate Judiciary
Committee was effectively split in half: 11 Republicans and 11
Democrats. In order for a nominee to go to the full Senate for a
nomination hearing, the Judiciary Committee must pass them on.

If all 11 Republicans vote no to pass on the nominee (and considering
the Presidential aspirations of roughly half of those Republicans, this
seems likely), the nomination goes *inert*. It doesn't die, but it
doesn't leave Committee unless a lawmaker (usually the Leader of the
party) brings it to the floor for four hours of debate.

A simple majority can put the nomination on the calendar for the next
day. But that action next day wouldn't be a nomination hearing. It would
be a motion to discharge, a *cloture* motion which requires 60 votes. In
other words, 10 Republicans would need to vote to resurrect the
nomination hearing for a candidate who was *effectively rejected* by the
Judiciary Committee, and that's unlikely to happen.

So that's how it's done: the Senate simply kills the nominations of
anyone Biden sends up.
