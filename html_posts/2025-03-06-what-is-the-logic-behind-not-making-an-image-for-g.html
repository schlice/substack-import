So as we know, God is *spirit*. He does not have a body. He does not
have an image.

If we create an image for God (such as the most common image: the old
man with the long flowing white hair), we tend to think of God in *human
form.*

And when we think of God as a *human*, we think of God with **human
limitations**.

So the danger with thinking of God based on an image we create is that,
even in our minds, we tend to ***limit*** God. We ***constrain*** Him to
the image we created.

Thinking of God with any limits at all does a disservice to our
understanding of Him. God is limitless. He is omnipotent and
omnipresent, two qualities which are uniquely unsuited to thinking of
Him in any form we can imagine.
