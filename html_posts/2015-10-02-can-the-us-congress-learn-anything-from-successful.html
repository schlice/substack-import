**Content:** [The only thing \"successful\" about the gun laws passed by
Australia and the UK is that they reduced private gun ownership.\
\
They did ***nothing*** to change the rate of gun homicides. They did
***nothing*** to change the rate of homicides in general.\

\
Here, you can see the rate of gun homicide continued unchanged through
the Australian gun ban. You can also see the \"total homicide\" rate
continued unchanged for at least five years following the ban. So
effectively, the ban had no impact.\

You can see here that around the time of the ban (which is at the first
I in suicide) that again, there was no change to the trend of gun
suicides, which was already on the decline. The rate of non-gun
suicides, however, did climb.\

\
As you can see here, the rate of homicides in England and Wales
continued on its upward trend, despite the handgun ban.\
\
The only thing Congress can learn from these statistics is \"gun bans
don\'t stop homicides.\"\
\
Not to mention, there\'s that pesky Second Amendment that prevents them
from enacting a gun ban anyway.
