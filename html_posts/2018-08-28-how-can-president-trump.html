**How can President Trump\'s new proposal to limit legal immigrants from
becoming US citizens pass Congress or the Supreme Court?**

First of all, a rule change that the Executive makes to an Executive
program does not get reviewed by Congress. Congress is certainly free to
change the law that the Executive is implementing, and the President is
certainly free to veto the change to the law if he chooses.

In order for the Supreme Court to "review" a rule change (presumably on
Constitutional grounds), someone has to be affected by the rule change
and file a lawsuit which would have to be appealed to the Supreme Court.

I assume that you're asking about the expansion to the "public charge"
portion of immigration policy.

Previously, only the use of certain programs like Social Security
Insurance (SSI) have hindered immigrants from obtaining permanent
resident status. The new proposal would expand that list of programs to
include Obamacare, children\'s health insurance, food stamps and more
government benefit services.

From your link (emphasis mine):

It is the section I bolded above which will be changing. Instead of just
the receipt of public cash assistance or "institutionalization for
long-term care at government expense" (which is SSI), this list of
government services considered will be expanded.

Remember: the whole point of this exercise is to determine whether or
not someone will become a "public charge," or "primarily dependent on
the government for subsistence." Since our list of government
subsistence programs is ever-expanding, it only makes sense to expand
the list of government programs we use to determine whether or not
someone will be primarily dependent on the government for subsistence.
