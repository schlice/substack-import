They're confused by conditional forgiveness followers.

So first, let's make sure we understand what we're addressing. Here's
the verse in question:

> *If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our
> sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. \-- 1 John 1:9 ESV*

When we discuss conditional forgiveness, this verse is the one
discussed. Why? *It's the only one which talks about conditional
forgiveness*.

And that fact is important as we move forward in this discussion of
conditional forgiveness.

The main point: **the doctrine of conditional forgiveness is
incompatible with the entire New Testament message, as well as the words
of Jesus.** In fact, a great deal of the issue with the doctrine of
conditional sin is the interpretation of the Bible.

When you find a Bible verse which is apparently in contradiction with
other verses in the Bible, you must stop and consider that you
misunderstand at least one of the verses. In other words, it's not that
the verses contradict each other, it's that our *understanding* of the
verses contradict.

So let's "zoom out" and see what the remainder of 1 John says about this
subject:

> *But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have
> fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus his Son*
> ***cleanses us from all sin****. \-- 1 John 1:7 ESV*
>
> *I am writing to you, little children, because* ***your sins are
> forgiven*** *for his name's sake. \-- 1 John 2:12 ESV*

Do these passages lead us to believe that Jesus' sacrificial work on the
cross cleanses us from *some sin*, or from *all sin*? I think the Bible
is wholly clear: Jesus' work on the cross cleanses us from **all** sin,
not just sin we confess.

So why the confusion? Perhaps the passage was directed at those who were
not saved. Perhaps he was addressing those who needed to come to faith
in Jesus, not those who already had. That said though, there's no
denying that *everyone* needs Jesus to atone for our sins.

Regardless, it's clear that Jesus' sacrifice cleanses us from ***all***
sin.

Think about it. When we stand before the judgement seat, the Accuser
will be there speaking against us. What will happen when the Accuser
says, "Well, here's an example of a sin for which he did not repent!"
What will the Advocate (Jesus) say?

> *But if anyone does sin, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus
> Christ the righteous. \-- 1 John 2:1 ESV*

Will the Advocate say, "Oh yeah, I guess he didn't confess that sin, My
Grace doesn't cover that one"? ***NO!*** He will say, "My blood paid for
that sin." The Bible says "if anyone sins, we have an Advocate." It does
not say, "if anyone sins *and confesses that sin*, we have an Advocate."
All sin is covered. The Bible is exceedingly clear that there's no
prerequisite to your sin being covered.
