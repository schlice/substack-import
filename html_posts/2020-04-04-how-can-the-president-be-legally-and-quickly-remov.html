**How can the President be legally and quickly removed from office
before tens of thousands more die from his leadership failures?
Political pressure? Public demonstrations? 25th Amendment? Or something
else?**

What exactly are you basing your *prediction* of "tens of thousands more
deaths" specifically caused by "leadership failures?"

Are you referring to the novel coronavirus known as COVID-19?

Because *predictions* of death are just that --- predictions.
Predictions based on **modeling** data, not *settled science*.

Don't get mesmerized by the numbers that are presented to you daily in
the doom-and-gloom show on TV. Those models are all merely predictions.
Yes, they are using numbers to try to predict what might happen.

Let me take a wild stab here at what you're trying to say. I bet you're
saying that Trump is going to re-open the economy and it's going to
cause more people to die. Is that right?

Well then, I guess I'm the guy who has to drop the truth bombs on you.
Duck and cover, here it comes.

- There is literally nothing we can do to stop the healthcare system
  from being overrun.
- People are going to get sick. People are going to die.
- No amount of governmental intervention is going to stop that.

Ouch, that hurt, didn't it?

So why then are we closing the economy? We're doing it because the
*models* say that if we include social distancing, we can reduce the
number of deaths by ***50 times***. That's pretty good. It's certainly
better than the 2.2 million projected dead if we did nothing. So we do
it for a short time.

But what is the result of that? We are looking at what is an "essential
business," and we are thus telling people that their work is either
essential, or it is not. We are literally pointing at two people and
saying, "your work is essential, but yours is not." You can go to work,
but you cannot. You can earn money for your family, but you cannot.

The point: **this isn't a debate about lives versus money. This is a
debate about lives versus lives.** We are literally destroying the
fabric of what makes the world economy tick, and for what? A small
fraction of the amount of people who die anyway? As of yesterday, we had
100 jobs lost for every one death. Think about that. 100 people are no
longer able to afford the house they live in, able to afford to buy food
for their kids, because one person out of that 100 died. We are
irrevocably altering the lives of 100 people because one died. Does that
sound like a proportional response?

Now, don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that we shouldn't have done
anything. We did. It had positive effects.

But people want ***HOPE***. People want to know that this is going to
***END*** sometime soon. Is there a light at the end of the tunnel?
Currently, no one is offering any.

So I agree with you, the President isn't doing is full job yet. He's not
offering any ***HOPE***.

But can you "get him out of office?" Nope. Not at all. Not without an
assassin\'s bullet. The way to get him out of office is to not re-elect
him in November, period. That's how our Constitution is designed. We
don't have "votes of no-confidence" like they have in Parliamentary
systems; we don't need them. We vote for President every four years. If
you don't like how the President has handled this pandemic, look to
change in November.

(EDIT: A note to USSS who no doubt will hear about and then subsequently
read this answer: I am in no way suggesting that we should assassinate
the President. I merely said that such was the only way that he would be
"removed" from office before the end of his natural term.)
