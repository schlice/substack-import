I absolutely agree with you. Those people who say that life begins at
birth literally look at one of the two only people who were never born
and somehow equate that to the rest of humanity which comes into
existence in a totally different way.

Think about it. Adam was a Claymation character who God breathed on and
he came alive. Eve was built from one of Adam's ribs by God. Neither one
of them were "born." So trying to equate how Adam and Eve came into
existence with how the rest of us came into existence doesn't work. It's
like saying that a stick-built house is only livable once it is
completed because pre-fab houses aren't livable until they are placed on
the lot.

In order to determine when "life" begins, we first need to look at what
is the definition of "life" as it relates to humans who were born, not
humans who were not.

\

But I posit that determining when life begins isn't a valuable piece of
knowledge. The reason: ***we don't know*** *what about a person makes
them* ***alive****.*

Think about it in terms we see all the time: rather than the beginning
of life, let's look at the ***end*** of life: the moment a live person
becomes not alive. If you have two people side by side, and one is alive
and one just died, what's different about them? Don't they contain the
same chemicals in their bodies? Is one somehow structurally different
than the other? Why is one body alive while the other is not? We can see
***signs*** of life, like heartbeats, breathing, and brain activity, but
those are just ***signs*** which point to a ***reason*** we are alive.
We know the signs, but we don't know the reason.

\

Rather than focus on "when does life begin," I'd like to instead look at
something else: ***the right to life***.

We posit instead that **the unborn have an equal right to life as the
rest of humanity,** ***specifically because they are human.*** And we
can use **what we already know** about life to determine this.

To illustrate what I mean, let's imagine a large hall, like a conference
center or a theater. In it, let's place everyone that you and I
intuitively know have a right to life. This would, naturally, include
every person who has been born, right? From the youngest preemie to the
elderly, to people in comas and people with disabilities. All of them,
intuitively (meaning we just know, no one has to tell us) belong in the
room.

But what about that person in the coma? Do they have a right to life? I
mean, they're unconscious. They're not aware of the world around them.
Do they still have a right to life? I think intuitively, you would say
yes, they do. So consciousness is not what gives us an equal right to
life.

But what about squirrels? Do squirrels have an equal right to life with
people? I mean, I'm absolutely against animal cruelty, and I'd never
intentionally harm a squirrel, but *do they have the same right to life
that we have?* Intuitively, you'd have to say no, they don't. You might
say that this is because squirrels are not *self-aware*; in other words,
they don't know that they are an individual and they aren't aware of
their own existence. But if you exclude squirrels because they aren't
self-aware (aware of the world around them), you'd have to exclude
newborns for the same reason, and perhaps some people with disabilities.
So that can't be right either.

So now that we've fleshed out who belongs in the room, why do they all
belong there? *What is it about all of them which gives them an equal
right to life?* It can't be that they are conscious, because we've shown
that even the unconscious still have a right to life. It can't be that
they're self-aware, or you'd have to exclude newborns as well. **The
only criteria which fits what we all intuitively know gives us an equal
right to life is that we are all** ***human*.** It is our humanity which
gives us an equal right to life. Because we are all human (members of
the species *Homo Sapiens*), we have an intrinsic, equal right to life.

And accordingly, if you apply the same logic to the unborn, you will see
that they too are, unequivocally, human. The unborn are completely
unique, living human beings, who came from two human parents. There is
no doubt that they are indeed fully human.

It is at this point that most pro-choice advocates try to "move the
goalposts" so to speak and introduce more qualifications to the right to
life to try to make it fit their desires. For instance, they may say,
"No, you have to be human *and* conscious" or "you have to be human
*and* self-aware" or "you have to be human *and* be viable outside the
womb" in order to have an equal right to life. The X in "human and X"
usually refers to some functional ability. This is a logical fallacy
known as the *ad hoc fallacy* or the "human *and"* fallacy. When someone
is being *ad hoc*, they're engineering arguments and facts to match a
conclusion they decided in advance. *Ad hoc* arguments are designed to
reach a conclusion even if the best evidence doesn't lead to it. It's
important to note, though, that people are often *ad hoc*
unintentionally, so they can think they're being open-minded but
inadvertently make this mistake.

So in order to see if we really truly need the "human *and* X" criteria,
you'd have to ask yourself two questions:

- How did you come to the conclusion that functional ability X should be
  added to human nature when explaining who has personhood?
- What does your functional ability X offer to make "human *and* X"
  better than just "human?"

And when you analyze those answers, you find that the addition of the
"and X" to the argument is clearly just to exclude the unborn. Whatever
the "X" is, the X alone doesn't explain the right to life, because the X
alone either excludes some born humans, or adds more rights to life for
things like squirrels. And the "human and X" doesn't provide anything
more scientifically accurate than "just human" other than to just
exclude the unborn. If I wanted to argue in favor of abortion, and I
decided that personhood was a result of "something like human nature
PLUS being not a fetus," that would be *ad hoc*, and I think most people
would agree with that. I just added something for no purpose other than
getting the answer I wanted in the first place!

\

So let's circle back to complete this answer. In summary:

- Using the creation of Adam to describe the beginning of life in the
  womb is silly, since Adam was never in the womb.
- We have a hard time defining when life begins, because we don't know
  what about a person makes them alive.
- We're better off talking about our right to life rather than when life
  begins.
