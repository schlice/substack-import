**Content:** [San Francisco to Los Angeles: 380 mi\
Los Angeles to New York: 2464 mi\
New York to London: 3016 mi\
\
A Gulfstream G650 (G6 for short) has a long distance cruising speed of
Mach 0.85 (about 562 mph), and a normal cruising speed of Mach 0.9
(about 595 mph). Using those numbers:\
\
SF to LA: about 25-30 minutes.\
LA to NY: about 4 hours and 10 minutes\
NY to London: 5 hours and 50 minutes\
\
Range on a G6 is between 6,000 and 7,000 miles depending on speed. Using
the normal cruise setting, the aircraft has a 6,000 mile range, so no
fuel stops are needed.]{.rendered_qtext}
