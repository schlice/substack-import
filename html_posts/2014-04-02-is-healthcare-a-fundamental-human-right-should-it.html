**Content:** [We\'ve answered this in other similarly-worded questions,
but the answer is the same:\
\
**Free** ***access*** **to healthcare is a basic human right; access to
free** ***healthcare*** **is not.**\
\
If you can wrap your head around that statement, you can begin to
understand the problem we face. Everyone has the right to ***access***
healthcare. Everyone does **not** have the right to ***free***
healthcare, because healthcare is not free. You may believe that it
should be, but it is not. Healthcare costs money. It costs money to
train doctors for many years with specialized training and skills before
patients can be diagnosed. It costs money to protect doctors from
lawsuits; a single malpractice lawsuit could cost a doctor millions of
dollars in punitive damages, so insurance costs for doctors are very
high, and that cost is passed on to patients. Creating safe, germ-free
hospitals is not free. And doctors, who have received this specialized
training and are licensed to practice it, can charge accordingly for
their services, just as any other highly skilled professional.
Ultimately, ***someone*** must pay for these services.\
\
You have to accept that healthcare costs money. You have to accept that
doctors can charge money for their services. And you also must accept
that public funds simply cannot cover the costs of **all** healthcare
for **all** people.\
\
In the United States, this country was founded on freedom. The
government was set up in such a way as to allow everyone the equal
opportunity to achieve whatever they chose to achieve. It was not set up
to provide for any more than just the basic needs: sanitation, safety
services (police, fire), power, water, etc. All other needs and wants
were left to the people. We should definitely add healthcare into that
list, but to what extent should public money be used to cover
healthcare?\
\
The answer is fairly simple; accepting the answer is not. We need to
separate our healthcare system into a public system for basic healthcare
needs and a private system for more advanced healthcare needs. We should
provide basic healthcare using public money, and advanced healthcare
using money from individuals/employers/insurance companies. But if
healthcare is a for-profit business, how do we get doctors to
participate in the public healthcare system? Subsidy. Subsidize doctors
as they attend medical school. Once they are done, they are required to
serve in a neighborhood healthcare clinic for a period of time before
moving to private practice if they choose. Some may choose to stay in
the public clinic, some may not.\
\
The difference is that the public neighborhood clinics only provide
basic healthcare services to taxpayers at no additional cost. Advanced
healthcare must still be paid for by the individual, their employer,
and/or insurance companies, not by taxpayers.]{.rendered_qtext}
