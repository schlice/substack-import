<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [We\'ve answered this in other similarly-worded questions,<br>but the answer is the same:\<br>\<br>Free *access* **to healthcare is a basic human right; access to<br>free *healthcare* is not.**\<br>\<br>If you can wrap your head around that statement, you can begin to<br>understand the problem we face. Everyone has the right to *access*<br>healthcare. Everyone does not have the right to *free*<br>healthcare, because healthcare is not free. You may believe that it<br>should be, but it is not. Healthcare costs money. It costs money to<br>train doctors for many years with specialized training and skills before<br>patients can be diagnosed. It costs money to protect doctors from<br>lawsuits; a single malpractice lawsuit could cost a doctor millions of<br>dollars in punitive damages, so insurance costs for doctors are very<br>high, and that cost is passed on to patients. Creating safe, germ-free<br>hospitals is not free. And doctors, who have received this specialized<br>training and are licensed to practice it, can charge accordingly for<br>their services, just as any other highly skilled professional.<br>Ultimately, *someone* must pay for these services.\<br>\<br>You have to accept that healthcare costs money. You have to accept that<br>doctors can charge money for their services. And you also must accept<br>that public funds simply cannot cover the costs of all healthcare<br>for all people.\<br>\<br>In the United States, this country was founded on freedom. The<br>government was set up in such a way as to allow everyone the equal<br>opportunity to achieve whatever they chose to achieve. It was not set up<br>to provide for any more than just the basic needs: sanitation, safety<br>services (police, fire), power, water, etc. All other needs and wants<br>were left to the people. We should definitely add healthcare into that<br>list, but to what extent should public money be used to cover<br>healthcare?\<br>\<br>The answer is fairly simple; accepting the answer is not. We need to<br>separate our healthcare system into a public system for basic healthcare<br>needs and a private system for more advanced healthcare needs. We should<br>provide basic healthcare using public money, and advanced healthcare<br>using money from individuals/employers/insurance companies. But if<br>healthcare is a for-profit business, how do we get doctors to<br>participate in the public healthcare system? Subsidy. Subsidize doctors<br>as they attend medical school. Once they are done, they are required to<br>serve in a neighborhood healthcare clinic for a period of time before<br>moving to private practice if they choose. Some may choose to stay in<br>the public clinic, some may not.\<br>\<br>The difference is that the public neighborhood clinics only provide<br>basic healthcare services to taxpayers at no additional cost. Advanced<br>healthcare must still be paid for by the individual, their employer,<br>and/or insurance companies, not by taxpayers.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
