**Will Republicans pass the resolution from the House to stop the
Emergency Declaration to build the border wall?**

No. House Republicans will not vote for the resolution. But House
Democrats will, and they have enough for a simple majority.

However, in order to actually potentially have any effect, the National
Emergencies Act says that you need a **joint resolution** meaning that
both the House and the Senate must pass it.

The Senate will not pass it.

And even if they somehow did, the President can still veto it. Which
means that in order to cancel the national emergency, Congress would
need a 2/3 majority in both houses. They don't have a 2/3 majority in
either house.

So it simply doesn't matter. There's no way Congress can stop this.
Anything the House does is symbolic.
