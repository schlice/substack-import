No, I'm disappointed that we couldn't deport this specific alleged
criminal alien. I'm not disappointed in the ruling.

For reference, the case we are discussing is *Sessions v. Dimaya,* for
which SCOTUS rendered a decision on April 17, 2018.

Conservatives are thrilled that we have a strict constructionist on the
bench. Gorsuch sided with the liberals today because they're right. The
wording in the previous court's ruling regarding what constitutes a
"violent felony" was unconstitutionally vague and was thrown out. So was
this. The court is, remarkably, consistent.

As a conservative, I want Congress to do its job and write good laws.
The sad fact is that when Congress writes poor laws, no one benefits,
and yes, criminals end up remaining in country because we can't
correctly deport them. Clearly, we want criminal aliens deported. But in
order to protect everyone, our laws must be iron-clad.

Gorsuch did not vote on party lines; instead, he actually comported
himself as a *jurist*, which is more than I can say for half the court.
The Constitution should come before the wishes of the majority of the
political party with whom you identify.
