The answer is yes, but it's not quite so simple.

There is currently a battle raging between the Biden administration and
Congress.

Following the overturn of *Roe v. Wade*, Biden crafted an Executive
Order which directed the Department of Health and Human Services to
ensure that abortifacient drugs are available to anyone who wants them.
HHS, in turn, sent guidance to 60,000 pharmacies nationwide, warning
their employees of harsh "corrective action" against anyone who refuses
to comply. The guidelines say, for instance, that if a pharmacist
refuses to fill an order for mifepristone or misoprostol "because these
medications can also be used to terminate a pregnancy --- the pharmacy
may be discriminating on the basis of sex." HHS adds that pharmacies
could open themselves up to legal action if they sell any kind of birth
control, such as condoms, but refuse to dispense the morning-after pill
or other forms of so-called "emergency contraception."

It's interesting to note that the *Dobbs* ruling stated very clearly
that abortifacient drugs, and abortion itself, is not sex
discrimination, and the Court has found this result many times over.
Just because it only applies to women doesn't make it discrimination
based on sex.

While legally dubious (but when has the administration cared about being
legally accurate), the Biden administration directive implies that
pro-life pharmacists may not be safe from government-instigated legal
actions, ***even though federal law formally protects conscience
rights***. Although the document notes the same office implements the
Church Amendments, which protect pro-life medical employees from having
to take part in an abortion if it violates their "religious beliefs or
moral convictions," it says the law will be evaluated "on a case-by-case
basis."

Congress, for its part, vociferously disagrees with HHS' stance. "You
can pass all the legislation you want. You can sign every executive
order that you want to sign. But if you think you're going to force a
pharmacist to go against their moral obligation to take care of
patients, to take care of babies, and dispense a prescription that's
going to be used for abortion: Good luck with that," Rep. Buddy Carter
(R-Ga.) vowed defiantly on the House floor.

"This is simply ludicrous and an obvious overreach," Carter, who served
as a pharmacist and co-chairs the Congressional Community Pharmacy
Caucus, said in a
[[statement](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=9102b2&url=https://tonyperkins.com/){.external_link

So Biden and HHS is basically telling pharmacists that they can follow
their conscience, but it will be legally costly, because HHS will be
pursuing legal "corrective action" which the pharmacist will have to
defend. Federal law protects the pharmacist, but that clearly won't stop
HHS from pursuing legal action against pharmacists.
