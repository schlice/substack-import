I was on Copaxone for 7 years. It worked great, until it didn't. It just
quit working, and I got new lesions and new symptoms. It was severe
enough that it was time to change.

I used Tysabri for 18 months. This medicine worked better than any other
medicine I've ever been on. It worked so well, that some of my lesions
actually started to ***shrink*** while I was on it. Downside: it is
metabolized by the liver, like my depression medication was (I was on
Wellbutrin XL and Cymbalta at the time). Tysabri is taken monthly, by
infusion. So over the course of the month, as the level of Tysabri
changed its quantity in my bloodstream, my liver needed time to catch up
to the change, which caused over- or under-metabolization of my
Wellbutrin and Cymbalta, which negatively affected my mood and
depression. My mood was a roller coaster every month. Apparently, I was
a bear to live with.

I got off of Tysabri and moved to Gilenya (the first drug I used that I
didn't have to stick myself to use) and so far, it's been okay. I'm no
fan of the side effects, but it seems to be keeping the MS under
control, and you can't argue with success.
