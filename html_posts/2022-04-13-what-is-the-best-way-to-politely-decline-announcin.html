Just decline.

When asked why, simply explain that you're not offended by anyone
misgendering you, so participating in this "pronoun identification"
exercise would be disrespectful to the people who *do* take offense at
being misgendered.

Declaring my pronouns when I don't require it, am not offended by it,
and match the gender I appear to be, minimizes the experience for those
who actually care. In other words, me, declaring my pronouns, would
actually be offensive.
