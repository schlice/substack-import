**If a 47-year-old man that has multiple sclerosis, and smokes marijuana
everyday several times a day and night while on several MS medications
be a part of the reason that his symptoms are getting worse?**

Medical cannabis is not a disease modifying drug. It does not slow down
the progression of the disease, and it does not reduce the severity,
duration, or frequency of MS relapses.

What medical cannabis **does** do for MS patients is reduce neurological
pain better than any prescription pain medicine on the market. For those
MS patients who struggle with neurological pain (i.e. pain caused by
faulty nerves, not by any physical condition), cannabis can be extremely
helpful without all of the toxic side effects of today's high-test pain
medicines like Oxycontin.

I do question what "several MS medications" means. I assume it means a
disease modifying drug and other meds to counter side effects, but I'm
just taking a guess.

If I were the physician, I'd focus on the particular disease modifying
drug, as it's fairly clear that it is not working. It would be time to
take a different tack.

I would tell this 47-year old man that he should talk to his neurologist
about changing his disease modifying drug to something else, as this one
doesn't seem to be working.
