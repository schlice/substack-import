**Content:** [*To start with, abortion is a highly-emotionally charged
issue and I don\'t want to get into my personal views about abortion.*
***My answer here is not an indication of my personal views about
abortion.*** *If you want to know my personal views about abortion (and
then take days to rip them apart and call me all kinds of names), ask
that question and then A2A me.*\
\
Anti-abortionists think it\'s wrong to terminate a pregancy caused by
rape because they believe that the source of the pregnancy is
irrelevant. They believe:\
]{.rendered_qtext}

- Life begins at conception
- Terminating a pregnancy is tantamount to murder
- No one has the right to murder an unborn baby.

They also believe that the agony of nine months of pregnancy pale in
comparison to the years of emotional trauma that can be inflicted on a
woman by an abortion. They can cite numerous studies that show that
abortion psychologically harms the mother, and the abortionists who
profit from abortions willfully cover up that fact. They believe that
profit is the goal over the health of the mother (to include emotional
and psychological health) and the government and the abortion lobby are
complicit in that profit goal.\
