**Content:** [In most cases, you would not be able to use characters
from copyrighted video games for commercial use.\

You would have to license the rights to use those characters from the
respective copyright holders.\

There are some \"fair uses\" that you can use without licensing, but
none of them are for-profit commercial uses.\

Contact the copyright holder to get permission to use the
