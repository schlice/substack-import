**Is it reasonable to call 911 over someone threatening suicide?**

Not only is it reasonable, it is strongly encouraged.

If you know of someone who has made a ***credible*** threat of suicide,
you should *immediately* call 911.

In fact, I would hate to think of how your life would progress had you
equivocated on that call, and the person *carried out* their threat.

Please encourage the person to contact one of the numbers in the "There
is help" box on this page, and if you truly believe the person intends
to harm themselves, please, please call 911 right away.
