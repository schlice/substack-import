**When will Samsung Galaxy S6 phones in UAE receive oreo update?**

It's unlikely that any Galaxy S6 will be updated to Oreo. It was
released with Lollipop, and only recently received an upgrade to Nougat.
It got two full OS upgrades, which is about all you can expect from the
S6 hardware. It's pretty much at the limit of what the hardware will
accomplish, and it's pretty dog slow with Nougat on it.

If you want Oreo, you have two choices:

1.  Root the device and install an open-source Android build which is
    based off of Oreo, such as
    [[LineageOS](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=395593&url=https://lineageos.org/){.external_link

2.  Buy a new device.
