How *should* they react? They should react in the same way that they all
usually do react: First-come, first-served. Possession is 9/10ths. And
any other pithy quote which says *the people in their seats are the ones
who get to fly.* Using check-in times to determine who gets seats
doesn't work, because you can check in 24 hours before you arrive.
You're not even headed to the airport 24 hours before you arrive! If you
make it to the airport and there are still seats available, you get one.
Easy peesey.

How they do react is different for every airline.

For the record, I think overbooking is a terrible practice in the first
place. Intentionally selling more tickets than you have seats because
*statistically* a certain percentage of people buy tickets and never
show is a bad practice, because sometimes they *do* all show. For the
airline, they guarantee themselves that they will always run the plane
at capacity. They also almost always inconvenience some travelers.
Granted, they are the travelers who got to the airport last, but what if
they had car trouble? What if they got caught in traffic? Now they are
doubly inconvenienced! And why would you oversell a plane during
holidays? Or during Spring Break? People are trying to travel on Spring
Break! That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard. But it happened to me
on Spring Break. I got bumped, which means my family gets bumped. Spent
all day in the flippin' airport, eventually made it there a full day
later.

You've already bought the ticket; if you don't show, who cares? Don't
try to make an extra buck by selling the same seat, because you
inconvenience actual customers because of statistics.

I understand why they do it (because they can). And I understand that
dealing with inconvenienced passengers has simply become the norm in the
industry. I don't have to like it.
