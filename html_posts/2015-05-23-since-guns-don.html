commented that \"Guns that are not locked up kill people.\" I replied
and told her \"I sat down with my gun that wasn\'t locked up and I gave
it a stern talking-to about going out and killing people. It promised me
it wouldn\'t. So far, so good.\"\
\
She replied, \"And of course no troubled people could ever remember your
gun is out and take it. Oh wait. That happens everyday.\"\
\
Then she turned off commenting on her answers and disallowed followers.
I guess this is a tactic to make your point and silence the opposing
view.\
\
I don\'t appreciate that, and I believe that it is disingenuous to start
a discussion and then shut it down.\
\
So I\'ll move the discussion to my own answer. And I promise I won\'t
disallow commenting.\
\
There is a fundamental difference between \"Guns that are not locked up
kill people\" and \"A troubled person takes a gun and kills someone.\"
In the first statement, \"Guns that are not locked up kill people\", the
prepositional phrase is \"that are not locked up\". Remove the
prepositional phrase and you see the subject, the verb, and the
predicate: guns kill people. So in the first sentence, the subject is
the gun. In the second sentence, following the logic, the subject is the
troubled person. She got it right the second time: the troubled person
is the one we need to focus on, not the gun.\
\
People only focus on guns because guns are purpose-built to kill. That
doesn\'t make the gun \"bad\", it just means that its primary purpose is
to kill. And it does so more efficiently than any other tool which can
be used to kill. And there are many of them. Cars can kill. Baseball
bats can kill. Knives can kill (and were actually originally designed to
kill). But these other tools have different primary purposes than
killing. You wouldn\'t think of banning cars because some people drink
and drive. Because some people kill irresponsibly using a car, you would
never think to ban cars, because they are just too useful. But because
some people use guns irresponsibly, you might think banning guns is
okay, because their only purpose is to kill.\
\
But killing is justified in certain situations. Self-defense and
fighting tyranny are two situations which are natural-law rights of
people. So if killing is justfied in certain circumstances, why can I
not use the most efficient tool to do it?\
\
The vast majority of US citizens owns and uses guns responsibly. And
when limiting a Constitutional right, you must do so in the least
restrictive way that still accomplishes your goal. Many schemes to ban
guns fail because they are not the least restrictive to legal gun
owners, and they don\'t actually accomplish their stated
goal.]{.rendered_qtext}
