(EDIT) I see that I was not clear enough in answering the question. The
question is basically asking "how is it 'promoting racism' by blaming
both sides?"

The first clue comes from AP themselves, who are editorializing instead
of reporting (whoa, big surprise there). The quote says that Trump is
"...appearing to once again equate the actions of white supremacist
groups and those protesting them."

This is where the media gets their "racism" claim. Because Trump says
that there is blame on both sides, and refused to call out the white
supremacists over the ANTIFA and BLM crowds, Trump is actually
"promoting racism" because he has equated what the white supremacists do
with what the ANTIFA and BLM groups do.

Now, in order to believe this, you have to believe that ANTIFA and BLM
had ***absolutely no agenda*** other than to protest white supremacy.
They were nothing more than innocent protesters. They don't belong to
any **hate groups** themselves, right? They were just bystanders,
expressing their First Amendment right to protest, when they were
*viciously attacked* by those haters, those KKK-loving, neo-Nazi white
supremacist bastards! Isn't that the story they want you to hear?

So when Trump says, "there's blame on both sides," he has essentially
said, in their view, that ANTIFA and BLM have the same quality and
character as white supremacists. Oh, the indignity! This cannot stand!
The media goes apoplectic and that little vein in their forehead pops
out while they write their headline.

Why? They *love* what ANTIFA and BLM stand for, and they *hate* what
white supremacists stand for.

So they are engaging in the very same value judgement by judging these
groups and assigning a value to them, when Trump is merely talking about
their **conduct**, not their character. The media then makes the leap
that based on your **character**, you should not have as much of a right
to speak as some other group, that your speech should be restricted.
They therefore believe that ANTIFA and BLM are "right," and the white
supremacists are "wrong," and if the President doesn't hold the white
supremacists to blame 100% for the whole thing, he's actually promoting
what they stand for, when he did nothing of the sort. He later came out
and denounced the white supremacist group for what they believe, but he
still holds to his opinion that their conduct, on both sides, was wrong.

The treatment of Trump in the media is a wholesale repudiation of the
First Amendment, and it is shameful.

Regardless of what you think of the character of any of these groups,
they have the right to speak. The conduct of both of these groups was
reprehensible. But they all have the right to speak.
