**What do you honestly think about President Trump\'s handpicked
Attorney General Barr plans to only release a REDACTED version of the
Mueller\'s report? I don\'t like it!**

You don't have to like it, but he is following the law.

A recent court challenge reaffirmed that grand jury testimony must
remain protected, so that information (which is included in the report)
cannot be released.

So now you're in a quandry. You'd like to see the whole report, but
there's information in it that would be *illegal* to release.

Also, Mueller referred some matters to other agencies to address. For
example, some tax evasion he found at state levels were referred to
those states to prosecute. If that information were to be released, it
would ruin the state's opportunity to get justice on behalf of their
residents. Is that fair to them?

So while you may not like that you don't have the opportunity to see the
full report, there are certain matters of law which even Congress is
required to follow.

But you're thinking, "But...but...that HANDPICKED Barr guy! He's going
to redact anything that makes Trump look bad!"

If that was the case, why isn't Mueller out there saying exactly that?
He may be a registered Republican, but he was appointed to government
positions by both Bushes, Clinton, and Obama. He should be out there
telling the truth! "This summary mis-characterizes my report! Trump
needs to go to jail, and Barr isn't doing it!"

Except...that's not exactly what's happening, is it. Why? Is Mueller
scared of Congress? Doubtful. He's a Marine. He's the former director of
the FBI. I don't think he's scared of much.

Maybe it's because, oh, I dunno, the summary is actually an accurate
summary of Mueller's findings?

That's more likely, isn't it.
