**Can you lose your job for not cooperating with a police
investigation?**

Short answer: yes.

Longer answer: As with all legal questions, the answer is "it depends."
And what it depends on is whether you are **being accused of a crime**
or simply **being questioned as a witness in a crime.**

**Being accused as a participant in a crime**. In this scenario, you
have been detained by the police, and they want to question you. You
assert your right to remain silent until you have had the chance to talk
to your lawyer. You will eventually get a lawyer and your lawyer will
either advise you to answer the question, or to assert your rights under
the 5th Amendment and not answer because your answer may incriminate
you.

However, what you must understand here was quoted by Cicero's maxim:
"Though silence is not necessarily an admission, it is not a denial,
either." Remember, only the government is enjoined from using your
testimony against you (or in this case, your lack of testimony). Your
employer can cite the whole sordid affair and simply choose to fire you
because they don't want to be involved in your potential lawlessness.
Most employment in the United States is "at will" employment, and an
employer can fire you for pretty much whatever reason they choose,
unless it violates a civil right (in other words, you can't be fired
because of your sex, race, national origin, disability status, or
religion)

**Being questioned as a witness in a crime**. In this scenario, you
haven't been detained; you've simply been asked to come down to the
police station and give a statement regarding something else. If you're
not being detained, you're not under any obligation to cooperate with
the police, and they can't compel you to give a statement or "cooperate"
at all.

While it might be difficult for your employer to find out whether or not
you were questioned, it's not impossible, especially if the incident
about which your cooperation was requested involved your employer. For
example, let's say that computers were being stolen from your employer,
and your friend and co-worker was being accused of the crime. The police
want to question you about it, not because they believe you did it, but
because they know you are a friend of the accused. You certainly can
choose to not cooperate with them, and that information could make it
back to your employer. And yes, they can fire you simply because they
don't like the fact that you could be protecting a thief. Again, in most
cases, your employer can fire you for nearly any reason they choose, so
long as it is not an unlawful reason. Protecting the integrity of their
business is certainly a viable reason to terminate someone's employment.

It's also important to understand that the 5th Amendment only protects
you in a *criminal* case. If it's a *civil* case, in many cases they may
be allowed to draw an "adverse inference" from your refusal to testify,
which means that they are allowed to make the connection that because
you refused to testify, you may be protecting information that
implicates you. Remember too that the "court of public opinion"
generally views pleading the 5th as a tacit admission of guilt,
regardless of what the court can or cannot do. If how you are perceived
in society is important to you, then it may not be advantageous to plead
the 5th.
