**Content:** [The only time you could be held accountable is if you were
statutorily required to do something, for example, if you were
accountable to the public as a sworn law enforcement officer or a
district attorney. Other than that, you cannot be criminally responsible
for failing to act when witnessing a crime.\
\
Civilly though, I could see that there could potentially be some
recompense if the situation were made worse by your failure to act,
although it would definitely be a stretch to prove, and it would also be
very hard to overcome the fact that under the law you are not required
to act if it is not your job to do so.\

EDIT: [[Dan

answer made me think. There are statutes that state that if you
willfully obstruct an investigation you could be charged as an accessory
after the fact. However, I have a hard time believing you would be
prosecuted under such a statute not because you were willfully
attempting to obstruct justice, but simply because you failed to act. If
you could show that you had no knowledge of the actor or the crime
(other than what was witnessed) and you had nothing to gain by
obstructing justice, and you were not willfully impeding an
investigation or a prosecution, I think that accessory after the fact
would be a stretch.\
