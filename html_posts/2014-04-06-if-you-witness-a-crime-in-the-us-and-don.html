<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [The only time you could be held accountable is if you were<br>statutorily required to do something, for example, if you were<br>accountable to the public as a sworn law enforcement officer or a<br>district attorney. Other than that, you cannot be criminally responsible<br>for failing to act when witnessing a crime.\<br>\<br>Civilly though, I could see that there could potentially be some<br>recompense if the situation were made worse by your failure to act,<br>although it would definitely be a stretch to prove, and it would also be<br>very hard to overcome the fact that under the law you are not required<br>to act if it is not your job to do so.\<br>\<br>EDIT: [[Dan<br>Robb](https://www.quora.com/profile/Dan-Robb-2)]{.qlink_container}\'s<br>answer made me think. There are statutes that state that if you<br>willfully obstruct an investigation you could be charged as an accessory<br>after the fact. However, I have a hard time believing you would be<br>prosecuted under such a statute not because you were willfully<br>attempting to obstruct justice, but simply because you failed to act. If<br>you could show that you had no knowledge of the actor or the crime<br>(other than what was witnessed) and you had nothing to gain by<br>obstructing justice, and you were not willfully impeding an<br>investigation or a prosecution, I think that accessory after the fact<br>would be a stretch.\<br>\<br>\<br>\<br>*WARNING: This answer is not a substitute for professional legal advice,<br>nor is it a solicitation to offer legal advice.
