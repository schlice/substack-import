**Do you think that the Republicans will sign on with the Democrats'
police reform bill that will ban no-knock warrants, chokeholds and
unnecessary deadly or excessive force? Why or why not?**

Some may, but most will not.

Why? As usual, the bill starts off great (actually, with a few things
Republicans have been calling for as well). But then, as with most high
profile Democrat-initiated bills, it quickly goes off the rails and they
include everything they've ever wanted for the past hundred or so years.

Let's review some of the proposed changes which are directly related to
the current issue:

- Reforming "qualified immunity." I have been calling for this for some
  time now, and it's a good first step at holding officers accountable
  for their actions. Qualified immunity needs to be either seriously
  reformed, or scrapped altogether. This would not remove Constitutional
  protections for officers, but would allow more civil rights lawsuits
  to proceed on their merits. Granted, this will increase litigation
  costs for departments (and ultimately increase taxpayer expense of
  departments), but it should be done.\

  officers?](https://www.quora.com/Do-you-agree-with-Senator-Cory-Bookers-push-to-eliminate-qualified-immunity-for-police-officers/answer/Bill-Stein)]{.qlink_container}
- Reform to the federal police misconduct statute. Currently, it is only
  a crime for an officer to "willfully" violate an individuals's
  constitutional rights, meaning prosecutors must prove an officer acted
  with the intention of depriving the person of their rights. The bill
  plans to lower the standard of criminal intent to "knowingly or with
  reckless disregard." This, in addition to reform of qualified
  immunity, will make it easier for the Federal government to seek
  redress against officers who act recklessly and violate civil rights.
  I fear for the unintended consequences of this, and police unions will
  argue that this will cause officers to not act and will cause more
  officers to be harmed and die. Some may find that acceptable. I'm
  certain that the nearly one million police officers in the country
  might not.
- Reform to the federal standard for the use of force by officers from
  "reasonableness" to only when it is "necessary to prevent death or
  serious bodily injury." The bill would require that federal officers
  use de-escalation tactics and use deadly force only as a last resort.
  This is acceptable for Congress to do with Federal officers (FBI,
  BATFE, USCBP, etc), but they also plan on making this a condition of
  grants to state and local police agencies as well, which is also
  likely to face Constitutional pushback, as well as strong pushback
  from police unions.
- Ban Federal law enforcement use of chokeholds or other carotid holds,
  and condition Federal funding to states on them doing the same. Again,
  while this may work for Congress to impose this on Federal law
  enforcement, forcing this on to the states is again likely to face a
  Constitutional challenge.

From here, the legislation goes on to address other things which are
unrelated to the current situation, but are things that police reformers
have wanted for a long time, so they'll try to use the current crisis to
get passed (in the spirit of "never let a good crisis go to waste"),
like:

- Bans to "no-knock warrants." This one is also unlikely to succeed, as
  they are already governed by judges, and are useful when trying to
  prevent evidence from being destroyed and suspects from escaping. The
  resulting unintended consequences of this could be devastating, more
  so than where no-knock warrants intersect the Castle Doctrine.
- Limit the transfer of military excess hardware to police departments.
  All this will do will be to force the police to buy the hardware new,
  increasing policing costs to taxpayers. It will also cause
  manufacturers of this type of equipment to develop "military-style"
  gear, and "police-style" gear, but that both accomplish the same
  thing. They will find the gear that is most acceptable to the public
  and will produce that, again at increased cost (because the police
  will be barred from buying excess military gear, and will have to buy
  the new "police-style" gear). But hey, it's not "military" gear, it's
  "police" gear, designed especially for the police. This is a whole
  discussion unto itself. Ultimately, all this does is increase the cost
  to cities and towns of operating a police department, and will hurt
  small agencies and small communities much more than large ones.
- Direct state and local law enforcement agencies to undertake a new
  effort to end discrimination in their practices by conditioning
  federal funding on the adoption of policies and training to combat
  racial and other discriminatory profiling. This is also wholly
  unnecessary, as it's already been done after the last few high-profile
  incidents which were also branded as "institutional racism." But sure,
  let's do it again.
- Set new requirements on the Justice Department to come up with and
  deliver new policing standards for state and local agencies and
  collect new data on police actions all over the country. Again, this
  one steps across the line, where the Justice Department seeks to make
  changes to how state and local law enforcement operates, and is
  unlikely to pass in its current form, and if it does, will again face
  swift Constitutional challenge, so long as those standards are
  voluntary and are advice to departments instead of mandates.

As it stands, for most Republicans, this bill is DOA.
