**If you shoot a undercover cop with a no knock warrant for trespassing
have you commited \[sic\] murder.?**

To be fair, the intersection of no-knock warrants and the Castle
Doctrine is a dangerous one, indeed.

But let's clear up a few issues with your question:

1.  Undercover officers **never** serve no-knock warrants. There are
    over 16,000 law enforcement agencies around this country and I could
    never hope to know the rules of every one, but I can tell you this
    with absolute certainty. You will never see an undercover officer
    serving a no-knock warrant. In fact, you'll rarely see a *uniformed
    patrol officer* conducing a no-knock warrant these days. In most
    cases, no-knock warrants are executed by SRT or SWAT teams where
    available, and even where not available, officers will use riot
    shields and will be wearing as much body armor as they can possibly
    adorn themselves with and still remain mobile. No-knock warrants, as
    you implied, are *dangerous*.
2.  Let's explain the difference between an "announced warrant" and a
    "no-knock warrant."\
    \
    Announced Warrant: Officer rings doorbell. Someone answers. Officer
    shows person answering the door (assuming the person is over 18) the
    search warrant, and officers let themselves in, sometimes over the
    objection of the person answering the door.\
    \
    No-Knock Warrant: Teams are stacked up outside the door, in the dark
    (usually the wee hours of the morning when most folks are asleep).
    The teams made a silent approach to the door. The officer or two
    holding the battering ram are in front. The officer declares, while
    swinging the ram, "Police! Search Warrant!" \<BANG!\> The ram hits
    the door, and officers storm in. Once they are inside, they continue
    to make that loud declaration of "Police" and "Search Warrant" as
    they sweep the rooms for threats. It goes from dead silence to very
    loud very quickly, and can indeed be disorienting. This is by
    design.\
    \
    No-knock warrants are issued when there is a high likelihood that
    evidence will be destroyed or suspects will escape between the time
    that officers ring the doorbell and the door is answered. Judges,
    with few exceptions, do not issue no-knock warrants lightly.

So the question remains: **can you shoot a police officer entering your
house via a no-knock warrant and** ***not*** **be convicted of murder?**

The answer to that very specific question is yes you can, although it is
highly unlikely. It has happened on at least one occasion where a
no-knock warrant was not executed well that a homeowner mistook police
for home invaders and shot and killed an officer because he was
genuinely in fear for his life.

In most cases, someone shooting at police will be treated as hostile,
and won't likely survive such an encounter.
