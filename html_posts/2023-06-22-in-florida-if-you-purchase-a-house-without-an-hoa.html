If you already own your home, any HOA formed will be a *voluntary* HOA.ยน
You are under no obligation to join the HOA. The only time you become
part of a mandatory HOA is if it is part of your purchase agreement.
Mandatory HOAs can only be attached to properties if 100% of the
landowners agree. Developers can create mandatory HOAs because they own
all of the properties during the development phase.

If an HOA is formed later on, it is voluntary. You are not obligated to
join. That said, you won't get any of the benefits of joining. Perhaps
the HOA decided to build a fitness center in the neighborhood on a piece
of property owned by someone. The HOA could allow you access to that
fitness center. That's just an example of what a voluntary HOA could do.
But even if the voluntary HOA performs services for you, you are not
obligated to join it.

ยน *As mentioned, if a community gets 100% approval to create a mandatory
HOA, it can be done, but in order to become mandatory and binding on all
current and future homeowners, it must be done with 100% approval.*
