Cameras don't prevent people from doing anything. Cameras merely show
you what people are doing.

Legally, you can't prevent people from walking up your driveway. *But,
but, it's private property!* Yes it is. But you have a front door with a
walkway, a "Welcome" mat and a doorbell, so there is at least a
presumption that someone may approach your door and explain to you why
they are present on your property. They may have a legitimate need to be
present on your property. For example, police officers, while engaged in
their lawful duties, can approach and knock on your door. Delivery
drivers may do the same. Politicians or their agents, and religious
organizations, all have First Amendment protections allowing them to
knock on your door.

Certain facilities have expectations that visitors will never be
present. For example, warehouses likely are only visited by employees.
Warehouses have gated fences all around them, and only employees are
permitted to enter.

But houses, in neighborhoods, have at least a presumption that people
may enter the property to knock on the door or ring the doorbell so that
the property owner may determine whether or not there is a valid need
for them to be present on the property.

Once you have ascertained why they are present on your property, you can
determine if you want them to *remain* on your property. If you choose
to no longer permit them on your property, you may tell them to leave,
and they must vacate your property *poste haste*. Failing to do so is
considered trespassing and can be legally enforced.
