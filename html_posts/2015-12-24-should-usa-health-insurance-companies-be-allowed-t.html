Besides the fact that the 2016 platform hasn\'t been written yet, the
current GOP platform available at
[[GOP.com](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=cca836&url=http://GOP.com){.external_link

]{.qlink_container}says exactly the opposite. Consumers should be given
flexibility in the insurance companies they do business with: there
should be price transparency so people know exactly how much services
cost (and therefore, how much the insurance company is charging on top
of the cost of the covered service). Consumers should have the option to
purchase insurance across state lines, increasing competition and
driving down the cost of service.

To be fair, the GOP platform says about personal health responsibility
(**emphasis** mine):

> We believe that taking care of one's health is an individual
> responsibility. Chronic diseases, many of them related to lifestyle,
> drive healthcare costs, accounting for more than 75 percent of the
> nation's medical spending. To reduce demand, and thereby lower costs,
> **we must foster personal responsibility while increasing
> \[preventative\] services to promote healthy lifestyles**. We believe
> that all Americans should have improved access to affordable,
> coordinated, quality healthcare, including individuals struggling with
> mental illness.

So what does this mean? Does this mean higher premiums for people who
refuse to take advantage of preventative services? Potentially, yes.
This is part of what taking \"personal responsibility\" when considering
one\'s own healthcare means.

Now, assuming you do take personal responsibility for your own
well-being and you are still afflicted with a chronic illness, you
should be afforded full and open access to quality, affordable
healthcare.
