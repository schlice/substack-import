**Content:** [Killing the President is murder, just as killing your
next-door neighbor is murder. In most jurisdictions, killing the
President may not be considered capital murder or first-degree murder.
Generally, first-degree murder is charged when you kill:\

- A police officer, firefighter, or paramedic
- A child
- During the commission of another violent felony, such as burglary,
  sexual assault, kidnapping, etc (known as the \"felony-murder rule\")\
- Multiple times in a single incident\
- As a murder-for-hire

However, because of the nature of the victim, a first-degree murder
charge may be sought.\

Capital murder or first-degree murder generally carries a life sentence
without the possibility of parole, or the death penalty, depending on
the state.
