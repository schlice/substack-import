**How long does a person have to file an American with Disabilities Act
related complaint with the appropriate federal agency?**

> You have 180 days from the alleged act of discrimination in which to
> file a complaint with the appropriate federal agency, unless the time
> for filing is extended by the Federal agency for good cause. As long
> as the complaint is filed with any Federal agency, the 180-day
> requirement will be considered satisfied.
>
> A complaint may be filed with either \--
>
> **1)** Any Federal agency that provides funding to the public entity
> that is the subject of the complaint;
>
> **2)** A Federal agency designated in the title II regulation to
> investigate title II complaints; or
>
> **3)** The Department of Justice.
>
> Complainants may file with a Federal funding agency that has section
> 504 jurisdiction, if known. If no Federal funding agency is known,
> then complainants should file with the appropriate designated agency.
> In any event, complaints may always be filed with the Department of
> Justice, which will refer the complaint to the appropriate agency. The
> Department\'s regulation designates eight Federal agencies to
> investigate title II complaints primarily in those cases where there
> is no Federal agency with section 504
> jurisdiction.[\[1\]](#JmopX){#cite-JmopX .citation_link}
