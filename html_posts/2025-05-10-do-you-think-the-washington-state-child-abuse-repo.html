I highly doubt it.

The court has a mixed history with religious freedom, but what it does
not have mixed opinions on is whether or not a law which violates a
deeply-held religious belief is constitutional. The court recently ruled
in the Hobby Lobby case that Obamacare's birth control mandate was
unconstitutional because it violated the owner's deeply-held religious
belief. The Court also ruled in the Masterpiece cake shop case that a
state's non-discrimination law violated the owner's deeply-held
religious beliefs. So it's pretty clear that when the court finds a law
violates a deeply-held religious belief, the law is unconstitutional.
And even if the law does require priests to testify about communications
during confession when they are subpoenaed to do so, those same laws do
not require priests to be "mandatory reporters" of what they heard in
confession.

I am almost certain that the court will similarly find that Washington's
mandatory reporting law will also be found to violate the First
Amendment, as it demands that Catholic priests violate their deeply-held
religious beliefs in order to obey the law. For the Catholic, the seal
of Confession is inviolate. A priest can be excommunicated for doing so.
I highly doubt that any priest would ever do so.

While I am unaware of any cases where a priest has been charged for
failing to report a crime in violation of a law, the priest also has to
contend with the fact that they would face excommunication and would be
committing what Catholics refer to as a "mortal sin" by doing so. The
Louisiana Supreme Court ruled in 2014 that while a priest doesn\'t have
a duty to report confidential information learned during confession, he
can be compelled to testify about communications during confession, or
face jail time for contempt if he does not. As far as I can see, this
law has never been tested.
