**Do you want your economic stimulus check now, or wait a few days so
Donald J. Trump\'s name can appear in the memo field?**

Fake Newsâ„¢.

This has already been debunked. In fact, the Treasury Department
responded directly to WaPo's claim that checks would be delayed to add
the president's name:

The printing on the checks is added electronically. It's literally one
line of text underneath where it says "Economic Impact Payment." It's
illogical to believe that such a change would take "days." It took
*literally seconds* to make that change, and the check production was
not delayed at all to make the change.
