So you're saying that God will whip out His big book of "all the people
who have wronged you" and will list them off for you?

Probably not.

So maybe instead, you can do it yourself! When you get there, you can
say, "Hey God, I would have been a much better person if it weren't for
X and Y and Z and A and B and C who wronged me."

How do you think that strategy is going to work for you?

When you are going through counseling recovering from trauma, you learn
to let go of your anger towards others. You learn that you cannot
control what other people do; you can only control *how you react* to
what other people do.

So it's not about *them*. It's about *you*.

**Part of forgiveness is learning to live with the consequences of
someone else's sin.**

Now you might think, "Well gee, that's not fair." And you'd be right.
It's not fair. But it is *just*. Because it's not about what they did,
it's about how you respond to what they did. So you will have to live
your life with the consequences of others' sins.

The only *real* choice you have is whether to do that in the bondage of
bitterness, or in the freedom of forgiveness.

The other thing you learn in recovery is little catchphrases. One that
sticks out in this situation is ***Let Go and Let God***. That means
it's up to you to let go of your desire for revenge, and let God handle
them.

> Beloved, never avenge yourselves, but leave it to the wrath of God,
> for it is written, "Vengeance is mine, I will repay, says the Lord."
> \-- Romans 12:19 ESV

Now, God isn't telling you here to forget about what was done. Far from
it. What He's saying here is that if you give it to Him, He will ensure
that it is not forgotten about. You don't have to be the one to hang on
to that guilt and that anger and that desire for vengeance. Give it to
God, because He promises that He will repay.

In other words, even if you let them off the hook, *you're not letting
them off of God's hook.*

When you do that, you free *yourself* from the guilt and the anger and
the desire for vengeance. Forgiving and letting God is to set a captive
free, *and then to realize that it was you who was captive*. You were
being held back by your guilt and your anger. Letting go and letting God
is the method by which we let go of all that holds us back, while
knowing that God will repay in the end.
