It doesn\'t matter what \"everyone else\" believes. It only matters what
you and your spouse believe. The rest of them can all go to hell.

Find someone who shares your beliefs, then marry them. Wait for that
person. Wait a long time if you have to. I\'d rather see you unmarried
because you are principled than to see you married and divorced because
you never found the right person.
