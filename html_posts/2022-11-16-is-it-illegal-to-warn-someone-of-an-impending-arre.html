The answer, as with all legal answers, is "it depends."

If you warn someone of an impending arrest *in an attempt to get them to
flee*, you are committing a crime called "aiding and abetting." When you
aid someone in avoiding capture, that is a crime.

If you instead warn someone of an impending arrest *so that they can get
their affairs in order before they are arrested*, this would not be a
crime. You would have to be clear that the only reason you are telling
them is so that they can get their affairs in order before their arrest.

However, even then, you are susceptible to being charged yourself if you
should have known that your actions could reasonably have been assumed
to lead to the suspect attempting to flee in order to avoid the
impending arrest. Even if you tell them of their impending arrest just
so they can get their affairs in order before they are carted off to
jail, but instead they try to run, you can still be charged with aiding
and abetting if a reasonable person would believe that the suspect would
run upon hearing that news. Maybe they have a history of trying to evade
capture, and if you knew of that history, you should have known that
telling them that they're going to be arrested would lead to them trying
to flee.

So while it's not a guarantee, you place yourself in legal jeopardy if
you tell the suspect that they are going to be arrested and they then
try to evade capture.
