There is a different reason for this. There has to be; why would you
stop a program which is, arguably, the most successful government
program ever?

Groups like Black Lives Matter and the attitudes they spawn have made
the job of the police officer all the more difficult. Heather MacDonald
said about the new phenomenon:

"Police operating in inner-city neighborhoods now find themselves
routinely surrounded by cursing, jeering crowds when they make a
pedestrian stop or try to arrest a suspect. Sometimes bottles and rocks
are thrown. Bystanders stick cell phones in the officers' faces, daring
them to proceed with their duties. Officers are worried about becoming
the next racist cop of the week and possibly losing their livelihood
thanks to an incomplete cell phone video that inevitably fails to show
the antecedents to their use of force. Officer use of force is never
pretty, but the public is clueless about how hard it is to subdue a
suspect who is determined to resist arrest.

"As a result of the anti-cop campaign of the last two years and the
resulting push-back in the streets, officers in urban areas are cutting
back on precisely the kind of policing that led to the crime decline of
the 1990s and 2000s. Arrests and summons are down, particularly for
low-level offenses. Police officers continue to rush to 911 calls when
there is already a victim. But when it comes to making discretionary
stops---such as getting out of their cars and questioning people hanging
out on drug corners at 1:00 a.m.---many cops worry that doing so could
put their careers on the line. Police officers are, after all, human.
When they are repeatedly called racist for stopping and questioning
suspicious individuals in high-crime areas, they will perform less of
those stops. That is not only understandable---in a sense, it is how
things *should* work. Policing is political. If a powerful political
bloc has denied the legitimacy of assertive policing, we will get less
of it."

So DeBlasio is scaling back proactive, data-driven policing, because
**the public is demanding it.** A powerful political bloc (blacks) has
demanded that assertive policing cease, and so DeBlasio complied. Right
or wrong, it's what they are demanding, and so the police oblige.

MacDonald continues:

"Unfortunately, when officers back off in high crime neighborhoods,
crime shoots through the roof. Our country is in the midst of the first
sustained violent crime spike in two decades. Murders rose nearly 17
percent in the nation's 50 largest cities in 2015, and it was in cities
with large black populations where the violence increased the most.
Baltimore's per capita homicide rate last year was the highest in its
history. Milwaukee had its deadliest year in a decade, with a 72 percent
increase in homicides. Homicides in Cleveland increased 90 percent over
the previous year. Murders rose 83 percent in Nashville, 54 percent in
Washington, D.C., and 61 percent in Minneapolis. In Chicago, where
pedestrian stops are down by 90 percent, shootings were up 80 percent
through March 2016."

The fact of the matter is: Compstat worked. While still in use, scaling
back Compstat enforcement causes crime to spike. One final though from
MacDonald:

"In New York City, businesses that had shunned previously drug-infested
areas now set up shop there, offering residents a choice in shopping and
creating a demand for workers. Senior citizens felt safe to go to the
store or to the post office to pick up their Social Security checks.
Children could ride their bikes on city sidewalks without their mothers
worrying that they would be shot. But the crime victories of the last
two decades, and the moral support on which law and order depends, are
now in jeopardy thanks to the falsehoods of the Black Lives Matter
movement."

We have to find a way to reverse this trend. The only way to stop it is
a top-down attitude adjustment. Seeing BLM for exactly what it is, a
hate group, will most definitely chill their actions. We shall see how
the new administration responds.
