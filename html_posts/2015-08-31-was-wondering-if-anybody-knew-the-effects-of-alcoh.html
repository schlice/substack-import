(lamoTRIgine is the chemical name for Lamictal)\
\
I would advise you to be very cautious if you plan on drinking while on
Lamictal. If you are going to drink at all, don\'t drive, even if you
don\'t think you\'re going to drink enough to be drunk. The additive
effects on Lamictal can impair you even when you\'re not technically
drunk.
