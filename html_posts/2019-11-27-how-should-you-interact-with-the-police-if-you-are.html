**How should you interact with the police if you are sure they are doing
something illegal?**

***DO EXACTLY WHAT THEY TELL YOU.***

***DO NOT INTERFERE WITH THEM! Think about it: if they're willing to
break the law, they're probably also willing to harm you!!!***

Once the interaction is concluded, call a criminal defense attorney
immediately. I know it's going to cost you money. Get out your credit
card.

I know other people are saying that you should escalate it through the
police chain of command. You absolutely should feel like you can do
this. However, if the police are doing something illegal, then relying
on them to police themselves probably isn't the route I would feel most
comfortable pursuing. It would behoove you to get representation who is
working directly for you, sooner rather than later. Evidence needs to be
collected while it is still fresh, and lawyers can help you, more than
the police will.
