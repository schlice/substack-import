I guess I'm curious why you shouldn't have taken Panadol to control your
fever.

The CDC says that taking OTC pain medications is perfectly fine after
your vaccination. If you got your vaccine and you're running a fever,
you can absolutely take OTC meds like acetaminophen, ibuprofen, or
paracetamol to help control it .

However, taking them ***before*** your vaccination may reduce the
effectiveness of the vaccine. This is because the vaccines use a process
known as "controlled inflammation" to create antibodies against the
virus. If you take OTC pain medications *before* you are vaccinated,
this may dampen the body's natural immune response, resulting in a less
vigorous response, and an overall lower
efficacy.[\[1\]](#agtSh){#cite-agtSh .citation_link}

So take pain medications *after* you get your vaccine and if you start
running a fever, and you'll be just fine. Just don't take pain meds
*before* you get your vaccine. If you do, make sure your pain meds have
worn off completely before you get your vaccine.

Original question:

When I got the first doze of Pfizer vaccine, I was running a fever the
next day. I took two Panadol which I shouldn\'t have and my fever went
away. What should I do to fix my mistake?
