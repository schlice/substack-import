**My county's stay at home order is till the end of May. I have a court
date in another county that will open up earlier. Am I supposed to go to
that court hearing?**

Contact the clerk of the court at the courthouse where you are scheduled
to appear. Stay in contact with them regarding the schedule. They will
let you know whether or not your appearance is still on or will be
postponed.

Appearing in court, if it is not cancelled, is considered to be an
essential activity.
