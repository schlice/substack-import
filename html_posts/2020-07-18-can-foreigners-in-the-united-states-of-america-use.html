**Can foreigners in the United States of America use the 5th Amendment
and the 14th Amendment?**

Nowhere in the Bill of Rights does it say that the rights apply to
"citizens." In most places, it says "the right of the people." Those
laws apply to everyone on US soil under the "jurisdiction of the United
States." There is some debate on that last part, but indeed, those laws
apply to everyone present in the United States.

Also, everyone has rights. You have these rights because you are a
person, created by God. The Constitution simply prevents the government
from infringing on those rights. So you can't really "use" the 5th or
14th Amendments. You are "protected" by them while you are in the United
States, just like any other person.
