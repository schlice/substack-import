In my HOA in Colorado, we negotiated group rates for trash service
(trash service is not provided by the local municipality) which
significantly reduced the cost and also synchronized trash collection
throughout the community.

In my HOA in Florida, we're maintaining a list of people willing to
volunteer to help their neighbors and a method for neighbors to submit
requests for assistance. We're doing monthly food truck events to
bolster community goodwill and neighborhood cohesion.

Just the tip of the iceberg.
