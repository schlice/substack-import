Error 53 is caused when certain components in the iPhone have been
replaced by third-party maintainers, such as the touchscreen or the
fingerprint sensor. The only fix, previously, was to have your device
serviced by Apple.

However, due to mounting pressure related to forcing users to use
Apple\'s repair services, Apple released an update to iOS 9.2.1 which
will resolve the issue.
