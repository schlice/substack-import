**Can you refuse to unlock your laptop for TSA?**

For context, we are talking about United States domestic airline travel
within the United States. We are **NOT** talking about a US citizen at a
Customs and Border Patrol checkpoint while you are traveling back into
the United States from abroad. Totally different set of rules at the
border.

\

I have been a frequent flier for many decades now. *At worst,* during
the whole 9/11 airline scare and increased airport security, I was
occasionally asked to open and power up my laptop, so that they could
see it was a laptop that actually booted, and not a bomb. I have only
had that experience maybe twice in my life. They saw the beginnings of
the boot sequence and then let me go.

Never have I been asked to power up my laptop and log in.

**Because that's illegal.**

In order for any US law enforcement official to examine the *contents*
of your computer, they must have a **search warrant**.

TSA is **not** law enforcement. TSA is exactly what it stands for:
Transportation Security. They work for the Department of Homeland
Security. They are not law enforcement.

The **only** time you must enter your password and unlock your laptop is
when you are presented with a **search warrant**. If you are presented
with a search warrant and you refuse to comply, you can be arrested and
charged with obstruction of justice, or whatever the appropriate crime
is in your jurisdiction.

However, *none of this* would happen in the TSA screening line.
