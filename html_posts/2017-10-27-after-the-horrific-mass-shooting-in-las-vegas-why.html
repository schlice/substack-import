**It's a bad idea because it can't be done.** You'll spend billions of
dollars and accomplish nothing.

I read a comment a month or so ago, and it really stuck with me.

Guns exist. There are over 300 million of them in the United States. No
amount of legislation or celebrity endorsements or voodoo magic will
ever get rid of them. Ever. Even if you could, [[you can still make a
basic
one](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=bc2d4f&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Improvised_firearm){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container} out of some cheap parts
from your local home improvement store. The notion that we can legislate
guns away is simply flawed thinking. Even Australia's "successful" gun
buyback program got *at most* 1/3 of the nation's guns off of the
streets. In the United States, that would still leave us with over 200
million guns still available.

Guns can be used to help or to harm the innocent. Guns can also be used
to help or harm the guilty. The gun is nothing more than a tool. Wasting
our time pining over the fate of a small mechanical device is useless.
Our time is much better spent working on the actual issue causing
someone to desire to take up a gun.

But that's harder to deal with. It's much easier (and it scores
political points in some circles) to simply add/delete/change some
legislation around the gun.
