***TRIGGER WARNING: Unpopular opinions ahead. Don't read if you can't
handle unpopular opinions!***

\

The biggest "health risk" a woman may face is that she'd have to travel
to a different state to get a legal abortion. And if she chose to get an
abortion where abortions were illegal, she'd be voluntarily incurring a
health risk. But you take on that risk when you do illegal things
anyway.

But if she's following the law, then there's really no "health risk"
here, is there.

**Because abortion is not health care.**

Abortion is an elective procedure. So you can *elect* not to do it, and
you'll not die. Therefore, it's not health care. Are tattoos health
care? Are piercings health care? Is LASIK health care? Those are all
elective procedures. You can *not* do those things and you'll not die
(in most cases). That means they're not health care.

And if you don't get an abortion, but your pregnancy DOES threaten your
life or your health, doctors can legally abort your baby *even if
abortion is 100% illegal.* **Medical intervention to save your life was
never in question, and still wouldn't be in question, even if**
***Roe*** **and** ***Casey*** **are overturned.**

The only thing that overturning *Roe* and *Casey* does is return control
of the issue to the states, and allows them to decide for themselves
whether or not to allow that elective procedure in their state. Elected
representatives become responsible for enacting those policies, not
unelected Justices-for-life at the Supreme Court. The people have direct
control, by electing representatives who will set state policy as the
majority of voters see fit.

*Comments are getting stupid again.*

*The only thing we are discussing here is* ***whether, and when, it is
morally acceptable to terminate the life of a human being for the sake
of convenience.***

*If you start muddling the discussion with "what about IVF, what about
rape, what about the life of the mother..." then I'll politely guide you
back to this discussion. If you continue, your crap will be deleted.
Focus on the issue at hand, or don't waste our time.*

*Let me repeat what I said in my answer:* ***Medical intervention to
save your life was never in question, and still wouldn't be in question,
even if Roe and Casey are overturned.***
