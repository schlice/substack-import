**How do I get my stolen vehicle back if it is not registered under my
name? The car was stolen with the bill of sale and pink slip. Everything
was in the car.**

Hire an attorney.

is correct, you have a tough row to hoe here. But you can make it work
if you can contact the previous owner and convince them to testify that
they sold the car to you. Receipts or bank statements showing the
transaction taking place and the money changing hands between you and
the previous owner would probably be enough to establish that you
actually did purchase the car when you said you did, and that the
current bill of sale and title were obtained fraudulently.

This is not impossible, but it is not easy. Good luck.

And for anyone else reading this, fair warning: **never store the title
to the car in the car itself.** Anyone with that title "owns" the car,
as they can pretty quickly generate a fake bill of sale showing you
"sold" the vehicle to them. They can then register the vehicle and all
is well.
