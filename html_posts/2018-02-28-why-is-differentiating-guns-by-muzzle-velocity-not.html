**Why is differentiating guns by muzzle velocity not being used in the
public gun control debate?**

Because despite what the media is telling you, there isn't a gun out
there that is "less deadly" or "more deadly" because the bullet moves
slightly faster or slower.

All guns are designed to kill. Guns which fire small, subsonic bullets
like the .22 or guns which fire faster bullets like a 5.56 will still
make the person on the business end of that gun dead. Small bullets make
you equally as dead as bigger bullets.

A .22 can cause death just like a 5.56 can. If your goal is to kill
(which is why you use a gun in the first place), why would you not use
the most efficient tool available?

- If your goal is to put a house together, why wouldn't you use a nail
  gun instead of a hammer and nails? The nail gun is more efficient.
- If your goal is to paint a house, why wouldn't you use a power painter
  instead of a brush? The power painter is more efficient.
- If your goal is to kill, why wouldn't you use a gun instead of a
  spoon? The gun is more efficient.

The problem in this debate is that people don't find using a nail gun or
a power painter distasteful but they find using guns to be distasteful.
But that's because they don't realize that in some limited
circumstances, using a gun is legally permissible. There are two
scenarios in which killing is permissible: self-defense, and resistance
to tyranny. The founders of the United States thought that these
principles were *so important* that they explicitly prevented the
government from ever passing laws to restrict the right to self-defense
or resistance to tyranny or any other lawful use with firearms.

You don't have to personally touch a gun ever, in your lifetime. But
that belief cannot infringe on the rights of those who do. And there are
tens of millions of gun owners who own hundreds of millions of guns.
