**Can a straight-A high school graduate, with no extra curriculars, do
something specific with their life to later apply and be accepted into
one of the military academies?**

*(Air Force specific answer, but all the services have similar
programs)*

Yes, there are two things you can do: ***go to college***, or
***enlist***.

If you want to go the college route:

> Remember to keep track of your achievements in high school and
> maintain relationships with teachers and counselors who can help you
> gather required evaluations.
>
> While at \[..\] college or university, enroll and maintain high grades
> in challenging courses with an emphasis in math, English, lab-based
> sciences and history.
>
> The Academy will request college transcripts to validate college
> subjects taken and requisite grades earned.
>
> Retaking and improving your standardized test scores is highly
> recommended.
>
> Finally, ensure you continue participating in athletic and nonathletic
> activities to show your leadership potential. Work experience and
> achievements while at college are also relevant to your
> application.[\[1\]](#KbWSp){#cite-KbWSp .citation_link}

If you want to go the enlisted route, you can participate in what the
Air Force calls the ***Leadership Encouraging Airman Development (LEAD)
Program.***

LEAD is "an ongoing effort to give our best and brightest Airmen (Active
Duty, Reserve and National Guard Airmen) the opportunity to excel by
offering them appointments to the U.S. Air Force Academy and the Academy
Prep School. This program delegates authority to unit commanders to
identify outstanding and deserving Airmen with officer potential for
this commissioning program."[\[2\]](#EcRFD){#cite-EcRFD .citation_link}

Once you arrive at your first duty station, inform your commander that
your goal is to get into the service academy of your choice. Tell him or
her that you'll do whatever it takes to accomplish that goal, then
*listen to the advice they give you, and* ***follow it.*** You will have
an ally in your corner, and if you do well and show potential, your
commander can recommend you for the LEAD program.

Regardless of the route you go, don't forget the Academy eligibility
requirements:

- Be a U.S. citizen or be able to obtain citizenship before entry into
  the Academy.
- Be 17 years of age for direct entry but not have reached your 23rd
  birthday by July 1 of year of entry.
- Be 17 years of age for prep school but not have reached your 22nd
  birthday by July 1 of year of entry.
- Be unmarried.
- Bear no legal obligation to support a child or other individual.
- Not be pregnant.
- Be of high moral character.
