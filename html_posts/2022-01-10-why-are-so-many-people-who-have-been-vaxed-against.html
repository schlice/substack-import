You have asked a two part question. I will break it down for you:

> Why are so many people who have been vaxed against Covid still
> contracting Covid

Because the vaccines were never designed to prevent you from getting
COVID. They were designed to protect you from the worst outcomes of
contracting COVID, not to prevent COVID infection in the first place. So
if you were vaccinated and contracted COVID, it wouldn't be as bad (in
theory) as someone who was unvaccinated.

Of course, Omicron flipped all of this on its head. Omicron is proving
what I just said. It is literally infecting *everyone*, vaccinated or
not. But also...

> and falling seriously ill?

No. People are *not* falling seriously ill with Omicron. The *vast*
majority of people who are being infected with Omicron are experiencing
mild, flu-like symptoms, and are recovering without the need for
hospitalization. And this includes the unvaccinated.

Original question:

Why are so many people who have been vaxed against Covid still
contracting Covid and falling seriously ill?
