**Does Speaker Pelosi's delay in submitting her articles of impeachment
to the Senate for certain conditions essentially amount to a 'quid pro
quo'?**

There's plenty of buzzwords you can apply to Pelosi's delay in
submitting the Articles of Impeachment to the Senate, but "quid pro quo"
is not one of them.

The most notable and apropos buzzword to apply is **obstruction of
Congress**.

That Pelosi can't fathom her own hypocrisy is what is most telling. Just
a few weeks ago, she railed on against President Trump for failing to
allow staffers to testify in front of Congress, ostensibly exercising
executive privilege without using the word. Predictably, the House
impeached him for exercising his authority under the Constitution.

Then, just a few weeks later, Pelosi decides that it's perfectly
acceptable to obstruct the Senate in its trial obligation under the
Constitution by failing to deliver the Articles of Impeachment to the
Senate because she's dissatisfied with how the Senate plans on
conducting its business. She has no Constitutional authority to fail to
deliver the Articles of Impeachment to the Senate because she dislikes
the Senate rules, or she disagrees with how the trial in the Senate is
to take place. The Senate is the sole organization which can conduct the
trial, not the House. The House has no authority here. But she has
unilaterally decided to gum up the works.

It's obstruction of Congress, plain and simple.

McConnell should subpoena the House Manager and force them to deliver
the Articles of Impeachment to the Senate floor, and if he/she fails to
appear, he should petition the courts to intervene.
