So I get it, some people find the trappings of Christmas to be
unbiblical. But the whole idea of Santa Claus is not satanic.

Santa Claus is based on the legend of *Sinterklaas* as brought to New
Amsterdam (New York today) by Dutch immigrants in the 19th century. It's
also loosely based on St. Nicholas, the gift-giving patron saint of
children.

The legend of St. Nicholas isn't incompatible with God. Giving gifts is
certainly compatible, as Jesus is the greatest gift that the world has
ever received. And we can use the Christmas season to remember that gift
and to spread that Gospel message throughout our communities.
