**What is the difference between illegal and unconstitutional in the
United States?**

**Illegal** refers to an action which violates a law. Laws are either
passed by Federal or state governments. They tell you things which you
are not allowed to do, and if you do them, you can be fined or arrested.

**Unconstitutional** refers to a Federal or state government action
which violates the US Constitution. The Constitution limits the scope of
the government and limits its power. When the government does something
that either violates the Constitution or does something for which it
does not have the authority, it is considered unconstitutional.
