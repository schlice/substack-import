Ask Jonah. He tried to run away from God. Turns out, there is nowhere
you can run that God cannot find you and bring you back.

Also, nothing can separate you from the love of God:

> demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, neither
> height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to

> Romans 8:38--39 NIV

Anyone who repents of their sin and turns to Christ will be saved. **No
one is beyond salvation.**
