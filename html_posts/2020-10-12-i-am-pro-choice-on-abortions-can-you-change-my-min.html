Nope. I have little to no hope of changing your mind. You have already
declared yourself "pro-choice," so you've already determined that the
convenience of the mother trumps the life of the baby.

Maybe you've got a pocketful of "Buts" that keeps you on the pro-choice
side:

**But what about rape?** This is the only place that I will give a
little ground, because the woman was an *unwilling participant* in the
act creating a child. Any argument which discusses responsibility cannot
include a rape victim.

But I'll only give a little ground. Why? *The baby is a victim, too.*
Since when do we kill innocent third-parties when someone else was the
victim of a crime? Does that really sound like the appropriate answer?

I may not think it is, but I am willing to consider reasonable solutions
(i.e. at the conclusion of the police investigation which initially
establishes that the woman was not lying about being raped, she is given
an abortifactent).

**But what if the woman did not consent to carrying a baby? What if she
used protection?** No ground given here. The woman consented to carrying
a baby the moment she allowed a penis to enter her vagina. The woman was
a *willing participant* in the very act that creates children.

Let's say I stick my hand in a blast furnace, but I'm wearing a
fireproof glove. Can I still get burned? Of course I can. The glove
could fail. I could be wearing it incorrectly. Regardless of why, I knew
that such was the possibility the moment I stuck my gloved hand into the
blast furnace. Believing that a condom-wrapped penis is a 100% guarantee
against accidental impregnation is clearly a mistake; it's even clearly
written on the box. Claiming that you did not consent to carrying a
child because of it is plain, unadulterated ignorance. Birth control
never has been 100% effective. There is always the possibility that you
can get pregnant, even while using birth control.

**But what about healthcare? Isn't abortion health care?** No, it is
not. Abortion is very, very rarely part of normal women's health care.
And even if it was required to save the life of the mother, it would be
permitted. No one would ever seek to override a doctor who said that it
was either the mom or the baby, but only one would live. But those
incidents are shockingly rare. Modern health care (which includes
obstetric care) means that giving birth is very, very safe. I won't get
into the corner cases, because corner cases always exist, but I also
won't allow all abortions simply because corner cases exist.

**But you just want to control women! You want to keep them barefoot and
pregnant in the kitchen!** Um, no I don't. I'm really not interested in
controlling women. I'm simply interested in saving lives, and to me, it
appears that pro-choice advocates are simply ignoring the fact that
pregnancy involves ***two lives***, the life of the mother, and the life
of the baby. Why isn't the baby's life ever considered?

And I know we as a country have a long way to go to improve the
**adoption** process in this country. We must make it easier for women
to give up their babies for adoption. We must make it easier for
prospective parents to adopt babies. We must provide assistance to
adoptive parents in just the same way we incentivize single motherhood
today. I don't deny any of that. This transition wouldn't be easy.

But we must try. Continually justifying 99% of abortions out of
convenience because 1% of abortions are due to rape is unacceptable to
me.

But yeah, none of this will likely change your mind. Because if you're
truly pro-choice, most of you already have formulated snappy comebacks
to each one of these arguments. I don't want to hear them, because I've
already heard them all and you can't change my mind. The rest of you
probably want to harass me as a sexist or misogynist, or some other
"ist" and tell me that because I have a penis I can't have an opinion.
I'll save you from yourselves, help you not get into BNBR trouble, and
just turn off comments now.

*Sorry, no comments on this one.*

*If you don\'t like what I wrote, tough shit. If my answer is
grammatically low-quality or is un-cited opinion masquerading as fact,
downvote it. If you think I\'m wrong, write your own answer. But Quora
is a question-and-answer site, not a debate site. If you were simply
going to comment to tell me \"ackshually, you\'re wrong,\" then you're
the reason why I disable comments. Well done, Karen. You ruined it for
everyone.*
