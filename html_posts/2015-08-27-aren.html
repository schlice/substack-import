**Content:** [The statements are completely incorrect and incongruous
because they are incorrect.\
\
**Guns don\'t kill, people, who use the guns, kill, so no need for
stricter gun control.**\
\
This is an accurate statement. We shouldn\'t focus so much on the gun.
We should focus more on the person who uses the gun.\
\
Then you went on to make a completely unrelated comparison.\
\
**Cigarettes don\'t kill, people, who smoke them, kill, so no need for
strict controls on sale.**\
\
First, while people who smoke can (over many years) kill bystanders, it
is completely unintentional. Gun users can intentionally kill people.\
\
Second, guns do not kill the person using them (by default). Cigarettes
do kill the person using them (by default).\
\
Third, gun makers have no qualms about telling users that the gun kills
whatever is standing in front of it when it goes off. That\'s its
designed purpose. Cigarette makers spent half a century and hundreds of
billions of dollars trying to convince you that cigarette smoke was
harmless. Now we know the difference, and the public health backlash has
been nothing short of an epidemic. No such epidemic exists with guns
(despite what media hype leads you to believe).]{.rendered_qtext}
