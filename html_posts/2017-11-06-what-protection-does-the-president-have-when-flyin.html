No nation wants to go to war with the United States (except for maybe
North Korea, but they're just bat-shit crazy). Just the threat of war
with our country is enough to keep the vast majority of nations at bay.
So it's highly unlikely that a nation would launch fighters against Air
Force One.

The rogue actors are the ones you need to worry about, and they don't
own fighter jets. But they can buy rockets. Surface to air missiles are
bigger threats than manned fighter jets operated by a nation.

While the exact loadout is classified, Air Force One has countermeasures
on board to defeat incoming missiles.
