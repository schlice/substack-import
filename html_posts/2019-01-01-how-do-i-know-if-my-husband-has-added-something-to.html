**How do I know if my husband has added something to my phone where he
can see what I\'m doing?**

There are two basic ways to detect and remove spyware from your phone:

1.  Run an antispyware application
2.  Wipe your phone and reinstall everything.

**Antispyware**: There is antispyware for your phone, and it can detect
whether or not spyware is installed.

- If you're an Apple iPhone user, install [[Certo
  iPhone](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=539f7d&url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/certo-mobile-security/id1274429896?mt%3D8){.external_link
  rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
  onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
  qt-tooltip="apple.com"}]{.qlink_container}.
- If you're an Android user, install
  [[Incognito](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=8450a2&url=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id%3Dcom.dvtech.incognito%26hl%3Den_US){.external_link
  rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
  onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
  qt-tooltip="google.com"}]{.qlink_container}.

Running one of these antispyware apps will tell you if there is any
spyware on your phone, and help you remove them. It will also tell you
whether or not your phone was rooted/jailbroken without your knowledge.

**Wipe your phone:** Admittedly, this is kinda the "using a sledgehammer
to drive in a finishing nail" sort of approach to uninstalling offensive
applications, but once you do, you can be sure there is no monitoring
software on your phone.

In order to ensure that *only* apps you choose are installed on your
phone, you have to *wipe your phone.* I know, that sounds pretty harsh,
and in truth, it is a pretty ham-handed way to clean up your phone. But
two things will definitely happen: 1. your phone will run really well,
and 2. you'll be sure that there is no spyware on your phone.

For an iPhone:

1.  First, make sure you have a good backup, either in your iCloud or in
    iTunes. You will need that backup to restore your apps and data.
2.  Navigate to **Settings** \> **General** \> **Reset**
3.  Tap on **Erase All Content and Settings.**
4.  Tap on **Erase** **iPhone**.
5.  Tap on **Erase** **iPhone** again to confirm.

Your iPhone will wipe, and your installed applications from your last
backup will be restored. Be sure to check that entire list of
applications and don't install any apps you are unsure of.

For an Android phone:

1.  First, make sure you have good current backups in your Google Play
    account.
2.  In current versions of Android, go to **Settings \> General
    Management \> Reset**.
3.  Click **Factory Data Reset.**
4.  You will have to Confirm your choice and then enter your PIN in
    order to proceed.

Your Android device will reset, wipe and re-install its base OS. It will
re-initialize as if it was a new phone. Once you log back in to your
Google account, it will ask to restore your apps and settings. In that
list of apps, make sure they are all apps you want to re-install and are
not spyware apps.
