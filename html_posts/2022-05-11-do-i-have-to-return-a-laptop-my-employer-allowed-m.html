I really like [[David
Schwartz](https://www.quora.com/profile/David-Schwartz-9)]{.qlink_container}'s
answer, billing them for your time in moving your data off of the
machine and then returning it for refund plus expenses. The problem I
have with this is that you now have to haggle with them over your pay
rate, and if they reject it, you're stuck, and they still want your
laptop back.

I have a different opinion. **I think you have just as much right to
keep the laptop.**

You have a purchase receipt, and you purchased it from the entity which
had "ownership" of the laptop at the time. Whether or not they had the
right to sell it is not your problem, but they are trying to make it
your problem. The "owner" made a sale decision, and as the "owner of
record" at the time, they legally can bind their company to contracts,
whether or not they had the authority to do so. Now, the leasing company
is likely coming back to them and telling them that they actually want
the hardware back, and they're trying to minimize what they have to pay
out, along with not having to go back to the leasing company and admit
that they actually sold the laptop when they were not authorized to do
so.

My answer: **tell your former employer to go kick rocks.** They legally
sold it, I have a receipt, I paid fairly for it, it's mine. If they
found out they didn't have permission to sell it, that's their problem,
not mine. Looks like they need to pay the leasing company for their
mistake. Don't put me in the middle of your contract issue with your
leasing company.

If they complain about this at all, you may need to retain the services
of an attorney in your area to help you politely tell them to go kick
rocks.

Original question:

Do I have to return a laptop? My employer allowed me to buy my work
computer after I left my job. Later, they asked for it back saying they
never had the right to sell it (they will refund me). Do I have to
return it?
