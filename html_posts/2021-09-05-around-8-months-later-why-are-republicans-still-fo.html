1.  It's really hard to prove that Trump was "inciting a riot" when he
    intentionally included those two words in his speech. If he was
    directing his followers to try to take over the government, using
    the words "peacably and patriotically" would have gone against what
    you purport he was doing. So it kinda destroys the argument that he
    was fomenting the crowd into some kind of political takeover.
2.  Political speech is supposed to be inflammatory. It's supposed to
    spur people to action. That's actually a hallmark of an effective
    political speech. Can you see a Biden speech evoking the same kind
    of reaction? Doesn't that tell you something?

Original question:

Around 8 months later, why are Republicans still focused only on two
words (peaceably and patriotically) from Trump's 2 hour long
inflammatory \'fight\" speech on January 6th?
