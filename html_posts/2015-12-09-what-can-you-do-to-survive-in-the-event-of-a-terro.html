You do the same thing you would do in any terrorist situation. In order:
**Run, Hide,** and ultimately, **Fight.** I\'ll explain each in detail.

**Run**

If you have the ability, and you can do so safely, get out. As soon as
you recognize that everything is going sideways, get out. Help as many
others to get out as you can. Get at least a block away from the
location and wait. Police will want to talk to you. When you see them,
identify yourself to them, tell them you made it out and you got \<these
folks\> out with you and where you made it out from. The more
information they have about what is going on in there, and where people
are (or are not) holed up will be immensely beneficial.

**Hide**

If you can\'t get out, find a place to hunker down. Find a defensible
position with few entries/exits, such as a lavatory, an office, or a
small(ish) space. Try to secure that location (i.e. try to barricade the
door, if you can). Stay down, stay quiet, and wait for help to arrive.
If you have a mobile phone, get on the phone with 911, tell them you\'re
holed up inside. They will likely keep you on the phone until police
physically arrive in your location. They will want to know what you can
see and what you can contribute to the information-gathering function.
You won\'t be asked to put yourself in danger, but you will be asked to
convey what you can see. Be prepared to move to the next phase.

**Fight**

If the attackers make it to your location, you have to have it in your
head that you\'re not going down without a fight. Be prepared to attack
anyone who comes in to your defensible space. If you\'re armed, this
would be the time to use your weapon. If you\'re not armed, you should
arm yourself with whatever you can find: knives, letter openers, broken
chair legs, fire extinguishers, etc. Phone handsets make decent
bludgeons. Use your environment. Whatever you can get your hands on can
become a weapon (so on a side note, gun control is pointless).

These are things that anyone should consider in any location, not just
Grand Central Station. Wherever you are, maintain situational awareness.
What\'s going on around you? What\'s going on behind you? Remember,
situational awareness doesn\'t mean being paranoid about your
environment. It\'s just being *aware* of your surroundings and what is
going on around you.
