**What is the law regarding driving in the middle of a narrow,
residential road that has no yellow line down the center, and has no
pedestrian sidewalk where cars can park partly on the road and partly on
the soft shoulder?**

In most jurisdictions, you are to ride as close to the right side of the
road as you can safely do so. If you need to extend to the middle or the
left side of the road, you must do so only when it is safe (i.e. don't
rush into oncoming traffic). But again, all jurisdictions are different,
and specific regulations vary.
