**If the majority of the states pass their law circumventing the
electoral college would it be upheld by the Supreme Court when it is
challenged?**

Almost certainly not.

Let's look at the issue another way. The Supreme Court has stated that
states have the absolute authority to decide how their electoral votes
are divided. What if they decided to hold a lottery and sell their
electoral votes to the candidate who paid them the most money? Do you
think the Supreme Court would allow such a scheme?

If you said no, then you already understand why the National Popular
Vote (NPV) scheme is unconstitutional.

There are several portions of the NPV which violate the Constitution,
but the biggest one is related to the actual power of the state to
designate Electors who participate in presidential elections. This power
is a "delegated" power, unlike some other powers which are "reserved
powers." Madison said that reserved powers are "numerous and
indefinite," while delegated powers are "few and defined."

For example, the power of a state to enter into compacts with other
states is a reserved power. It generally involves the use of some other
reserved power, such as taxes or water rights. NPV's advocates believe
that because the power to enter into compacts is a reserved power, NPV
is Constitutional.

Delegated powers are specifically defined by the Constitution, and must
be used in accordance with the reason why they were delegated in the
first place (or in lawyer-speak, in accordance with the power's
underlying purpose, and its historical context). Courts can intervene if
a state tries to use a delegated power in a way in which it was not
intended.

The power of a state to appoint electors to participate in a
presidential election is a delegated power. It must be used in the way
it was intended: to represent the interests of *that state*. The
Electoral College and its system of electors was designed to balance a
number of competing interests, not just the popularity of the candidate.
To that end, the system of Electors was designed so that they act in the
best interests of their own state, in order to maintain the balance of
all of those competing interests. NPV would have Electors acting on
behalf of other states, and in just the same way that a state would not
be allowed to sell Electors to the highest bidder, a state cannot
declare Electors vote as agents of other states. This would be a breach
of the public trust, and would therefore be unconstitutional.

Additionally, because NPV would have a majority of electoral votes, it
would functionally repeal the Constitutional provision requiring the
House of Representatives to hold a run-off election in the event that no
candidate reached the requisite 270 electoral votes. This action
requires a Constitutional amendment to implement.
