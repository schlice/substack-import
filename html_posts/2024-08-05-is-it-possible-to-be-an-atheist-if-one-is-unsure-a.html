An ***atheist*** says, "I know there is no god." An ***agnostic*** says,
"I don't know whether or not there is a god."

Agnostics come in two flavors: *ordinary* agnostics say, "We don't know
whether or not God exists." *Ornery* agnostics say, "We *can't* know
whether or not God exists.

So it sounds like this person really isn't an atheist, because an
atheist says that they **know** that there is no God. It is only the
agnostic who says that they don't know whether or not there is a God.
