**While not all gun control activists espouse the desire for a gun ban

willing to personally gear up and go in with those given the job of
seizing banned firearms?**

I certainly hope so, because I don't know anyone of sound mind who'd be
willing to go door-to-door to try to remove guns from unwilling people.

I mean, that just sounds like a recipe for disaster.

I'm certainly not going to shoot anyone, because you won't find any guns
in my house when you come to seize them.

That's all I have to say about that.
