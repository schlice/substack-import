**Why doesn\'t the military operate its own rail route?**

They don't need to.

1.  The military uses rail only sparingly, so a military-only rail route
    would be under-utilized.
2.  The military can ship things by rail just like everyone else during
    peacetime.
3.  The military can commandeer rail lines (like they can commandeer the
    United States interstate system of roads) during wartime.
