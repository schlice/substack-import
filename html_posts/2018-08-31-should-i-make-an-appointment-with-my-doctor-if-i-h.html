**Should I make an appointment with my doctor if I had a breast lump
that dissapeared \[sic\] a few days after my period?**

Cyclic changes in breast tissue concurrent with hormonal changes during
periods are common, but lumps are never anything I fool around with.

If you have a new or changing lump, be sure to talk to your doctor about
it. To be honest, it is most likely nothing, but please do talk to your
doctor about it.
