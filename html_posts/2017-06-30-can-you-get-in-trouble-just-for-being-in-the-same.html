*(When I say "organization," that also means "club.")*

In general, just being a part of an organization does not mean shared
liability for activities not sanctioned by the organization.

The only time you might find yourself in some amount of hot water is if
the organization knew that illegal activity was going to take place, the
organization condoned (approved of) the activity, and told everyone
about it. While the majority of states do not have requirements to
inform law enforcement of illegal activity you know will take place,
some do.

Another time you may find yourself in some form of "trouble" (since you
didn't define what "trouble" you're referring to) is if this "club" is
at a school and you are under 18. Schools fall under a different subset
of laws, as the school acts *in loco parentis* which basically means
that legally, while you're there, they have some authority in the same
way your parents do. The school can levy administrative punishment
against all of the students in the club if they choose, especially if
the students were aware that illegal activity was going to take place,
and did nothing to stop it. Schools can, for the most part, administer
clubs in mostly the way they see fit, so long as that administration
furthers the goal of maintaining and enhancing the academic environment.
The *legal* aspect of the punishment will still be left to local law
enforcement, and will be limited to the person committing the crime. But
*administrative* punishments can be handed out by the school to whomever
they choose. The school could simply choose to disband the club, or they
could hand out individual punishments to students as well.
