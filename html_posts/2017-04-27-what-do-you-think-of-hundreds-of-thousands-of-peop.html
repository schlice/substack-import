This is akin to the toddler saying "I'm going to hold my breath until I
get my way."

I say: knock yourself out. FIguratively and literally.

If you want to go on a hunger strike, go for it. There are always
natural consequences to everything you do.

**But this country is not run by mob rule, and that's what they are
attempting to do.**

Remember this woman?

This is Baltimore City State's Attorney Marilyn Mosby. After the death
of Freddie Gray on April 12, 2015, Mosby took a *miraculous* four hours
to determine that murder charges were warranted against the six police
officers who were involved in his arrest. No grand jury, no
investigation, just a glimpse at the coroner's preliminary report was
enough to meet her evidentiary requirement for murder charges. To
compare, Michael Brown's **grand jury** (which she didn't even bother to
empanel) took three months to investigate Brown's death before finding
that there was not enough evidence to charge the officer with criminal
charges.

In actuality, her press conference told the real story. She stated, in
public, that she was filing murder charges *to appease the rioting
crowds*, which vowed to intensify their rioting if the officers were not
charged. "I heard your call for 'No justice, no peace.' Your peace is
sincerely needed as I work to deliver justice on behalf of this young
man," Mosby said in May of 2015.

This is called **mob rule**, and is not how a working system of justice
functions, and it is certainly not how our system of justice is designed
to work.

Because she rushed to charge these officers without a proper
investigation, one of the cases ended in mistrial, three were found not
guilty, and the charges were dropped against the remaining two. She
literally went 0 for 6. And what did she get for her troubles?
Disbarment proceedings for incompetence and ethical "recklessness" and
five of the six officers have filed malicious prosecution lawsuits
against her, along with defamation and invasion of privacy.

We do not charge people with murder because a crowd threatens violence.
This is not how our justice system works.

Similarly, we do not write legislation because people threaten to hurt
themselves. This is not how our system of legislation works.

Feel free to protest all day long. You have a right to speak. You don't
have a right to get everything you ask for.
