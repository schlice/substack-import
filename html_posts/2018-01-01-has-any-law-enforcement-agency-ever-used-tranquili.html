You do realize that there is a whole sub-class of **doctors** who
specialize in administering anesthetics, correct? They're called
anesthesiologists, and it is a precise art. Too little, and you just get
a little woozy and it doesn't really do what you want it to do; too much
and you're dead anyway.

Unless you're planning on training all police officers as professional
anesthesiologists, it's unlikely that tranquilizers will ever be used in
place of firearms.

"Icers" are a great sci-fi tool, but that's about it.
