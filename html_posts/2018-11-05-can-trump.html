**Can Trump\'s campaign continue to play Rihanna\'s music, even if she
doesn\'t want them to do so?**

The answer, as with all legal questions, is "it depends."

Usually, it is the venue that provides the bumper music. And whether or
not the venue can play the music at a political rally depends on the
license the venue signed with the Performing Rights Organization, or
PRO. The PRO negotiates individual licenses with venues so that they can
use the music of the artists with whom they have contracted. Most arenas
sign blanket license agreements which exclude rallies and conventions.

Most. Not all.

So Rihanna's options may be limited by the contract she signed with BMI,
and whether or not they issued a public performance license to Trump.
And if they did (and there's a fair bet that they did), Rihanna may be
out of luck.

Many artists have sent cease-and-desist letters to the White House,
claiming copyright infringement. But most of those cases fall off the
radar, because the campaign does have the proper licensing from the PRO
which manages the copyright.

The artist could, of course, remove the song from use by the PRO, but
that would be a pretty ham-handed move which would cost the artist lots
of future revenue.

The artist could also make a separate claim of "trademark infringement,"
or "false endorsement," if it appears that the campaign is implying
endorsement of the politician by the artist. So if Trump encouraged the
crowd to clap along or sing along, there could be a case made for false
endorsement.

But as far as the music itself goes, so long as the licensing is up to
date, Rihanna may be left crying all the way to the bank.
