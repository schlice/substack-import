**Would Alabama Governor Kay Ivey sign HB 314 if she had a
twelve-year-old granddaughter who was raped? Would she give the doctor
who saved her from giving birth a 99-year-sentence then?**

Yes and yes.

Remember that the goal of the Alabama abortion law is to generate a
legal challenge to it so that the Supreme Court will be forced to take
up *Roe v. Wade* again. Alabama is "leading the charge" to overturn bad
law, and following the principle of "striking while the iron is hot,"
the composition of SCOTUS says that the time is now to revisit the
issue.
