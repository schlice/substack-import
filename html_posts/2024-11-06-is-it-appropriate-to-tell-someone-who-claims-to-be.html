No, it's not appropriate, because they truly do believe in it.

It's more appropriate to point out that they have *much more faith than
you do*, because the gap between the facts and their belief (which is
bridged by faith) is much wider for them than it is for you. Therefore,
they must have more faith to believe in something which is supported by
fewer facts.

*(As you can see, when you have fewer facts, you need more faith to
reach your belief)*

For example, all of the best information we have tells us that the
universe exploded into being out of nothing. The Law of Causality tells
us that nothing begins to exist without a cause. Therefore, either
**someone** caused something to come into existence out of nothing, or
**no one** caused something to come into existence out of nothing. Which
view is more reasonable? The view that **someone** created something out
of nothing. Which view requires more faith to believe? The view that
**no one** created something out of nothing.
