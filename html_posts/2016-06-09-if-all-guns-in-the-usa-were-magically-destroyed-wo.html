Unless you can simultaneously destroy all guns from existence along with
the knowledge of how to build one, destroying all guns in one location
will only create a new market for illegal guns.

If you outlaw guns, you'll create a tremendous black market for guns,
and only the people willing to violate the law will have the guns which
they will smuggle into the country illegally or manufacture illegally or
3-D print illegally.
