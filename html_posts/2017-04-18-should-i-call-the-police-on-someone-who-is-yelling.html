At most, it's a nuisance. If he does it after hours (i.e. after 11 pm),
he can be cited for violating noise ordinances, but there usually isn't
a law preventing someone from being a nuisance. If you do think it
warrants a call, please call the non-emergency number and explain the
situation to the operator.

If he lives in an area controlled by an HOA, there's a good chance they
have rules against nuisances. Better to take it up with them.
