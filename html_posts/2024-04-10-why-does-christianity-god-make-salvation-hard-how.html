HARD? What are you talking about? If you believe that it is hard to be
saved, you don't know what it takes to be saved. Being saved is as easy
as falling off a log.

What ***IS*** hard is *changing how you live* ***once you've been
saved.*** Saved people don't act like those who aren't saved. You may
have to change your lifestyle. You may have to change your habits. You
may have to change your friend groups. All of those lifestyle changes
may be difficult because of inertia. It's potentially hard to have to
upend your life to live as a saved person lives.

In other words, **salvation may be free, but it could cost you your
life.**

Jesus was definitely not invisible when He was here on earth. In fact,
after He was resurrected, He physically appeared to over 500 people
before He was assumed into Heaven.

And I don't understand why "being invisible" is a barrier for you. You
believe in plenty of things which are invisible. Here's just one
example: I'll show you God when you can show me the wind. You may say,
"Just look at the trees moving! Just feel the wind on your face!" No,
those are ***results*** of the wind. Show me the actual wind. You can't
do it. You know it exists. You can see its effects. You can feel it on
your face. But it's invisible. Nevertheless, you are quite rational to
believe it exists.
