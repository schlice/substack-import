**What are the legal consequences if Christine Blasey Ford made up her
story about Kavanaugh in order to affect the Supreme Court?**

*If* it can be proved that she lied (and lying means she knew the truth
and she intentionally said something different with the intent to
mislead the Congress), she could be convicted of perjury, which is lying
under oath. A similar charge is "knowingly and willfully making
materially false statements to Congress," but that doesn't require being
under oath. A conviction on a Federal perjury charge can send you to
Federal prison.

For reference, John Poindexter was convicted of perjury for his
Congressional testimony as part of the Iran-Contra affair. He was later
pardoned.
