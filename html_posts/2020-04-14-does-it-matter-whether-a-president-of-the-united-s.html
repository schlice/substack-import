**Do you have to be born on US soil to be president?**

No. Specifically, the Constitution says that you must be a "natural born
citizen of the United States," not that you are actually born on US
soil.

Note that "natural born citizens" can be born outside of the physical
United States and still be citizens. For example, if you are born to
parents who are both citizens, but you are born physically outside the
US, you are still a "natural born citizen," that is, a citizen by birth.
You don't have to be "naturalized" in order to become a citizen if you
are born to citizens but you are physically born outside of the country.
