I think anyone would have a hard time hijacking a plane these days, Air
Marshall or not. Flight deck doors have been reinforced against forced
entry, and once they are locked from the inside, they are virtually
impossible to enter without someone on the inside letting you in.

Most flight deck doors have an electronic lock with a keypad on the
outside. When the code is entered, the door buzzes and a video feed to
the outside is activated. The pilots can then either approve the door
unlock request or deny it, keeping the door unlocked. If the pilots fail
to respond after a certain timeframe (about 1 minute), the door will
unlock (this is to allow entry if the cockpit crew has become
incapacitated).

The door has three settings:

- Open
- Locked with password override
- Completely locked with no override

If the flight deck crew is still conscious, there is nothing you can do
from the outside to force the door open.

Now, if the Air Marshall decides to take his service weapon and start
killing people, he may convince the flight deck crew to open the door
willingly, as in "I will kill one person every minute until you open the
door." Hopefully, some passengers will get brave and subdue the marshall
until the aircraft can be landed and the marshall can be taken into
custody. If they rush him, he can't conceivably shoot all of them before
they get to him.
