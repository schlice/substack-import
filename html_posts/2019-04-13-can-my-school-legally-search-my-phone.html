**Can my school legally take my phone and search it in USA?**

The answer, as is the answer to any legal question, is "it depends."

Schools generally have more leeway than law enforcement when it comes to
confiscating and searching anything on school grounds, including
lockers, backpacks, and yes, mobile devices. But of course, these
policies all vary by state.

In general, a school can remove anything from a student which is
disruptive to the learning environment. So can the school take your
phone? Yes, they can.

Whether or not they can *search* your phone varies wildly by state. Some
states have legislated this issue. For example, California students have
as many rights as anyone on the street when it comes to privacy and
devices. For students there, searches require warrants or legitimate
emergencies. Other states have made it clear that students have no
expectations of privacy when it comes to their devices on school
grounds.

Because of the lack of clarity and the patchwork of laws and school
policies, it's important for everyone --- parents, students, teachers,
and administrators --- to seek clarity on the rules that apply to them.
It's best to do that *before* an incident occurs, as it will avoid a lot
of unnecessary headaches and confusion.
