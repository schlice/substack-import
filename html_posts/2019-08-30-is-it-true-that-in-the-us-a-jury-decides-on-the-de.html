**Is it true that in the US, a jury decides on the death penalty or not?
If so, why? Isn\'t that like a kangaroo court?**

This process varies by state. In most states, a judge decides sentences.

However, in some states, judges are not allowed to determine whether or
not the death penalty will be applied; that is left up to a jury to
decide.

But it is most definitely not a kangaroo court. Remember that the actual
*trial* has already concluded and the defendant has already been found
guilty of a crime which carries a possible death sentence.

The trial then moves on to the *sentencing* phase, where sometimes in
some states a jury must decide to apply the death penalty.

Colorado is one of those states. In Colorado, after a guilty verdict
where the death penalty can be applied, the prosecution informs the
court that they are seeking the death penalty. The jury will then decide
whether or not the death penalty will be applied. The decision of the
jury must be unanimous. If even one juror opposes the death sentence in
the case, the sentence is life without parole.
