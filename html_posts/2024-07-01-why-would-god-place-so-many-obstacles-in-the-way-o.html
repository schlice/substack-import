What is your evidence of this? You claim that God is *actively making it
harder* for people to do good thigs, while He is *actively making it
easier* for people to do bad things. What makes you think God is doing
it?

First of all, you must realize that in order to make this assertion, you
must assume that God exists. Not sure if that's what you wanted to
assert here, but in order to make the argument, you must make the
assumption. Second, in order to know that something is **good** or
**bad**, there must be an eternal standard of **good** which applies to
all people everywhere. Therefore, you also assume that moral absolutes
exist, and that God is the source of these absolutes.

God isn't the source of "good" because He created a rule. God is the
source of "good" because ***He is the rule.*** Since "good" is following
God's Word, and "bad" is doing the opposite, the fact that "good" and
"bad" exist are because God (the source of all that is good) exists.

In addition, God (whether you believe in Him or not) is necessarily (by
definition) *omnipotent*, which means "all-powerful." This omnipotence
is basically a motive force; it means that God has unlimited power to do
things. *If it is capable of being done, God has the power to do it.*
But this also implies that there are certain things that God cannot do:
He cannot do something which is impossible to do.

One of the things that God cannot do is **actively deny His nature**. We
know this because we are designed in God's image, and we too are capable
of doing anything which we are capable of doing; we cannot do things
which we are not capable of doing. For example, I can walk across a
bridge, run across a bridge, or skip across a bridge. But I am unable to
fly across a bridge, because as a human, I am unable to fly. Therefore,
what I can do (and what God has the capability to do) is limited by our
very natures.

So what does all of that mean?

- God is the definition of good.
- God cannot deny His own nature.
- Therefore, God can never actively do bad, or actively deny doing good,
  because it is in opposition to His nature.

\

So what does all of this mean? It means that what appears to be
obstacles to doing good, or enablement of doing bad, **must have another
source.** *It cannot, by definition, be God.*

So is there another force in the universe which is *actively* trying to
deny God and His will? Indeed there is. It is the one who God kicked out
of Heaven for trying to take all the glory. It is the one who (along
with his minions) actively encourages people to deny God. It is the one
who actively puts obstacles in the way of you connecting with God and
doing God's will.

That's right: it's Satan and his demons. It is Satan who actively is
trying to separate you from God. It is Satan who actively puts obstacles
in your path to doing God's will, trying to get you to question God and
His promises. It is Satan who actively assists those who choose evil in
the conduction of that evil, "greasing the skids," as it were, to do
those evil things, *because the more you do evil, the more you are
separated from God.*

It simply makes more logical sense to presume that God cannot be the
source of the obstacles to doing His will; it must be Satan and His
minions.
