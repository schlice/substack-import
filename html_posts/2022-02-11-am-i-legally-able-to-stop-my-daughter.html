Of course you are! If it is indeed your house, you can control who
enters and who must leave. A daughter's ex-boyfriend has no special
authority to enter your house without your permission. You can lock him
out and keep him out. If he has a key, change the locks. If he tries to
break in, get a gun.

You deserve to feel safe in your home. No one gets to threaten that.

You get to control who comes in and who does not. Tell ex-boyfriend-boy
that if you find anything of his, you'll send it on to him, otherwise he
can go kick rocks.

Original question:

Am I legally able to stop my daughter's ex-boyfriend from entering my
house to \"look around\" to see if he left anything?
