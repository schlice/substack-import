is spot on. Untreated, RRMS transitions to SPMS within 10 years. We know
that using the MS therapy drugs extends that time. We don't know exactly
how much the drugs extend that time.

Also considering that MS is usually diagnosed between ages 20 and 40,
that would mean this woman is between 50 and 70 right now, which also
means that she was able to hold off the SPMS for the majority of her
childbearing years, meaning that quality of life during that time was
pretty good.

With new medicines being approved all the time, I think she's in great
shape for the future.
