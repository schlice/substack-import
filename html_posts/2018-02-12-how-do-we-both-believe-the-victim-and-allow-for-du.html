**How do we both believe the victim and allow for due process when
someone is accused of abuse?**

FINALLY!!! Someone is asking the right questions!!! Well done [[David
Hinckley](https://www.quora.com/profile/David-Hinckley)]{.qlink_container}.
It's the right question because it's the one everyone is so confused
about. Let's try to cut through the confusion.

You're talking about two different things: believing the victim (or
showing that we believe the victim) and being able to prosecute a case.
One is a matter of belief, and the other is a matter of law. The reason
why there is so much confusion is because we are trying to blend the two
in some way, and we are failing miserably. We are telegraphing that we
"believe" the victim by destroying the life of the accused, and this is
a miscarriage of justice.

Before we get into the meat of the question, we need to discuss a legal
function called a **statute of limitations**. The statute of limitations
defines a timeframe after which charges for a certain crime cannot be
brought. The statute of limitations for crimes are different, and they
are different in each state as well. The statute of limitations exists
to protect the accused from bad prosecution, because over time, memories
fade, evidence degrades, and the possibility that the accused can get a
*fair trial* decreases. So when we pass the "point of no return" where
it becomes nearly impossible for the accused to get a fair trial, we cut
off the possibility of bringing charges.

We need to discuss one more point before we address the question: **the
truth.** Think of the truth as existing on a timeline. His story is on
one end, and her story is on the other end. The truth is somewhere in
between. It can be closer to one side than the other, but it is always
somewhere in between. Why can't one side be telling the complete truth?
Is this because everyone lies? Not at all. It's because everyone sees
the world differently. Everyone's perceptions are colored by their life
experiences. This is why two people can see the same incident and report
that they saw it happen differently. Especially when we miss seeing
things with clarity, our brains interpolate and fill in the blank spaces
in our recollection. When our brains do this, it is subconscious. We
don't know it's happening. We simply believe in the veracity of our
memories, even though they may not be exactly what happened; they may
have some pieces filled in by our brains. And when our brains
interpolate the spaces between our memories, they may not be accurate,
and what our brain adds to our memories is based on what we already
know, and that is where our life experiences come into play. So the
truth is always somewhere between the two stories. In law, we seek to
get as close to the truth as our limited memories allow us to do.
Evidence allows us to get closer than we've ever gotten before, and it
helps to support our fallible memories. But while we always seek the
truth, we actually are searching for what we can prove. And in court, we
try to prove **guilt.** In other words, *is it more likely than not that
this person did what they are accused of doing*. In criminal court, it's
guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, and in civil court, it's liability
based on preponderance of evidence. *But it's not exact truth*.

Okay, so now back to the question. How can we believe the victim and
also allow for due process?

I think that in most cases, most victims are believable, and in most
cases, we do believe the victim. There are some accusers who were later
proven to have lied and made up their claims, but in most cases, I think
the victims are fairly believable.

What has happened in recent times is that victims of sexual abuse are
coming forward *decades* after their alleged abuse and are making
claims. Legally speaking, *nothing should happen in these cases.* Why?
In America, you are innocent until proven guilty in a court of law. The
probability of getting a fair trial where guilt or liability can
reasonably be established, after so much time, is strikingly low. Does
this mean we don't *believe the victim*? Certainly not. We likely do
believe the victim believes that her account exactly explains what may
have happened. But because of all the reasons we've discussed, it
probably doesn't exactly describe exactly what happened. However, and
this part is critically important, **it matters not what we believe. It
only matters what we can prove.** And after so much time, we can't prove
much.

However, men's lives are being destroyed (they lose their jobs, their
homes, their marriages, their families) over mere *allegations* which
are unproven and the memories of which have likely degraded so badly
over time that they are unlikely to depict much of exactly what
happened.

So how do we merge **believing the victim** with **achieving due
process?** ***We separate belief from provability.***

Believe the victim. Believe that the victim endured *something* which
happened a long time ago (assuming that the victim is following the
current trend and is coming forward decades after an alleged abuse), and
support the victim. Ensure that the victim is cared for, physically and
psychologically. Understand that memories degrade over time, and that
what the victim remembers may not be an exact replica of what actually
happened, but believe that the victim endured *something* terrible, and
support that victim.

But (and here's the less-than-popular part), *don't expect that after
decades of silence, we can destroy the accused's life.* We shouldn't
expect his employer to fire him over an allegation. We shouldn't expect
a TV and movie actor to lose his role on a TV show because of an
allegation of abuse decades ago. We shouldn't expect a Congressman to
resign because of an allegation of abuse decades ago. And this is part
of societal expectations. If we expect these things to happen after an
allegation, they will. If we begin to expect that they should not, then
the trend will change.

So in my opinion, two things have to change.

1.  We the public have to stop believing that it is right that a man's
    life be destroyed over an allegation.
2.  We need to encourage victims to come forward *while we can do
    something about it*.

We should make sure that while we support the victims, we shouldn't
accept the current trend of destruction of the life and livelihood of
the accused so many years after the alleged abuse occurred. It is really
up to us to show businesses and industry and government that this
practice of retaliation against the accused, without so much as an
investigation, let alone a trial, is unacceptable. Before you reach for
the comment section to flame this, remember this is not an indictment of
the victim. But the victim *shares some responsibility* to bring the
allegation forward in a timely manner. We should be using this movement
to encourage victims to come forward while we can still prosecute a case
of sexual assault. In most states, the statute of limitations is only
two to three years for civil sexual assault. If you want to see
something done about these crimes, encourage victims to come forward
while we can prosecute the crime.
