First of all, I want to commend you for making this comparison to the
parable of the Prodigal Son. Most people just ignore the fact that the
parable continued after the son came home, but you did not.

Josh Conrad from Vox Church wrote probably one of the best blog posts on
the (other) prodigal son---the one you're talking about. I want to quote
it in its entirety, and I really want you to read and understand it.
Take time to read this, it's really good.

What a powerful reminder for us!

The most important pull quote: "Stop building your case. Ignore the
instinct to *earn* what God has given to you *freely*, and find your
greatest satisfaction in His undeserved, unmerited, and never-ending
grace."

I wish you all the best.
