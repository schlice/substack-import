**Content:** [I respect your opinion and I thank you for sharing it with
me and the larger Quora community.\
\
I hate to leave with such a half-baked and dismissive answer, but
\"let\'s wait and see\" is unfortunately how this is going to play out.
Either the governor is going to assist the legislature in clarifying the
law to ensure that it does not cover discrimination, or we will have to
see some judicial interpretation that proves that cases of
discrimination are not covered by the law as the legislature and the
governor claim.\

Thanks again for a substantive and thoughtful
conversation.]{.rendered_qtext}
