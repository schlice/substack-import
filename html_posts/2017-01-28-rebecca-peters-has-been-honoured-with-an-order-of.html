The Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian award the
government can bestow.

If I were to give it to someone who advanced the cause of gun control,
it would be James Brady. Brady was Ronald Reagan\'s press secretary and
was shot by John Hinckley, Jr. in 1981. He founded the Brady handgun
initiative, and the Brady law which imposed waiting periods on certain
handgun purchases bears his name.
