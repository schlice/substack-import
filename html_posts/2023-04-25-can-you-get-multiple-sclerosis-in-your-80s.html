Yes.

It is called "Late-Onset MS" and it is fairly rare. One
[[study](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=c2ac9b&url=https://doi.org/10.1590/0004-282x20170070){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="doi.org"}]{.qlink_container} shows that as many as 4% of MS
patients are diagnosed with Late-Onset MS, which is characterized as a
primary diagnosis of MS after age 50.

I actually knew a PA in Colorado who was diagnosed with Late-Onset MS.
He was in his 70s and already had heart trouble, so he and his
neurologist decided that they would not treat it.

Treatment is the same whether you're 40 or 80, but not treating MS
diagnosed in your 80s is also an option. There is a risk/benefit
calculation you have to take: how disruptive to my life will the
medicine be in order to receive a moderate ability to slow down the
progression of the disease? At a certain point, the interference with
normal life and side effects caused by the medication becomes too great.

But that's a decision between you and your neurologist. No one gets to
decide how to treat your MS but you, and whether and when it's no longer
worth it to you to do so.
