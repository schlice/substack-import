Science cannot prove the nonexistence of God, just as science cannot
prove the existence of God. Science deals with the empirical. It deals
with things you can test and hypothesize and observe. Trying to find
material evidence of an immaterial God is simply impossible, not because
we haven't found it yet, but because such evidence *cannot* exist. It's
like trying to use an X-Ray machine to find a plastic spoon.

Secondly, while you can prove an affirmative existential proposition,
you cannot prove a negative existential proposition. For example, I
could tell you that red eagles exist, and you could tell me that red
eagles do not exist. In order to prove my position, I only need to
provide some evidence of at least one red eagle existing in order to
prove my assertion. But you would have to comb the entire universe and
literally be at every place at once to prove that no red eagles exist or
ever did exist. This is why intellectually honest atheists admit that
you cannot prove that God does not exist.
