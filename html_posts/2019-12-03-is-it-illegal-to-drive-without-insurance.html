**Why is it illegal to drive a vehicle without insurance?**

Because the state owns the roads, and the state gets to determine who
gets to use those roads and under what conditions.

- The state mandates that you have a driver's license.
- The state mandates that your car be registered.
- The state mandates that you carry, at a minimum, bodily injury and
  property damage insurance if you cause damage to other people and/or
  other things (though some states require more).
  - The exception to this: some states may not require you to carry
    insurance. Those states could require you to put up a cash bond in
    lieu of insurance, or show that you have enough money to cover any
    injuries you may cause. However, this is most definitely the
    exception rather than the rule (something like three states allow
    this). The vast majority of states require you to carry commercial
    insurance.
