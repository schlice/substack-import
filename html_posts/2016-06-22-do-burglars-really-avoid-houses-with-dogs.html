I've written this on other answers regarding home security, but if you
can remember this story, you'll remember all you need to know about home
security.

Two hunters were hunting in the African bush when they stumbled on the
den of a few lions and lionesses. As the hungry cats started stirring
and preparing to capture their next meal, one of the hunters stopped,
reached into his bag, and produced a pair of running shoes.

The second hunter looked incredulously at him and said, "What are you
doing??? You can't outrun a lion!"

The first hunter said, "I don't have to outrun a lion. I only have to
outrun *you*."

The same applies to home security. You don't have to make your home a
veritable fortress. You just have to make your home *less attractive* to
burglars than your *neighbor*'s home.

Now, if you live out in the country and your nearest neighbor is miles
away, well then, you're on your own.

But if you're like most people, in a suburban setting, in a community of
other houses, you only need to ensure your home is less attractive to
burglars than other houses in your neighborhood.

Burglars, above all, don't want to be seen or heard. They want to do
their business and get out without being seen. This means that, for the
most part, they will be doing their work at one of two times:

1.  In broad daylight
2.  In the middle of the night

*In broad daylight? Are you out of your mind? That's when they'd be the
most visible!* Yeah, assuming anyone was **home**, which in most of
Suburbia is simply not true during the day. Most people are at work,
kids are at school, etc. And with more than one wage earner in a
household becoming more and more common, having most people in the home
gone during the day leaves your home open for intrusion, and no one
around to see what's going on.

The middle of the night is far more sketchy, because people are home but
sleeping. You have to be really stealthy to rob houses while people are
home, and most burglars simply aren't interested in the possibility of
waking someone up.

In either case, making your home less of a target is the goal. Clearing
away places where burglars can hide, planting pointy bushes beneath
windows, adding security lighting to the exterior of the home, **and
getting a dog** are all part of the ***security in layers*** methodology
you should be employing when looking at the security of your home. You
can add security systems and cameras and panic rooms as your funding
allows, but some of these things that you can do without a tremendous
cost would be:

1.  Adding a timer to your exterior lights so they come on at dusk and
    go off at dawn. Along with this, replacing the bulbs with
    high-efficiency LED or CFL bulbs will negate some of the cost
    associated with leaving your exterior lights on all night. In the
    long run, this will probably *save* you money, as these bulbs are
    far more cost-efficient to run than a traditional incandescent light
    bulb.
2.  Clear away big shrubs from in front of your home's windows. Any
    place a burglar can hide from view while he does his business is a
    bad thing for home security. You can also plant pointy shrubs
    underneath your exterior windows, making it even tougher for
    burglars to get in.
