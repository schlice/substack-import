Follow the model of the Boy Scouts of America. They have been doing the
job the government refuses to do and has been teaching shooting to
elementary school age boys for decades.

The Scouts use pump-action BB rifles to simulate firearms. They teach
the boys to treat them ***exactly*** the same way as a loaded firearm.
They teach the boys range discipline and weapons discipline, teaching
them to have a healthy respect for the weapon at an early age. We (adult
leaders) hold the firing ranges as sacrosanct, and we make sure we show
the same respect to the weapons that they boys should.

We also do archery with the boys. Some school gym classes do archery.

We could very easily transfer the Scouts model to school gyms. Adding BB
courses alongside archery courses is a great way to introduce the
respect for guns at an early age. As long as the guns are treated in the
same way you would treat any other firearm, you can teach gun safety in
a safe and responsible way, and the kids can still put holes in paper
targets.

To go further, we could re-introduce shooting clubs to high schools for
those who wish to pursue the sport.

The *effect* would be to de-mystify guns. Guns, like alcohol, are
somehow magical and mysterious because they are restricted. While Eddie
Eagle's advice to kids about what to do when you see a gun (Stop, Don't
Touch, Leave the Area, Tell an Adult) may be wise for the untrained, it
teaches children that guns are things to not touch. Mix a rebellious,
hormonally-charged teenager with something they are not allowed to do,
and they will do it, *just because*. If instead, they looked at a gun
and said, "Meh, I know all about those," accidental shootings by
children would plummet.

Conversely, if we don't couple this with a commensurate increase in
psychological evaluations of children, we may see an increase in
*intentional* shootings by children.
