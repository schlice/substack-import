**Content:** [I heard once that a person placed an FBI jacket and an
empty shoulder holster in his luggage so that TSA officials would
scrutinize his luggage less. I certainly hope that\'s not the case, but
I can\'t imagine that it wouldn\'t be. I could see TSA screeners looking
less closely at the contents because of the items they found in the
luggage, or perhaps if they were apt to take things from luggage,
they\'d be less apt to take something from that luggage. That\'s social
engineering.\

I would think putting police emblems on your items where they can be
seen in plain sight is more likely to get *you* into trouble. The
thought here is that you\'re misrepresenting yourself, or attempting to
gain privilege or special treatment by displaying police insignia.
Impersonating a peace officer is a fairly serious
crime.]{.rendered_qtext}
