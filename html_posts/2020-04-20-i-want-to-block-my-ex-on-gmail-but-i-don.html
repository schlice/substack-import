**I want to block my ex on Gmail but I don't want our past emails to be
deleted. Does anyone know if they will be deleted?**

You said you want to "block your ex on Gmail." So let's make sure that
we fully understand what we're asking for:

- block: means you will no longer see or keep (your choice) the incoming
  emails
- Gmail: the online mail program. Not chat, not Facebook, Gmail.

In order to accomplish what you're asking, you need to set up a rule.
This rule will either auto-archive, or auto-delete, the incoming mail in
question. **It will not affect any of your existing messages unless you
tell it to.**

Here's how you do it:

1.  Find one of the messages from this person and select it. The email
    will have a checkbox next to it on the left.
2.  Click the three-dot menu at the right-side of the row of buttons
    just below the search bar.
3.  Choose **Filter messages like this**
4.  You will see a message selection box populated with the email
    address from the email in question. Without changing anything else,
    click the button which says **Create filter** at the bottom.
5.  A new window will appear titled "When a message arrives that matches
    this search". You have the option here of either keeping the mail
    and just not seeing it, or deleting it outright. If you want to keep
    it but just never see it, select the first two boxes: **Skip the
    Inbox (Archive it)** and **Mark as read**. If you don't want to keep
    the messages at all, click **Delete** **it**. DON'T CHOOSE ANYTHING
    ELSE. ***ESPECIALLY*** the box at the very bottom which says "Also
    apply filter to X matching conversations". That would perform that
    action on all of your existing mail, and if you chose "Delete it,"
    that would delete all your existing email.

You might want to keep the messages and just not see them. Who knows,
they may be useful in the future. But if you really don't want to keep
them, set your filter to simply delete them as soon as they arrive.

The magic of filters.
