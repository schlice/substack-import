If I feel instant resentment because of a phrase, that's my problem, and
no one else's.

Thankfully I don't have that problem. I don't feel anything when someone
describes themselves.

I do have that "association" problem where someone says something about
themselves, and I think other things about them, through association.
For example, someone tells me they are "anti-gun" or "pro gun control"
and I usually think that they are liberal, or Democratic, or
progressive. And usually I'm right, but the association is my problem.

But none of that is relevant. I don't care that you're anti-gun. Feel
free to be anti-gun all day. Don't ever buy one. Don't ever own one. You
are absolutely free to do whatever you choose.

**The minute I have an issue is where you start to tell me what I can do
and what I can't do**.

Be anti-gun. Enjoy that. That's your business. *But don't tell me what I
can do.* If I want to be "pro gun" or "pro gun rights" or whatever,
that's my business. If I want to own a gun, if I want to take the time
and invest the money to get a concealed weapons permit, that's also my
business. If I want to go out in public with my concealed weapon, again,
my business, not yours.

My concealed weapon doesn't impact you. My lifestyle choice doesn't
impact you. Don't take it upon yourself to insert yourself into my
business.

Anti-gunners choose to not own guns, and that's fine. But then they
attempt to tell me that I can't own guns either, and that's where I have
an issue. I don't tell anti-gunners that they *must* own guns. I don't
understand why they deign to tell me that I can't, or shouldn't.

(EDIT) I want to answer the new question.

> *Gun owners, do you have any hope for a satisfactory resolution to the
> gun rights issue?*

I have little hope, because I know that gun control advocates want
nothing short of the banning of all legal gun ownership in America.
Nothing less will do.

While we have already addressed this issue here on Quora, there are lots
of things that we can do which might actually make some difference.

- While some major work would have to be done, I believe some form of
  safe storage should be mandated in households where small children are
  reasonably expected to be present. I know, lots of pro-gun folks don't
  like this, but I believe technology has come far enough that gun safes
  are both quickly accessible (i.e. within seconds) and make guns safe
  from children. If we say we're protecting children, this should only
  be applicable for households in which children under 16 are reasonably
  expected to be. If it is a household of all adults, or where children
  are not routinely present, it shouldn't be mandated. We should also
  not mandate safe storage to prevent gun theft. It's not incumbent on
  the law-abiding to correct the misdeeds of the criminal, and if gun
  owners don't take reasonable steps to prevent any theft in their house
  (let alone gun theft), it's not a punishment we lay on the victim.
- We should get tough on the gun laws we already have. I know people
  have vapidly parroted this line in the past, but to me, this means
  forcing prosecutors to levy this charge any time a gun is involved in
  a crime, and making it so that this charge cannot be plea bargained
  away. Too many times, prosecutors have told defendants that they would
  waive the gun charges if they plead guilty to
  \<insert_other_crime_here\> and it makes the commission of a crime
  with a gun moot. Criminals will continue to commit crimes with guns
  because they know they can get the gun charges dropped if they plead
  to something else. Criminals will think twice about using a gun if
  they know that if caught, they will be charged with a gun crime, and
  it will stick.
