Homophobia means "fear of homosexuals." God is not homophobic, as he
does not possess the capacity for fear.

Intolerant means "not tolerant of views, beliefs, or behavior that
differ from one\'s own." In that respect, he is intolerant.

Why? Because he is perfect. He does not tolerate sin in any form. In his
kingdom, sin has no place. Sin is an earthly function. Since God is
just, as well as loving, all sin must be atoned. This means all sin must
be paid for. People with sin debt cannot enter the kingdom of heaven.

Christians know that their sin debt was paid by Christ through his death
and resurrection. So our sin is paid for.

Non-Christians have to pay their own sin debt, and that cannot happen in
the kingdom of heaven, so they are banished from God's sight.

So what's the point of telling you all this? It's because the actual sin
is irrelevant. We're all sinners. We have all fallen short of God's
standard. It is impossible for us to earn our way into heaven.

But God loves us all. He gives us a way to heaven. It's very simple:
**repent** and **believe**.

*Repentance* means admitting, **and then turning away from,** sin. Jesus
said it many times in the Bible: **your sins are forgiven, go and sin no
more.** Admitting your sin and then *turning away from it* is what is
required. In simpler terms: admit that you did the bad things, and stop
doing the bad things. And the bad things are anything he says is bad. He
can say that because he is God. He is the creator of all. So he gets to
make the rules. In fact, he made the rules a very long time ago, like
when he created the universe and everything in it.

*Believing* means understanding why Christ had to die on the cross, and
what that means for our sin. Christ died once, for all. He cleansed us
of our sins with his death, and he defeated death when he was
resurrected.

That's it. It says nothing about who you love. It says nothing about
what you believe you were born with or not. It only says turn away from
doing the bad things, and live your life focused on him, not on anything
else.

Also, no one said it would be easy. Nowhere in the Bible does it say
that believing in Christ makes your life perfect. Far from it. The Bible
tells you to *expect* trouble, because it will come. You are admonished
to be ready for it.

So you're gay? So what? You have something born in you, just like I do.
I have things in me I've had to struggle with my whole life. Mine's not
homosexuality, but it is similarly difficult to ignore. We all do,
whether we admit it or not. The Bible calls them "thorns in the flesh,
messengers of Satan." When Paul talked about them in the Bible, he said
that he asked God three times to take it away, and God said no. He said,
"My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in
weakness." (2 Cor 12:9) This means that God's grace is enough to
overcome any of your earthly struggles, and his power shines through
when you are weakest. We want our lives to glorify him rather than
ourselves. When we are weak, God is strongest in us, and our lives
reflect him instead of us.

So yes, living with the pain of not acting on the desires of your flesh
is hard. I fully expect it to be. But it's up to you to do it. It's not
up to you to shake your fist at God and say, "Why did you make me this
way? Fix me, or else!" Really? Accept your brokenness, just as we all
do. You are no more broken than I am.

**But saying that you and I are broken doesn't make us homophobic.** Far
from it. We love you. We don't love what you do. "Love the sinner, hate
the sin." Because we recognize that we are all sinners, I'm no better
than you. I'm a sinner, too. But I accept my sinful nature and I strive
to avoid the sin. I know my weaknesses. They tempt me daily. Hourly,
even. But living in Christ means that you recognize the fruits of Satan
and you consciously put them aside. It's hard, but it's doable. And it's
hard to hear someone tell you that you're broken, because you don't want
to hear that. No one wants to hear that they are broken. But I know
you're broken, because *we are all broken*, in different ways. You're
not unique in that respect. Don't live in your brokenness. Live *better*
than it.

And for the sake of your soul, I ask you to think about it. If you're up
for it, talk to God about it (in other words, pray about it). He will
never abandon you. He will never give up on you. He will always love
you. There is nothing you can do, nowhere you can go, to escape his
love.

He will love you through it. Now give yourself the opportunity to love
him, too.
