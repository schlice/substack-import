**I know it\'s illegal in NYS to possess marijuana, but is it illegal to
ingest it as well? Could you be ticketed twice, once for having it, and
once for ingesting it?**

No, because as far as I know, there is no statute for unlawful ingestion
of marijuana.

In New York, there are indeed separate charges, but the charges are not
for ingesting it. The charges are for unlawful possession, and for
unlawful sale. New York does have a medical marijuana process, and they
have also decriminalized marijuana in small amounts (less than 25
grams). Possessing less than 25 grams of marijuana will get you a fine
of no more than \$100, assuming you haven't been convicted of the same
crime within the last three months.

If the marijuana is burning, or it is in public view, or if you possess
anywhere more than 25 grams but less than 2 ounces (57 grams), the
charge immediately becomes a fifth-degree criminal possession of
marijuana, a Class B misdemeanor, carrying a possible three-month
sentence. Amounts in the 2--8 ounce (57--227 g) range are fourth-degree
criminal possession of marijuana, a Class A misdemeanor for which
offenders can receive up to six months in jail. Any of these
misdemeanors will get you a criminal record.
