**When will cell phones become picture phones like Dick Tracy?**

Dick Tracy famously had a watch phone.

There's even an [[Indiegogo
campaign](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=d573f2&url=https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/dick-tracy-the-official-watch--4%23/){.external_link

working Dick Tracy watch phone

In 1964, Tracy began sporting a Watch TV:

We're pretty close today.

Android Wear allows for video to be shown on a watch. Apps like Glide on
WatchOS or the native Messaging app on Android Wear allow you to record
voice messages and send them as text messages. But since our watches
don't yet have front facing cameras on them, having a two-way video call
through the watch isn't quite a thing yet.

If enough of the market wants to use their watch as a video camera for a
FaceTime call, Apple will start including small front-facing cameras in
their watches. I'm just not sure there's a huge demand for it yet.
