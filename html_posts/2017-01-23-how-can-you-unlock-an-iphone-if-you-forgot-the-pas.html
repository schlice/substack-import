There are a few ways. None of them are wonderful.

1.  Continue entering wrong passwords until the iPhone is wiped,
    assuming that it was set to wipe after a certain number of incorrect
    passwords. Once it is wiped, restore from the most recent iCloud
    backup.
2.  Use someone else's phone or a tablet to log into
    [[iCloud.com](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=f30a9e&url=http://iCloud.com){.external_link
    rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
    onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
    qt-tooltip="icloud.com"}]{.qlink_container} with your iTunes
    credentials and wipe your phone remotely. You'll find the remote
    administration options under "Find my iPhone" assuming that it was
    enabled on the iPhone in question. Again, once it is wiped, restore
    it from the most recent iCloud backup.
