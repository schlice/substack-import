Let's break this down, since you actually have a few questions here.

> *If the police served a search warrant on the wrong house (mine)*

If the house is wrong, when the police knock on the door and you open
the door, they tell you they have a search warrant to search your house,
and ask to see the warrant, you say, "114? No, 114 is down the street.
This is 144." Or, you say, "Yes, this is 144, but there is no Smith that
lives here, I'm Mr. Jones, and this is Mrs. Jones, and we are the owners
of this property."

This is what's known as a "mistake of fact." It is an error, everyone
has a good laugh and the police go their own way.

(EDIT) Lots of people seem to be conflating "serving a search warrant"
with "no-knock warrants," and I credit the media for causing the
confusion. Let's be clear: in the vast majority of cases, you serve a
search warrant by knocking on the door, waiting for the homeowner to
answer, and presenting them with the warrant as you enter. No-knock
warrants are what you usually see on TV, where the door is busted in
with a ram and the police scream while they enter, "Police! Search
warrant!" The difference between an announced warrant and a no-knock
warrant is the condition of the front door when the police leave.

We've discussed the intersection between the Castle Doctrine and
no-knock warrants on here before:

(EDIT2) It was then asked, "Well, what if you tell them they have a
mistake of fact, and they proceed to search anyway?" The short answer is
*you let them*. There are a scant few circumstances in which anything
they find would be legally admissible in court. Even plain view items
would be ruled inadmissible as the only reason the police were present
in the house was a mistake in fact, and there is no criteria to show
inevitable discovery. Admission of evidence found as part of a mistake
in fact search would be dismissed under 4th Amendment protections, as
such an admission would almost certainly be considered "unreasonable."

> *I defended my home with a firearm (in theory legally)*

In the vast majority of jurisdictions (Texas being a notable exception),
you do not defend your ***home*** with a firearm. You only defend your
***person*** with a firearm. Most Castle Doctrine states start their law
by saying that a homeowner has an absolute right to feel secure within
their home, so you may defend your life with a firearm if you are
threatened. This means that someone must

1.  Unlawfully enter your home
2.  Armed, and
3.  With the intention of doing you harm.

The police only meet one of these criteria (they're armed), they're not
entering your home unlawfully (the entered under mistake of fact, which
is not technically unlawful), and they do not intend on harming you.
Because of that, you are not legally authorized to use deadly force.

Therefore, had you defended your home against the police with deadly
force, if you manage to make it out of that situation alive (which is
unlikely), you would be arrested and charged with aggravated assault
against a peace officer, and if you happened to kill one of them,
murder.
