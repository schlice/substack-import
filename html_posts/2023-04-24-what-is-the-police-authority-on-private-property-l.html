In general, police cannot enter private property without probable cause
and a search warrant. This is because of the Fourth Amendment, which
prohibits unreasonable search.

There are, as with everything, exceptions to that rule. Among other
reasons, police can enter private property if they see something illegal
in plain view. This is called the "plain sight" exception. With
marijuana being such a distinctive smell, the "plain smell" exception
extends the "plain sight" exception.

Also, if the police see or hear a person in distress, or if they see or
hear a crime being committed, or if they are made aware that evidence is
going to be destroyed or a known fugitive is going to escape, the
exception called "exigent circumstances" allows police to enter that
private property.

There are other limited exceptions to the warrant requirements (i.e.
search incident to an arrest, etc), but plain sight and exigent
circumstances are the biggest ones.

Beyond any exceptions though, in order for police to enter private
property, they must have a warrant to search. This is the requirement
under the Fourth Amendment.
