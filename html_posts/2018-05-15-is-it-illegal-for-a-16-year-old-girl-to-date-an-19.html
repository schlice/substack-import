**Is it illegal for a 16 year old girl to date an 19 year old guy in
Colorado?**

There are no laws against dating (except the ones I enforce in my own
home).

There are laws against sex with underage people. However, in Colorado,
there is a "close-in-age" law. A person who is **under** **15** can
legally consent to have sex with someone who is **no more than 4 years
older**. Additionally, a person **under 17** can legally consent to sex
with a person who is **no more than 10 years older**.

So in your scenario, in Colorado, a 16 year old can consent to sex with
someone as old as 26, and it wouldn't be illegal.
