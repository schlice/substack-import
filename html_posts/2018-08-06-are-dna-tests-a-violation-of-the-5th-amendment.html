**Are DNA tests a violation of the 5th Amendment?**

No. DNA tests are not in and of themselves *testimony*. They are
biometric data, not testimony.

This difference between "testimonial evidence" and "non-testimonial
evidence" means that you cannot be compelled to give statements against
yourself, but you can be compelled to give fingerprints, pictures, blood
samples, and DNA evidence, and these are not protected under the 5th
Amendment as "testimony."

Clearly, this only applies when you've been arrested for a serious
crime, at which point DNA can be taken, depending on state law. If
you're just a suspect and haven't yet been arrested and charged, you
can't be compelled to give your DNA. The court would have to issue a
"compulsion order" in order to require you to give your DNA.
