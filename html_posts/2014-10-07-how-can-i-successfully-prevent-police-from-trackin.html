Android (or any phone with a removable battery): Take out the battery.
The phone can\'t be traced when it is off.\
iPhone (or any phone without a removable battery): Turn it off and put
it in a transmission-proof pouch. With the battery still connected,
there is no guarantee that the phone can\'t be traced.

But of course, if you are really a fugitive, the first thing you would
do would be to destroy your contract phone. Not remove the battery or
put it in a transmission-proof pouch, \*destroy\* it with a hammer.

Then go buy (with cash) a few burner phones. Use them a few times each
and throw away.
