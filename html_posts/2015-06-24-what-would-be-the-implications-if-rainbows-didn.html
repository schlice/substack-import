**Content:** [The Bible doesn\'t say that rainbows didn\'t exist until
the flood. The Bible says that God set a rainbow in the sky after the
flood, in the same way that you see a rainbow when there is sun after a
rainstorm. It was God\'s promise that he would never again flood the
earth in the same way He just did.\
\
It never says that this is the first ever time a rainbow had appeared.\
\
I\'d like to believe that God \"co-opted\" the image of the rainbow and
used it to teach Noah a lesson. Sorta like, \"when you see the rainbow,
remember that I won\'t ever again flood the earth like this.\"\
\
I believe this because it happened at other times in the Bible. When
Jesus shared the Last Supper with his disciples, he took the bread,
broke it and said, \"Take this, all of you, and eat it. This is my body,
which will be given up for you.\" If you\'re Catholic, that means the
bread actually became His body. For everyone else, it\'s a symbol. He\'s
saying, \"Every time you break this bread, remember my body, which was
broken for you.\" He did the same with the cup of wine, and said, \"This
is the cup of my blood, the blood of the new and everlasting covenant.
It will be shed, for you and for all, so that sins may be forgiven.
Whenever you do this, do it in memory of me.\" Again, if you\'re
Catholic, you believe that means the wine became His blood. For the rest
of us, He is saying that every time you drink from the cup, remember the
blood which was shed for your sins. Jesus used symbology throughout His
ministry on earth. We have no reason to believe He wasn\'t still using
symbology when communicating with His disciples at the Last Supper.\
\
Anyway, does that mean that bread and wine didn\'t exist before Jesus
made symbols out of them? Not at all. It just means that Jesus used
those symbols to further the message He was trying to send: every time
you break bread, every time you share a cup of wine, remember my body
which was broken for you, and my blood which was shed for you. Jesus
used the bread and the wine as symbols signifying His upcoming death and
resurrection (which then fulfilled the prophesy and saved us all from
sin and separation from God).]{.rendered_qtext}
