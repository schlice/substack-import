Let's take this a step at a time, shall we?

The beginning of the end of *what*, exactly? Maybe the beginning of the
end of the government interfering in our lives and livelihoods because
of a virus, but certainly not the end of the virus itself. To wit, we
answer the next question:

> How long would it take for Covid to completely go out of society once
> everyone has been vaccinated?

You simply can't vaccinate everyone. It goes against good scientific
rigor and completely invalidates the idea of individualized healthcare
and individual choice, which is a hallmark of American society. There
are significant questions about how safe it is to vaccinate someone who
has already had Covid and survived. And if you exempt them, you also
have to exempt people with sincerely-held religious objections, and
others who may develop complications to vaccines in general. Therefore,
you will never get everyone vaccinated.

Secondly, government scientists tell us that fully-vaccinated people can
both contract Covid, and spread it, so vaccination will not stop the
virus from spreading.

Finally, if you believe the government's scientists, Covid *will always
be around*. That's right, Covid will never go away. It will become
*endemic*, which essentially means that it will continue to evolve and
mutate endlessly, exactly like the flu. It will become more *virulent*,
which means it's easier to catch, but it will become less *deadly*.
Remember, the virus only wants to live (note: I know the virus doesn't
have a desire. We're talking about the evolution of viruses here, and
why a virus mutates. It is not ideal for a virus to kill its host, so
each new variant will be less deadly). This means that as new variants
evolve, they will do just that: they will become easier to catch, but
will become less deadly.

To that end, when you get your flu shot, you'll also have to get your
Covid shot, every year, if you want to not catch that year's flu or
Covid.

So the grand question: *when will this government intrusion stop?* When
hospitalization and death rates from the virus fall to the same levels
as influenza. Then we treat it just like influenza, with yearly
vaccination. And just like the flu vaccine, you get it if you want it.
As it should be.

> What part will the booster shots have in the mandates?

Boosters will still be a thing during the time of high hospitalization
rates from these initial variants of the virus, so it's likely that for
those who can get a booster, they will be highly recommended. I think
the hurdle for the government will be to find the *balance point*
between making sure everyone has *access* to the vaccine, protecting the
most vulnerable in society, and determining that people have a right to
declare that they simply *don't want* the vaccine. The government will
have to come to grips with the fact that they made pariahs out of honest
people who had legitimate concerns about the early vaccines. And if they
hope to regain the trust of the American people, they will have to lay
partisanship aside and do just that. And of course, this will happen at
the exact time that we see the pigs with wings flying around the
neighborhood.
