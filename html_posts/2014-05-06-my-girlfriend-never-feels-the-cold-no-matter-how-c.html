**Content:** [There are lots of things that could contribute to the fact
that she doesn\'t feel cold. Some of these are neurological disorders,
like MS or Guillain-Barr√© Syndrome. In these cases, she may not **feel**
the cold but she still may **be** cold, which could be dangerous. The
feeling of cold and the physical reaction to that feeling is a defensive
mechanism employed by the body to protect us against the damaging
effects of cold on our extremities.\
\
Some of these are things to be worried about. There are others that are
very very worrying, but she probably would know about that by now. For
example, there is a very rare group of diseases called **hereditary
sensory and autonomic neuropathy** which is a series of conditions which
inhibit nerve sensations. Usually though, when one cannot feel cold
because of this disease, they also can\'t feel hot, or pain.\
\
So usually, the causes are anything from annoying to worrying to very
worrying. It will take more investigation to determine what the cause
is, but she should definitely schedule a visit to the doctor to discuss
it.]{.rendered_qtext}
