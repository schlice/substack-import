I can't argue the point, because you're right. There simply isn't enough
research which compares childhood outcomes from same-sex parents versus
natural sex parents. I can only present what I have, and what I have
shows that far and away, better than any other family configuration, the
married biological parents of a child living in the same low-conflict
household produces the best possible outcome for that child. Unless and
until new vetted research shows otherwise, that's what I have.
