**Will senators who have stated they will not be impartial in the
impeachment trial of the president, technically be in legal jeopardy
after taking an oath of impartiality?**

Impeachment is a political process, not a legal one. There is nothing
involving the law, or the courts, related to an impeachment proceeding.
There is no legal jeopardy for anyone for following or not following
Senate rules.

Senators who violate their oaths in the Senate can be investigated by
the Senate Ethics Committee and can be reprimanded.

Recall that the oath (written by the Senate) says that they will do fair
and impartial justice under the Constitution and the law. While Senators
can never be completely impartial, they can at least approach whatever
they are presented with with objectivity. Senators are elected officials
and they work for the people who elected them. To that end, they are
never impartial, so the oath is a little disingenuous in that regard.
The Senate should think about changing the verbiage of that oath.
