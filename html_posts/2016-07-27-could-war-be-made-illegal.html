Yes, war can be made illegal. But that would be illogical.

We would be removing the ability of our own country to fight back if
another country chose to invade us. We would be tying our own hands and
signaling to the world that we no longer intended to remain a sovereign
nation, as any nation could invade us and it would be illegal for us to
retaliate.

Therefore, wars can only be legitimized in the United States through act
of Congress. While the President has first-strike authorization, he must
get approval from Congress to continue. It is up to Congress to approve
the war and to fund it.
