We should separate the two questions that most people here are
conflating:

- How ethical is gun control
- How ethical is it to demand gun control, or how ethical is it to ask
  the question about demanding gun control

The second bullet is directed at the person asking the question. It is
entirely ethical to ask the question. It would be unethical to attempt
to prevent someone from asking the question. The ethics of asking the
question is not at issue. Even if your motive for asking the question is
morally suspect in the first place, the actual asking of the question is
not unethical.

The first bullet is directed at the concept: is gun control, as a
concept, ethical? Assuming you base your ethical standards on the
foundation of the nation, then by that metric, gun control itself is
unethical. The nation was based on the natural law as written about by
Blackstone and others. Natural law is derived from natural rights, which
are assumed to be rights which exist because you are human. No one gives
you those rights, therefore no one can take those rights away. One of
the natural rights humans have is a right to self-defense. Therefore,
anything that you do which inhibits a natural right is *prima facie*
unethical.
