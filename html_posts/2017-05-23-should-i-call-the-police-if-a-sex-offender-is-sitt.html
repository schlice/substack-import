**No.**

You really don't need more context than that.

Apparently though, Quora wants our answers to be more complete. So let
me supply some details.

**Sex Offender List does not equal 24x7 Surveillance.** Someone on the
sex offender list must register their home address and must notify the
police if they move. They will be judged every time they seek
employment, try to open a credit card, or get a loan. But they don't get
24x7 police surveillance. They are not "monitored." They are "tracked,"
meaning the police know where they live. If a sex assault happens within
a certain distance of where they live, guess who will be the prime
suspect.

**Sex offenders have not lost any Constitutional rights.** They have
every other right that you and I have. They can go wherever they please
(with the possible exception of schools depending on the state). He's
perfectly allowed to sit in his car and eat lunch. He probably gets
shunned from any other place he could go to eat his lunch, so it's
likely the solitude of his car is the only place he feels safe.

Please don't call the police unless you'd like to report a crime.
