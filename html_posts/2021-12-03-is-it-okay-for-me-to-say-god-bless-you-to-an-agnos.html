Of course! In the United States, you have freedom of speech. You can say
whatever you like, even if the person you are speaking to happens to
practice a different religion than you (or no religion at all).

Are you worried that the atheist or agnostic person will be *offended*?
Because you offered a sincere blessing? I mean, it's a silly habit we
held over from the time when we thought that sneezes were evil spirits
being violently expelled from our bodies; nonetheless, it's still a
polite thing to do.

You're literally being polite. We do remember what politeness is these
days, don't we? If an atheist or agnostic takes offense at you offering
a blessing after a sneeze, we're in a far worse place in this world than
even I thought. Since you cannot control them, their offense is not a
reflection on *you*. It is a reflection on *them* and how they respond
to stimuli in their environment.
