**Content:** [The problem here, of course, is that you are comparing
apples to oranges.\
\
Civilian courts are adjudicating using the US legal system which follows
Federal, State, or local laws. Military courts are adjudicating cases
based on the Uniform Code of Military Justice, the UCMJ. UCMJ is far
stricter than civilian law in most cases, as the military is expected to
be held to a higher standard.\
\
In fact, punishment in the military is much harsher than civilian law.
You can receive confinement (prison, which still includes hard labor;
i.e. turning big rocks into little rocks with sledgehammers),
garnishment of salary, and dishonorable discharge. For crimes like
treason, the UCMJ still offers execution as a punishment.\
\
Also, this is the only area of law in the US where \"double-jeopardy\"
doesn\'t apply. Double-jeopardy is the principle that states that if
you\'ve already been tried and convicted for a crime, you can\'t be
re-tried and re-convicted for the same crime (there was actually a
really good movie titled \"Double Jeopardy\" which explored this legal
principle). In situations where you have violated both a civilian law
and a military law, the military can try you, convict you, and sentence
you, and then at the completion of your sentence, you can be released to
civilian authorities to be tried again, for the same crime.\
\
In most cases, where civilian law and military law coincide, civilian
prosecutors defer to the military to try the case first. It\'s actually
pretty rare that a crime would be first tried by the military and then
tried by civilians, but it does happen. What doesn\'t usually happen is
for civilian courts to try and convict someone and then have the
military do the same. The military would consider the civilian court
decision an administrative matter and proceed with military discipline
(i.e. counseling, confinement, garnishment, or
discharge).]{.rendered_qtext}
