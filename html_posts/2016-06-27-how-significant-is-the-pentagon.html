Since a military member's sexual preferences have absolutely positively
zero to do with their ability to accomplish the mission, it won't make
the military a more efficient fighting force.

So will it change how the military accomplishes the mission?

Nope, won't change a thing.

Although I'd hate to be the woman who identifies as a man try to take a
shower with the whole team watching her/him. There's paltry little
privacy in the military, and if you're transgender, you don't get extra
privacy. You do what the team does.

I simply can't imagine that this would be preferable to showering with
members of your biological gender, uncomfortable as it may be. But I'm
not transgender so I can't answer that question.

Also, would the transgender service member get issued uniform items
corresponding to their biological gender, or their identified gender?
The uniforms simply aren't "cut" to fit the opposite gender. How will
that work? Will they have to get new uniform items made? So an already
cash-strapped military which can barely keep its tanks rolling and
planes flying now has to spend a boatload of money making new uniforms?
This is beneficial to the military *how?*

Remember, what's most important is the needs of the service, not the
needs of the member. Yes, you need to keep your military members happy
(fed, clothed, healthy, paid, etc), but catering to their sexual
orientation doesn't make a more efficient fighting force.
