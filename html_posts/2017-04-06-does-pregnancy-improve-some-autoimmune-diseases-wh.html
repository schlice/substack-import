Pregnancy makes MS better during the time that the woman is pregnant.

MS is an autoimmune, demyelinating disease which causes the immune
system to attack the myelin sheath surrounding nerve fibers. It has also
long been known that pregnant women who have MS tend to go into
remission during their pregnancy. Researchers formerly postulated that
this was because the enhanced immune systems of pregnant women stopped
their autoimmune patterns for a while. Now, as demonstrated in a recent
study, scientists have shown that a hormone generated during pregnancy,
*prolactin*, \"\...encourages the spontaneous production of
myelin\...\".

It is also known that within a few weeks to months of giving birth,
women will likely experience a relapse (for women who have relapsing
forms of MS).
