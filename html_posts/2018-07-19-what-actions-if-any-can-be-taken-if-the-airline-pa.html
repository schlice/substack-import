**What actions, if any, can be taken if the airline passenger sitting
directly next to you or your child is viewing pornography in flight?**

1.  Try talking to the passenger first. Explain that his screen is
    visible. Request that he either change his choice of content or
    reorient himself so that his screen is no longer visible (even
    accidentally) to your child.
2.  If that doesn't work, involve the flight crew. They can either
    request that the passenger modify his viewing, or they can re-seat
    you (if availability exists to do so).

One way or another, you can easily resolve the situation.
