**How are the unilateral tariffs of Trump without congressional approval
legal and/or constitutional?**

Because over the course of American history since the Constitution was
written, Congress has spent its time handing over its power of tariffs
to the President.

Over its long history, Congress has proven that it is absolutely
terrible at national economic planning. Also, the power to levy tariffs
tends to land more with matters of foreign policy, and foreign policy is
squarely in the President's wheelhouse, not Congress.

So little by little, Congress has granted tariff authority to the
President. Initially, it was only for foreign policy reasons, but since
FDR, the office of the president has had nearly complete control of
tariffs, even in cases like Trump's tariffs which are not manifestly
foreign policy related. Trump is just scoring points with the aluminum
and steel industries, not projecting a foreign policy.
