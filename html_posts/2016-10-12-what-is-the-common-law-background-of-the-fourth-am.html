During the time of the American colonies, there were two legal practices
which were highly disliked among the colonists: *general warrants* and
*writs of assistance*.

A *general warrant* is a warrant obtained by a law enforcement or
government official which does not specify the location to be searched
or the item to be seized. It gives officials broad authority to search
persons or places as they choose, without any real description of what
it was that needed to be seized. These were routinely granted by the
Crown, to the distress of colonists.

*Writs of assistance* were similar. During the same time period, the
Crown began enforcing some provisions of the Navigation Acts by granting
custom officers writs of assistance. Much like general warrants, writs
of assistance not only allowed the holder to search anywhere at any
time, but they were permanent, and even transferable. They expired only
upon the death of the King.

The Fourth Amendment sought to provide citizens of the United States
with some sense of security in their persons and property, providing
that the government needed to be specific in their requests for searches
and seizures.
