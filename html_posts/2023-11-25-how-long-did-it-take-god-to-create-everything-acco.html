**Six days.**

That's six *literal* days, because "days" as we know them (and as the
Bible writers knew them) was the timeframe when the light was around
followed by the time when the light was not around, despite the fact
that there was no sun yet for the first three days. The time we refer to
as a "day" doesn't change.
