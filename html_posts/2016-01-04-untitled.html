So the only people who profit from this are the lawyers. Nice.

It\'s interesting that the president doesn\'t mandate that BATF actually
issues licenses. The policy just states that those \"engaged in the
business\" must be licensed, but doesn\'t specify what \"engaged in the
business\" actually means.

To me, this seems largely symbolic.
