The only use for a radar detector detector (RDD) is to find vehicles
which have active radar detectors in areas in which they are prohibited.

It's a constant battle between radar detector manufacturers and RDD
manufacturers. A radar detector uses a [[superheterodyne
receiver](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=3ba0c1&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superheterodyne_receiver){.external_link

local oscillator, which radiates slightly. The RDD can detect the local
oscillator in the radar detector. But since the RDD also uses a local
oscillator, the radar detector can essentially contain a "radar detector
detector detector" (hehe, that was fun) and when it detects the presence
of a RDD, it shuts off the local oscillator so as to avoid detection.

The original RDD was called the VG-2, but this device has been
supplanted by the Spectre brand of RDDs, developed by Stealth Micro
Systems. The "cat-and-mouse" game between Stealth Micro and the radar
detector manufacturers has been going on since the original VG-2 was
released before 2000. Today, we're up to the Spectre IV and there are a
few detectors which are immune to it, but many are not.
