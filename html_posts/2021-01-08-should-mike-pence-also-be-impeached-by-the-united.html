**Should Mike Pence also be impeached by the United States House of
Representatives for refusing to perform his constitutional duties as
Vice President, especially those specified in the 25th Amendment?**

No. Failing to perform your job is not an impeachable offense. Failing
to perform your job is an issue addressed at the ballot box.

Impeachment is reserved for "high crimes and misdemeanors." In general,
this means when a politician has done something so egregious that he
cannot be left in office.

This does not mean when a politician does their job *badly*. It also
does not mean when a politician *doesn't even do what they're supposed
to do*. There is no requirement for a Vice President to take action to
remove a President who is doing his job *badly*. That's nowhere to be
found in the 25th Amendment.

The 25th Amendment does not apply when the president does his job, but
he does it in a way that you don't like. The 25th Amendment only applies
when the president is *physically incapable of doing his job*. In this
case, he is doing his job, but we don't like how he is doing it. That
situation is handled at the ballot box.

*For the time being, I have re-enabled comments on selected answers.
Some people like to comment. Some people like to engage with me in a
civil manner, and I did kinda miss that\...a little. But do not
misunderstand, I take this step very cautiously, and I have no tolerance
for harassing or inane behavior. If you don\'t like what I wrote, tough
shit. If my answer is grammatically low-quality or is un-cited opinion
masquerading as fact, downvote it. If you think I\'m wrong, write your
own answer. But Quora is a question-and-answer site, not a debate site.
If you are simply commenting to tell me \"ackshually, you\'re wrong,\"
don\'t be surprised if I quietly delete your comment. Put anything
vaguely harassing in there, and your deletion will be followed by a
block/mute, and a BNBR report. I will do this immediately and with no
compunction. You have been warned. Be nice.*
