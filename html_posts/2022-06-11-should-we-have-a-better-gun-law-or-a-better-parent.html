Neither. We already have many gun laws, and better parenting can't
really be legislated.

The problem, which we all know in our hearts but dare not speak it, is
the decline of the nuclear family. The lack of ethics being taught and
modeled at home. The dissolving of the family and the rise (and
celebration) of single parenting. The near-necessity of two parents
working. The abortion culture, with its near-militant, but yet somehow
oddly casual, disregard for human life. The lack of focus on (and the
veritable shunning of ) mental health. After all of this, are we
surprised *at all* that mass shootings happen?

But thanks to the rise of liberalism and progressivism, that ship has
sailed. It will take *decades* to restore the family as the core unit to
train children on morals and values, and to model the same effectively
for them, if we even try.

No, it's far more likely that the family will continue to erode, along
with morals and values.

Therefore, the only way we can avoid more school shootings is to harden
schools even further.

- Employ full-time armed security
- Improve physical security. One-way doors, alarm systems, AI-powered
  scanners, monitored camera systems, etc.
- Dissolution of "Gun-Free Zones" and permitting fully-licensed
  concealed carry teachers to carry during school hours

Or even better, don't send your kids to traditional schools. Online
learning has gotten

rivals that of traditional school settings. But again, that whole
both-parents-at-work thing kinda precludes homeschooling because your
kids need a babysitter.

See how the government has both caused the problem and then provided the
solution? Hmm...
