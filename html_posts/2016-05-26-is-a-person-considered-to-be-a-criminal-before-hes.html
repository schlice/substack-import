If a person is not under arrest, he or she is not considered to be
anything other than a citizen. He may be a "person of interest" but
beyond that, he has no special consideration. He is not considered to be
a "criminal" because "criminal" is not a legal designation. It's an
adjective, meaning "someone who has committed a crime." If you've ever
broken the speed limit, even unknowingly, you technically could also
rightly be called a "criminal," so that's not a word that is normally
used. It's too broad a term to be used in law enforcement. Notice the
difference: if you are not in custody, you are free to go; you are not
being "detained."

Once a person is arrested, he is a "suspect" whether he has been
formally charged or not. The formal arrest means that the officer has
enough evidence to present a "charge" to the judge.
