I'm a conservative.

There are indeed bad cops. I have admitted this many times in this
platform. Cops come from society, and society has all kinds. They try to
weed out the bad ones, but sometimes they slip through. Also, some cops
get jaded over time, and become bad cops.

I have just done it. I hope this answers your question.
