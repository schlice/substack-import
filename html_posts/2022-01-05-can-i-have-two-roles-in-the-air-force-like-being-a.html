Usually, training in an AFSC is challenging and time-consuming. You
commit to a job when you select your AFSC, usually because the Air Force
wants to spend the appropriate money on your training and then use you
in that field. That said, there are a few ways that you can do multiple
jobs in the Air Force. But very few of them include doing the work of
multiple AFSCs at the same time.

One would be to *cross-train* into another AFSC. In essence, you would
be giving up your old career field and training into a new one. This is
only something you are able to do if it is in the best interest of the
Air Force (i.e. you're in an over-manned AFSC and you are moving into an
undermanned AFSC). The Air Force would send you back to Tech School for
your new AFSC, and then send you on to another duty assignment.

Another method would be to serve as an *augmentee*. For example,
Security Forces often employs and trains augmentees from other career
fields to, er, *augment* their capabilities during contingencies and
personnel shortages (usually due to deployments). While the active guys
get deployed, the auggies come in and backfill. Additionally, the flight
line needs extra ramp personnel during contingencies; they often use
augmentees from other career fields to fill that need during those
times.
