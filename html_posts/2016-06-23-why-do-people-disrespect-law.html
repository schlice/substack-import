People disrespect the law because their own government shows them that
**laws are irrelevant.**

For example, the President is not allowed to write law. But he tried to
do so on many occasions. He just happened to get called out on it today.
The court told him that he cannot write law, and his executive action
was unlawful. He then went on television and said, in no uncertain
terms, that it's everyone else's fault, I'm going to keep doing what I'm
doing, and the court decision doesn't affect me at all.

People only emulate what they see in their own government. When the
President can flout the law as it suits him, the people will follow
suit.

And the people resent the police because the police show them, quite
painfully sometimes, that there are indeed consequences to your actions.

This government wants you to believe that actions do not have
consequences. Have sex freely! When it makes a baby, kill it! Whatever!
No consequences! Birth control? Someone else pays for that! No
consequences! No personal responsibility! When a soft drink is "too big"
and will "make you fat," ban it! You can't think or make decisions for
yourself! Let us handle all that "difficult decision making for you!"

And then we'll demonstrate exactly how you should treat the law. As if
it doesn't exist.

People disrespect the law because they have taken the cue from their own
government: the law doesn't apply to you.
