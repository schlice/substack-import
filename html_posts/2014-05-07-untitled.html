<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: [This is a very challenging decision. Many people choose to<br>not tell their employers during the hiring process for fear of<br>repercussions. I can understand this.\<br>\<br>I can also understand the opposite position. I prefer to be up-front and<br>have the law on my side, knowing that I can\'t legally be denied a job<br>because of my disability.\<br>\<br>In your case, you are under no obligation to reveal your disability<br>during the hiring process. I assume you don\'t need any accommodations<br>to accomplish the job currently, so there is really no reason for them<br>to know. You are concerned that your healthcare costs will hurt the<br>company down the road, and I understand that. Your moral question can be<br>analyzed using some facts about health insurance.\<br>\<br>When a company buys health insurance for its employees, it does so at a<br>group rate. The more people there are in the group, the lower the risk<br>is of any one person\'s cost to negatively impact the entire group. This<br>is called the \"risk pool.\" If you are working for a small start-up<br>company with, say, 100 or so employees, this can be an issue for them<br>(it may cause the company\'s premiums to increase). If you are working<br>for a large company with, say, 50,000 employees, this is far less of an<br>issue for them (it\'s less likely that your issue alone would cause the<br>company\'s premiums to increase). Additionally, HIPAA (Health Insurance<br>Portability and Accessibility Act) says that your employer does not have<br>the right to access your PHI (Personal Health Information), so what<br>happens between your doctor, your health insurance, and you is private.<br>Your company won\'t know that you are using your healthcare benefits to<br>treat MS. More likely than not, it won\'t seriously affect them, because<br>that\'s the point of insurance. What all this means is that,<br>essentially, you never tell your company you have MS unless you choose<br>to. Even though they are paying for the insurance coverage, they don\'t<br>know the nature of your medical treatments, ever.\<br>\<br>The point is that the company cannot deny you employment because you<br>will have higher medical costs than another employee. They also cannot<br>terminate you because your healthcare is more expensive than someone<br>else\'s. The risk of this happening despite the law is obviously higher<br>when you deal with smaller companies (they are less well-informed about<br>hiring laws and about how much an ADA lawsuit will actually cost them).<br>I would rather you not have to go through an ADA battle over hiring, so<br>if you are applying with a smaller company, I would not mention it at<br>all, even after you\'re employed, unless you have a trusted colleague or<br>supervisor you choose to tell. If it\'s a larger company, I\'ll leave it<br>up to you to choose whether or not you tell them.\<br>\<br>In my opinion, your healthcare is between you and your doctor,<br>regardless of who is footing the bill. As long as your disease doesn\'t<br>affect your work, your company doesn\'t ever have to<br>know.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/Am-I-obligated-to-tell-my-new-employer-of-my-health-condition-MS-if-it-will-not-affect-my-work-but-is-very-expensive-to-treat/answer/Bill-Stein<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
