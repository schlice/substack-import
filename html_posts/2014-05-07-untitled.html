**Content:** [This is a very challenging decision. Many people choose to
not tell their employers during the hiring process for fear of
repercussions. I can understand this.\
\
I can also understand the opposite position. I prefer to be up-front and
have the law on my side, knowing that I can\'t legally be denied a job
because of my disability.\
\
In your case, you are under no obligation to reveal your disability
during the hiring process. I assume you don\'t need any accommodations
to accomplish the job currently, so there is really no reason for them
to know. You are concerned that your healthcare costs will hurt the
company down the road, and I understand that. Your moral question can be
analyzed using some facts about health insurance.\
\
When a company buys health insurance for its employees, it does so at a
group rate. The more people there are in the group, the lower the risk
is of any one person\'s cost to negatively impact the entire group. This
is called the \"risk pool.\" If you are working for a small start-up
company with, say, 100 or so employees, this can be an issue for them
(it may cause the company\'s premiums to increase). If you are working
for a large company with, say, 50,000 employees, this is far less of an
issue for them (it\'s less likely that your issue alone would cause the
company\'s premiums to increase). Additionally, HIPAA (Health Insurance
Portability and Accessibility Act) says that your employer does not have
the right to access your PHI (Personal Health Information), so what
happens between your doctor, your health insurance, and you is private.
Your company won\'t know that you are using your healthcare benefits to
treat MS. More likely than not, it won\'t seriously affect them, because
that\'s the point of insurance. What all this means is that,
essentially, you never tell your company you have MS unless you choose
to. Even though they are paying for the insurance coverage, they don\'t
know the nature of your medical treatments, ever.\
\
The point is that the company cannot deny you employment because you
will have higher medical costs than another employee. They also cannot
terminate you because your healthcare is more expensive than someone
else\'s. The risk of this happening despite the law is obviously higher
when you deal with smaller companies (they are less well-informed about
hiring laws and about how much an ADA lawsuit will actually cost them).
I would rather you not have to go through an ADA battle over hiring, so
if you are applying with a smaller company, I would not mention it at
all, even after you\'re employed, unless you have a trusted colleague or
supervisor you choose to tell. If it\'s a larger company, I\'ll leave it
up to you to choose whether or not you tell them.\
\
In my opinion, your healthcare is between you and your doctor,
regardless of who is footing the bill. As long as your disease doesn\'t
affect your work, your company doesn\'t ever have to
know.]{.rendered_qtext}
