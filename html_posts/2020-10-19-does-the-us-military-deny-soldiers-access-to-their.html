**Does the US military deny soldiers access to their own money?**

No. Not ever.

Once you are paid, the money is yours. The military can only intercept
money with a court order (i.e. you are a criminal and a portion of your
wages have been garnished), and it is done *before* the member is paid.
Once you have been paid, the money is in the bank and the military has
no say in what happens to it after that.

If someone is telling you that the military is denying them access to
their money and they need your help, they are a scammer trying to scam
you out of your money. Do not ever send money to anyone claiming to be
in the US Armed Forces for any reason.
