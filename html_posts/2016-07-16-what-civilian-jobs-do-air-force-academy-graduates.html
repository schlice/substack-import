Air Force Academy graduates have done it all. Almost every civilian job
conceivable. We have everything from Members of Congress to scientists,
lawyers, and doctors. Most recently, this doctor:

Dr. Brian H. Williams is a '91 grad from USAFA. I am proud and honored
to say I served with him.

We have had Rhodes Scholars and astronauts and government officials at
almost every level of government. We even have sports coaches of NBA
teams, such as the San Antonio Spurs:

Gregg is a 1970 graduate. We have had Olympians, All-American athletes,
and even a few NFL players came from our ranks

[[Chad

Chad is a 1988 grad.

Basically, what I'm saying is that graduating from USAFA doesn't prepare
you for ***a*** job. It prepares you for ***any*** job. Because if you
have what it takes to graduate from the Academy, you have what it takes
to do ***anything you want with your life.***
