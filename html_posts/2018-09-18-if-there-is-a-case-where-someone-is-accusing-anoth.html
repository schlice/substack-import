**If there is a case where someone is accusing another person of sexual
assault, and there is no evidence on their side, but there is a motive
for the accuser to fake the accusation, can these motives be used as
evidence in court?**

So let's separate the hyperbole about today's
"let's-drag-up-something-from-thirty-years-ago-and-call-it-sexual-assault"
from actual legal workings. You asked about a court, so let's discuss
actual law around sexual assault.

While laws are indeed different in every state, sexual assault shares a
few commonalities across all states. In general, sexual assault is a
crime or a group of crimes in which the *offender* subjects the *victim*
to any form of unwanted touching of a sexual nature. The differences
between states involve which specific crimes fall under the broad
umbrella of sexual assault. Some states have made sexual assault the
overall term for crimes like rape and unwanted touching, while still
others have differentiated their assaults based on penetration, making
the penetration crimes more severely punished than the non-penetration
(touching-only) crimes.

Also generic to all sexual assault laws is the fact that the offender
will use force or coercion, or that the victim is incapacitated
(unconscious, drunk, unable to consent, etc).

There are, finally, statutes of limitations on any of these crimes, and
they vary by state, depending on the state in which the offense was
committed.

So now that we've covered the basics about sexual assault laws around
the country, let's dissect the question:

**If there is a case where someone is accusing another person of sexual
assault, and there is no evidence on their side**

Well, we're going to have a hard time making a case if the victim is
accusing an offender of a sexual assault but there is no evidence to
corroborate that accusation. Depending on the assault in question, there
may or may not be physical evidence, so these kinds of cases are usually
made on circumstantial evidence. In general, such circumstantial
evidence of a sexual assault could be anything surrounding the incident
which would lend credence to its veracity: sometimes there are witnesses
to the assault or to interaction before or after it, or sometimes there
is physical evidence obtained by an emergency room, or there is a
confession to a friend, or there is a police report. Without any of
this, it's essentially a "he-said-she-said" exercise, and courts don't
like to convict people based on imperfect recollections alone. There has
to be a solid body of circumstantial evidence in order to bring a sex
assault case to court, and in most cases, that does not exist. FBI
statistics state that out of 1000 reported cases of rape, only 13 are
referred for trial, and only 7 result in convictions. As difficult as it
is to hear, it's highly unlikely that enough evidence exists in a
usable-enough form to substantiate charges of sexual assault. This is
certainly not meant to diminish what a victim may have experienced, only
to point out the difficulty in making these charges stick.

Additionally, as I quickly mentioned above, there are statutes of
limitations in place in each state. Depending on the crime being
alleged, there is a limited amount of time to bring those charges. If
you are outside of those timeframes, you cannot bring a charge at all,
as you have no standing to do so.

**but there is a motive for the accuser to fake the accusation, can
these motives be used as evidence in court?**

Motives are not evidence. Motive is the *intent* to perform an act.
Motive is not evidence of an act. You can have motive without an act. I
can *want* to kill someone without actually doing so. Character evidence
is admissible in certain circumstances, such as proving motive, but
motive itself is not evidence.

Motive can, however, be used by an offender to cast doubt on the
victim's claim of impartiality. An accused offender can certainly raise
the concept of motive behind the victim's actions in court, and they can
certainly do so by questioning the victim's character.
