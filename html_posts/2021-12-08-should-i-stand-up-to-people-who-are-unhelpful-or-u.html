As long as by "standing up" you mean "taking control of your answers and
your Quora feed."

Don't forget to use the **Mute** and **Block** functions liberally.
Remember: **you** control your answers, and **you** control all of the
comments on your answers. You can even Mute and Block people who are
replying to you in comments, which will prevent them from replying to
your comments as well as your answers. You don't have to allow people to
answer you!

If someone is arguing with you just to argue with you, feel free to mute
and block them. If they are violating BNBR, report them.

The key is to do this with *consistency*.

This is the right way to "stand up" to bullies on Quora. Don't worry, it
gets easier the more you do it.

Original question:

Should I stand up to people who are unhelpful or unkind to me on Quora?
