**If Dershowitz is correct that the president cannot be criminally
prosecuted for obstructing justice by firing Comey, couldn't it
nevertheless be grounds for impeachment?**

Dershowitz is talking about ***criminal*** charges, since Congressional
members were calling this "obstruction of justice," which is a crime. He
was saying that the President can't be charged with a crime when he is
discharging his lawful, specified duties under the Constitution.

***Could this still, though, be impeachable?*** The short answer is
**yes** it can. Why? Impeachment is a ***political*** process, not a
***criminal*** one.

If the Congress can see fit to find something that the president did
that was, perhaps, an abuse of his power, or intended specifically to
"derail" the investigation, then perhaps they could make the case that
impeachment is warranted.

But I don't see how. President George H. W. Bush did something very
similar: he pardoned Casper Weinberger specifically to forestall the
investigation which would have eventually implicated him, and he was not
impeached for abusing his pardon power. So I can't see how Trump,
***assuming he fired Comey specifically to derail the investigation into
him (which he did not)*** would be impeached for doing the same thing
that previous presidents have done without being impeached themselves.
