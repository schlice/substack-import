**Is Comey likely to vie for the presidency (or leader of the GOP should
Trump resign before impeachment), & would he be a popular choice?**

First of all, Trump isn't going anywhere. Even if he is impeached, he
won't be removed from office, and he's going to be re-elected.

Secondly, even if Comey were to run, I doubt it would be as a
Republican.
