ADA has done some really great things for the disabled community. Not
only has it equalized the workforce and how employers are allowed to
hire people and support individuals with disabilities, but it has
empowered the disabled community to be open and honest about their
abilities, and to seek accommodations when they are needed so that they
can function right alongside everyone else in today\'s society.
Additionally, ADA is flexible; it does not limit what conditions qualify
and what conditions do not. It simply states that you are a person of
disability if you are \"a person who has a physical or mental impairment
that substantially limits one or more major life activities, a person
who has a history or record of such an impairment, or a person who is
perceived by others as having such an impairment.\" So the law includes
both people who self-identify as having a physical or mental impairment,
**and** people who have been identified in society as a person with such
an impairment, either through history or records, or perception.

At the same time, ADA has shifted the ***entire*** burden away from the
disabled person, and fully towards providers of public accommodation and
employers, since ADA does not require the disabled to *prove* that they
have a disability. The disabled can demand accommodations, and providers
of public accommodation must comply, whether or not that person actually
has a disability. Consequently, the disabled person does not share in
the responsibility to ensure the system is not abused. The theory behind
the legislation says that the disabled person should not have to
\"prove\" that they have a disability. I agree; employers and providers
of public accommodation are not doctors; it\'s not their job to
determine whether or not someone has a disability. However, the
\"balance of power,\" being shifted so in favor of the disabled person,
with so little accountability, means that the system is *rife* with
abuse.

Many companies and providers of public accommodation struggle with how
to best offer both services to fully-abled customers and accommodations
to disabled customers. Just look at all the issues [[Disney has
had](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=f64573&url=https://www.disabilityscoop.com/2016/04/08/disney-again-faulted/22152/){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="disabilityscoop.com"}]{.qlink_container} with its Disability
Access System. In trying to balance the need to accommodate persons with
disabilities, and at the same time preventing abuse of the system by the
fully-abled (but less endowed with conscience) is proving to be a major
headache for the proprietor of the most popular theme park in the world.

So what can be done to correct this? One thing would be like they have
in the UK, a system of national identification to identify a person who
is entitled to receive benefits under ADA. It is administered by the
DMV, since it would be added to your state identification or license,
but it would be a nationally-recognized identifier. Similar to
handicapped parking spaces and their administration, handicapped hang
tags and handicapped license plates are accepted in all states, even
though they are administered state-by-state. Similarly, a simple
identifier on a driver\'s license would signify that the person is able
to receive accommodations under ADA.

Of course, such a system produces more questions than answers. What
about children with disabilities who need assistance? What if I am poor
and can\'t get a state ID? What if my doctor won\'t sign the form to get
the identifier added to my license? Do I not have a disability? And the
biggest question: is the abuse of the system worth the trouble of
identifying persons with disability in an official capacity?
