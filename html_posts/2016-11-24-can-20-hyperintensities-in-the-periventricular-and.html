*Can* it be nothing to worry about? Yes, it can.

*Is* it nothing to worry about? Once you find out the cause of such
hyperintensities, you won't have to worry about it.

But I presume that you got an MRI in the first place because you had a
symptom of something.

Like me.

I got an MRI when I had a bout of *Optic Neuritis*, which is a condition
where the optic nerve behind the ocular orbit swells, causing decreased
signal intensity through the area of swelling. The condition itself is
not much to worry about, some discomfort when looking around, and some
vision change during the period that ON is busy doing its thing. The
condition resolves itself in the "few weeks to a few months" timeframe.
*What causes it* is the more nefarious question. In half of the people
who presented with ON at my age, there was no underlying cause. In the
other half of the people, the cause was multiple sclerosis. I needed an
MRI to confirm.

My MRI showed all the signs of someone with MS. And by the way, I also
had about 20 hyperintensities in my MRI. The majority of them caused no
symptoms; what we call "silent" lesions.

I still needed a neurologist to do a full neuro workup on me, including
blood tests to rule out the most easily identified causes of
hyperintensities on MRIs (what they referred to as the "little white
spot" series). I did not need a lumbar puncture (also known as a spinal
tap) since my symptoms along with the MRI were enough to confirm MS.

So my suggestion to you: if you haven't seen a neurologist yet, now is
the time. Make an appointment (or get a referral, depending on your
insurance) and go see a neurologist. If you have an MS Center in your
area, try to get in with one of the docs in there. They are specialists
in neurological conditions, and you will be best served by the resources
they can offer.

Good luck!
