**Content:** [Ccleaner may be a bit of overkill every time. If you are
concerned about something being written to your system, your best bet is
to use either a sandbox to run your browser, or run your browser in a
VM.\
\
If you\'d like to try a sandbox first, look up Sandboxie. Far and away
the best sandbox app out there.\
\
If you use a VM, be sure to take snapshots so that if you do pick up a
virus, you can revert to a saved snapshot. Make sure to keep your
virtual network isolated as well.]{.rendered_qtext}
