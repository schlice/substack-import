Salvation is instantaneous. To be saved, you have to **repent** and
**believe**. The Bible tells us how:

> If you **confess** **with your mouth** Jesus as Lord and **believe**
> **in your heart** that God has raised Him from the dead, **you will be
> saved.** For with the heart there is believing unto righteousness, and
> with the mouth there is confession unto salvation. (Romans 10:9--10)

The passage shows us how to be saved: **repent** and **believe**.
Repenting means confessing our sins, and turning away from sin and
turning to God. Believing means we must believe in Jesus as our Savior.
He died in our place, and shed his blood to obtain forgiveness for our
sins.

Once you do that, the Bible says, you will be saved.

Okay, cool. You did that, congratulations. *So what's next?* **What do
you do once you are saved?**

The process of *salvation* is instantaneous. But the process of
*sanctification* takes a long time, perhaps the rest of your life. How
do you do that? What does that sort of life look like? How do you live
as a person who has been saved?

You keep in mind their confession and their turn from sin. You live in a
way which makes people question what makes you so happy. I want people
to look at me and wonder why I smile all the time. Someday, I'd love for
someone to ask me.

In other words, *if you were put on trial today and accused of being a
Christian, would there be enough evidence to convict you?*

Also, **learn more about God, learn more about Jesus, and learn more
about his life.** Jesus lived a perfect, sinless life, the only person
in history to do so. Learning how he did it, and patterning your life
after his, should be everyone's goal.

Finally, **serve God by serving others**. To serve God is to serve
others. It is the greatest form of charity. A person who has been saved
should model the life of Christ by serving others.

> A new command I give you: Love one another. As I have loved you, so
> you must love one another. (John 13:34 NIV)

Serve your family. Volunteer in your community. Serve your church.
Donate clothing. Serve children in need in your community. Or just be a
friend to a person in need. There is so much hate and misunderstanding
in our communities these days, and there are countless ways you can
serve others. Be a light in the darkness (Matthew 5:14).

Where am I headed now that I have been saved? *Home*, when he is ready
to call me home. Until then, I've got a lot to do here.
