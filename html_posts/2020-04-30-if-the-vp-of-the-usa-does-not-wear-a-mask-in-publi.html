**If the VP of the USA does not wear a mask in public, why should
anyone? Should not he (and Trump) be setting a good example?**

This is a great question.

Why do we wear masks in public? Is it to protect others, or is it to
protect us?

We wear masks for both reasons. We want to protect ourselves from
pathogens, and we want to avoid introducing infections that we don't
know about to others. It's a *barrier*. It works both ways.

For Pence, he is regularly tested for coronavirus. We know he does not
have it. So we know he is not spreading it.

And if everyone else is wearing masks (to avoid picking up the virus,
and to avoid spreading it to anyone else), *if one person does not wear
a mask, does it really matter?* Pence wanted to be able to look people
in the eye (which you can still do with a mask) and he wanted to talk to
people and express emotion, which is challenging to do from behind a
mask. Pence weighed all this, and chose to forego a mask.

So what was the message Pence was sending?

Right or wrong, he did send a message:

*I am unconcerned whether or not I get the coronavirus, but I am
regularly tested and I know I am not spreading the virus to anyone
else.*

While he's right, he probably should have worn a mask to stay in
compliance with Mayo Clinic's policy.
