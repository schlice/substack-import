**Content:** [Sadly, that\'s a political question, and not a military
one. If you want to judge the question in a completely military way, you
have to look at what the military is charged with doing, and make every
budgetary decision based on what their actual job description is.\
\
The question goes deeper than just job description, and it gets down
into details.\
\
]{.rendered_qtext}

- Is the military able to conduct wars on multiple fronts
  simultaneously? As military budgets grow and shrink depending on the
  prevailing political climate, this ability changes. In our current
  military configuration, the military cannot successfully conduct wars
  on multiple fronts; there simply is not funding to accomplish it.
- How technologically advanced should are Armed Forces be? We had one of
  the most technologically advanced armies going in to Afghanistan, and
  it was the simple IED that cost us many soldiers\' lives. The
  technology to overcome the IED was developed through necessity during
  Afghanistan, but that was through necessity, and political posturing
  during the process cost several years in development, and cost many
  more lives as a result.
- Eventually there will not be \"people\" on the front lines at all; it
  will all be robots and UAVs. These things cost money, and how quickly
  we start replacing troops with robots depends on the size of the
  budget.
- Our military equipment is aging. We have B-52s in service that former
  Air Force aviators and their grown children have both flown during
  their respective careers. This isn\'t just because the venerable BUFF
  is a great bomber, but because we simply don\'t have the money to
  replace the entire B-52 fleet with B-1s. Our forces will need to
  modernize in order to keep up with the security needs of a growing
  world.

\
So the question of \"how big should the budget be\" is one that is
driven out of necessity, but dictated by politics. This is the nature of
our country, and I suspect that it will always be this way.
