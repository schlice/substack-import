**Content:** [Great question, by the way.\
\
The problem here is in the definition. You use the word *justice*
interchangeably with the word *revenge* and that\'s the fundamental
problem.\
\
\"Moral outrage\" does not fuel a need for justice. It fuels a need for
*revenge*. Revenge can be a valid outcome of a justice system, but
revenge is not the only motivation. Justice can serve several moral
imperatives, such as rehabilitation, restitution, and yes, retaliation.
All of these, to varying degrees, are appropriate responses for a
justice system to produce. The people, to whom the justice system is
responsible, want all of these moral imperatives, to one degree or
another. No one should be trumped over the others, as all are
valid.]{.rendered_qtext}
