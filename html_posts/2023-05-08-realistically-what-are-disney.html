I love the people who are saying that Disney can just pack up and move,
like it's a traveling circus. They have invested *hundreds of billions
of dollars* into the infrastructure and experiences near Lake Buena
Vista and Bay Lake. Walt chose this location specifically because of its
favorable year-round climate, proximity to an international airport and
seaport, and the sweetheart deal he worked out with the State of Florida
for special district status.

In other words, it would take *years* to relocate Walt Disney World to
somewhere else, even if contiguous property somewhere near an
international airport in an area with favorable year-round weather could
be cobbled together.

And with Disney Parks, Experiences, and Products being the only
profitable business unity in TWDC, they simply can't divert any of that
revenue anywhere else. It would literally kill the company.

Let's not forget the climate that generates this kind of thinking. Less
than ten years ago, corporations were pushing businesses around.
Remember the fights over religious freedom which morphed into fights
over gay rights? Corporations were pulling out of locations left and
right. Atlanta lost the All-Star game. North Carolina lost NBA and NCAA
events because of House Bill 2 defining bathroom usage.

Republicans would previously cave to such pressure, despite being
frustrated about it.

But even though Atlanta lost the All-Star Game, Georgia's voting laws
still stand. Even though Greensboro lost the NCAA tourney, its bathroom
rules still stand. Republicans these days *must* stand up to woke
corporations flexing their muscle against the will of the state (and
thus the people in that state).

DeSantis was reading from the same playbook when handling Disney. The
Parental Rights in Education Act didn't affect Disney at all, but they
still decided to speak out over the state's actions. DeSantis contends
that as a family-friendly business, they should understand parents not
wanting young children taught about gender identity in public schools.

Republicans' disenchantment with big business throwing their weight
behind social issues will continue to play out like this in states
controlled by Republicans.

But now to the question: realistically, what are Disney's options?
Realistically (meaning, without hurting their bottom line, as Disney is
beholden to its shareholders), they don't have many. They will not
prevail in this fight; history has shown us that the state always wins
in these fights.

The only way for them to prevail is to ride it out and wait for a more
sympathetic government. Governments go in cycles. Disney has been in
Florida for more than 60 years; they can wait for a new administration
to take over in the state.
