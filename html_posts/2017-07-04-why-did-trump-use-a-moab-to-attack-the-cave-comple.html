First, I'm certain that Trump didn't make any choices regarding
ordnance. Trump and the National Command Authority makes *strategic*
decisions. It is the military commanders who make the *tactical*
decisions to accomplish the *strategic* goals.

Second, MOAB is capable of producing a concussive force which can
penetrate miles of cave systems, but it's not a great "ground
penetrator." MOP is a fantastic ground penetrator, able to get into some
of the most hardened locations, but its concussive force is limited
compared to the sheer force of the detonation of MOAB. Remember, MOAB
doesn't stand for "Mother Of All Bombs," really. It stands for "Massive
Ordnance **Air Burst**." This means it's detonating before it hits the
ground, allowing the concussive force to reach into the tunnels and
ultimately collapse them. MOP stands for "Massive Ordnance Penetrator"
which is appropriate for hardened targets.

In terms of the "proper tool for the job," MOAB was absolutely the right
tool for the job.
