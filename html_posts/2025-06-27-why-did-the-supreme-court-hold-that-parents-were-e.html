Why? It's simple. The parents argued that without an opt-out provision,
their First Amendment religious freedoms were violated.

Writing for the court majority, Justice Samuel Alito agreed, saying
parents challenging the board\'s introduction of the
\"LGBTQ+-inclusive\" storybooks, along with its decision to withhold
opt-outs, are allowed to excuse their children from the classes related
to the books while the litigation proceeds.

Alito wrote, \"The parents are likely to succeed on their claim that the
Board\'s policies unconstitutionally burden their religious exercise.\"

The school board, for its part, noted that it did initially allow
opt-outs from specific lesson plans, but it removed that ability when it
became too onerous and disruptive to manage all of the opt-outs. The
board argued that while it is easy enough to facilitate single-class
opt-outs, as the school district provides for sex education, it is much
more challenging to take children from the classroom every time that a
book mentions same sex parents or gay and lesbian kids.

To that end, parents are now able to excuse their children from those
classes related to those books while the lawsuit regarding opt-outs
continues.
