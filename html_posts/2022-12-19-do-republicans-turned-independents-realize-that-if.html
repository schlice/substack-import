This is on the list for the dumbest thing I heard on the Internet today.

**No, going independent but still voting Republican does not make you a
"closet Republican."**

The idea of going independent is that you are declaring that you are not
beholden to any political party. You'll vote for the candidate who best
represents your values, whatever party that candidate happens to belong
to. If that person happens to be Republican, so be it. Same if that
person happens to be a Democrat.

Going independent as a *voter* really has very little significance other
than...

> What exactly does that accomplish other than exclude you from primary
> voting?

In states which restrict their primaries to registered members of their
party, going independent guarantees that you will not be able to help
select the Republican or Democrat candidate (which should be just fine
for you, as an independent). When it comes time for the general
election, you'll still pick whoever represents your values best.

You are an idealist; you believe that candidates should fight for your
vote, and they should do it by appealing to you. The candidate would
have to show that they possess the same values that you do.

But since you ideologically "straddle the fence," so to speak, you're
not likely to find a candidate who checks all of your boxes. You're
probably going to be dissatisfied with every candidate. No one candidate
will be perfect for you.
