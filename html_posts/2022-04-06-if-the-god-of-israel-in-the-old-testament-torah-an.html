So the reason why this is so confusing has a lot to do with a
mistranslation of one word in the King James Version of the Bible. In
the KJV, the Sixth Commandment is listed as, "Thou shalt not kill." The
Hebrew word *ratsach* is the word which the writers of KJV translated to
"kill," but the word *ratsach* is virtually exclusively used to mean
killing without justification. The correct translation of *ratsach* is
"murder," and nearly all modern translations show the Sixth Commandment
as "You shall not murder."

God does allow killing, and as you rightly noted, the Bible is full of
references showing God killing people. He has wiped out whole cities,
including women, children, and animals. The Bible also shows God killing
the population of the entire world with a flood.

But does this mean God is evil? Does this mean God is a murderer?
Murder, as we mentioned, is killing without justification. Homicide is
what it is called when a life is taken, not murder. Not all killing is
murder.

In order for God to be a murderer, he would have to break the law, or
act unlawfully. We should remember, however, that God is the almighty
creator of everything. He literally created the whole universe and
everything in it, including morality and law. Since God is perfect, and
all of his ways are just (Deuteronomy 32:4), God *by his very nature*
cannot break the law, because he **is** the law.

But, you might say, weren't some of those people who God killed
*innocent*? First off, nowhere in the Bible does it say that God killed
*innocent* people. Additionally, *all* have sinned. No one is sinless.
Compared to God, *no one* is innocent. The wages of sin is death (Romans
6:23). **God is therefore** ***completely within his rights*** **to
destroy each and every one of us.**

When God chose to destroy the earth with a flood, it is because he
judged the entire world to be evil:

> The Lord saw how great the wickedness of the human race had become on
> the earth, and that every inclination of the thoughts of the human
> heart was only evil all the time. --- Genesis 6:5 NIV

Throughout Deuteronomy, when God told the Israelites to destroy cities
and peoples, it was because he judged that they were evil.

> You must not worship the Lord your God in their way, because in
> worshiping their gods, they do all kinds of detestable things the Lord
> hates. They even burn their sons and daughters in the fire as
> sacrifices to their gods. --- Deuteronomy 12:31 NIV

\

So what does all this tell us?

The Old Testament showed how God destroyed evil, and when God judged
evil people, he sometimes killed them. He was completely within his
rights to do so.

But we are far more fortunate today. Why? **Because God gave us an
"out."**

**God gave us Jesus**, who paid for our sin with his death and
resurrection. Anyone who believes in him and repents of his sin will be
saved.

Original question:

If the God of Israel in the Old Testament (Torah and Tanakh) allows the
killing of some stubborn Israelites and some Gentiles, does that mean
that God is evil? Or does God just have a deep and acceptable reasons
why he allows killing?
