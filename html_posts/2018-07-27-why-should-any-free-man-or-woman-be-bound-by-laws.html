**Why should any free man or woman be bound by laws that were passed
before they were born? They neither elected the officials nor voted on
any proposition related to those laws.**

Your parents are in charge of you up until the moment you reach the age
of majority. This means that your parents make decisions on your behalf,
including voting for government representatives who will structure the
law in a manner and application with which they approve.

You are therefore subject to that law because your parents participated
in its implementation (and by the way, choosing not to vote is also a
conscious decision to abdicate that responsibility to others'
viewpoints). You are subject to the law because your parents were
subject to the law, and actively participated in shaping it over the
years.

When you come of age, you have the newfound authority to vote for
representatives who will respect ***your*** viewpoints, and you have the
ability to re-shape the law if you choose.

The date of passage is irrelevant. The fact that you participate in
government (or that your parents did) is an implicit validation of the
legal authority of government, and an explicit affirmation of the social
contract.
