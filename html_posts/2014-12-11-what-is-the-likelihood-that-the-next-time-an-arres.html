**Content:** [Not very likely. Because logically it makes no sense.\
\
Being a parent, have you ever seen your children choking on something?
It can go one of two ways:\
\
- COUGH, COUGH, COUGH, \<raspy breath\>, COUGH, COUGH, COUGH, \<raspy
breath\> COUGH\
\
or\
\
- silence.\
\
Which one is more troublesome? The silence is far more troublesome than
the loud coughing. Coughing means that they are breathing. Little
intervention is necessary. Silence means they are getting no air. Swift
intervention is necessary to preserve life.\
\
Same holds true for someone who **says** \"I can\'t breathe.\" Somehow,
they are getting air to make words. The simple fact that they are
speaking belies their actual words. In order to speak, you need to
breathe. They may not be able to breathe ***well***, but they can, in
fact, breathe.]{.rendered_qtext}
