**If someone is accused of rape, and he has a video where it shows that
after sex, there were cuddling and even kissing goodbye which like
nothing had happened, does that disprove the accusations in China and
the USA?**

Nothing *disproves* an allegation of rape short of the accuser saying
that it really didn't happen.

But the behavior you noted, which was purported to take place in the
immediate aftermath of the alleged rape, would definitely throw into
question the *credibility* of the accusation.

In other words, those behaviors are not the behaviors of someone who did
not *consent* to the contact taking place. And they are certainly not
the behaviors normally undertaken when one has just been raped. Kissing
and cuddling your rapist is not, on average, an accurate representation
of normal after-rape conduct.

Such video would certainly be used to raise what we in the United States
would call *reasonable doubt* as to whether or not the accusations are
credible.
