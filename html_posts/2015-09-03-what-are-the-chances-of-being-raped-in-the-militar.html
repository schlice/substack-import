**Content:** [The risk is lower than out in public, in general.
Especially if you are on a military installation.\
\
The chances are not non-existent, as I have seen cases come through the
military legal system involving rapes. The percentage is much lower than
the percentage in society, accounting for the different populations as
well. But you do need to understand that the military is made up of
people, and in general, while military members are people who hold
themselves to a higher standard, some do not. That percentage is much
lower than the corresponding percentage in the general public.\
\
I think you\'re far more likely to get in trouble for having consentual
sex with someone with whom you are disallowed by policy (i.e.
fraternization) than you are to be raped.]{.rendered_qtext}
