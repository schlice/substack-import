First of all, virtually anyone can be sued for virtually anything, so
sure, a school can be sued.

The question then is about whether or not you will be successful in your
suit.

And the answer depends heavily on circumstances.

Chances are, you connected to the school\'s WiFi. And chances are that
when you did so, a consent form popped up which you didn\'t read (no one
ever does) which probably stated, in part, that the school retains the
right to monitor your activity while you use their resources. So chances
are that you actually did consent to monitoring.

Sometimes, schools make students sign IT consent forms at the beginning
of the school year, and those agreements normally cover any device a
student brings to school or connects to a school resource.

So you would then have to prove that they were monitoring your activity
while you were *not* connected to the school WiFi, which would have
violated the agreement you already digitally accepted.

So unless you can show that they were monitoring you while you were away
from the school in violation of the initial agreement, then they likely
retain the right to monitor any device which uses the school WiFi or is
used in the school, whatever the text of the agreement said.

Can a private school be sued for installing an unwanted
parenting/spyware app on students' personal devices they bought
themselves and the school has no legal access to?
