The Boberg utilizes both the rotating barrel and the bullpup-style
rearward magazine feed. The main spring on the Boberg is really small,
such that you are surprised that it's actually the main spring. It has a
very light slide action. Boberg claims that this gun is favored by those
with limited upper body strength because it is just so easy to rack.

I've noticed a common complaint among reviewers of the Boberg: if you
don't fully rack the slide when reloading, the round can get jammed on
the ramp and it's a pig to clear. It's a different sort of muscle memory
mechanism than simply releasing the slide to reload and it will take
practice, but the fact that it has a longer barrel in a smaller package
is simply awesome. I personally love the design; this would make a
fantastic back up gun or concealed pistol, since you're really not too
worried about reloading your backup gun.
