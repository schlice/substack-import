**How is bundling IE with Windows different than what Amazon does with
its own brand of products?**

This is a great question
[[Shri](https://www.quora.com/profile/Shri-Amin)]{.qlink_container},
thanks for asking. Let's look at what the two companies are offering,
and the answer will become crystal clear.

**Amazon.** While it may look like the Fire Tablet is nothing more than
an Android tablet, you'd be shockingly mistaken to believe that. In
fact, *Amazon is not selling you a tablet. It is selling you a portal
into Amazon services.* It may look like a tablet. It may run programs
from an app store. It may even run an Android-based operating system.
But don't be fooled. It is really nothing more than a portal to allow
you to easily consume content from Amazon. And its licensing and its
sale price prove it. These devices are deeply discounted and are
subsidized by Amazon. They recoup part of that cost by showing you
Amazon ads on your lock screen. They recoup the rest of that cost by
providing you with a portal to directly consume Amazon products and
services. For example, Fire Tablets are the only tablets which can show
content just like an Echo Show. In fact, Alexa is baked right in to Fire
Tablets. Buy the optional cradle, and your Fire Tablet looks shockingly
like an Echo Show. Surprised? You shouldn't be.

**Microsoft**. The big takeaway here is that while Amazon is a product
and service company which offers many value-added services which can be
accessed through their hardware, *Microsoft is a software company.* They
primarily make a very well known operating system, Windows. In addition,
they also make a suite of office automation applications like Word,
PowerPoint, Excel, and Outlook. Finally, Microsoft produces a web
browser, which was previously called *Internet Explorer*, or IE for
short.

The problem is that Microsoft made it technically impossible to
uninstall Internet Explorer, or to make it not the default browser. And
in 2001, the US government filed an antitrust lawsuit against Microsoft
alleging that it was intentionally trying to maintain its monopoly
position on the PC market by not allowing users to choose their browser.

Which wouldn't have been a bad thing, if Internet Explorer was a better
browser.

But it's ***horrible***. As far as security goes, it has more holes than
Swiss cheese. It supports ancient protocols which have been exploited
many times over and should be removed, but again, IE couldn't be
removed. It's slow, inefficient, and didn't contain any of the new
features being incorporated into Chromium-based or Mozilla-based
browsers such as Firefox or Chrome.

Anyway, Microsoft lost the lawsuit, with different results in the EU and
in the US, but the same basic theme: Microsoft was forced to decouple IE
from Windows and give users the opportunity to install other browsers.

Even today, they still prod you to try their browser, called Edge, which
is still years behind its competitors in terms of features and
functionality. But at least now they let you change.

\

This was a quick overview and I could go into much more detail about
Microsoft's antitrust problems, which were not limited to just IE. Just
know that the problem with Microsoft and IE was Microsoft's refusal to
allow people to uninstall it, which was declared to be an antitrust
violation.

No one is declaring that Amazon has a monopoly on Android tablets. And
Amazon is not billing a device as an "Android tablet." They are calling
it a "Fire Tablet." Meaning it's an Amazon asset, designed to access
Amazon services. Are you upset that you can't install Android on your
Echo Show? It's a purpose-built device, which is why you're probably not
upset. But the fact that your Fire Tablet is actually a purpose-built
Android device for accessing Amazon services is surprising? It shouldn't
be.
