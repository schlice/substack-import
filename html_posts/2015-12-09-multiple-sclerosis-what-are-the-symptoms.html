Thanks for the A2A.

Regardless of whether or not your dad does have it, multiple sclerosis
itself does not cause death. In advanced cases of MS, patients can die
from complications surrounding MS (i.e. choking because of poor
swallowing, etc). But by itself, MS is not fatal.

With proper treatment, people with MS will have a similar lifespan to
those who do not have the disease.

Now, on to the disease itself. It is likely that MS will manifest with a
finding on an MRI, but it is not a requirement. However, a single
symptom is not an indication of MS. In fact, you cannot positively
diagnose MS with a single symptom and a negative MRI. You can call it
\"possible MS\" but his neurologist should be doing other tests to see
what else could cause paralysis attacks. There are several other
diseases and medical conditions which can cause paralysis. His
neurologist should be chasing those down.
