The concept of sin and what constitutes it is dependent on the specific
religion you hold to.

If you are not religious, you have no such qualms about sex, when to
have it, or with whom. So this idea of when you may have sex only
applies to those who believe in the concept of sin as something which
violates the laws of your particular deity.
