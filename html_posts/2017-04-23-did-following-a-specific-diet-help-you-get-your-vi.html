Optic neuritis (whether or not caused by Multiple Sclerosis) is an
inflammation of the optic nerve just behind the eyeball.

Eating a diet which does not contribute to systemic inflammation can aid
your body in reducing the inflammation of the nerve by allowing it the
"space" to fight that inflammation on its own. Optic neuritis will right
itself within a few weeks to a few months. How much time it takes
depends on how hard you are fighting the process, and the foods you eat
can contribute to that fight.

So eating any diet which fights systemic inflammation would be helpful:
