<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [I agree with<br>[Geoffrey(https://www.quora.com/profile/Geoffrey-Reemer)]{.qlink_container}<br>on this, but let me add some legal background around why not.\<br>\<br>Even though they may be convicted felons, they are still citizens of the<br>Realm and still retain the very large majority of rights simply by their<br>status as a citizen. They already have certain rights curtailed while<br>they are incarcerated. They are \"wards of the state\" while they are<br>incarcerated, and it is the responsibility of the state to provide them<br>a violence-free living facility. In this case, the state failed to keep<br>him safe.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
