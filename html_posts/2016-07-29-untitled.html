**Content:** []{.rendered_qtext}

If I was told to strip, I would ask why. If I was told that they don't
have to tell me, I would have to decide then, wouldn't I. I would have
to decide if I do it, or do I not and risk arrest.

To be fair, I would decide at that point, knowing full well that I could
potentially be arrested for failing to follow an order.
