**Content:** [Everyone\'s always looking for someone to blame in this
country. Heads have to roll. And it never seems to be enough to actually
blame the criminal. What made the criminal commit that crime? Is the
thought that the criminal would not have committed the crime if he
didn\'t have access to your weapon that he stole from your house? I
can\'t see how the gun owner is responsible for the bad acts of someone
else using his property.\
\
That said, we should require gun owners to secure their weapons in some
way. Technology has come a long way, and small arms gun safes can be
opened in complete darkness in a matter of seconds. I can open mine in
two seconds flat, and it has a detailed combination which uses
combinations of button pushes to get the door open, but when I hit the
combination, the door snaps into my hand and the gun is right there. If
we provide enough legal \"incentive,\" a gun safe can be included with
the purchase of almost every handgun or long gun at very discounted
prices. A little government incentive to salesmen, and the safes can be
provided free.\
\
Gun owners would be required to report any theft of weapons to police
within 24 hours of the theft of the weapon. Otherwise, there could be
some limited transfer of liability for an unsecured weapon.\
\
But that\'s something that would need a lot of coordination before
making it law.]{.rendered_qtext}
