**Content:** [Here\'s the rub: most manual labor jobs don\'t require
four-year degrees. But they do require some level of training and/or
experience. And they all pay more than minimum wage. According to the
Bureau of Labor Statistics, there are about three million unfilled jobs
which require some level of training, and most don\'t require four-year
degrees.\
\
I do know that garbage collectors make around \$15/hr, and they don\'t
require any specific skillset, nor do they require a four-year degree.\
\
If you\'re looking for well-paying manual labor jobs, I\'d be looking to
vocational tech school. [[Mike

particular construction manager would be willing to pay \$40/hour to a
reliable welder, but he just can\'t find one.\
\
My advice: look for some manual labor job that you\'re willing to do,
but requires some technical training, then go get that training. Many
technical training institutes offer job assistance at the conclusion of
your training, and offer financial aid as well.\
\
As an aside, we in the United States need to do better at offering
vocational technical training to students. By removing this from
schools, we seem to have \"devalued\" manual labor in the eyes of
students. To them, only a degree matters. And what of the millions of
skilled labor jobs which go unfilled? Many find them \"unsuitable\" for
their tastes. Oh well, better for those who actually get the training
and go after those jobs, eh?]{.rendered_qtext}
