Logically:

1.  Hanging is no longer a legal method of execution in Colorado.
2.  Holmes was not sentenced to death; he was sentenced to life without
    parole.

Therefore, two reasons why he would not be hanged are that he was not
sentenced to death, and he cannot be legally hanged even if he was
sentenced to death.
