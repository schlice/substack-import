The responsibilities of the stated rights have never been written in the
Constitution. When the Constitution was written, the idea was that we
had to safeguard our rights. No one has to safeguard responsibilities,
as they are an integral part of exercising a right.

The Second Amendment has two clauses, a **prefatory clause** and an
**operative clause**. The prefatory clause \"announces a purpose\"
(*Heller* law syllabus, p.1) for the operative clause, but does not
limit or expand the scope of the operative clause. The prefatory clause
is \"A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free
State\".

The operative clause is the actual protected right. \"The right of the
people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.\" That phrase,
\"the right of the people\" was used three times in the Bill of Rights,
and in each case, they enumerate individual rights, not collective
rights that may be exercised only when participating in some form of
collective activity.

The Court found that it didn\'t make sense to read the Second Amendment
would only apply if you served in a military. \"Reading the Second
Amendment as protecting only the right to \'keep and bear Arms\' in an
organized militia therefore fits poorly with the operative clause\'s
description of the holder of that right as \'the people\'.\" (p. 7)

The Court interpreted the meaning of \"the militia\" as all of the
people being armed.
