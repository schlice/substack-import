Download [[Samsung
Kies](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=0e538e&url=http://www.samsung.com/us/support/owners/app/kies){.external_link

official management software for phones. It does much more than just
upgrade phones.

Make sure you choose the correct version. First, you'll want to find out
what version of software your Core Prime is running. From the App
Drawer, click Settings, then click About Device. Find the section
labeled "Android Version." If it is 4.3 or higher, you can use Kies 3.
If it is below 4.3, you should use Kies 2.6. Both are available for
download from the Kies page I linked above.

Good luck!
