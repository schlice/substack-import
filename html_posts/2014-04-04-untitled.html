**Content:** [Sir, I do sometimes take a very reasoned and legalistic
view of these questions. But in my heart, I absolutely and fully agree

In case you were unaware, you should know that people who are imprisoned
for harming/killing children are the \"pond scum\" of the prison
community. There is a hierarchy in prison, and child molesters/killers
populate the very bottom of that structure. Even other prisoners despise
them. I can understand how such a prisoner would fear for his life
*more* ***in*** prison than he would ***out of***
prison.]{.rendered_qtext}
