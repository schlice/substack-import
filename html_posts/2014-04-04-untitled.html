<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: [Sir, I do sometimes take a very reasoned and legalistic<br>view of these questions. But in my heart, I absolutely and fully agree<br>with you.\<br>\<br>In case you were unaware, you should know that people who are imprisoned<br>for harming/killing children are the \"pond scum\" of the prison<br>community. There is a hierarchy in prison, and child molesters/killers<br>populate the very bottom of that structure. Even other prisoners despise<br>them. I can understand how such a prisoner would fear for his life<br>*more* *in* prison than he would *out of*<br>prison.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/Should-those-imprisoned-for-murder-be-denied-the-right-to-take-legal-action-against-the-prison-service/answer/Bill-Stein<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
