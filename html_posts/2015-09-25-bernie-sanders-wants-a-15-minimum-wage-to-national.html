**Content:** [Mike Rowe (the comedic host of *Dirty Jobs*) discusses
this in depth as he
[[lobbies](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=382d4f&url=https://www.facebook.com/TheRealMikeRowe/posts/938382126171931:0){.external_link

millions (currently around three million) of currently unfilled basic
skilled labor jobs in this country. In a nutshell, he says that rather
than paying more for *unskilled* labor, put that money towards
vocational training, get some *skill*, and make yourself **worth more**.
Entry-level jobs are just that: entry level. Once you have some
experience, you\'re expected to *move on.* Entry level jobs were never
expected to sustain you, or a family. He says, \"Very few of those jobs
require a four-year degree, but nearly all require specific training.
And all pay more than the current minimum wage. If we want a skilled
workforce, (and believe me, we do,) should we really be demanding \$20
an hour for unskilled labor?\"\

Nationalizing the oil and gas industry would only serve to remove the
profit. But profits aren\'t what drive cost at the pump; it\'s the cost
of the raw fuel:\

As you can see in this graphic from Michigan (where gas is probably some
the most expensive in the country), the vast majority of the cost of
gasoline is the actual cost of fuel. Nationalizing will only affect the
2.8% of the cost which is taken by fuel stations (since they will now be
government operations). Some have said that nearly 40% of the wholesale
cost of gasoline, but [[this
table](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=77a513&url=http://energyalmanac.ca.gov/gasoline/margins/){.external_link

qt-tooltip="ca.gov"}]{.qlink_container} from California (I know,
Michigan vs California, but it\'s close, gimme a break) shows that when
gas was \$3.89 (per gallon) in California, \"Distribution cost,
Marketing costs, and profits\" were only \$0.39 per gallon. The actual
crude oil cost \$1.31, refinery costs and their profit (which are mostly
outside the United States since environmental regulations are so heavy
on stateside refining) are \$1.60, and taxes were about \$0.50. We\'d be
able to eliminate the taxes and the profit, which would cut the cost
down to closer to \$3/gal. Not a significant benefit when you consider
the massive tax increases and government expansion that will be required
to sustain the new governmental oil and gas system. And you can bet that
any refining companies which currently reside in the United States will
pick up and leave should the oil and gas industry be nationalized. Their
rates will go up, and with no chance of a President Sanders removing any
environmental regulations to increase refining in the United States,
fuel costs (the majority of which is refining cost) will go up. So
ultimately, you\'ll see some volatility, but nothing will really change
at the pump.\
\
Why a 90% top-tier tax rate? What is that expected to accomplish? Are
you trying to pay off the national debt? You could make the top *three*
tax tiers 100% and you still wouldn\'t pay off the national debt any
time soon. I would much rather see us control runaway entitlement
spending rather than simply increasing taxes, even if it is on \"those
dirty stinking rich.\"\
\
Expanding Medicaid is what Obamacare did. We\'re going to expand it
*more*? Who else is it going to cover that it didn\'t cover before?\
\
I agree that healthcare insurance is driving up the cost of medical
care, but I don\'t think single payer is the answer. I think removing
the health insurance industry will significantly reduce costs. I think
instituting tiered healthcare will further allow all people access to
basic healthcare. Heck, doctors go overseas and do it for *free* these
days; why aren\'t they doing it here? Yes, specialty healthcare will
still need some form of payment, as doctors still need to make a living,
and they did attend years of schooling and have advanced knowledge that
the average parent doesn\'t have. They do deserve to be paid fairly for
their work. And specialists even more so.
