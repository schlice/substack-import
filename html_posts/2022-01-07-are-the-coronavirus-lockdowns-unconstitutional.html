As with all legal questions, the answer is "it depends."

First of all, we must distinguish **who** is doing the locking.

The Federal government has no authority to order states to lock down.
There is nothing in the Constitution which allows them to do so. This
means that not only can the Federal government not lock down people in
states, but Federal agencies also do not have authority to implement
lockdowns. So the CDC cannot issue a "lockdown order" which the states
would be required to follow. The CDC could create "guidance" which the
states "could" follow at their discretion, but they have no independent
authority to force any state to lock down.

Similarly, as court cases are consistently finding, the Federal
government has no authority to order state businesses to vaccinate all
of their employees against their will, or to condition continued
employment on receiving a vaccine against their will. The Federal
government may have authority over Federal contractors and the military,
but they do not exercise the same authority over businesses which are
registered to a state.

In contrast, states **do** have the authority to issue lockdowns, under
their police power. Indeed, the SCOTUS case everyone is quoting,
*Jacobson v. Massachusetts*, was a case where a city implemented
mandatory vaccinations, and it was upheld because of the state's police
power. Lockdowns would follow the same authority as vaccinations.

However, the lockdowns would face scrutiny, as it would be argued
whether or not the conditions exist to necessitate such Draconian
measures. Data would be analyzed and the decision to implement a
lockdown would be weighed against the relative risk to the public. There
would have to be a compelling state interest and a clear and present
danger in order to justify such measures. And lockdowns are not without
their own concomitant harms. There are absolutely harms to individuals,
groups, and businesses from lockdowns. Children, in particular, face
outsized harm from lockdowns. This is part of what the Court would have
to weigh to determine whether or not the lockdown was appropriate and
legal.
