The only other country I can think of, off the top of my head, is
Switzerland.

Switzerland has a statutory right to keep and bear arms in their Weapons
Act of 1997. Switzerland also has \"universal conscription\" and
mandates that all able-bodied males age 20-34 are members of the
militia. They will perform a period of active duty service, following
which they remain members of the militia. They also are then required to
keep their selective-fire rifles and semi-automatic handguns at home. Up
until 2007, militia members also received 50 rounds of government-issued
ammunition in a sealed box for use during milita call-ups. The rest of
their ammunition is self-purchased.

Switzerland has the highest rate of gun suicide in Europe. However, it
has one of the lowest rates of overall homicide in the world,
considerably lower than the rest of Europe.

For the seemingly ubiquitous gun presence in Switzerland (they likely
have the highest rate of gun ownership in the world), their laws are
very tight. They require licenses to own and carry weapons, and they
also have liability laws which render the owner responsible when a third
party misuses their weapon.
