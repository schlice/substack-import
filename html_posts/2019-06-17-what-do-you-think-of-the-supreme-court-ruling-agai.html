**What do you think of the Supreme Court ruling against Virginia's House
of delegates for their racial gerrymandering of state districts to
benefit Republicans in elections?**

First of all, your take on the racial gerrymandering "to benefit
Republicans" flies in the face of traditional Democrat talking points.
It's simply an incorrect assumption, which is how most of the drive-by
media is painting this decision.

The maps that the Virginia House of Delegates were arguing to keep were
gerrymandered along racial lines, to ensure that at least 55% of every
district was black. If it were only to benefit Republicans, the current
logic goes, then it should have been drawn to minimize the black vote,
no? Because isn't that what evil Republicans do? They want the black man
in chains again, right?

Regardless, SCOTUS already ruled in 2015 that race cannot be the main
factor in drawing state district boundaries. Lawyers for the Virginia
House argued that by making sure that each legislative district had at
least 55% black voters, the state was protecting their voting power.

The Virginia House appealed, and SCOTUS simply ruled, this time, that
they did not have standing over the state AG. \"The House, we hold,
lacks authority to displace Virginia\'s Attorney General as
representative of the state,\" stated Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg in the
majority opinion. \"We further hold that the House, as a single chamber
of a bicameral legislature, has no standing to appeal the invalidation
of the redistricting plan separately from the state of which it is a
part.\" Virginia law gives the authority and responsibility to represent
the state in court \"exclusively\" to the attorney general.

RBG goes on to state that the Virginia House won't be injured by
allowing the new district maps to stand, because the entire Virginia
Assembly, not just the House, is elected using those maps.

The new maps have already been used in Virginia's state primaries.

So, my take on this? Fine, if you want your districts to *not* take
racial makeups into account, then certain districts are going to lean
very heavy towards one race, and certain districts are not, and that
race's voting power will be diminished in those districts. I guess you
can't make the claim of voter suppression by redistricting in Virginia,
because the Democrats ensured that you can suppress the black vote using
redistricting.
