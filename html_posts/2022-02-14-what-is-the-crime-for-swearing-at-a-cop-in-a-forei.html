(US answer only)

The same as the crime for swearing at a cop in his native language.
Freedom of speech in this country says you can basically swear at a cop
and you can't really be arrested. Sticks and stones, and all that.

Some localities have laws which might cover obscenity under certain
circumstances, but it would have to be a pretty unusual circumstance for
someone to be arrested for swearing.
