The original man was already euthanized. By the alligator.

All joking aside, I bet you're asking why the alligator had to be
killed. You probably think, like many others, that alligators are
hunters and killers, and that's perfectly normal. It's just doing what
it knows. But alligators hunting *people* is abnormal.

Actual man-eating predators are an aberration in nature, and the only
way to curb the urge for an animal to attack humans is to euthanize the
animal which is hunting people.
