He means the story I quoted from the New York Times that says nothing
new, just a re-hash of everything we already knew. Obama knew that, like
every other government in the world, Russia is trying to break into our
systems every single day. Yes, every other government in the world.
Russia, Israel, China, North Korea, South Korea, every one with a
computer and a way to connect to the Internet is trying to hack us.

Big freakin' deal. It happens every day. And news flash: it's no secret
that we're trying to hack them, too.

But "meddling in an election" by what? How? Were votes altered? Were
voters suppressed? Did they hack voting machines?

The answer to all of this is **no**.

The bigger revelation in the tweet is what Trump actually did say, as
opposed to what people are trying to read into it. He said, and the New
York Times corroborated, that Obama knew that Russia was thinking of
trying something while he was president, and he did **nothing** about
it. Nothing. He pulled a few ambassadors. No sanctions, no retaliation,
nothing. And what happened on election day anyway? **Nothing.**

So what does this tell us? Russia likes to bluster like all other world
governments, and they can't actually hack our election system.
