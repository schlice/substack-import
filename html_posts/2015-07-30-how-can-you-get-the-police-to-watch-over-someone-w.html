**Content:** [You did exactly the right thing. Welfare checks are common
and police don\'t mind checking on someone. Better to check on them
while they are not causing harm to themselves or others than after they
start.\
\
You called the non-emergency number, which was also the right thing to
do.\
\
You did everything right.\
\
The police probably stopped by to see if she was there, ask her if
everything was okay, ask her what her plans were, advise her of any
curfew laws that may exist in that jurisdiction for persons under 18,
and if everything checked out, leave her alone, unless it was past
curfew and she had no plans, in which case they would make her call
someone to pick her up.\
\
If the officers had reason to believe that she might hurt herself or
others, they could elect to take her into protective custody so that
they could be sure she didn\'t cause herself any harm. But that\'s a
judgement call on the part of the officers.]{.rendered_qtext}
