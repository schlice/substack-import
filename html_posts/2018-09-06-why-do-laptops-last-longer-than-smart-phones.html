**Why do laptops last longer than smart phones?**

Because they are designed to.

Smartphones are miniaturized computers that you carry with you, every
day, with hyper-miniaturized components and very detailed etchings on
the circuit boards. Because you knock them around daily, they're bound
to die quicker.

Laptops are full-blown computers in compact cases. They don't take
nearly as much abuse as smartphones do, on a daily basis. If they did,
they'd die just as quickly.
