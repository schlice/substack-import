Cubital tunnel syndrome is usually not caused by a disability, and is
normally a medical condition that can be corrected with surgery and/or
physical therapy.

If it cannot be corrected, work with your employer to try to get an
accommodation.

While it likely does not qualify as a "disability" under ADA, it should
be something that your employer can accommodate.
