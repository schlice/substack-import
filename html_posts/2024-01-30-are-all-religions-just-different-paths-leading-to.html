It's certainly a common belief, one that appeals very strongly to the
broadly tolerant American mind.

Many people say it is unreasonable to believe that only one religion
could be exclusively true. If one religion were really true, it would
mean that billions of religious people from every other religious faith
are wrong today and have been wrong throughout the centuries. And that's
a big problem if Christianity is true because Christianity seems to
teach that non-Christians are going to hell. There's also the not
unfounded fear that those who think they have the truth will be
intolerant of those who won't accept it.

Easygoing Americans are more apt to believe that no religion is *the*
truth. This sentiment is often illustrated by the favorite parable of
many university professors: the parable of the six blind men and the
elephant. This is where each blind man feels a different part of the
elephant and therefore reaches a different conclusion about the object
in front of him. One grabs the tusk and says, "This is a spear!" Another
feels the trunk and says, "This is a snake!" The one hugging the leg
claims, "This is a tree!" The blind man holding the tail thinks, "I have
a rope!" The one feeling the ear believes, "This is a fan!" And the one
leaning on the elephant's side is certain, "This is a wall!" These blind
men are said to represent world religions because they each come to a
different conclusion about what they are sensing. Like each blind man,
we are told, no one religion has *the* truth. Religions are simply
different paths up the same mountain.

This kind of thinking is, simply put, untrue.

Primarily because **truth** exists, and that which is contrary to truth
is false. So if religions teach contrary things, then they can't both be
true. While most religions have some beliefs that are true, not all
religious beliefs can be true because they are mutually exclusive---they
teach opposites. In other words, some religious beliefs must be wrong.
But you're not supposed to say that in America today. You're supposed to
be "tolerant" of all religious beliefs. And in our culture today,
tolerance no longer means to put up with something you believe to be
false (after all, you don't tolerate things you agree with). Tolerance
now means that you're supposed to accept every belief as true! In a
religious context, this is known as **religious pluralism**---the belief
that all religions are true.

\

There are a number of problems with this new definition of tolerance.

First, we should be thankful that we have religious freedom in this
country. We are well aware of the dangers of religious intolerance and
believe that we should accept and respect people who have different
religious beliefs. But that doesn't mean that personally we ought to
embrace the impossible notion that all religious beliefs are true. Since
mutually exclusive religious beliefs cannot be true, it makes no sense
to pretend that they are. In fact, on an individual level it can be
dangerous to do so. If Christianity is true, then it's dangerous to your
eternal destiny not to be a Christian. Likewise, if Islam is true, then
it's dangerous to your eternal destiny not to be a Muslim.

Second, the claim that "you ought not question someone's religious
beliefs" is itself a religious belief for pluralists. But this belief is
just as exclusive and "intolerant" as any religious belief of a
Christian or Muslim. In other words, pluralists think all non-pluralist
beliefs are wrong. So pluralists are just as dogmatic and closed-minded
as anyone else making truth claims in the public square. And they want
everyone who disagrees with them to see things their way.

Third, the prohibition against questioning religious beliefs is also an
absolute moral position. Why shouldn't we question religious beliefs?
Would it be immoral to do so? And if so, by whose standard? Do
pluralists have any good reasons supporting their belief that we ought
not question religious beliefs, or is it just their own personal opinion
that they want to impose on the rest of us? Unless they can give us good
reasons for such a moral standard, why should we allow them to impose it
on us? And why are pluralists trying to impose that moral position on us
anyway? That's not very "tolerant" of them.

Fourth, the Bible commands Christians to question religious beliefs
(e.g., Deut. 13:1-5; 1 John 4:1; Gal. 1:8; 2 Cor. 11:13; etc.). Since
Christians have a religious belief that they ought to question religious
beliefs, then pluralists---according to their own standard---should
accept this Christian belief as well. But of course they do not.
Ironically, pluralists---advocates of the new tolerance---are not really
tolerant at all. They only "tolerate" those who already agree with them,
which by anyone's definition is not tolerance.

Fifth, the pluralist's claim that we ought not question religious
beliefs is a derivative of the false cultural prohibition against making
judgments. The prohibition against judging is false because it fails to
meet its own standard: "you ought not judge" is itself a judgment!
Pluralists also misinterpret Jesus' comments on judging (Matt. 7:1-5).
Jesus did not prohibit judging as such, only judging hypocritically.
Indeed, everyone---the pluralist, the Christian, the atheist, the
agnostic---makes judgments. So the issue isn't whether or not we make
judgments, but whether or not we make the *right* judgments.

Finally, are pluralists ready to accept as true the religious beliefs of
Muslim terrorists---especially when those beliefs say that all
non-Muslims (including pluralists) should be killed? Are they ready to
accept as true the religious beliefs of those who believe in child
sacrifice or other heinous acts?

\

While we should respect the rights of others to believe what they want,
we are foolish, and maybe even *unloving*, to tacitly accept every
religious belief as true. Why is this unloving? Because if Christianity
is true, then it would be unloving to suggest to anyone that their
opposing religious beliefs are true as well. Affirming such error might
keep them on the road to damnation. Instead, if Christianity is true, we
ought to kindly tell them the truth because only the truth can set them
free.
