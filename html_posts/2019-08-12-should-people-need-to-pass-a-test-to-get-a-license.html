**Should people need to pass a test to get a license to own a weapon?**

No. And there are several reasons why.

First of all, you can't make a test to allow someone to exercise a
Constitutionally-protected right. The Constitution says you can own a
firearm. You can't make a test which requires you to get a license to
exercise a Constitutional right unless you change the Constitution. Do
you think you should need to get a permit before the police won't barge
into your home and search it for illegal stuff without a warrant? Do you
think that you should only be free from self-incrimination if you have a
self-incrimination prevention permit? Do you think you should be
required to pass a test and get a license before you can post on Quora,
or on any website for that matter? Of course not. No Constitutional
right is any different in this regard.

So bypassing the Constitutional requirement for a minute (which we must
do to continue this hypothetical), there are many items out there which
are demonstrably more dangerous for which you don't need a permit to
own. Chainsaws and wood chippers are extremely dangerous, yet you don't
mandate a license to buy one. Knives are extremely useful and arguably
as dangerous (if not more dangerous) than firearms, and no permits are
required to purchase them, and they're not even protected by the
Constitution. Cars kill more people than guns, and you don't need a
license to **own** a car. Clearly, you need a license to drive a car,
which brings us to the next point...

And that point is the question you probably wanted to ask: **should
people need to pass a test to get a license to** ***carry*** **a
weapon?**

**Absolutely yes**.

In the same way we license drivers, you don't need a license to own a
car. You only need a license to drive one on a public road. In the same
way, you should not need a license to own a gun, but you should need a
license to carry one off of your own property. You should be shown to be
competent enough to not hurt yourself or others with it. A simple usage
test and a nominal fee (not an exorbitant fee as is currently charged by
even most "shall issue" states) should be all that is required to carry
a firearm.
