I'm going to take umbrage with a few of your assertions (okay, all of
them):

1.  Christianity is a religion, if you hold to the traditional
    definition of what we consider to be a religion. It's true, there is
    no complete scholarly consensus over what precisely constitutes a
    religion, but we know that religion in general is a personal set, or
    institutionalized system, of religious attitudes, beliefs, and
    practices, the service and worship of God or the supernatural, and a
    commitment or devotion to religious faith or observance.
2.  Jesus wasn't against religious establishment in and of itself. He
    was against faith in the religion *over faith in God*. He was
    against making the practice of religion into a religion all on its
    own. When this happens, the religion aspect takes on more importance
    than the worship of God. Judaism had this problem during the time of
    the Sanhedrin just as Roman Catholicism faces similar issues today.
3.  Jesus' mission was not to "project the last frontier of human
    consciousness." Jesus as both fully human and fully divine will
    **only** be experienced by Jesus. We will receive **new perfected
    bodies** after we are resurrected, but we will not be fully divine
    like Jesus. We will not become gods. We will remain, as we are
    today, *children of God*, adopted into His Kingdom, made righteous
    by His sacrifice.\
    \
    Jesus' mission was to reconnect us to God. He came to restore us to
    our Heavenly Father. He was the only one who could. And He did.
