**Was Trump\'s appeal to emotion in the second half of his Oval Office
address a legitimate argument upon which to base policy on immigration?
Shouldn\'t we just deal with facts?**

The President doesn't use public addresses as legal justification for
law. They are political stump speeches. They have no impact on the
legality or the justification for a policy. Political speech is well
established in the law as to be non-impactful on the actual law itself.

He could have even said that he wants to build a wall to keep brown
people out, and that still wouldn't change the legality of the action.
Regardless of the feelings on which the law is based, you can only
determine the legality of the law by looking at the actual law itself,
not any emotions or political speech which spurred it.

How he socializes the law to people is only a matter of public
relations, and not a matter of legal argument.

Now, if you're asking whether or not emotional appeals are a valid
method to gin up support for a policy, I can tell you that they are.
People are more guided by emotion than logic these days, so an appeal to
emotion definitely carries more weight than one to logic and facts. If
you want those, look them up.
