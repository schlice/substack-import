**Are there any powers the president has in an emergency to extend the
time until election or cancel it all together? Could this happen if the
Corona virus gets worse?**

There are literally *hundreds* of powers granted to the Executive during
times of declared national emergencies, and those powers are all written
into individual laws. Congress writes those powers into laws as they
create them.

However, elections are not held at the Federal level. There is no one
election for president. There are 51 elections for president, controlled
by each individual state. This, and the operation of the Electoral
College is why we say **the people elect Congress, but the states elect
the President.** To that end, a national emergency cannot modify what a
sovereign state does with its election process.

Additionally, there is no provision to modify the date of the election
of a President in the Constitution. In order to allow for some entity to
modify a Presidential election, a Constitutional amendment would be
required.

In the case of COVID-19, it would be up to the states to ensure that
elections can be safely completed. For example (and it has been done in
some states already), the state can switch to all mail-in ballots, no
on-site elections at all. Colorado has been operating in this mode for
several years now and it has been wildly successful.
