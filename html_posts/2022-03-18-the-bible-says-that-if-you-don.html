So most "intelligent" people are confident that the Bible is "just a
fairy tale."

I doubt this statement.

The Bible isn't *one book.* It's 66 books, written over the course of
1500 years, by about 40 different authors, in three languages, on three
separate continents.

But there is *unity* in the message of the Bible.

Even more astoundingly, the Bible *never contradicts itself*, and it is
historically and archaeologically accurate. It relays one unified
message, with no errors or omissions.

If you believe that such a feat is a fairy tale, invented by man, if you
do not believe that the Bible is the inspired word of God, I pose the
following challenge to you:

Go into any library. Choose any 66 books you like which match the
characteristics of the books in the Bible, but it must be 66. They can
be written in no fewer than three languages. They must have been written
by no fewer than 40 different authors, and they must have been written
over the course of 1500 years. Those 66 books must all share a common
storyline, a common theme, and a common message, with no historical
errors or contradictions.

If you can do this, I will concede that the Bible may have been invented
by man. But no one has been able to accomplish such a feat, because it
is impossible.

More accurately, it is impossible to accomplish with any collection of
human writing. But the Bible passes this test, because the authors were
inspired by God to write what they did.

Original question:

The Bible says that if you don\'t believe in Jesus as your Savior you
would not be saved but perished, which means you will go to the hell.
But most intelligent people are confident that the Bible is just like a
fairy tale. What thought comes to you?
