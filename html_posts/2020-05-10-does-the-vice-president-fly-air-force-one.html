As a reminder, any aircraft on which the President flies is called Air
Force One, and any aircraft on which the Vice President flies is called
Air Force Two.

Currently, we have a Boeing C-32, a 757 outfitted for the Vice President
and which most commonly serves as Air Force Two. It is similar in most
respects to the President\'s aircraft, but because it requires a smaller
complement of support staff, the aircraft can be smaller.

On occasion, the Vice President does use the VC-25A, which is more
commonly used as Air Force One, and appropriately it is called Air Force
Two.

I flew on Air Force Two with the Vice President in the 90s when its home
base was still called Andrews AFB.
