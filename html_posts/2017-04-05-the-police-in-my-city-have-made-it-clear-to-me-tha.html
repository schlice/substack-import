That's unusual. It's going to be an odd conversation when the local
sheriff approaches your chief of police and asks him why he's not doing
his job; why the sheriff's office has to cover for the police department
in an area where the police department has jurisdiction. Hopefully you
have your ducks in a row. As you know, there are three sides to every
story: your side, their side, and the truth, which usually lies
somewhere in between both sides. So the truth of the situation is likely
related to this (**emphasis** mine):

> *I support the police* ***almost*** *completely,* ***in general****. I
> have no record, no activism, no arrests.*

The reason that your police department might refuse to service your
calls may have something to do with those "almosts" and "in generals."
Believe me, I am not at all concerned with what those are. Just be
prepared for when that conversation ends up on your doorstep, because
the first time you call someone else for service, it will.

To answer your final question:

> *Is there any other entity that I can contact in case of trouble?*

In most areas of the country (some older East coast cities may be
different), your city is part of a county. Your city is protected by a
police department, but your city is also within a county, and the county
is protected by a sheriff's department. The two organizations legally
have what is called *concurrent jurisdiction;* however, the sheriff has
a Memorandum of Understanding or a Memorandum of Agreement between
himself and the chiefs of police of each city within his jurisdiction.
What it spells out is basically that the city is responsible for law
enforcement actions within the city limits. The city can call the
sheriff's department for help, but under normal circumstances, the
sheriff will defer to the chief of police for that city to handle law
enforcement actions within that city. If this is the structure where you
live, call your local sheriff's department **before you need them** and
explain that your local police department is refusing to respond to
calls for service from you, so it now falls on them to service your
calls. I'm certain they will want to follow up with the city on this
breach of protocol. If you are forced to call the county for something
that should be handled by the city, the two of them are going to have to
work it out.

You're also going to have to find and post near your phone the direct
line to the sheriff's dispatch center. You won't be able to call 911,
since it will be routed to your local police department's dispatcher.
You can try to call 911 and try to tell them that the city police won't
respond, but I wouldn't bet my life on the fact that they are actually
going to come when you call them.

Finally, as everyone else here said, the United States is a land of
*individual responsibility*. Numerous Supreme Court rulings have
affirmed and re-affirmed that the police have no specific duty to
protect you. They have a general duty to protect the public at large,
but they are under no specific duty to protect you from harm. It is
**your** responsibility to protect yourself from harm. Get a dog, get an
alarm system, get a gun (and learn how to use it). You are your own
security.
