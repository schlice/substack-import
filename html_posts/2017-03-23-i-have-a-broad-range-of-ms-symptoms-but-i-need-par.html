The answer, of course, is "it depends."

You must ensure that the requirements of the job can be met with
reasonable accommodations. Are there reasonable accommodations that
allow you to fulfill the essential functions of the job you're applying
for?

For example, what if the employer requires four hours of physical and/or
mental exertion per day for a part time employee? What happens to you
after two hours? Do you need a 30-minute break and then you can do
another two hours? Perhaps an employer might consider that to be a
reasonable accommodation. If you can only work for two hours **per
day**, and the employer requires four hours, this may not be a
reasonable accommodation. Since you're part time, the employer *may* be
able to schedule you for only two hours per day, but that may not meet
the minimum requirements that the employer has to accomplish the
essential functions of the job. Perhaps even a part time employee needs
to be available for a minimum of four hours on a scheduled workday.

To answer the specific question, you have to be able to accomplish the
job with reasonable accommodations. You do not have to disclose your
illness during the hiring process. You only need to disclose the fact
that you require a reasonable accommodation when you determine that you
actually need one. Reasonableness will be determined by you and the
business. It will turn on whether or not the business needs to
*significantly* change in order to accommodate your disability. If they
have to hire more workers to cover you, and they are a small business,
that may be considered a significant change. If they have to move around
a few shift schedules, that's probably something they can do. Denying a
request for accommodation is also very significant, and the business
will ensure they are well within the law before doing so. But in most
circumstances, the business will try to meet your accommodation.
