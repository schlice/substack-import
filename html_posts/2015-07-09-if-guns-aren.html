**Content:** [Your comparison is logically incorrect, which is why you
found a dichotomy where there is none.\
\
\"Guns don\'t kill people, people kill people.\"\
\"Guns are the best deterrent against bad guys.\"\
\
These are not diametrically opposed statements. The first statement
shows that there has to be a will behind the gun in order to take a
life. A person has to choose to take a life. The gun is just a tool. The
gun is very efficient at its job, which is taking lives. But the gun
does not take a life on its own: someone with a will to take a life must
make the gun do its job.\
\
The second statement does not oppose the first; it states another fact,
except you have an incomplete thought, which may be where your confusion
lies. The whole thought is: \"The best deterrent against a bad guy
**with a gun** **is a good guy with a gun**.\" This thought simply puts
into more simple language the common law principle of meeting force with
equal force. If you are being presented with deadly force, the best
deterrent is someone else wielding deadly force.\
\
These two statements are not diametrically opposed, so there is no
dichotomy.]{.rendered_qtext}
