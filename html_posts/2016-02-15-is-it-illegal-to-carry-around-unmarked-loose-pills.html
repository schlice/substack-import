It is not illegal to carry around loose pills. If your purse happens to
be searched by the police, you may have some \'splainin\' to do if they
don\'t know what the pills are either. However, the police can look up
the pills online to determine what they are.

However, private venues that are \"open to the public\" (such as night
clubs) can establish whatever entrance rules they choose as long as such
rules are enforced equally against all patrons and do not discriminate
based on race, religion, color, sex, or national origin (or sexual
orientation in some states).

I can tell you that if you were to visit Cheyenne Mountain Air Force
Base (also known as NORAD), for example, you would find that they
require any medication you carry to be legal and be prescribed to you.
Therefore, to carry such medication into the Mountain, you would need to
have them in their original prescription bottles (to show that they are
both legal and prescribed to you).
