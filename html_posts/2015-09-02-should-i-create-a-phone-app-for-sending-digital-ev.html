**Content:** [Thanks for the A2A.\

There are a few things you need to work out first.\
\
- Is there a market for your app? Are there police departments that want
this capability? Are there police departments that need it? For example,
my local department allows reporting of certain types of crimes online.
They allow the reporting of the following crimes:]{.rendered_qtext}

- Theft of Personal Belongings (*Where you or another person allowed the
  suspect to enter your property/residence.)*
- Theft of Car Parts
- Theft of License Plates
- Damage to Your Property
- Vandalism to Your Property
- Property You Have Lost
- Gas Skips (Businesses only - no suspect information or license plate
  information)

Could your app be integrated with their online system to provide a
convenient way for people to report these crimes and include images?
This would create a value-added for them and enhance their ability to
solve some of these crimes.\
\
- How can you ensure the video or images are not edited? You have to
create recording software that ensures the integrity of the uploaded
video (i.e. you have to only allow uploads directly from the app, and
you have to capture the camera within the confines of the app). What
happens on jailbroken/rooted phones? Can someone commandeer the app and
upload edited video?\
\
- Can reports be made anonymously? This would seriously place in
jeopardy the usability of the videos, as their provider could not be
authenticated.\
\
While I like the idea overall, I don\'t think police departments will be
interested, because the video won\'t be usable in court (because it
can\'t be authenticated and/or verified), so it will be of limited
usefulness.
