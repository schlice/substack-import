The answer: ***correlation does not equal causation.***

From 1973 (when *Roe* was passeed) until 1990, the number of abortions
climbed steadily until it hit a peak at 1.6 million in 1990. Since then,
the number of abortions has experienced a "slow but steady decline."

There are a number of reasons for this, but primarily it has to do with
the proliferation of, and proper education on, contraceptive use and its
growing acceptance. In other words, the *need* for abortions has
decreased as people got better with, and more comfortable using,
contraceptives.

This is proved out when you look at abortion rates **around the world**,
and compare "developed" countries to "developing" countries. Guttmacher
has great data on this, and here's what they found:

Here's the pull quote: **women and couples in the developed world have
become more successful at avoiding unintended pregnancies---the cause of
most abortions---over the last two decades.**
