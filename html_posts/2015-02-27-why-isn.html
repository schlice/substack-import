**Content:** [Where is it completely acceptable to say that a country
should have never existed? If you\'re talking about the US, and saying
that its acceptable to exercise free speech, and you\'re saying that one
is acceptable and the other is not, what you\'re actually talking about
is *tact*.\

It\'s always tactful to be self-effacing. It\'s never tactful to
denegrate someone else. It\'s okay for an Israeli in Israel to declare
that Israel never should have existed, but for that same Israeli to say
that the US never should have existed is disrespectful and
tactless.]{.rendered_qtext}
