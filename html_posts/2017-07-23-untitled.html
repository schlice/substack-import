To Cliff's point, the jurisdiction may have sanitation laws regarding
corpses, but generally that applies to the person putting the corpse in
the place in which they did, and even so, it's not a felony. At worst,
it's a misdemeanor, but likely not even a chargeable crime, just a
violation of statute punishable by fine only.
