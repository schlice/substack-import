Here\'s a handy app I just ran across today (I\'m assuming you\'re
running a variant of Android \-- if you\'re on iOS, you\'re out of
luck).

Parallel Space: [[Parallel Space-Multi Accounts - Android Apps on Google
Play](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=0b0941&url=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id%3Dcom.lbe.parallel.intl){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="google.com"}]{.qlink_container}

This app will create a \"virual\" phone application space where you can
install applications just like your primary phone space. You would
install Tumblr in your Parallel Space, and you can then run two
instances of Tumblr: one in the primary phone space, and one in your
Parallel Space. In the App List, the primary instance of Tumblr will
appear called \"Tumblr\" and the second instance of Tumblr will show up
as \"Tumblr (parallel)\". You can be logged into separate accounts in
each instance, and they will not interfere with each other.

Best of all, the phone does not have to be rooted in order to use
Parallel Space.

As I mentioned, I know of no other similar functionality in iOS.

Enjoy!
