Calling yourself Christian does not give anyone the authority of the
church.

In other words, *don't blame the church for the failings of the
messengers.* Their failings are their own. People who take on the name
of Christ and yet do not live as He commanded are taking the Lord's name
in vain.

These "fake Christians" can demand anything they like. That doesn't mean
you have to do what they say.

There are plenty of "fake" people out there who demand you act in a
certain way. You are under no obligation to do so.

That doesn't relieve you of the responsibility to repent of your own
sin. If you have unrepented sin, I urge you to go to God and repent of
that sin. But that doesn't mean that others can "demand" you live in a
particular way.

But let's make sure we have a balanced answer.

Perhaps what is going on is that Christians are pointing out sin in your
life, and you are taking that to mean that they are demanding that
everyone live that way, and because it doesn't match the way you
believe, you are calling their interpretation "very flawed." You are
then using the *ad hominem* basis of, "well, you're not a very good
Christian yourself" to ignore what they are trying to teach you.

So how do you know what is "right?"

The answer, the gold standard, is the Bible. Compare what you are being
told with the Bible. If you don't know how to interpret the Bible, ask a
pastor to help you. Perhaps if you told us here what you are being told
to do, we can help you review what the Bible says about it and you can
make your decision based on that.

But ultimately, you get the choice to either love God or reject God, in
whatever you decide to do with your life.
