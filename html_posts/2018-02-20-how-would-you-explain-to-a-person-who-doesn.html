We'll chop the question down to the two actual questions.

**How would you explain to a person that doesn\'t live in the US the
need to have so many guns?**

I'll explain it using things you might understand by changing the
wording just a little.

**How would you explain to a person that doesn\'t live in the US the
need to have so many pairs of shoes?**

Well, I have some shoes for hiking, and some shoes for running. I have
one specialized pair of shoes that attach to the pedals of my road
racing bicycle, and I certainly can't use those when I hike. I have one
pair of shoes when I play the organ (actually, I do have one of those).
I also have some specialized water shoes, and some sandals. I have a
pair of waterproof flip flops that I wear in the shower at the gym
because I don't trust how they clean the floors in there.

As for guns (not shoes), I have a long gun for plinking. I have an air
rifle which I can legally shoot within city limits for scaring the
woodpeckers off of the top of my home since I can't legally kill them. I
have a rifle for home defense. I have a pistol for concealed carry. I
have a pistol for open carry. I have a pistol for home defense. So
that's five firearms and one air rifle, and that's just the baseline of
guns that I feel you'd *need,* let alone the ones you want just because.

**\[W\]hy do people need AR-15s and similar guns?**

The AR-style platform is literally the most popular gun in America. It
is lightweight, accurate, and easy to modify. There are mod kits to do
literally anything you want with it for any use case. It's easy to
clean, easy to break down, and easy to shoot.

\

But to be fair, just as I don't need to explain why I need so many pairs
of shoes, I don't need to explain why I need so many guns. I'm legally
allowed to buy them, so I do. I don't have to justify my purchases to
anyone.
