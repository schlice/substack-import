The B-1 and the Tu-160 are very similar aircraft in that they are both
supersonic strategic bombers and missile carriers. There are a number of
differences, however.

\- The B-1 is used primarily as a strategic bomber where the Tu-160 is
used primarily as a standoff missile platform.\
- Because the Tu-160 has a different mission than the B-1, it
accordingly has a greater range and is slightly larger than the B-1. The
B-1 has a greater combined payload based on its primary mission as a
strategic bomber.\
- Neither of the aircraft is considered a stealth aircraft. The bottom
of the B-1 is painted with RAM (radar-absorbent material) which gives it
a black look in the sky, and is generally painted gray or brown on top.
The Tu-160 is painted in anti-flash white (a paint which reflects some
nuclear radiation, meant to protect the crew).

The B-1 is nicknamed the \"Bone\" (B-One) by its pilots. The anti-flash
white paint scheme of the Tu-160 is what gives it the moniker \"the
White Swan\" by its pilots.

Different planes, different roles.
