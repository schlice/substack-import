**I went to the food store to get some chips and I didn\'t realize there
were small worms. My family ate a almost the whole bag until I realized.
Where can I take this to court? This has happened more than once.**

Sounds like the chips were bad.

But before you can recoup money from the chip manufacturer, you have to
show that some harm has befallen you. You also have to show that there
wasn't negligence somewhere else in the supply chain. For example, were
the chips expired when you bought them? And more importantly, did the
chips hurt anyone? Did they make anyone sick? Did you incur medical
expenses after eating the bad chips?

If the answer to any of these is yes, you may be able to sue for
damages.

You probably won't have a large enough damage to do anything other than
small claims court, which you can do yourself.

However, you can always retain an attorney at your own expense to help
you file that suit. You can also seek the assistance from a community
legal aid group in your area.
