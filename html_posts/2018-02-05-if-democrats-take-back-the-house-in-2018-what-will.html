Several things will happen:

1.  Nothing of any importance will pass Congress. The House will send
    bills to the Senate, and the Senate will ignore them.
    1.  In concert, the President will have a great deal of cause to
        harangle Congress for not "getting anything done."
2.  The House will, most likely, impeach the President. The Senate won't
    remove him from office. If Clinton can lie to Congress and not be
    removed from office, Trump won't be removed from office for
    "obstruction of justice" which legally can't be a crime that he can
    commit.\*

These two are pretty solid predictions. Remember that the House only
needs a simple majority to impeach, but the Senate needs 2/3 to remove
from office.

\* Obstruction of justice is a crime. The President is in charge of the
Executive branch, and is therefore responsible for personnel actions.
Therefore, **even if** he maliciously fired Comey with the specific
intent to stop the investigation into himself (which it can be argued
that he did not), he cannot be convicted of obstruction of justice for
performing a Constitutionally-authorized job function. That said, he can
still be impeached for obstruction of justice, since impeachment is a
political function, not a legal one.
