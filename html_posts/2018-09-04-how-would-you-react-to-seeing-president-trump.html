**How would you react to seeing President Trump's image on US stamps and
coins in the future?**

Stamps? Indifference. Those things are a relic. They're on their way out
anyway.

Coins? Not sure I'd agree with that decision. Look at the people who are
on our currency. Washington. Jefferson. Lincoln. Trump? Nah, doesn't fit
with that crew. I think deep down he's a good man, but is he a
Washington, or a Lincoln? I don't think so.
