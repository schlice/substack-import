**Content:** [It\'s okay, I can understand the confusion.\
\
You have two options here: pursuing criminal assault charges (as you
were criminally assaulted), or pursuing civil assault-and-battery
charges.\
\
If you choose to go the criminal route, you are hoping that the police
will find and arrest the person who assaulted you. After being convicted
of assault, he will be put in jail for a minimum of one year (as felony
assault carries a minimum of one year in jail), and will be forced to
pay court costs and your medical fees. To go the criminal route, you
visit the police station and ask to report an assault. You\'ll go
through the same process that I detailed in my original answer, and
you\'ll be interviewed by the detectives, who will talk to you about the
case, what happened, and any evidence you have, including what you\'ve
already discussed with your chiropractor. The detectives will take it
from there. Your \"attorney\" will be a lawyer from the District
Attorney\'s office, if they choose to arrest him and press charges. If
they find him but they don\'t charge him, you can still take your case
file from the police to a personal injury attorney\...\
\
\...to aid you in a civil court case. Filing in civil court is not about
arresting someone for a crime. The civil court route is only interested
in seeking damages (in the form of money) for what was done to you: pain
and suffering, and medical expenses. Assault is both a crime and a civil
tort. You don\'t have insurance; why should you be forced to pay for all
of those expenses out-of-pocket, when he\'s the one who unlawfully
attacked you, unprovoked? He should be held to account for his actions.
As I mentioned, if you don\'t want to charge him and send him to jail,
you can simply seek the advice of a personal injury attorney in your
area. If they find him and can file court documents against him, he will
have to appear in court and can be held accountable for his actions. He
may be forced to pay your medical expenses and a reasonable amount for
the pain and suffering that you had to go through during this whole
ordeal.]{.rendered_qtext}
