**What if you haven\'t been arrested, and you have not read your rights,
but you answer questions by the law enforcement that could possibly be
incriminating?**

*In general*, voluntary, non-coerced statements by people who are not in
custody are still admissible in court; simply because you were not
Mirandized before you answered a question does not always mean that your
statement is inadmissible in court. There are many circumstances which
could cause your statement to be considered involuntary (i.e.
confessions extracted by force, coercion, extended time, being held
"incommunicado," deprivation, threats or promises, etc). Absent these
mitigating factors which would indicate some sort of involuntary nature
to the statement, truly voluntary statements not found to have been
coerced can be admissible.

If this has happened to you, you had better be talking to a lawyer now.
