First, as the other commenters have mentioned, "serve and protect" is a
motto, it is not a listing of required duties.

Second, the police provide for the safety of the general public; they do
not have any legal obligation to protect any one person, unless a
"special relationship" exists, such as when you are in custody, or when
prior arrangements have been made.

Remember that the 14th Amendment prevents the government from depriving
a person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law. That
clause does not place an affirmative duty on the government to protect
or defend the life, liberty, or property of private citizens from
anyone. In general, the Due Process clause does not provide an
affirmative right to government assistance, even in a situation in which
the government itself may not deprive the individual of that right.
Also, there have been several cases which highlight the fact that police
have a general duty to protect, but no specific duty to protect one
private person from another.

There is an exception under which the police may develop a duty to
protect, and may be held liable if they fail to do so. The theory is
called the "state-created danger" theory. This is related to whether or
not the police left an individual in a situation that was more dangerous
than the one in which they found him, by creating a danger which did not
exist before, or by making a situation more dangerous. At least three
circuit courts have established tests to see if the state-created danger
theory passes muster. For example, the Third Circuit requires the
plaintiff to show that (1) the harm ultimately caused was foreseeable
and fairly direct, (2) the police or other state actor willfully
disregarded the plaintiff\'s safety, (3) there existed some relationship
between the state and the plaintiff, and (4) the police or other state
actors used their authority to create an opportunity that otherwise
would not have existed for the third party\'s crime to occur. The Sixth
Circuit requires the plaintiff to show that (1) the state acted
affirmatively to create or increase the risk that the plaintiff would be
harmed by a third party, (2) the state\'s actions placed the plaintiff,
not the general public, at risk, and (3) the state knew or should have
known that its actions specifically endangered the plaintiff. The Tenth
Circuit\'s test requires a plaintiff to demonstrate that (1) the state
actor created the danger or increased the plaintiff\'s vulnerability to
the danger in some way, (2) the plaintiff was a member of a limited and
specifically definable group, (3) police or other state actors' conduct
put plaintiff at substantial risk of serious, immediate, and proximate
harm, (4) the risk was obvious or known, (5) defendant acted recklessly
in conscious disregard of that risk, and (6) such conduct, when viewed
in total, shocks the conscience.

(EDIT) I'm not sure that simply citing the relevant law completely
answers your question.

*Can a police officer refuse to do his duty? Is he compelled by law to
act?*

The short answer to that question is that there is no law which compels
a police officer to act or to not act. We know that there is no
affirmative duty under the law for the police to protect any one person,
and unless the police created or increased the danger (see the
"state-created danger" test above), the police are not legally required
to protect one person from another. Ultimately, the police are part of
"law enforcement." Law enforcement is not "law breaking prevention." By
definition, law enforcement occurs *after* a law is broken, not before.
That doesn't mean if police are present and observing a situation that
they cannot step in and prevent a crime from taking place, but that's
not their job. They collect evidence, detain suspects, and bring them to
the district attorney for formal charges and a trip through the court
system.

Officers also have some flexibility regarding who gets arrested and
charged and when those actions take place.
