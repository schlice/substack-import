**If Trump is impeached and convicted of sedition by the house then the
senate, will it pave the way for criminal conviction for inciting
rebellion ?**

The short answer is no. Impeachment is a political process, whereas
criminal conviction requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt.

The only way in which impeachment and removal from office paves the way
for criminal conviction is that Trump becomes eligible for indictment
once he is out of office.

But literally, wait a week, and he'll be eligible.
