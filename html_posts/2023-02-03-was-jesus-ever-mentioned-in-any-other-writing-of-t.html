There are ten known *non-Christian writers* who mention Jesus within 150
years of His life:

- Flavius Josephus, a Jewish historian
- Tacitus, a Roman historian
- Pliny the Younger, a Roman politician
- Phlegon, a freed slave who wrote histories
- Thallus, a first-century historian
- Seutonius, a Roman historian
- Lucian, a Greek satirist
- Celsus, a Roman philosopher
- Mara Bar-Serapion, a private citizen who wrote to his son
- the Jewish Talmud.[\[1\]](#haDCZ){#cite-haDCZ .citation_link}

Some of these non-Christian sources, such as Celsus, Tacitus, and the
Jewish Talmud, could be considered *anti-Christian* sources. While these
works do not have any eyewitness testimony that contradicts events
described in the New Testament, they are works written by writers whose
tone is decidedly anti-Christian.

What can we learn from them and the more neutral non-Christian sources?
We learn that they admit certain facts about early Christianity that
help us piece together a storyline that is surprisingly congruent with
the New Testament. Piecing together all ten non-Christian references, we
see that:

1.  Jesus lived during time of Tiberius Caesar.
2.  He lived a virtuous life.
3.  He was a miracle worker.
4.  He had a brother named James.
5.  He was acclaimed to be the Messiah.
6.  He was crucified under Pontius Pilate.
7.  He was crucified on the eve of the Jewish Passover.
8.  Darkness and an earthquake occurred when he died.
9.  His disciples believed he rose from the dead.
10. His disciples were willing to die for their belief.
11. Christianity spread rapidly as far as Rome.
12. His disciples denied the Roman gods and worshiped Jesus as God.

And we learn all of this from *non-Christian* sources.

When we *combine* the non-Christian sources with the Christian sources,
there was *more* written about Jesus within 150 years of His life than
was written about Julius Caesar. There was *as much* written about Jesus
as was written about Tiberius Caesar, the actual emperor at the time.
