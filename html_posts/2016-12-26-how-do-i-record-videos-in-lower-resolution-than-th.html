The only way to record in a lower resolution than the app included in
Samsung phones is to use a different camera app.

Go to the Play Store and search for "camera app qcif" or "camera app
qvga" to see camera apps that record in lower that VGA resolution.

You might want to look at

which records in many different video sizes, including QCIF and QVGA
(both smaller than VGA).

While I wasn't able to find a camera that records specifically in half
VGA, QVGA is quarter-VGA, and CIF (if any camera apps have it) is close
to half of VGA size. QCIF is Quarter-CIF, which is the resolution most
DVRs record camera footage at.
