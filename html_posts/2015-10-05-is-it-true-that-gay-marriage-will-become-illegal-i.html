**Content:** [The Supreme Court ruled that any state bans on gay
marriage are unconstitutional in 2015. The Federal Defense of Marriage
Act was, for all intents and purposes, thus ruled unconstitutional.\
\
So perhaps by 2025, any state constitution which still has a \"marriage
is between one man and one woman\" wording will finally have it
repealed. Not the other way around.]{.rendered_qtext}
