**Trump just added 17 new lawyers to his legal team. Are taxpayers
having to pay the legal fees?**

It depends on where the new lawyers are employed, and the announcements
about them are as of yet unclear.

The only attorneys paid for by taxpayers work in the White House
Counsel's Office and the Department of Justice. Trump's personal
attorneys are paid for only by Trump.
