Let's be more specific.

Can someone call 911 if you overdosed? Yes, absolutely. In fact, we
prefer you call. This gets both medical professionals to your location
quickly to keep you alive until you can get to a hospital, as well as
law enforcement personnel to investigate the consumption of illegal
substances.
