**Content:** [*While we rush people out of cars on fire, people ARE held
responsible for injuries resulting when they touch injured people.*\
\
Actually, this is not true. All 50 states have what they call \"Good
Samaritan\" laws that indemnify most individuals when assisting at the
scene of an accident. A small number of states do not indemnify
civilians, but most do. There are peculiarities that vary from state to
state, but they all have some form of the law. So if you rushed in to an
accident scene and tried your best to help but you actually ended up
causing a secondary injury, the Good Samaritan laws in your area
(assuming you have appropriate ones \-- we do) would protect you from
any civil or criminal penalties, assuming you were not acting recklessly
(dragging a person by a clearly broken arm, etc), or if you have
training, acting outside of the bounds of your
training.]{.rendered_qtext}
