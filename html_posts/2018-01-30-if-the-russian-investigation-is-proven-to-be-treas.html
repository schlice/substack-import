**If the Russian investigation is proven to be treason, then would
impeachment and prison time be a fair form of justice?**

It is virtually impossible that the Russia probe would settle on treason
as a charge.

Under British rule, political dissidents were considered to be traitors,
and were charged with treason and summarily executed. When the colonies
established the Constitution, they narrowly defined treason to be only
for the worst acts committed against a nation, and only during wartime:

> Treason against the United States, shall consist only in levying War
> against them, or in adhering to their Enemies, giving them Aid and
> Comfort. No Person shall be convicted of Treason unless on the
> Testimony of two Witnesses to the same overt Act, or on Confession in
> open Court.

The Constitution doesn't define the crime, it only defines the limits of
the crime. Thus, the treason law reads:

> Whoever, owing allegiance to the United States, levies war against
> them or adheres to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort within
> the United States or elsewhere, is guilty of treason and shall suffer
> death, or shall be imprisoned not less than five years and fined under
> this title but not less than \$10,000; and shall be incapable of
> holding any office under the United States.

Treason, therefore, is really a crime limited to wartime (i.e. giving
aid and comfort to the enemy). Even the only remaining crime related to
sedition in US law, **seditious conspiracy**, still requires the person
to engage in conduct designed to overthrow the government by some means
of force. Therefore, it is extremely unlikely that Trump could be
charged with treason or any related charge.

As we've said numerous times on this thread, Constitutionally-speaking,
Trump also cannot be charged with obstruction of justice by firing
people who work for him. Trump is the head of the executive branch, and
is responsible for the actions of the people who work for him. He
therefore is authorized to make personnel decisions, including hiring
and firing decisions. A law (the law regarding obstruction of justice)
cannot override the Constitution: if a law is in opposition to the
Constitution, then the law is wrong, not the Constitution. Attempting to
charge the President with obstruction of justice for fulfilling a
Constitutionally-permitted operation would simply be a non-starter in
court.

**Would Pence be in possession of stolen goods?**

If you're referring to "stolen goods" as the Presidency, then the answer
is no. A political office is not considered a "good" or "commodity" in
the traditional sense. Additionally, in order for the President to have
"stolen" the election, it would have to be alleged that he manipulated
votes, or committed some form of voter suppression, or somehow forced an
Elector to vote against how his state told him to vote, and there is no
evidence whatsoever that any of this happened. Therefore, the election
was not "stolen" at all. The President was, indeed, lawfully elected by
the people, and can only be removed from office by Congressional action.
The only way for Pence to be removed from office would be to investigate
and charge him separately with a "high crime or misdemeanor," and not
only has this not been discussed, but he's not the President yet, so
it's hard to remove him from the office when he hasn't been *in* the
office yet.

**What would be the logical course of action (Not strictly the legal
limitations)?**

The only logical course of action would be for the House of
Representatives to vote to impeach the President, and for the Senate to
vote to remove him from office. What grounds the House uses is entirely
up to the House, as impeachment is not a legal process, but a political
one. Therefore, the Mueller probe does not need to find any evidence of
criminal wrongdoing in order for impeachment to proceed; they simply
need to find enough evidence of "high crimes and misdemeanors" in order
to impeach. If the House finds enough evidence of this, they can vote to
impeach him. It is then up to the Senate to get enough votes together to
remove him from office. In my personal opinion, this is the sole purpose
of the Mueller probe: to collect enough "dirt" to substantiate a charge
of "high crimes and misdemeanors" against the President so that he can
be impeached. They know he hasn't done anything criminal, but they don't
care; they just want him removed from office. If he were to fire Mueller
or someone else investigating him, while it wouldn't be obstruction of
justice, it could easily be seen as an "abuse of office" or an "abuse of
power" and if enough Representatives agree, it could be an impeachable
offense. The House could even allege that the firing was done solely to
attempt to derail the investigation, in which case the House could
allege that the "high crime" was obstruction of justice, even though
Trump was not charged with that crime. In other words, he could be
impeached for obstruction of justice even if he cannot be legally
charged with that offense as a crime, since again, impeachment is a
political process, not a legal one.

If that happens, the Vice President becomes President. If the House and
the Senate can repeat the process against the Vice President, then he
would be removed from office, and the Speaker of the House (currently
Paul Ryan) would become President.

That is the only logical course of action.
