So if you haven\'t been following the news, they basically just did.

[[https://www.vox.com/platform/amp\...](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=9134bd&url=https://www.vox.com/platform/amp/23159672/supreme-court-egbert-boule-bivens-law-enforcement-border-patrol-immunity){.external_link

While this case applies to Border Patrol agents, there\'s no reason to
think that this case shouldn\'t apply to all federal law enforcement
officials.

*Bivens* is exactly like *Roe* in that while people may agree that a
remedy is needed, the court is not the right place for that remedy to
have been found. Congress could very easily pass a *Bivens* remedy so
that individuals can seek damages when it is alleged that a federal
agent violated their constitutional rights. Or, Congress could eliminate
qualified immunity. Or, Congress could take a number of other actions in
order to enact something like *Bivens*.

But Congress has failed to act.

However, some would argue, that if Congress does not act, that is an act
unto itself. This could signal the fact that there is not enough
political will in Congress in order to enact such a remedy. So it may
not necessarily be that Congress simply failed to act, Congress may have
not acted specifically because they chose not to.

This case, along with the forthcoming decision in *Roe*, should signal
to anyone watching the courts that this particular Court is very much
opposed to any form of judicial activism, and will root it out whenever
it finds it.
