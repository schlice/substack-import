**Who is Cesar Sayoc Jr. the arrested mail bomber and what can he tell
us about this case?**

According to [[Fox

**Is it true that he supports GOP and Donald Trump?**

Yep. He's a far-right whack-a-doodle.

He's not an indication of all people who support Trump. He's not even an
indication of *most* people who support Trump.

In exactly the same way that some people blamed the Democrat Party or
Bernie Sanders when James Hodgkinson shot up a Congressional baseball
practice, some people are going to blame Trump or Republicans in general
because of Cesar Sayoc.

Let's be clear: the only person responsible for shooting Congressmen or
Congressional staffers was James Hodgkinson.

The only person responsible for sending what appear to be pipe bombs
through the mail is Cesar Sayoc.

This just goes to prove that whackadoodle status is not limited to any
one political party.
