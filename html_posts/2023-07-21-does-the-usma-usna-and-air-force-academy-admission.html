Not to a military academy. Perhaps to an Ivy League school, but not to
the military academies.

The nominating officials you cited have specific numbers of cadets that
they are legally authorized to have present in the Academy at any one
time. For example, a Representative or Senator is authorized to have
**five** (5) nominated cadets at each Academy at a time. On average,
this amounts to about one cadet to each Academy per year. If that
Representative has five cadets at that Academy, he or she can no longer
nominate any further cadets until one leaves through graduation or
otherwise.

Representatives use the "whole person" standard to nominate individuals
to attend a service academy. The selection process for nomination
mirrors the selection process for acceptance into the Academy itself.
You will have to put together a nomination package that looks somewhat
similar to the acceptance package you will assemble for the selected
Academy. A complete nomination package will have the following elements
in it:

- High school transcript
- ACT or SAT scores
- Resume of extracurricular activities
- An essay stating why you want to attend a Service Academy (500 words
  or less)
- Minimum of three letters of recommendation

Letters of recommendation come from people like

- Teachers
- Counselors
- Employers
- Coaches
- Faith-based leaders
- Scout Leaders

Your nomination package goes before a nomination board assembled by the
Representative or Senator. They pick a slate of candidates to present to
the Representative or Senator to choose. That Representative will choose
(usually) the number of applicants which corresponds to the number of
slots he has available, so either one or two cadets. There's normally
about 100 applicants for nomination per academic year.

\

Now, all that said, when the Representative or Senator receives the list
of candidates from the Board, does he or she ever look at the list of
donors to their campaign and see if the parents are listed? I can't say.
But I can tell you that my parents did donate to the campaign of the
Representative who nominated me.

But I was selected by the Board, so I was one of five who was put
forward to the Representative out of roughly 100 applicants, and the
Representative selected two. Out of the two nominations, only I received
an appointment.

\

TL;DR: It *might* be a factor in who the Representative or Senator
ultimately selects, but you have to get 90% of the way there on your
merits. I will never say that political connectedness or money has
nothing at all to do with it, but you still have to be a fully qualified
candidate before you get to the point where such considerations could
ever be made.
