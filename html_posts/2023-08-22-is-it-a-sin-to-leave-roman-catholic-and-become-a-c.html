As you can see by my credential, I am exactly the person you are asking
about.

So the specific answer to your question is **it depends on who you
ask.**

If you ask a Roman Catholic, you\'re not a sinner by leaving the church,
you are an *apostate*. Catholics would say willingly becoming apostate
means you forego your salvation. Is that sinful? As it is a violation of
God\'s commands (according to them), then yes, it is a sin.

But to the Christian, it is not only not sinful, but it the most
salvific thing you can do. To the Christian, that act is what will get
your heart in a right state. That act will save you!
