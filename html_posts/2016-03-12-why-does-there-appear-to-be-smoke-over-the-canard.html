**Content:** [This is water vapor condensing when the air pressure over
the top of the wing gets lower than the pressure needed to tip the dew
point.\
\
Basically, the dew point is a combination of humidity, temperature and
pressure, at which airborne water condenses. The air over the top of an
aircraft wing is at a lower pressure than the surrounding air. When this
happens at the correct humidity and temperature, the water in the air
condenses and becomes visible water vapor. This is also why water
condenses on a cold drink, for example.]{.rendered_qtext}
