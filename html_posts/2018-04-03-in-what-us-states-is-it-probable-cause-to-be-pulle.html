**In what US states is it probable cause to be pulled over for bearing a
Colorado license plate?**

None. Simply having an out-of-state registration does not constitute
reasonable suspicion for a traffic stop. Remember, officers need
reasonable suspicion for a stop, and probable cause for an *arrest*.

Now, if the officer patrols the same area routinely, and sees the same
vehicle with the same out-of-state registration for three months, this
would be reasonable suspicion to stop the vehicle. New state residents
are required to register their vehicles generally within 60 days of
moving in to the state, so seeing the same out-of-state registration for
three months would cause suspicion.

Just as one example of an exception to the registration requirement:
military members stationed at a military facility are not automatically
state residents unless they choose to change their state of permanent
residency. This means they can retain their resident status in their
home state, even while stationed in another state. They can maintain
their home state driver's license, and their home state registration.
They can pay taxes in their home state instead of the state where they
are stationed.
