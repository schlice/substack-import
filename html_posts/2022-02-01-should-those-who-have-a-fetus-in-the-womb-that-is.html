Is it at all kind to force a woman to bring a baby to term when we
***know*** (not suspect) that the baby will have a short, painful life,
and will most definitely die?

There are a few arguments to be made, including misdiagnosis, and the
possibility of using the infant organs as donors.

But the crux of this argument should be that such a diagnosis,
regardless of abortion laws, should leave the mother the choice about
whether to carry the baby to term or abort.

But a *means test as a basis for determining abortion?* Patently
ridiculous. Life's value is not determined by your financial solvency.

Should those who have a fetus in the womb that is inflicted with an
ailment such as Anencephaly be required to go through a financial
background check so that if they fail to pass the test then doctors
would immediately abort the fetus?
