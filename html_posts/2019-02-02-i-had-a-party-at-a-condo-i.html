**I had a party at a condo I'm renting, now the condo was destroyed by
partygoers and I'm here left with a lot of damages, should I tell the
landlord or try and fix everything myself?**

Let's just start with the fact that you're on the hook for all the
damages. There's no two ways about it. Also, if you're a renter, it
doesn't matter if you're renting a house, a condo, or an apartment.
Someone else owns it, and you rent it. You're subject to the rental
agreement, and you have to return the unit to the owner in the same
condition in which you received it, full stop.

If your renter's agreement specifies that you notify the landlord before
you perform any maintenance on the interior of the unit, then you have
to tell him. If it does not, then the extent of the damage determines
who you contact and when.

If the damages extend beyond walls and carpet and into things like
plumbing or electrical, in all cases you should contact the landlord and
find out who he wants to fix those things. He may not have a preference,
or he might. If it's structural, talk to the landlord. It will be up to
you to pay for it. When the work is done, let him inspect the work so he
can see that you took responsibility for the issue and corrected it.

If the damage is just limited to walls and carpets, and if your rental
agreement does not specify that you notify the landlord for any interior
work at all, then you can do the work yourself, or hire a handyman to
help you. In any case, as previously mentioned, the unit must be
returned to the landlord/owner at the end of the lease period in the
same condition in which you received it.
