We need to dissect your question because it's actually two questions.

1.  **Can the military disobey the president's orders?** As most folks
    have already answered here, the military can, and is taught how to,
    disobey direct orders which violate the Constitution or the law in
    general.
2.  **Can they refuse to go to war if they know it is wrong?** You
    didn't clarify what "wrong" means. Do you mean "illegal?" Or do you
    mean "morally incongruent with their beliefs?"

The military can only disobey ***illegal*** orders. If you receive a
***legal*** order that you don't like because you don't think the US
should be involved in a war there, or you think war is bad, or you think
the president is an immoral buffoon and so shouldn't be allowed to wage
war anywhere, **you cannot disobey that order.** You do not get paid
enough to make those kinds of decisions. Those are someone else's job to
make, not you. If you do decide that you don't want to go to war because
you believe that the US should not be involved in that war, or you think
that war, in general, is morally wrong, you are called a *conscientious
objector.* There is [[a very long
process](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=424726&url=http://girightshotline.org/en/military-knowledge-base/topic/conscientious-objection-discharge%23topic-if-you-are-facing-deployment){.external_link

onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="girightshotline.org"}]{.qlink_container} that you go through
when you wish to claim conscientious objector status, or a conscientious
objector discharge, and it involves counseling, forms, questionnaires,
and letters from friends and family describing how you live your beliefs
in the rest of your life outside of military service. It's not just as
easy as saying, "I don't wanna go." But it can be done.
