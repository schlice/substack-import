Define "respect."

I respect you for who you are. You have every right to be you and live
as you choose. End of discussion.

But for many people today, that's not enough. They conflate *respect*
with *affirmation*. I can respect someone who voted for Bernie, but I
don't have to put a "Vets for Bernie" bumper sticker on my car to prove
it.

Let's be abundantly clear: **forcing someone to indicate public support
for a position they personally disagree with will always be wrong**. End
of other discussion.
