Let's stop and think about the idea of a sex strike.

So what you're saying is, you want to voluntarily stop doing the thing
that we want you to stop doing, thereby reducing abortion rates by
reducing the incidence of unwanted children? I mean, if you're married,
this doesn't really apply to you, but it does apply if you're single.
You're going to *voluntarily stop having sex outside of marriage*, is
that what you're saying?

I say: ***I'm 100% for it.***

Here's a novel approach you might think of employing: ***don't have sex
with randos.*** Perhaps you should try something wacky, like *saving sex
for the person who you are going to marry. And then have children with
that person, children you actually want to keep.*

We can call it something like, oh I dunno, **traditional values**. What
a radical, novel concept. I know, shocking, right? Sorry, didn't mean to
throw all of these new ideas on you all at once, but I'm sure you can
handle it.

TL;DR: "Watch out, or I'm going to start following traditional values!"
