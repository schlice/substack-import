**What would you classify as a "modern" disease?**

Type 2 Diabetes, which is most commonly a lifestyle disease caused
specifically by our modern diets affecting certain at-risk people.

We used to call it "adult-onset diabetes" since it generally only
affected adults with poor nutritional habits, usually linked to excess
sugar intake, sedentary lifestyle, and obesity. However, since
"adult-onset diabetes" began affecting adolescents and teens, they
really couldn't call it "adult-onset diabetes" any longer, so they
changed it to "Type 1" and "Type 2" diabetes.

Type 1 diabetes is diagnosed in children from a very young age through
the 30s and is caused by an autoimmune response where the immune system
destroys insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. Type 2 diabetes
is more closely tied to age, obesity, genetic predisposition, and a
sedentary lifestyle, but the cause is not yet fully understood. While
Type 2 diabetics do produce insulin, their bodies do not use it well.

The only way to treat Type 1 diabetes is by supplementing insulin, since
their pancreases do not produce it at all. Type 2 diabetes can usually
be managed using some combination of diet, exercise, and medication.
However, it is a progressive disease, and within five to 10 years, the
Type 2 patient will likely also have to start supplementing insulin.
