**How do police investigate missing parcels that say delivered and
aren\'t received when there is no security video or any proof. Also if
the sender files the report would the receiver get a knock on the door
by a investigating officer to get more info?**

*(US Answer Only)*

Police do not investigate missing parcels, because missing parcels is
not a crime. If you are alleging mail theft or "porch piracy," even if
you have proof, it's highly unlikely for the police to be able to catch
the perpetrator, so it's again highly unlikely that the police would
investigate at all.

The only investigation that *might* be done would be accomplished by the
delivery service (UPS, FedEx, or UPS if you used a trackable delivery
feature). They could tell you if they delivered the package, and where.
Amazon, now entering the "last mile" delivery game, has its system set
up so that the delivery person takes a picture of the parcel on the
doorstep, and that picture is included in Amazon's delivery report, thus
proving that they dropped the package on your doorstep. Porch piracy
would therefore need to be investigated by the police, if they will even
investigate.
