**How many more school shootings? How many more children are murdered
before our legislators cease worrying about being reelected and enact
sensible gun laws?**

There already *are* sensible gun laws. Heck, there are *ridiculous* gun
laws. There is already an *insane* amount of gun laws.

So answer this, questioner: ***What new gun law would stop a shooter?***

This shooter probably broke about 10 different laws just bringing a gun
onto school property. Clearly, the laws we have preventing guns on
schools didn't stop someone from doing it.

Wanna know why?

**Laws don't prevent people from doing bad things. Laws provide a
framework for us to prosecute people who violate them**.

If you want to ***prevent*** bad behavior, *laws are not the answer.*
Laws help you to prosecute people who violate them. Laws don't stop
people from doing bad things.
