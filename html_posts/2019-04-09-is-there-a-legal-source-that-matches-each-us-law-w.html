**Is there a legal source that matches each U.S. law with a punishment
for breaking it?**

In general, within each written law (either federal or state), the range
of punishments for violating those laws are already written there. They
describe the law, the conditions under which a person has violated the
law, and the range of punishments which can be levied for breaking that
law.

It is a range of punishments because it is a court of law which decides
exactly what (if any) punishment will be given after being found guilty
of violating a law. That said, the punishment will fall somewhere in
that range.
