**Is it illegal to have a ridiculously loud over the top car horn?**

Depends on your definition of "ridiculously loud."

If you're talking the same air horns they put on trucks, that's not
ridiculously loud. Trucks use them, why can't you?

But I'd strongly recommend you consider the following: ***don't replace
your standard car horn with a truck horn.***

**Install it as a secondary horn.** Or if you're Mark Rober, build a
custom electronic horn, and then add the truck horn as a last resort.

After you check your local ordinances, this build is a really easy way
to do this. It's not an overly complicated build, and you can assemble
the whole kit relatively inexpensively.
