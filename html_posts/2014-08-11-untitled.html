<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: [Unfortunately, according to UCMJ, your analysis of the<br>situation was wrong. Your officer can tell you to do something<br>*dangerous,* even *needlessly* *dangerous*, and it\'s still a lawful<br>order. It\'s not your place to judge need. That\'s why you have an<br>officer.\<br>\<br>You might have said something along the lines of, \"Sir, I\'m not sure I<br>understand your order, you\'re asking us to go out into the open in a<br>hostile area to pick up trash? It\'s not illegal, but is it smart?\" And<br>if the answer was \"Yes, I know it\'s hostile, but we need the trash<br>policed because loose trash which contains information can blow into<br>enemy territory and we may as well package up all our intel and deliver<br>it to them with a bow and a cupcake\", you\'d still be required to<br>follow the order or face court martial and dishonorable discharge<br>because you were afraid of being in a hostile area. Even if the answer<br>was simply \"Yes, I\'m aware of the hostility, now get to work\", you<br>still have to do it. The officer is under no obligation to explain the<br>rationale behind the order. He might just to keep good order and<br>discipline, but he might not.\<br>\<br>Ours is not to question why, ours is just to do or<br>die.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/What-is-a-member-of-the-US-Armed-Forces-supposed-to-do-if-they-believe-that-a-superior-officer-has-given-them-an-illegal-order/answer/Frank-King-9<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
