<h2>Answer Comment</h2>
<div>

**Content:** [Unfortunately, according to UCMJ, your analysis of the
situation was wrong. Your officer can tell you to do something
*dangerous,* even ***needlessly*** *dangerous*, and it\'s still a lawful
order. It\'s not your place to judge need. That\'s why you have an
officer.\
\
You might have said something along the lines of, \"Sir, I\'m not sure I
understand your order, you\'re asking us to go out into the open in a
hostile area to pick up trash? It\'s not illegal, but is it smart?\" And
if the answer was \"Yes, I know it\'s hostile, but we need the trash
policed because loose trash which contains information can blow into
enemy territory and we may as well package up all our intel and deliver
it to them with a bow and a cupcake\", you\'d still be required to
follow the order or face court martial and dishonorable discharge
because you were afraid of being in a hostile area. Even if the answer
was simply \"Yes, I\'m aware of the hostility, now get to work\", you
still have to do it. The officer is under no obligation to explain the
rationale behind the order. He might just to keep good order and
discipline, but he might not.\
\
Ours is not to question why, ours is just to do or
die.]{.rendered_qtext}
