**Why do many states not allow open carry of firearms? Wouldn\'t it be
better for police to see when someone is armed from a distance so they
won\'t be surprised, in addition to deterring anyone about to commit a
crime?**

Your assertion is incorrect. "Many" states do allow open carry of
firearms. "Many" is generally accepted to mean "at least half," and
that's not even true.

So by this count, there are at least 46 states that allow open carry in
some form or another.

However, there are *many* cities within those states which restrict open
carry, as they are permitted to do. *Why* they do this is entirely up to
them. The mayors of these cities have determined, for better or worse,
that their city would be a better place if no one was allowed to openly
carry firearms. [[Cities have done this since the beginning of the

Is it a good idea to open carry? This question has been asked several
times before on Quora:

[[Is open carrying more risky than concealed carrying, or would open
carrying be more likely to deter
crime?](https://www.quora.com/Is-open-carrying-more-risky-than-concealed-carrying-or-would-open-carrying-be-more-likely-to-deter-crime)]{.qlink_container}

[[Doesn\'t openly carrying a gun make you more likely to become a victim
of robbery? Why would it discourage an armed criminal to rob you? If you
open carry alone and he pulls his gun first, you have no choice but to
give up yours and then other
stuff.](https://www.quora.com/Doesnt-openly-carrying-a-gun-make-you-more-likely-to-become-a-victim-of-robbery-Why-would-it-discourage-an-armed-criminal-to-rob-you-If-you-open-carry-alone-and-he-pulls-his-gun-first-you-have-no-choice-but-to-give)]{.qlink_container}
