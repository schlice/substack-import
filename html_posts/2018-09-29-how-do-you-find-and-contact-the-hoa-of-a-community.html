**How do you find and contact the HOA of a community you are considering
moving into?**

If the HOA is on the web, just Googling the name of the community might
do it.

If not, but you're looking at a current listing, you can ask the listing
agent about the HOA and they should be able to tell you.

If you're not looking at a specific listing, you'll always be able to
find information about the HOA of a community from the city in which the
HOA is chartered. Public records at City Hall should always give you
that information if you can't find it from any other area.
