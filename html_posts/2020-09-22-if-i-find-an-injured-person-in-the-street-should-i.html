**If I find an injured person in the street, should I take him to the
hospital in my car or call 911 in the USA?**

In general, the answer is call 911.

There are a few very rare corner cases in which loading the person into
your own car and driving them to the hospital might be acceptable, but
in the *vast* majority of cases, that's not the right solution.

Primarily, you don't want to do this because you can't begin to
stabilize and treat the patient en route, which an ambulance can do. The
call also preps the emergency room to receive the patient, gets the
right specialists in gear, and gets that ball rolling at the call onset,
rather than at your arrival. You get the fast-track to treatment with an
ambulance instead of walking in the front door.

Finally, and these days it can't be overstated, there is the issue of
liability. Yes, you are protected by "good Samaritan" laws which absolve
you of any liability in the event the person is hurt during your
transport and they choose to try to recoup some of those costs from you.
But must you really put yourself through that, when an ambulance is a
perfectly acceptable alternative?
