The answer, in the case of this pro-lifer, is **infinity** (or **none**,
depending on how you look at it). The reason is primarily because I
don't think you understand what the definition of the word misogyny is,
and secondarily because I don't think you understand what it means to be
pro-life.

**Misogyny** is *hatred of women*. It's more than chauvinism, which is
simply the belief that men are better than women. Misogyny goes further.
Misogynists actively hate women, simply because they are women.
Misogynists actively threaten, intimidate, and are directly violent
towards women, simply because they are women.

I do not hate women. Therefore, definitionally, I am not a misogynist.
Even if I were a person who directly pursued policies which
**affirmatively physically hurt women**, I might not be a misogynist if
I had some other reason for pursuing those policies besides hurting
women. Perhaps I thought that a different goal of the policy trumped the
physical pain my chosen policy position would inflict. The only way such
a choice would be misogynistic is if the goal of my pursuit of the
policy was to cause pain to women simply because they are women.

With that understanding, now we need to look at why I'm a pro-lifer, and
at the same time understand what it means to be pro-life. We just
established that in order to be misogynistic, I would have to be a
pro-lifer just to cause violence and pain to women. I am not a pro-lifer
because I desire to cause pain to women.

**I am a pro-lifer because I value the sanctity of all life**
***equally*** **at all stages of its development.**

That's it. Nothing more, and nothing less.

The opposite is true as well. At their core, **a person who is a
pro-choicer places** ***differential value*** **on life depending on its
temporal locality**. "Temporal locality" is just a fancy term meaning
"position in time and space." Position in time means how old it is, and
position in space means where it is physically located. Pro-choice
people place a lower value on life when it is pre-born, and when it is
in the womb.

You can try to make as many arguments as you like, I've heard them all
and I've debated most of them. And once we have exhausted all the
bullets in our collective arsenals, the two fundamental truths I shared
above remain: I value all life equally at all stages of its development,
and the pro-choicer devalues the life of the fetus because it is a fetus
and because it is pre-born. And just so that we are clear, believing
that it is okay to kill a baby because a woman is inconvenienced or
uncomfortable means that you value a woman's comfort and convenience
over the life of a baby. This is only possible if you devalue the baby
because it is pre-born and because it is so early in its development.

**TL;DR:** I don't care who you are. I don't care what structures reside
between your legs. Just don't kill babies at any age. That is not a
misogynistic position, because it is not intended to hurt women. "Just
don't kill babies" doesn't hurt women, and since that's not the goal of
the position, it is, **by definition**, not misogyny.

*For the time being, I have re-enabled comments on selected answers.
Some people like to engage with me in a civil manner, and I do like
that. But do not misunderstand, my mental well-being isn\'t worth your
harassing, inane behavior. If you don\'t like what I wrote, tough shit.
If my answer is grammatically low-quality or is un-cited opinion
masquerading as fact, downvote it. If you think I\'m wrong, write your
own answer. But Quora is a question-and-answer site, not a debate site.
If you are simply commenting to tell me \"ackshually, you\'re wrong,\"
don\'t be surprised if I quietly delete your comment. Put anything
vaguely harassing in there, and your deletion will be followed by a
block and a mute, and a BNBR report. I will do this immediately and with
no compunction. You have been warned. Be nice.*
