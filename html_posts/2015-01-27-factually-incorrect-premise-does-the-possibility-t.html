**Content:** [Not at all.\
\
The A-10 is looking at being mothballed because the platform is
out-of-date and the airframe is a single-role aircraft (i.e. it is only
used for Close Air Support, or CAS).\
\
There are other multirole aircraft in the inventory that can also
perform the CAS role admirably, such as the F-15E, the F-16, and the
F-22.]{.rendered_qtext}
