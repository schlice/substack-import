**Content:** [Thanks for the A2A, Anonymous, this was a fun thought
experiment.\
\
Law enforcement knows that especially with murder, and especially with
murder with a knife (which requires force and generally aggravation),
the victim probably knew the killer. So the police are going to
***start*** collecting suspects with you, as no one knew the victim
better than the victim\'s spouse.\
\
Your only option is to run. Far away. There are no other alternatives.\
(EDIT: Faking your death is an alternative. See the comments.)\
\
Ideally, you should have enough money so that you can live off the grid,
comfortably, for the rest of your days. Because as soon as you pop up on
the grid, you\'ll be caught. So before you commit this murder, you need
to have enough money (i.e. several million in cash) so that you can live
without any interaction. You will also need a new identity: new Social
Security number, new license, new passport. You will need to use this
new identity to get yourself out of the country, so it has to be good.
The people who provide these services are constantly being monitored by
law enforcement, so they have to be good as well. Which also means that
these will be expensive.\
\
Within hours of discovering the body, the police will be after you. Your
only hope of escape is to have your escape route pre-planned, and to
time the commission of the murder to coincide with your flight out of
the country. As soon as the body is discovered and the police take a
cursory look at you, they\'ll know you did it (he dropped off the grid
at the same time the crime happened). It doesn\'t take a rocket
scientist to figure out that you\'re running.\
\
You will have to survive on your own. You will have to abandon your
former life. You will not be able to make any contact with anyone you
knew: your parents, your friends, your acquaintances, all gone.
Off-limits. You will need to run to a country which has no extradition
treaty with the United States. Pick one:\

You will have to live completely off the grid. No credit cards, only
burner phones (but who are you going to talk to anyway), etc. You can
use your new identity to establish a *second* new identity in the new
country. This is important, because if your identity is compromised in
the States, they can track you down to your new country. You have to
create a new, new identity to cover your tracks again. This is an
important step that is often missed.\
\
Then, you\'ll spend the rest of your days looking over your shoulder.
Was my deception discovered? Did they figure out where I went? Did they
discover my identities? Did her parents hire a hit man to come and kill
me? Since you\'re in a country with no extradition treaty, they can\'t
really get justice, so they\'ll get the next best thing: revenge. They
want their pound of flesh, and if they find you, they will extract it
from you, painfully. And since they know you did it, they will be
scouring the seedy underbelly of whatever city you lived in, looking for
the person who created your fake credentials so they can try to track
you down. The stress will age you prematurely.\
\
Even with enough money to live comfortably for the rest of my days, I
can\'t imagine that this would be a fun way to live.
