Agonstics are different than atheists. Atheists say "I know there is no
god," while agnostics say "I don't know if there is a god."

But there are two types of agnostics. Ordinary agnostics say "We don't
know anything for sure." Ornery agnostics say "We can't know anything
for sure."

The ornery agnostic's position, however, is logically unsupportable. If
you say, "We can't know anything for sure," you are making an *absolute*
truth statement to try to prove something which you are claiming you
can't know absolutely. In other words, when you say you can't know
anything for sure, *how do you know* ***that*** *for sure?* You'd have
to know what you claim you can't know in order to make that statement.
So it is logically unsupportable. It's a self-defeating position.

So let's look at the ordinary agnostic's position. If, as the ordinary
agnostic does, you say, "We don't know anything for sure," then why
don't you know? Most ordinary agnostics at this point claim that the
reason that they don't know is because no one has shown them the
evidence.

The problem is that the evidence they think they want just isn't
available. To find out why, see my other answer on this:
