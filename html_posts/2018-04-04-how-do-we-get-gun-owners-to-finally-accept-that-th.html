**How do we get gun owners to finally accept that the second amendment
is outdated and will be repealed soon?**

Hypnosis.

Drugs.

Bribing with large sums of money (by the way, I might be open to that
one. Reach out and let me know how large a sum we're talking).

Because beyond that, here in reality, the Second Amendment, being part
of the Bill of Rights, is so integral to the fabric of our country, that
repealing it will literally destroy the government as we know it.
Understanding that the Bill of Rights, as it stands, was so major a part
of states' acceptance of the Constitution, destroying the Bill of Rights
by repealing any of its constituent amendments will render that trust
irrevocably broken. At best, the Constitution will be dissolved and
States will revert to individual countries. At worst, it will plunge us
into the next civil war.
