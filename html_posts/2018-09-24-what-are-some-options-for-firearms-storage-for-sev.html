**What are some options for firearms storage for several months if I am
going to somewhere that doesn\'t allow personal firearms? Family is not
a good option because they are all on the other side of the country.**

There are a few options, and they vary in price.

Self-storage locations may have small locker-type storage rather than
renting a whole room. You must first check in your state to see if
leaving firearms in self-storage is legal, but if it is, this is a way
to go. It may not be cost-effective, but it will definitely work. Note
that you will not be able to store your ammunition, just your firearms.
If you do go the self-storage route, you can move your entire gun safe
into the storage room if they don't have lockers for you to use.

A second option is a pawn shop. Pawn shops have bad reputations, but
they actually have some valid uses, and storing your firearms is one of
them. Here's how you do it: pawn shops will give you a loan against
collateral you bring in. So you bring in your gun and get a loan with
the gun as collateral. You make payments on the loan, and as long as you
continue to make payments, they will hold the gun as collateral on the
loan. Once you're back, pay off the loan, and you get your gun back.
Similar to self-storage, the pawn shop will likely not store your ammo.
Make sure you read the contract carefully; they should not charge you
extra storage fees or any other charges. The downside, of course, is
that if you miss your payments, the pawn shop can sell your gun to get
their money back, but using a pawn shop is a valid method to store your
firearms while you're gone.

Valet storage is relatively new, but it allows you to store boxes
instead of renting a room and storing items that way. They give you
whatever boxes you need, you pack your stuff, and they take the boxes
and store them for you. Check with the valet storage company to see if
they will store guns for you and what their requirements are. Valet
storage is cheaper than renting a self-storage unit, or even a pawn
shop.

If you're only storing pistols, a bank's safe deposit box is a good,
inexpensive way to store firearms. Most bank safe deposit boxes allow
you to store guns (and again, not ammunition), and are actually very
reasonable to lease. The terms of the lease may not work for you, since
they generally are more into long-term storage of items.

Finally, if none of these options work for you, you can always pop down
to your local gun range and ask the staff. If they won't allow you to
leave your guns at the range (for a fee), they may know of some local
businesses which will store your guns for you. Some enterprising FFLs in
the area may offer such a service (I would if I had my FFL). The folks
at the range should know who those people are. Heck, I'd do it myself if
I could store your guns legally in my state without a background check.
