We\'ll take this a step at a time.

*I failed out of college. -* This has no bearing on whether or not the
military will pay for any schooling you may choose to attend.

*If I join the Air Force, will they pay my student loans?* - The
military will not pay any *previous* student loans you may have incurred
before you entered Active Duty. However, if you go to school *after* you
join the military, there are educational benefits available.

The military will pick up much of the tab for your schooling, but as
with everything, there is a catch. If you attend school while you are
active duty, you will incur a service commitment following your
graduation. This service commitment (for school) usually runs
*concurrently* with any other service commitments you may already have.
So if you already have a three year commitment, and you graduate from
college and thus incur a two year service commitment which starts the
day of your graduation, you would have zero additional commitment, as
you already have a three year commitment and your educational benefit
commitment would run concurrently with your existing commitment.

Let me give you a practical example. I graduated from USAFA in June,
1994, with a five year active duty service commitment, so that would
expire June, 1999. I started my Masters program January 1995, after
arriving at my first duty station in October, 1994. I graduated from my
Masters program in March, 1996, and incurred a two year service
commitment following graduation, which ran concurrently with any other
existing commitments. My education commitment expired in March, 1998,
but I still had commitment from USAFA. So my education commitment had no
effect on my total required service.

**TL;DR** - If you have existing loans, the Air Force will not pay
those. If you go to school while on Active Duty, education benefits are
available to help pay for the bulk of that cost.
