**Content:** [1. There is no right in the Constitution to own a car.
There is a right in the Constitution to own a gun. Big difference. You
drive at the pleasure of the State. Your driving privileges can be
revoked. Under normal circumstances (i.e. unless you\'re a felon or
seriously mentally ill), you can\'t lose your right to own a gun.\
\
2. If I have the need and the legal authority to take someone\'s life,
I\'m going to do it in the most efficient way possible, with the least
potential for injury to myself and others. The gun provides me with the
means to do just that. And what if my opponent is twice my size? I\'ll
admit, I\'m no Hulk. The gun is my equalizer. Finally, you have no right
to tell me what form of self-defense I can use if I am justified in
taking a life. I\'m defending myself; this has nothing to do with you.\
\
3. \"Most killing is done because someone is pissed and has a gun.\"\
\
Statistics don\'t support that assertion. Can you show me the statistics
that show that most murders (which are done with **malice** and
**forethought**) are actually impulse decisions with no forethought
involved? I\'m surprised we can convict *anyone* of murder if, as you
say, there is no forethought involved in most unlawful
killings.]{.rendered_qtext}
