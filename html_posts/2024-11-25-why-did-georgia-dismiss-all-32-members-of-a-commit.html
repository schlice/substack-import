So pretty straightforward: the committee violated the state's rules
about confidentiality, and when the investigation couldn't find the
leaker, all of the members of the committee were dismissed.

But the quote that really destroys the narrative you were probably going
for in asking this question:

> \[A\]ll new member seats would be filled through a new application

So **the committee still exists.** All the seats on the committee will
be re-filled, but they're going to do a better job ensuring that the
people who fill those seats can maintain their oath of confidentiality
better than the previous committee members.
