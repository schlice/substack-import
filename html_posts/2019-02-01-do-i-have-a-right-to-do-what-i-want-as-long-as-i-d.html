**Do I have a right to do what I want as long as I don't break the
law?**

In general, yes.

Remember the rule of thumb: your right to swing your arm stops at my
nose. The purpose of the law is to make sure that your exercise of your
rights doesn't interfere with my exercise of my rights.

Remember too that there are lots of laws, and they may not cover exactly
what you're doing but they may still be applicable.

While it may not be illegal to scream on a street corner because there's
no law against screaming on a street corner, you could be causing a
public nuisance, or inciting a riot, or engaging in a demonstration
without a city permit (depending on what street corner you are on). It
also doesn't mean that your activity, while legal, won't prompt some law
enforcement inquiry as to your mental state (again, doesn't have to be
illegal for the police to check on whether or not you've lost your
marbles).
