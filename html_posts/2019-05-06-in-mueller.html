**In Mueller\'s report, he said he wouldn\'t exonerate Trump and pointed
to the Justice Department guidance that a President couldn\'t be
indicted while in office as a reason for not reaching a conclusion.
Should Trump be indicted after leaving t/office?**

This is an incorrect statement.

1.  Mueller actually stated in his report, "while this report does not
    conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not
    exonerate him.\" In other words, Mueller declined to make a
    judgement. Mueller had three choices: (1) exonerate Trump; (2)
    declare that there was not enough evidence to indict Trump on
    obstruction; or (3) refuse to take a position. In this case, option
    2 is the best course of action, as AG Barr pointed out, because it
    would be impossible to meet the legal standard of obstruction of
    justice beyond a reasonable doubt. Additionally, Mueller laid out
    counterevidence for every single allegation of obstructive behavior
    by the President, which would make prosecution virtually impossible.
    But Mueller chose option 3 instead. Why? Because he knew he couldn't
    meet the legal standard for obstruction (so the right thing to do
    would have been to declare the same), so he "punted." Doing so
    leaves the door open for impeachment, and also smearing the AG for
    making a decision, since the AG was appointed by the President.
    Spreading the notion that the AG is the President's lap dog is the
    perfect way to fan the flames for impeachment.
2.  It was not Mueller who stated that Trump would have been indicted
    were it not for DOJ guidance. It was "hundreds of ex-DOJ
    prosecutors" in an open letter posted online (which CNN and every
    other mainstream media outlet picked up and ran). Mueller and Barr
    both emphatically stated that DOJ guidance did not factor into the
    decisions that either of them reached.\
    \
    Also, if you still want to indict Trump for obstruction of justice,
    if the DOJ policy is held to be true, the statute of limitations
    will be tolled during the period of time when you *cannot* indict
    someone. The statute of limitations would only run during the period
    of time that the defendant is indictable. Therefore, this charge
    will wait until the President leaves office. Then, if you think you
    have enough evidence, you can easily indict him. So the other false
    headline that the media is spouting, that Trump is merely trying to
    run out the statute of limitations, is ludicrous. You can't run out
    the statute of limitations while at the same time being unable to
    indict the target of the investigation. If you *can* indict a
    sitting President, you should have the courage to state that there
    is enough evidence to do so. But Mueller failed to do so, and the AG
    is siding with his Special Counsel.

The only logical course of action is for Congress to act if they feel
that impeachment is the way to go.
