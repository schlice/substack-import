There is only one way to get off of AcPro.

**IMPROVE YOUR GRADES.**

You usually get yourself on AcPro when your GPA drops below 2.0. When
you're on AcPro, (depending on institution), you are either required to
have a tutor or required to attend mandatory study time (usually both).
Take advantage of those. Improve your grades. That's the only fix for
AcPro.

Oh. and the two letters that will help you more than anything else: E I.
Extra Instruction. I have it on good authority that teachers won't fail
students who come in regularly for EI. It's not a sign of weakness to
get help, and most teachers I know will go out of their way to help
students who ask (i.e. come in early, stay late, etc).
