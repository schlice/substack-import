**Content:** [*Are you implying that you hate authority as a whole and
you want to show your hatred for authority by attempting to find a legal
method by which you can make a cop angry?*\

I put that comment in the question details, and then decided that was
the answer I would address.\
\
Short answer: good luck. Cops have seen it all and then some. Fun fact:
if you ever want to find out things that your mind would never have even
thought to comprehend, ask a cop about some of the weirdest experiences
he has seen, because he has seen it all. Without question. Cops deal
with the worst of the worst, all day, every day. Cops see people at
their worst. It\'s unlikely you\'d be able to come up with anything that
would piss off a cop. Mostly you\'d just be lumped into the same
category as all the other morons: not worth the time, effort, and/or
paperwork.]{.rendered_qtext}
