<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [*Are you implying that you hate authority as a whole and<br>you want to show your hatred for authority by attempting to find a legal<br>method by which you can make a cop angry?*\<br>\<br>I put that comment in the question details, and then decided that was<br>the answer I would address.\<br>\<br>Short answer: good luck. Cops have seen it all and then some. Fun fact:<br>if you ever want to find out things that your mind would never have even<br>thought to comprehend, ask a cop about some of the weirdest experiences<br>he has seen, because he has seen it all. Without question. Cops deal<br>with the worst of the worst, all day, every day. Cops see people at<br>their worst. It\'s unlikely you\'d be able to come up with anything that<br>would piss off a cop. Mostly you\'d just be lumped into the same<br>category as all the other morons: not worth the time, effort, and/or<br>paperwork.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
