Since you're talking about college, I would look into a Bachelor's
degree in Criminal Justice or something similar. Barring that (if your
college doesn't offer), a Legal Studies or another Pre-law related
Bachelor's degree would be useful.

While a specific degree isn't required to become a police officer in any
jurisdiction that I'm aware of, if you're in college getting a degree,
focusing on understanding the foundation of the legal system in our
country is a great way to focus your efforts towards any law-related
field. If you have the ability to take a Criminal Justice and a
Constitutional Law class, do it.
