**Why should I buy any cell phone that refuses to let me remove the
battery?**

It's all about compromise.

Do you want \<that_cool_new_feature\>? You can only get it in the
"flagship" or "premium" handsets, and none of them have removable
batteries. And waterproofing was the major feature that drove handset
manufacturers to move to non-replaceable batteries. IP68 certified
devices will not have removable batteries.

And "refuse" is a strong word. You can remove and replace the battery
--- you just can't do it by yourself. You do need an authorized repair
shop to do it, but you probably won't need to.

Consider that the average life span of a mobile device is about two
years, and the average life span of a mobile phone battery is perhaps
slightly less, but pretty close. You can probably get away with not
replacing the battery for the life of the device.

If having a removable battery is that important to you and every other
feature is peanuts, then you have narrowed your choice of phones you can
buy accordingly. It's all about what's important to you.
