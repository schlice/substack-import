We can really only answer this question when you can explain how you can
"politely" **take away someone's property**.

You can **buy** the property from them, but that may get a little
expensive for you.

You can **steal** the property from them, but the police might have
something to say about that. Also, it's not very polite, and it might
get you a bullet in your body if you break into their house to steal
their property.

You can **ask** them to simply give you their property. You can expect
that they probably won't though.

Unless you can tell me how you intend to "politely" dispossess someone
of their legally-acquired property, there's really no way we can help
you here.
