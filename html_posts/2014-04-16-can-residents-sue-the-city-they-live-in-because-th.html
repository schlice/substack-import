**Content:** [The short answer is yes, you can file a suit. You would
have a simple tort claim for \"trespassing\" and the case could be made
that the government\'s inaction created the condition which allowed the
trespass onto your property. You\'re going to have a tough time coming
up with a suggested remedy, because there hasn\'t been any
damage\...yet.\
\
This would be the time to petition the city to get the problem addressed
sooner rather than later, because if damage does occur, you will have to
pursue legal action. Make sure you include the city engineering
department as well as the city legal department. Don\'t be surprised if
they try to bully you and say it\'s your fault or whatever; it\'s not.
You are responsible for your property, they for theirs. And if their
property is in a condition that is causing a trespass on to your
property, they are liable for that condition.]{.rendered_qtext}
