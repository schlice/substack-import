This is an example of a rhetorical question. It contains its own answer.
It's like the joke, "what happens when you throw a white rock into the
Red Sea?" "It gets wet."

So if abortions were free, and child support was repealed, would we see
a decrease in out of wedlock births?

YES! Of course we would! Because instead of those children being born,
they'd all be ***killed!***

Of course, abortions are never free. Those doctors and hospitals and
Planned Parenthood all have to be paid by someone. It's just that the
point of payment moves from the patient at the time of service to the
patient simply paying taxes and those taxes paying for everyone's
services.

I'm curious though. Do you believe that a decrease in "out of wedlock
births" justifies an increase in dead babies? Maybe it does to you. For
me, that's not necessarily a moral calculation that I'm comfortable
making. How many dead babies is worth a decrease in out of wedlock
births? 10,000? 100,000? And why stop at *birth*? I mean, babies still
have to be cared for and fed for several years because they can't
survive on their own. They're actually *more* of a burden after they're
born than before. So why limit the killing to birth? Why not make it the
first year or two? Just take your baby to a government-funded
extermination center for disposal. I mean, tax dollars are unlimited, so
let's make a whole new government-run industry just destroying unwanted
babies. Easy peesey, right?
