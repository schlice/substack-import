It's actually shorter to list the states with complete abortion bans led
by Democrats: Louisiana and Kentucky.

Twelve other states have enacted complete abortion bans:

- Idaho
- North Dakota
- South Dakota
- Oklahoma
- Texas
- Missouri
- Arkansas
- Mississippi
- Alabama
- Tennessee
- Indiana
- West Virginia

Twenty one states in total either ban abortion or restrict the procedure
earlier in pregnancy than the standard set by *Roe.* The additional
seven states which have set limits earlier than *Roe* did includes two
states controlled by Democrats: Arizona and North Carolina (and North
Carolina is unique because they have a Republican-controlled Legislature
and a Democrat governor, and some of this legislation was passed over
the governor's veto by a legislative supermajority). The remaining five
states:

- Utah
- Nebraska
- Florida
- Georgia
- South Carolina
