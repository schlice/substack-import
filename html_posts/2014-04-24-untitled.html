<h2>Answer Comment</h2>
<div>

**Content:** [No one was forcing the driver behind to exceed the speed
limit; the police were not creating a condition in which someone would
break the law when they would normally not (the very definition of
entrapment). I would think entrapment would be a very difficult defense
to make in such a scenario. Additionally, there are several reasons an
officer can exceed the speed limit without lights and siren; this
behavior of an officer is not an indication that the public is thus
allowed to break the law. If the police were simultaneously speeding and
covering up or obstructing the view of speed limit signs, this could
potentially be considered entrapment, but no such scenario was offered.
No one is affirmatively stating that the speed limit is null and void,
and a reasonable person would not believe that a speeding police car is
an affirmative indication of a lack of a speed limit, so entrapment by
estoppel is not a defense either.\
\
As far as most VTLs (Vehicle and Traffic Laws) are concerned, cruisers
are considered \"emergency vehicles\" and are therefore not subject to
speed limits other than what the local department policy
dictates.]{.rendered_qtext}
