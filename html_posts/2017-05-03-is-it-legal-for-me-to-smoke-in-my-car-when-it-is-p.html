While the car is indeed your property, when you *voluntarily* drove the
car onto school property, you agreed to respect school rules, which
includes not smoking on school property. You (and your car) agree to be
bound by those rules, and you tacitly agreed to that when you drove your
car onto school property.

If you instead leave you car in the parking lot and walk off of school
property (perhaps onto the public sidewalk outside of school property),
you can have your smoke.
