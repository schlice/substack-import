Even vacant land has an address. Whether it be a street address, or a
plot on a parcel map, every piece of land is addressible.

The easiest way to find the owner of vacant land is to take the actual
parcel address and submit it into the County website. You'll find
multiple ways to identify the parcel on their website.

The County is keenly aware of who owns what piece of land, for one very
important reason: **taxes**. Every parcel owner pays taxes on every
piece of land, so the county knows who owns what.

If you have trouble with the website, contact the county's tax
collector's office. They will help you find the owner of the parcel.
