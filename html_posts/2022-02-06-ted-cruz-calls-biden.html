Is it really history in the making if you have to force the hand of
history?

Is it really a historically significant moment if you have to violate
Federal hiring practices to do it? Under Federal hiring laws enforced by
the EEOC, it is illegal to discriminate on the basis of race or sex. By
declaring that he will only select a black woman, he has now declared
that he will violate federal hiring laws.

It's one thing to look at an entire pool of qualified candidates (which
includes men and women of all ages and races) and select a black female
because she was the best choice. It's quite another to arbitrarily
narrow the playing field before you even choose a candidate. While I'm
certain she will be very qualified, and you'll certainly be able to say
that, you won't be able to say that she is the *most* qualified, because
you have artificially narrowed your candidate pool to only those
candidates who, by their very choice, "make history."

To me, it's a pyrrhic victory. It rings hollow as "history in the
making" when you have to violate the law and force it to happen, rather
than it happening organically.

(EDIT) And yes, I know Trump did it too when he chose Amy Coney Barrett.
He chose from a list of women. It was wrong when Trump did it, and it
will be just as wrong when Biden does it.

Original question:

Ted Cruz calls Biden\'s promise to nominate the first black woman to the
Supreme Court \'offensive\' and \'insulting.\' Why don\'t Republicans
see this as \'history in the making\'?
