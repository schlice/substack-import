As with any legal question, the answer is "it depends." Laws on when a
guardian can be removed vary by state.

Here in Florida, there are 21 reasons a guardian can be removed:

1.  Fraud in obtaining her or his appointment.
2.  Failure to discharge her or his duties.
3.  Abuse of her or his powers.
4.  An incapacity or illness, including substance abuse, which renders
    the guardian incapable of discharging her or his duties.
5.  Failure to comply with any order of the court.
6.  Failure to return schedules of property sold or accounts of sales of
    property or to produce and exhibit the ward's assets when so
    required.
7.  The wasting, embezzlement, or other mismanagement of the ward's
    property.
8.  Failure to give bond or security for any purpose when required by
    the court or failure to file with the annual guardianship plan the
    evidence required by s. 744.351 that the sureties on her or his bond
    are alive and solvent.
9.  Conviction of a felony.
10. Appointment of a receiver, trustee in bankruptcy, or liquidator for
    any corporate guardian.
11. Development of a conflict of interest between the ward and the
    guardian.
12. Having been found guilty of, regardless of adjudication, or entered
    a plea of *nolo contendere* or guilty to, any offense prohibited
    under s. 435.04 or similar statute of another jurisdiction.
13. A material failure to comply with the guardianship report by the
    guardian.
14. A failure to comply with the rules for timely filing the initial and
    annual guardianship reports.
15. A failure to fulfill the guardianship education requirements.
16. The improper management of the ward's assets.
17. A material change in the ward's financial circumstances such that
    the guardian is no longer qualified to manage the finances of the
    ward, or the previous degree of management is no longer required.
18. After appointment, the guardian becomes a disqualified person as set
    forth in s. 744.309(3).
19. Upon a showing by a person who did not receive notice of the
    petition for adjudication of incapacity, when such notice is
    required, or who is related to the ward within the relationships
    specified for nonresident relatives in SS. 744.309(2) and 744.312(2)
    and who has not previously been rejected by the court as a guardian
    that the current guardian is not a family member and subsection (20)
    applies.
20. Upon a showing that removal of the current guardian is in the best
    interest of the ward. In determining whether a guardian who is
    related by blood or marriage to the ward is to be removed, there
    shall be a rebuttable presumption that the guardian is acting in the
    best interests of the ward.
21. A bad faith failure to submit guardianship records during the audit
    pursuant to s. 744.368. (Fl. Stat 744.474)

At least in Florida, guardianship can only be removed for one of these
reasons.

If you still believe that you need to have your guardianship removed,
you will need to talk to a licensed attorney in your area.
