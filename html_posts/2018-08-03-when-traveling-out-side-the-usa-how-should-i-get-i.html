**When traveling out side the USA, how should I get internet for my
phone (T-Mobile)?**

There are several things you can do, depending on whether or not your
phone is locked to T-Mobile.

If you're still paying for your phone, there's a good chance it's locked
to T-Mobile's network. Check out [[this
answer](https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-know-which-network-my-phone-is-locked-to/answer/Bill-Stein)]{.qlink_container}
for more information on how to find out if your handset is
carrier-locked.

- If your handset is carrier-locked to T-Mobile, **your best bet** is to
  add International Data to your plan. Good news: if your plan is
  T-Mobile ONE, you already have International data and texting in over
  140 countries around the world. Check the T-Mobile website to see if
  the country you are going to is included. If you're not on T-Mobile
  ONE, you can still easily add international data and texting to your
  plan. Just call Customer Service (611 from your phone) and ask to add
  international text and data to your existing plan.
- If your handset is not carrier-locked to T-Mobile, you have even more
  options. You could use the same option above, or you could buy a
  pre-paid GSM SIM card at the airport when you arrive at your
  destination. Pop it in and you have pre-paid data. Make sure you buy
  enough data. Remember though, if you keep refilling your data, this
  can get pricey. But you won't have to worry about any international
  roaming charges if you're not on a T-Mobile ONE plan.

There are other options, but they are more complex and arguably more
expensive (i.e. buying a pre-paid phone at the airport, etc).
