¿Por qué no los dos?

In Christianity, you have the Trinity™. One God, three persons: God the
Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit.

So you can worship one God, who has as His nature three distinct beings.

Original question:

Is it more beneficial to worship only one god, or can we worship
