Yes. But there are different ways you "hold them accountable" in your
two scenarios:

- **Breaking laws:** Contact an attorney in your area to help, full
  stop. If you find the HOA breaking the law, your very next stop is a
  lawyer. You also may have a process in your Declarations which allows
  you to *recall* a Board member; you might look into that as well.
- **Making bad decisions:** Elections are the answer. People are elected
  to office, but there is no requirement to *do well* in that position.
  The correct method to handle an HOA that makes bad decisions is to
  elect people who will make *better* decisions.\
  \
  The problem, of course, is that very few people actually step up to
  run the HOA. So you end up with people who are there for the wrong
  reasons.\
  \
  Some people are there because they are retired and have nothing else
  to do. They tend to micromanage their positions and place too great an
  emphasis on the importance of them, simply because the HOA becomes
  their "only job." Some people are there because they think they can
  run an HOA better than anyone else, and they try to be everyone's
  friend. They'll often work outside of official channels, try to use
  the "good ol' boy" system, and try to generally be as congenial as
  possible. This can backfire when corrections need to take place.\
  \
  Regardless, the way to fix someone making bad decisions is to get
  someone else in there who will make *better* decisions.
