**If persons within the military industrial complex push through a
weapon system they know to be defective, causing deaths and defeats, can
they be charged with treason?**

No.

They will be sued, not arrested. It will be a defective product lawsuit.
These lawsuits happen at the state level, and depending on the state, a
defective product lawsuit may allege negligence, strict liability or a
breach of warranty as to the defective product.

The only way you could claim treason is if we were at war and the
company was specifically acting as an agent of the enemy, intending to
inject the design flaw to aid the enemy and injure or kill US troops.
