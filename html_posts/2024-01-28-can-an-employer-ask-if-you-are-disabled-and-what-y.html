Can they ask? Sure! They can ask anything they want. But during your job
interview, it would be really foolish for them to do so. Why? Because if
they do ask you, and you don't get the job, you could reasonably accuse
them of violating ADA and not hiring you because of your disability. So
smart employers don't ask you about your disability during your job
interview.

Generally, the only thing an employer will ask you during the interview
is this following sanitized generalized question:

*Can you perform the essential functions of this job with or without
reasonable accommodations?*

If you answer yes, then you can move forward. Of course, it leaves open
to interpretation what exactly is "reasonable," but I digress.

> **Are there any examples of reasonable accommodations under the
> Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)?**

Certainly. Let's say you are a cashier at a grocery store. You have a
prosthetic leg. A reasonable accommodation would be to provide you a
stool at your register because putting that much pressure on your
prosthesis for that long is challenging. It doesn't cause an undue
hardship to the business, and you're able to continue to do your job.
