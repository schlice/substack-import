**How accurate is an MRI to diagnose multiple sclerosis?**

The MRI is one of the most important tools used in diagnosing MS, *but
it alone cannot diagnose MS.*

MS is a diagnosis of *exclusion*, because there is no one symptom unique
to it. Even the small, ovoid patches (in other words, little white
spots) on an MRI can be caused by other diseases. Therefore, you have to
*exclude* all other diseases and conditions which might cause little
white spots on an MRI.

Along with the MRI, the neurologist will begin to exclude all other
known diseases and conditions which can cause an MRI to show white
lesions on the brain. A panel of blood tests are performed (colloquially
called, no surprise, the "little white spot series") which rule out
other diseases which can cause both the symptom experienced and the
white spots on the MRI.

The MRI has become so important in the diagnosis of MS that the
diagnostic criteria used to diagnose the disease were changed to include
a positive MRI. This criteria is called the [[**McDonald
criteria**](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=891dab&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonald_criteria){.external_link

had to have two separate symptoms of MS "disseminated by space and
time." Dissemination in space means in two separate areas of the CNS
(i.e. the brain, the spinal cord, the optic nerve, etc). Dissemination
in time meant no closer together than six months. Therefore, in order to
get a full diagnosis of MS, you would have to have two relapses.

In 2017, the McDonald criteria were updated to include evidence of one
of those two symptoms appearing only on an MRI. Therefore, you can show
symptoms in only one functional system of the body, and show evidence on
an MRI of the inclusion of a second functional system, and of course,
run the "little white spot series" to rule out any other possible causes
of the symptoms or the little white spots. So for a person who has had
only one attack, the MRI can provide the evidence that a second system
is involved, and that the second event is older, disseminated by time
(the MRI can show active lesions, and lesions which were active but are
now inactive, using [[**gadolinium
enhancement**](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=b22a95&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MRI_contrast_agent){.external_link

qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}).

Therefore, it's fair to say that the MRI is so important in the
diagnosis of MS, that as of 2017, you can now be diagnosed after only
one relapse, if you have an MRI which shows evidence of previous disease
activity in another functional area of the
CNS.[\[1\]](#vHswA){#cite-vHswA .citation_link}
