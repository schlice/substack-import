Only if you're under the care of a doctor. If your doctor recommended
you do this, then follow his or her directions. If not, then don't do
this. There's way too much risk if it's not managed correctly. You risk
liver and kidney damage, at a minimum.

Only start or stop a therapy with the guidance of your doctor.
