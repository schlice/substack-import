As with all legal answers, the correct answer is "it depends." In order
to be absolutely sure, you would need to consult with a lawyer in your
area. I'll try to respond in a general way, for informational purposes
only.

So long as the camera **does not record audio** (there are separate laws
which cover that), and is in a **shared space**, not a space in which
there is a reasonable expectation of privacy (such as a bedroom or a
bathroom), then a landlord can likely install a surveillance camera for
security purposes.

The laws in your area may require that he post signage advising all who
enter that there are security cameras and entering the space implies
consent to monitoring, but those laws vary. Your local laws may not
require this.
