The question itself is a non-sequitur. The first part of the question is
completely unrelated to the second part of the question.

But I understand what you're trying to ask. You're asking why pro-life
people claim that abortion is not a safe and effective form of birth
control.

For now, I'll ignore the non-sequitur and try to answer your question.
In order to do that, we need to define how safe and effective *other*
forms of birth control are in relation to abortion. So let's do that.
Let's review all of the available forms of birth control, and let's talk
about how safe they are, and then how effective they are:

- *Coitus interruptus*: or in English, "pulling out." This form of birth
  control is mostly safe. As far as my research goes, no one has died
  from pulling out. Safety, however, includes other factors, such as
  prevention of sexually-transmitted infections (STIs). This method is
  completely ineffective at preventing STIs, so it cannot be considered
  to be completely safe. Effectiveness, however, varies, but on average,
  *coitus interruptus* is only about 80% effective at preventing
  pregnancy. The pre-ejaculate actually does contain sperm cells, so the
  possibility exists that pregnancy may still result even when
  intercourse is interrupted before climax. However, the main reason why
  *coitus interruptus* fails is when *coitus interruptus* becomes
  *coitus almostus interruptus.* Failing to pull out in time is the
  number one reason why the pull-out method fails.
- *Condom:* Condoms are also nearly 100% safe if used correctly (very
  few people in history have died from condom use, unless there was a
  previously undiagnosed latex allergy which isn't effectively treated),
  and if they are used *totally perfectly*, they are about 98%
  effective. Typical effectiveness is about 87%. This is usually due to
  the condom tearing during sex, or intercourse continuing following
  ejaculation causing the sperm to leak out.
- *Hormone-based birth control:* Hormonal birth control, when used
  perfectly, can be up to 99% effective at preventing pregnancy. In
  typical usage, however, it is only about 91% effective. For most
  healthy women, hormonal birth control is safe for long-term use. But
  for some women (especially women who smoke), hormonal birth control
  carries a risk of blood clots, which can cause pulmonary embolisms,
  heart attack or stroke.
- *Abortion:* Abortions are 0% effective at preventing pregnancy. They
  do prevent *birth*, so abortions are about 99% effective at preventing
  birth. They are not 100% effective, as there are cases of babies
  surviving the abortion process. In terms of safety, however, the
  numbers are not quite so encouraging. According to the World Health
  Organization, 60% of all unintended pregnancies end in an induced
  abortion. Around 45% of all abortions are unsafe, of which 97% take
  place in developing countries. Unsafe abortion is a leading -- but
  preventable -- cause of maternal deaths and morbidities. It can lead
  to physical and mental health complications and social and financial
  burdens for women, communities and health systems. 78,000 women die
  each year globally from unsafe abortions.

Therefore, we can say the following about abortion:

- Abortion is an *effective* method of birth control, at nearly 99%
  effectiveness.
- However, of all of the methods available, abortion carries the highest
  risk of complications, so therefore, we cannot say that it is a *safe*
  method of birth control.

There are other methods of birth control which are just as effective and
much more safe than abortion.
