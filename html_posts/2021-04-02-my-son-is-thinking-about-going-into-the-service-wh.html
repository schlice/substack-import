**My son is thinking about going into the service. What would be the
safest job for him where he could avoid combat?**

First, you need to understand the difference between *deployment* and
*combat*.

**Not all military personnel are** ***front-line combat troops*, but**
***any career field, legitimately, can deploy.***

Clearly, there are certain career fields who are seemingly deployed all
the time. Security Forces, Combat Controllers, and any career field
associated with work directly on the flight line (aircraft maintenance,
etc) deploy regularly.

But if you are in a worldwide-deployable unit, and you are deployable,
you deploy with your unit. There are only a scant few career fields
which are non-deployable, and they are usually in very niche fields or
short-term billets. But even those fields are slowly changing and are
deploying more regularly. The only field which is not compelled to
deploy is government civilians who work at military bases. They can
voluntarily deploy, but unless you signed up for a position which can be
deployed, they will provide the consistency at the base while the
military teams deploy.

But *deploying* is worlds different from seeing *actual combat.*

There are many career fields which will never use the firearms training
they got in Basic Training outside of Basic Training. Support staff at
bases and posts outnumber the actual front-line fighters, and those
folks will not see combat unless combat comes to them at their base.

There are even some career fields which have combat specialty units
within them. For example, I was a Communications officer, and we have a
specialty unit called *Combat Comm* which was a highly deployable front
line unit.

So unless you choose a career field which is actually a front-line
combat field, you will still deploy, but you'll do the same job you did
stateside, just overseas.
