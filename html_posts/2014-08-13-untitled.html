But<br>your prejudice seems to be that you presume that everyone who is not<br>military or law enforcement or works in a profession in which you<br>routinely carry firearms is unstable. That is your prejudice. Make sure<br>you pay and leave peacefully. Make sure you tell the manager you will<br>never be back.\<br>\<br>I wouldn\'t want to dine with people who espouse such<br>prejudices.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/If-you-are-eating-in-a-restaurant-and-someone-enters-carrying-a-gun-can-you-legally-leave-without-paying-because-you-believe-the-person-is-potentially-a-danger-of-robbery-or-harm-death-to-patrons-of-the-restaurant/answer/Jeff-Darcy<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
