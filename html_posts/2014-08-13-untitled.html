I don\'t hang out where unstable people tend to congregate either. But
your prejudice seems to be that you presume that everyone who is not
military or law enforcement or works in a profession in which you
routinely carry firearms is unstable. That is your prejudice. Make sure
you pay and leave peacefully. Make sure you tell the manager you will
never be back.\
\
I wouldn\'t want to dine with people who espouse such
prejudices.]{.rendered_qtext}
