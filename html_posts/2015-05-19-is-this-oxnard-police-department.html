**Content:** [Since I was A2A I\'ll answer, but I\'ve got far far less
real world experience with EDPs than either [[Tim
Dees](https://www.quora.com/profile/Tim-Dees)]{.qlink_container} or [[Al
Saibini](https://www.quora.com/profile/Al-Saibini)]{.qlink_container}
have, so I\'ll comment about the article specifically.\
\
This is a fluff piece, meant to play on emotions, and the focus of the
writer is the classic fallacy being bandied about these days: the police
have created the problems causing all manner of crime. Consider the
following \"thought-provoking\" comments from the article:\
\

> The cop survival code will continue to trump everything, and community
> efforts to get the cops to clean house and reform will be ignored\

\
As Tim mentioned, nowhere in the police officer\'s job description does
it say \"gets killed when necessary.\" If you are presented with a
life-or-death situation, you\'re going to have to make a judgment call.
That call is simply, \"Am I going home at the end of my shift in my car,
or in a body bag?\" I think it\'s a pretty straightforward choice.\
\

> and any effort at community policing, CIT included, initiated by the
> cops is a fraud because the cops are at war with the American public.

\
When you enter the debate with the mindset that the police have
\"created\" the problem instead of \"responding\" to the problem,
you\'ve put the cart before the horse. It is a logical fallacy to ask
the police to respond to violence, and then condemn the police for doing
so.\

\
So let me review this logic once again:\

- You deinstitutionalize the mentally ill.

<!-- -->

- You ask the police to handle the fallout when the mentally ill
  confront society.
- You condemn the police for doing ***exactly what you asked them to
  do***.
- Your \"solution\" is to send someone else in first on mental health
  calls.

All I can say is, \"good luck with that.\" I hope your first responders
have bulletproof vests and up-to-date organ donor cards. Because you
won\'t be preventing much death; you\'ll just be starting with one of
your SAVE volunteers dead first, then your EDP will be dead when the
police move in. So all you\'ll be doing is increasing the body count.
Was that really your goal?\
\
But if this is what the community wants, we can absolutely send a SAVE
team in first. The SAVE volunteer will have to specifically agree that
their families may not sue the police when they are killed. My only
requirement would be that we set a police perimeter so that the EDP
cannot escape. The police will NOT enter the area where the SAVE
volunteer is working unless specifically called. If the SAVE volunteer
fails or is killed and the EDP tries to escape, the police will prevent
any further loss of life or danger to the general public. And yes, that
will involve traditional police \"de-escalation\" tactics. But SAVE will
be in there first, just as the public wants. The SAVE team can then
recount, with vivid detail, what didn\'t work and what did. Or their
body-mount cameras will talk for them, when they\'re dead. Because we
will also send them in there with those.\
\
We could also send the SAVE team member in with a radio with a RD (radio
distress) button. It\'s kinda like a \"silent alarm\" for a person. It
can\'t be accidentally activated, but when it is activated, the police
can go in and take over, if the subject is too violent. The police can
attempt to subdue the person and take him into custody.\
\
The fallacy that the police have created the problem that they are
fighting to control is sad and sickening to me, but we can roll with it.
If there are volunteers brave enough to go into these situations to try
to de-escalate them, more power to them, but the police will not allow
the general public to be hurt when they fail.
