**Why is nudity related to sex? Why is nudity not related as an art or
just how the human anatomy is? Why sex?**

Simple: because we spend the majority of our lives wearing clothes.

Nudity can be related to art, and nudity is also fundamental to any
study of human anatomy.

But because we spend the majority of our lives wearing clothes, and only
removing them to bathe or procreate, nudity gets implicitly tied to sex.
