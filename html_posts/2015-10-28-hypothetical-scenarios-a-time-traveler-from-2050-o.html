**Content:** [First of all, definitely take the deal, and don\'t worry
about the fact that you\'re going to impact the timeline and the future
to which she is returning will be radically different because of your
2050 laptop.\
\
You won\'t really be able to use the 2050 laptop in 2015, because none
of our infrastructure is tailored to support technology which hasn\'t
been built yet. So instead, you\'re going to take the 2050 laptop to
really smart computer people and sell it for almost as much as the
first-gen iPad Pro in the future, if not more. The tech guys will
dissect it and learn all sorts of new stuff about how to make
better/faster/smaller computers today. We will use that technology today
to make computers better. This will alter the future of computing, and
the future to which the time traveler returns will be very different
from the one she left, because computers have taken a giant leap
forward.\

(EDIT) I like what [[Mil
Ford](https://www.quora.com/profile/Mil-Ford)]{.qlink_container} said.
Figure out who made the chips and the computer. They\'re probably the
next Apple. Invest heavily in them while they are start-ups. Become
independently wealthy by 2050.]{.rendered_qtext}
