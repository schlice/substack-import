Military police are charged with protecting the personnel and facilities
on a military installation. Their jurisdiction ends at the gate, and the
only exception to that is the "hot pursuit rule" which is similar for
both military and civilian law enforcement. The *Posse Comitatus Act*
prevents the military from enforcing civilian law; someone violating a
state or local ordinance on a military installation would be "detained"
until civilian law enforcement could come and pick them up.

Military police also enforce the rules listed in the Uniform Code of
Military Justice, and violations are referred back to the unit commander
for resolution.
