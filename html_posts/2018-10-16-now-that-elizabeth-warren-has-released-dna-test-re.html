First of all, Warren was *excoriated* by the Cherokee Nation for
thinking that DNA evidence *at all* means you're part of a tribe:

Secondly, the media going along with it, claiming that she actually *is*
Native American because she has somewhere between 1/64th and 1/1024th
Native American lineage in her DNA, makes them look like apologists and
not journalists.

Third, Trump called her "Fauxcahontas," not Pocahontas. That name is
brilliant and she deserves it.

Finally, Trump did exactly what Trump does: he forced Warren to respond
to the charge, and she stepped in it eloquently. Like the linked article
says, Trump makes his opponents do stupid stuff and then he beats them
with their own stupidity.

But if you're liberal, I encourage you to continue with this
foolishness. You can never have enough political ammunition come
Election Day.
