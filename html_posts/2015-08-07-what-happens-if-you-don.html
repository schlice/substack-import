**Content:** [I think not responding is a pretty poor choice. You could
be opening yourself up to hardships if/when you return to the US.\
\
In Colorado, we have the option to postpone our jury duty by return mail
should we be out of the country. There is also a disqualification
section on the return card which you would fill out if you met any of
the conditions for disqualification (i.e. have a physical or mental
condition, can\'t understand/read/speak English, etc). Check the card
you received in the mail to find out exactly how to file for
postponement or disqualification.\
\
If you are not returning to the US any time soon, you will likely have
to check with the jurisdiction issuing your jury summons about
disqualification from service. I can\'t guarantee leniency as there are
very few factors which trigger disqualification from service.\
\
(EDIT) The original question did not have the question details:\
\"I didn\'t receive anything, as far as I know. That is my concern: that
I\'m away and won\'t know if I get one.\"\
\
You should contact the city or county in which your US state driver\'s
license is registered. If you own a home in the US, contact the city or
county in which your home is located. It\'s easy enough to find on the
Internet with a few quick searches. Be proactive about it, and ask them
about disqualification/postponement now, not when you\'ve been summoned
to jury duty.]{.rendered_qtext}
