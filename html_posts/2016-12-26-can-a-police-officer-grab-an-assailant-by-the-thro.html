As [[Ralph](https://www.quora.com/profile/Ralph-1517)]{.qlink_container}
mentioned, **anyone** who is faced with an attack which could cause
grave bodily harm can use **any force**, up to and including deadly
force, to defend themselves from that attack. This includes law
enforcement officers and civilians alike. While the person will still
face legal scrutiny, the doctrine of self-defense indemnifies the victim
against charges.

So to answer your specific question, yes, a police officer can grab an
assailant by the throat, or any other part of the assailant's body, if
he is attacked, in order to defend himself.
