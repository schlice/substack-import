We could, but the Golden Rule still applies.

If we don't want other nations pressuring us to intervene in
international conflicts where we do not wish to interfere, we should
probably not do the same thing to others.

It's so odd. People complain that they don't want us to be the world's
police, but then they post stuff like this which is an example of us
dictating how other sovereign nations should act, and trying to use our
influence as the biggest, baddest kid on the block to get what we want.

You can't have it both ways.
