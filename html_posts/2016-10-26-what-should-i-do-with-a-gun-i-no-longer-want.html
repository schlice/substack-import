All answers here are excellent, I would follow [[Jon
Mixon](https://www.quora.com/profile/Jon-Mixon-1)]{.qlink_container}'s
advice.

The only caveat: before you do **anything** with your gun, be sure you
understand your state's laws regarding transfer of firearms. For
example, Colorado has a "universal background check" law, so unless you
are gifting a gun to a first-degree relative, the person getting your
gun through sale or gift must have a background check performed by a
FFL.

Please be sure that your gift/sale/disposal does not violate local laws.
