**I\'m planning to purchase a stun gun for protecting myself against
possible robberies and street crime? How does it work and what\'s the
best way to test its working?**

Hopefully you're certain what a stun gun is.

This is a stun gun:

Stun guns have **contact probes** which stick out of the front of the
unit, similar to this one. When they make contact with something and the
unit is activated, any current will flow through them. To that end, stun
guns require **direct contact with your assailant** in order to work.
Stun guns are not a *standoff device*; you cannot use them at standoff
distances. You must essentially be point-blank to touch the probes to
your attacker.

You'll also notice two probes facing each other towards the middle.
These are called **test probes**. When nothing is touching the contact
probes and you activate the stun gun, current will arc between the test
probes.

The best way to learn how to use this device is to take a self-defense
class which includes using a stun gun. I would not recommend carrying
one without some level of training, even though you can buy these
devices from anywhere.

You should also make sure you check your local laws to ensure that you
are permitted to carry one, as laws vary widely across states and around
the world.
