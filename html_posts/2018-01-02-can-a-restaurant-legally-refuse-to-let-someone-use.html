Laws for restroom access for customers are made at the state level.
Federal law only requires that restrooms be made available to employees.

To answer your question, restaurants do not have "public restrooms,"
since restaurants are not "public locations." Restaurants are
**privately owned locations** **which are open to the public**. There's
a difference. Being a private facility, the restaurant can restrict the
use of its facilities to whomever they choose, and most restaurants
restrict their facilities to paying customers to save money. Regardless,
the restaurant must remain compliant with state law regarding who must
be given access to restrooms in food service establishments. In order to
find out who can be restricted and when, check the laws in your state.
