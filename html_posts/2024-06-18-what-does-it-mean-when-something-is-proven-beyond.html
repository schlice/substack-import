Most knowledge we possess is gained through **induction**. Induction is
the process by which we take specific observations and use them to come
up with a general conclusion. We all do this, every single day. For
example, you go to sit in a chair. Will that chair hold your weight? You
don't know, but you have some specific observations:

- The screws all seem to be in place.
- The chair appears to be sturdy.
- Historically, chairs designed with this material in this configuration
  have held your weight.

So while you can never know with 100% certainty whether or not that
chair will hold your weight, you can know *beyond a reasonable doubt*
(not beyond all doubt) that the chair will hold your weight when you sit
in it, and you rely on that knowledge.

*But you can't be 100% sure! How can you sit in the chair without being
100% sure?*

**Faith**.

You have faith that the knowledge you do have indicates the general
conclusion that the chair is safe to sit in. **Faith bridges the gap
between the undeniable and the unknowable.**

The exception to the induction rule is called the *perfect induction*
and it happens when all possible specific observations are known. For
example, I can say "My right hand contains nothing but pennies." You can
examine all the coins in my right hand and you can make the general
conclusion that the knowledge gained through induction is 100% true. So
there is one time where you can say that something is true beyond *all*
doubt.

However, in the vast majority of cases, knowledge gained through
induction is never 100% true beyond *all* doubt.

\

The case of the existence of God follows the same rules of inductive
reasoning. It is true beyond reasonable doubt, but not beyond all doubt.
We can never know with 100% certainty that God exists, because we cannot
know all the answers to make a 100% certain conclusion. Some things we
will never know while we are alive on this earth. No one observed the
Big Bang. No one saw what existed before the Big Bang. No one has the
ability to traverse past the end of the universe. There are certain
pieces of information we will never be able to access.

Therefore, we can never, while we are alive, know with 100% certainty if
God exists. We can only say that with the rational and logical evidence
we do have, we are certain *beyond a reasonable doubt*, but not beyond
all doubt.

There is abundant evidence to show that God exists, but it's not direct
evidence of God Himself. For example, the scientific evidence
overwhelmingly confirms that the universe exploded into being out of
nothing. Either someone created something out of nothing (the theistic
view), or no one created something out of nothing (the atheistic view).
Which view is more reasonable? The theistic view. Which view requires
more faith? The atheistic view.

Also, the simplest life form contains the information-equivalent of
1,000 encyclopedias. Theists believe only an intelligent being can
create a life form containing the equivalent of 1,000 encyclopedias.
Atheists believe non-intelligent natural forces can do it. Theists have
evidence to support their conclusion (scientific evidence based on
observation and repetition). Since atheists don't have any such
evidence, their belief requires a lot more faith.

So not only does the belief in the existence of God have evidence, the
belief that God does not exist requires a lot more faith.
