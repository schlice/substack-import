Finally, an easy question today!

Here's your answer:

While you're in there, use a temporary deadbolt. Here's an example from
Amazon:

You're going to get an earful when someone tries to barge in to your
room. When they realize that you can lock yourself in, maybe you can
have a real discussion with them about setting boundaries.

Now, when you're outside of your bedroom, that's a different story. If
it's not your house (and if you're not sharing an apartment with
others), I'm not sure you can stop anyone going in to your room; that's
just something you're going to have to live with until you leave home.
Best not to leave anything lying about that would be incriminating.
Basically, "sanitize" the room so that you either lock up (inside of
your room) or bring with you anything you don't want anyone else to see.

I assumed that you are still below the age where you are renting an
apartment; in other words, I assumed that you are still a child living
at home. However, it may be that you are renting an apartment with
others and you have shared space and private space. If you are, you are
absolutely able to have completely private space. In that case, you
should change the door knob to one with a better lock that actually uses
a key, and make sure the landlord has a copy of the key so they can get
in to do maintenance.
