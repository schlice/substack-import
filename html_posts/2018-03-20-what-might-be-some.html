**What might be some \"common sense\" legislative options to address the
issue of gun violence in America and what would be the
legal/constitutional basis upon which it could be based?**

First of all, common sense is uncommon. That means that what might seem
"common sense" to you might seem totally unreasonable to someone else.
So using the term "common sense" is pointless. There is nothing that
everyone agrees is "common sense."

You asked about "gun violence in America" as if it is a really big
problem. Statistically, it's not a very big problem at all, either
compared to other countries, or compared to violence overall. I don't
know why people focus on "gun violence" but ignore "knife violence,"
"bomb violence," "rental truck violence," and "baseball bat violence."
Couldn't we just look at how we reduce violence in general, regardless
of the tool used?

The reason why it's so pointless to focus on the gun: **you will never
get rid of guns. Ever.** The only way to get rid of guns in America is
to invent a device which can simultaneously vaporize all guns all over
the world *while at the same time* obliterating the knowledge about how
to make one. As you've probably guessed, this is an impossible task. You
could create new laws that ban gun violence, but we already have laws
that ban violence. So how will adding a law that bans violence, but this
time specifically using guns, going to make any bit of difference when
we already have laws which ban violence irrespective of the tool used?
If you have existing laws and they don't work, how will they start
working by adding more laws?

So let's start by asking some better questions, such as *why don't
existing gun laws work*? This is a good one. Why do criminals use guns
when they commit violence? Overwhelmingly, criminals use guns when they
commit violence because they can. The punishments for using guns are
nonexistent. *But...but...the laws!* I can hear you saying right now.
Yeah, you actually have to *enforce* the law in order for it to be
effective. Criminals may have warped values, but when it comes to the
crimes they are committing, they're generally not all that stupid. They
know that they can commit a crime with a gun and they can get that gun
charge dropped pretty easily. Prosecutors plea bargain gun charges away
in exchange for "bigger" charges. So for example, if I were a criminal
who was involved in a drug deal gone bad and I shot someone else, the
first thing I would be telling that prosecutor is, "I can give you five
levels of dealers above me if you make this gun charge go away." It's
all part of plea negotiations, and gun charges are one of the
sacrificial lambs that tends to get dropped in favor of other charges.
So the first thing we can do is **forbid prosecutors from using gun
charges in plea deals.** If a crime is committed with a gun, it must be
charged; it cannot be removed as part of a plea bargain.

Secondly, **make and enforce tough sentences for using a gun in a
crime.** I am no fan of mandatory sentences, because it takes the legal
system out of the loop. But for the time being, *the legal system is the
problem.* So get rid of it! If you do a crime with a gun, you get a
mandatory 10 year sentence for using a gun, **in addition to any other
charges**, and the penalties run *sequentially*, not *concurrently*.
That means it's an automatic 10 years on top of any other crime you're
charged with. That means that a 5 year robbery stint becomes a 15 year
armed robbery stint. When you start making the penalties tougher, and
you start making the penalties mandatory, you will see gun crimes
plummet.

Of course, that just means that knife crime will begin to rise. Don't
believe me? [[Look at the
UK](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=d16c3c&url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/knife-gun-crime-stats-latest-england-wales-rise-increase-a8177161.html){.external_link

So therefore, the final leg in this barstool of common sense gun laws is
**CCW reciprocity**. If you allow someone who was trained to drive a car
in Kansas to operate that car in New York City, you should also allow
someone who was trained to carry a concealed weapon in Wichita to carry
that gun in Columbus. Make gun carry *ubiquitous* and *safe*.
