The problem with your line of thinking is that diseases don\'t mimic MS,
because MS doesn\'t have any symptoms which are unique to it.

There are many diseases which can cause the symptoms you\'re describing.

- Strokes of the blood vessels supplying blood to the eye, tumors, or
  retinal disorders may mimic ON and can cause blurring and double
  vision.
- I can\'t even begin to list the number of diseases and conditions
  which cause fatigue.
- Leg/arm weakness and leg/arm/facial parasthesia can all be caused by a
  stroke, which could also produce the ON symptoms. They can also be
  caused by peripheral neuropathy, specifically symmetrical
  polyneuropathy.
- Spinal stenosis could be a contributor to symmetrical polyneuropathy.

Before a diagnosis of MS can be made, all of the other potential causes
of the symptoms in question must be ruled out. MS is still today a
diagnosis of exclusion. You must exclude all other potential causes of
the symptoms in question before MS can be considered.

Additionally, lumbar puncture and visual evoked potential tests can be
performed to help confirm a diagnosis of MS, should it come to that.
