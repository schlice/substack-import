The legal restriction is on the **sale** of the gun, not its use. It is
an antique, which is the only reason it was legal to buy. Normally, you
cannot sell a toy gun at a store without a bright orange tip. The fact
that your toy was an antique made it legal to sell as an antique (not a
toy).

There is no requirement to have the bright orange tip on it when you use
it.

That said, you have to have a modicum of common sense here. Just because
it's a toy probably doesn't mean it's a good idea to shove it in your
waistband and go strolling around your downtown area. You probably
shouldn't "play with your toy" around police officers. You're very
likely to be shot. Just ask the kids who were shot by police while
"playing with toys" around them.

If you're in your yard, by yourself (or with other mentally-competent
adults, or children under adult supervision), you should be perfectly
fine to play with your toy, orange tip or not.
