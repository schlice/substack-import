**Do Christian marriage vows include a submission of free will (when it
comes to moral decisions) from the woman to the man?**

I see you're caught up in the wording in Ephesians 5:22--24. Let me give
you the Worldwide English translation of that passage:

> Wives, obey your husbands as you obey the Lord.
>
> The husband is the head of the wife, just as Christ is the head of the
> church people. The church is his body and he saved it.
>
> Wives should obey their husbands in everything, just as the church
> people obey Christ.
>
> Ephesians 5:22--24 (WE)

That word "obey" tends to invoke images of a superior/subordinate
relationship, when that was never the intent of the passage. A more
appropriate phrase would be "follow the lead of" instead of "obey." The
New International Version says "submit yourselves to," and I think in
modern English, that still sounds too "submissive" for what the passage
intended. The New International Reader's Version is closer to what the
writer intended:

> Wives, follow the lead of your own husbands as you follow the Lord.
>
> The husband is the head of the wife, just as Christ is the head of the
> church. The church is Christ's body. He is its Savior.
>
> The church follows the lead of Christ. In the same way, wives should
> follow the lead of their husbands in everything.
>
> Ephesians 5:22--24 (NIRV)

Note the rest of the passage discusses Christ as the head of the church.
The Church is the "body of Christ," and He is its savior. The church
follows the lead of Christ, as Christ is the head of the Church.

In biblical times, the man was the head of the household. The Bible
teaches that the man is still the head of the household, and indeed, a
husband and a father has an obligation to his family to lead his family
in the way God intended. He is to teach them what the Bible commands,
and model right behavior. This doesn't obviate free will; it simply
means that the bible has ordained that a man has an obligation to guide
his family in the teachings of the bible, both in word and in deed.

Wives are exhorted to understand that special calling, and allow the man
to do his appointed duty.
