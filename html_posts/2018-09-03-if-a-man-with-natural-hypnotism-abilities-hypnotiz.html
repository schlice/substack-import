**If a man with natural hypnotism abilities hypnotizes a woman into
having \"consensual\" sex when she otherwise wouldn\'t, without either
of them being aware of the hypnotism, is that rape?**

No, since you said that neither of them were aware of the hypnotism.

Therefore, no one intentionally deceived anyone. Rape involved forcing
someone to have sex against their will. The "force" portion of the crime
involves a knowledge and intent to deprive someone of their free will
and choice in the mutual decision-making process, and if someone has
"natural hypnotic powers" and is unaware of them, then there is no
"force of will" driving the alleged rapist.
