**Is Gen. Flynn\'s indictment the proof of Trump's innocence?**

No, but it's not proof of Trump's guilt, either.

And even if it was, what is it proof of?

We already know that Trump directed his national security transition
team to start getting in contact with foreign governments, including
Russia, before he took over as President, but after the election was
concluded.

This is what Flynn knows. And this is completely normal for a
presidential transition team to start reaching out to the officials with
whom they will be doing business and start making those contacts.

He wasn't directed to make secret deals with Russia about rigging the
election. Remember, the discussions took place after the election was
over, not before.

He wasn't directed to advise Russia to rig the election. Many
investigations have already found that the election was not rigged. Vote
totals were not tampered with. Voters were not suppressed.

As usual, nothing to see here.
