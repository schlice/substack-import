No. Mental health should be **the only focus**.

Guns aren't the problem. We've had a Second Amendment for 231 years, and
we've only had school shootings similar to this one for the past 30 or
so. It wasn't all that long ago when kids used to *bring guns to school*
so that they could attend Rifle Club, and still no one was shot. High
school aged kids would go hunting in the morning and drive straight to
school, with their hunting rifles still in their trucks, prominently
displayed in gun racks. And still, no one was shot. The gun is not the
problem. We don't need more laws on guns. There is no law that you can
think of which would have prevented any one of these school shootings.

What we need is **serious investment in this nation's mental health care
system.** Ever since
[[deinstitutionalization](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=d38b6c&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deinstitutionalization_in_the_United_States){.external_link

onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}, we have had a decreased
emphasis on mental health. We've been told that mental health can be
handled in neighborhood clinics, not hospitals. We've been told that the
people who need inpatient care are *seriously sick*, and a judge would
easily rule that they are "mentally deficient." We don't really need a
process to involuntarily commit people we think are sick, so we're going
to incredibly overburden that system such that we don't accidentally (or
maliciously) involuntarily commit someone who is not crazy. We don't
need MDs who treat the mentally ill. MDs just write the prescriptions.
We have *therapists* and *counselors* and *social workers* who do the
treatment, but can't prescribe medications. Thus, we have a big
disconnect between the people who provide the treatments, and the
doctors who prescribe the medications (in actuality, patients have the
best chance of recovery when utilizing *both*).

The unintended consequence of that decision is that we have people who
are indeed mentally ill, but not so ill that they have ever crossed
paths with law enforcement, so a judge has never had the opportunity to
even determine whether or not they are mentally defective. These people
are also not so visibly ill as to never cause someone to take them to an
emergency room for a psychiatric evaluation (no, that would simply be
too intrusive). The people who care for them believe what the government
tells them, that mental health can be treated locally, with nothing more
than a few pills. You don't need emergency rooms and mental hospitals
for that. And in the last 30 years or so, the ages of those who have
serious, debilitating mental health conditions are getting younger, and
younger.

To say it a different way: deinstitutionalization has de-emphasized the
importance of mental health in the United States.

\

Now, combine the mental health *crisis* we are facing with the erosion
of the family and societal values. Families have *abrogated* their
responsibility to be the primary teacher of values, and the only
organization remaining which has a vested interest in teaching things to
children is the public school system. However, as all public
institutions are, they are susceptible to the *loudest* political
voices, and so they have become overrun with *woke ideology.* That
ideology has informed them what values they should be teaching to
children.

Parkland shooting, and she's just echoing a sentiment we all know but
are too afraid to say. \"The family blew up \-- divorce, unwed
childbearing. Fatherless sons. Fatherless daughters, too. Poor children
with no one to love them. The internet flourished. Porn proliferated.
Drugs, legal and illegal. Violent videogames, in which nameless people
are eliminated and spattered all over the screen\... The abortion regime
settled in, with its fierce, endless yet somehow casual talk about the
right to end a life\... So much change, so much of it un-gentle.
Throughout, was anyone looking to children and what they need?\"

> Are there other things that can be done so this doesn't happen again?

Besides fixing mental health and re-emphasizing the family? If we do
those two things, this problem will vanish. But those are *hard*, and
they took decades to erode. We won't fix them overnight.

So what do we do in the meantime? We make the hard choices to protect
our kids.

- Increase armed security at schools.
- Tighten policies on locked doors in schools. One entrance should be
  open, and that entrance should be monitored by armed school security.
- Enhance security with technology. AI-powered scanners [[are a real
  thing](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=ea7592&url=https://blogmickey.com/2020/07/massive-changes-coming-to-disney-world-theme-park-bag-check-experience/){.external_link

  qt-tooltip="blogmickey.com"}]{.qlink_container} and they really work;
  why is it only theme parks and entertainment venues which are using
  them? Why haven't schools prioritized the funding to implement these?
- Eliminate "Free-Fire Zones," also known as "Gun-Free Zones." Shooters
  specifically choose these locations because they know they will face
  minimal resistance when they go there. It's why you've never seen a
  mass shooter choose a police station or a gun range. They go where
  they can maximize the number of lives they take before they go down in
  a "blaze of glory." They may have radically broken values, but they're
  not dumb. Concealed carriers are not your enemy. In fact, they are
  safer than the police.
- Allow teachers who are licensed and permitted to conceal firearms
  while at work. Those teachers are the ones who are willing to put
  their physical bodies in the way to save kids, but they only end up
  dead first. Give them the tools they already know how to use to
  protect our kids. But parents are *so worried* that some teacher is
  just going to snap and shoot a kid. Seriously? So you'll eliminate the
  one area where we can really make a difference because you're worried
  about crazy teachers killing kids? What about crazy teenagers who are
  killing kids *today*? ***Face the threat you have, not the threat you
  theorize.***
- Fix our broken and disjointed carry laws around the country. Move all
  states to "Shall Issue." And in a controversial position, I'd vote to
  eliminate "Constitutional Carry." I want everyone carrying a firearm
  to have been vetted by the state equivalent of the FBI. And start
  pouring some federal dollars into *that* program so that the
  investigations can be funded by the state. That's what "shall issue"
  should look like. Fill out application, give permission for background
  check, background check complete, license issued. All can be done
  online.
