**Why doesn\'t every state have specific laws against (with suitable
punishments for) \"upskirt\" and similar photography?**

The law, like most other things, moves at the speed of government. And
this law lags behind the technology.

When the "public place" photography laws were passed, no one expected
cameras to be so tiny as to be able to take photographs and videos up
someone's skirt (and, so as to not be sexist, up someone's kilt).
Therefore, some jurisdictions which have not passed specific laws
banning the practice have found that the victims were "in a public
place" and thus did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy. Some
states have found that a person has a reasonable expectation of privacy
underneath a skirt or kilt, but most states, to date, have found that
the public place rule overrides much upskirt photography, and have had
to pass specific legislation banning the practice. For example, in
California, their disorderly conduct statute protects people from
someone who would use electronic devices to "view through or under a
person's clothing without his or her consent."

But states still face difficulty passing such laws, even though it seems
clear that they should be able to. Texas struck down their own statute
against "improper photography or visual recording" because it was overly
broad. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals said, "Protecting someone who
appears in public from being the object of sexual thoughts seems to be
the sort of 'paternalistic interest in regulating the defendant's mind'
that the First Amendment was designed to guard
against."[\[1\]](#csVfZ){#cite-csVfZ .citation_link} The Massachusetts
Supreme Court struck down a lower court conviction under their "Peeping
Tom" laws, stating that the law only protected people against those who
would photograph them "nude or partially nude," such as in locker rooms
or in bathrooms, but it doesn't protect clothed people in public
areas[\[2\]](#NbPnU){#cite-NbPnU .citation_link} (Massachusetts went on
to craft a new law banning upskirt photography).

But as the linked article shows, while you may not face criminal
penalties for upskirt photography, you may face a good, solid beating,
and subsequent public shaming.
