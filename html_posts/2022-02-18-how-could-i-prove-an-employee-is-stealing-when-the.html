Good old fashioned gumshoe detective work.

You can use the interview tactic. Bring them into the office and tell
them that another employee rolled over on them and you're going to have
to fire them unless they come clean about the theft. But this is
dangerous because it's possible that they didn't actually do what you
claim they did. You have to be certain beyond a reasonable doubt that
they are the thief. The detective's mantra: you never ask a question
which you don't already know the answer to.

You could also continue to watch and collect circumstantial evidence.
Eventually, when you get enough evidence, even without "catching them
red-handed," you'll be able to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that they
are the thief, and you can fire them for it.

Or finally, you can simply relocate them to another position that has no
access to the item they are stealing, or you can fire them for something
else. In the United States, at-will employment means that the employer
can fire the employee for any reason (except for legally protected
reasons), so find another reason to fire them, and do it.

How could I prove an employee is stealing when they never do it on
camera and I can\'t just search them?
