*The narrative of the gun owner, the story you present to me,- I can't
hear anything creative about it. There are no openings. What I hear is
"It's my way or the highway.".*

Please cite a specific example where you have tried to present an
alternate opinion in this thread and you have been shut down because a
gun owner believe he is right simply because he is a gun owner.

I will tell you that gun owners know they have the Constitution and over
200 years of American history on their side, so they do tend to get a
little sure of themselves, but when we have civil discussions, we
sometimes have to look past the person and look instead at the policy.

We actually don't see anything here that you have yet to offer that we
can debate about.

Finally, Quora is not a debate site. It is a question-and-answer site.
If you want to debate a topic, perhaps you should visit a different
website. Check out a few:

- [[The Premier Online Debate
  Website](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=c1ec2d&url=http://www.debate.org){.external_link
  rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
  onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
  qt-tooltip="debate.org"}]{.qlink_container}
- [[idebate.org](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=b5121f&url=http://www.idebate.org){.external_link
  rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
  onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
  qt-tooltip="idebate.org"}]{.qlink_container}
- [[Debate Forum \| Online Debate Community \|
  CreateDebate](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=252104&url=http://www.createdebate.com){.external_link
  rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
  onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
  qt-tooltip="createdebate.com"}]{.qlink_container}

These are all debate sites, where you can present opinions for or
against any one of hundreds of topics.

Again, *Quora is not a debate site.* It is a question-and-answer site.

So if it sounds like you're simply getting an *answer* to your question,
it's probably because people are trying to answer your question, not
debate with you.
