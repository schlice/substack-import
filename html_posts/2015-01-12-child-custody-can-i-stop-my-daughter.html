**Content:** [I think I\'m going to take the middle-ground position
here.\
\
I\'m not sure that I see an immediate threat to the welfare of the
child. Nevertheless, if you have joint custody, you have as much input
into the decisions of the other parent as they do.\
\
I would start by writing a certified letter to the other parent (copy
the other parent\'s lawyer) and explain that you don\'t agree with the
choice of sitter because of the proximity of the sex offender and the
likelihood that because of the familial relationship, the offender will
likely be in contact with your child. You don\'t have to state *why* you
are uncomfortable with this; as a parent with joint custody, you have
the right to object to the choice of sitter.\
\
If she refuses to change sitters, a return trip to court to sort out the
childcare arrangements may be in order, but make sure you have tried to
sort out the issue beforehand, and can show the court documentation that
proves you tried and that your rights as a parent with joint custody are
being knowingly violated. The court can then compel her to change
sitters, and refusal to follow the judge\'s ruling would constitute
contempt of court and could force a change in custody status. Her lawyer
would know that and would likely advise her to at least meet with you to
hear your concerns before you got to court.]{.rendered_qtext}
