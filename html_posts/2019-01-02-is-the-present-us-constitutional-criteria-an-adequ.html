**Is the present US constitutional criteria an adequate basis for
removing a US president? If not, how should it be improved?**

"Adequate?" As in, "covers all conditions in which we might want to
remove a President?"

If that's the question, then the answer is an emphatic yes.

The impeachment power in Congress, while it is only supposed to be used
for "high crimes and misdemeanors," can really be used for any offense a
President commits. There isn't a list of offenses which can be called a
"high crime or misdemeanor."

Once a president is impeached, the Senate has a trial to determine
whether or not that charge for which he was impeached is of a sufficient
nature as to impede his ability to perform the duties of the office of
president. If so, the Senate votes to remove him from office.

If the president becomes physically incapable of carrying out the duties
of the office, the 25th Amendment contains a process to allow the Vice
President to assume the command of the office without any action
required on the part of the President.

Finally, if the President is acting in a way you don't like, or if he's
a big mean orange bully and it hurts your feelings, you can simply not
re-elect him, and he'll go be orange somewhere else. If the President
can do too much damage in four years that you think you'd need to remove
him before that, then Congress has given the President too much
authority and needs to dial it back.

So it would seem that the Constitution has all the bases covered, so to
speak.
