It's a good question. And the answer really has nothing to do with Mitch
McConnell or Congress.

**Democrats got complacent with** ***Roe.***

The problems with *Roe* started long before Mich McConnell refused to
allow the nomination of Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court to come to
the Senate floor. They watched silently as President George W. Bush
added both Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Samuel Alito to the
Court, both of whom already made no bones about wanting to place limits
on abortion.

They watched silently as President Obama delivered a [[commencement
speech](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=611a60&url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/18/us/politics/18obama.html){.external_link

he would be working to reduce the number of abortions in the country.

And, of course, in 2016, part of the reason that Hillary Clinton lost
the election to Donald Trump was that they weren't worried about *Roe*;
so comfortable were they with *Roe's* resilience that even though
abortion was an issue at the ballot box, supporters of nationwide access
to abortion never thought it could be overturned.

So why did they "cave so easily" to Mitch McConnell? Besides the fact
that there was nothing they could do about it, they didn't press harder
or turn it into a campaign issue because the never in a million years
thought *Roe* would be overturned.

Until it was.
