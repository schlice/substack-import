We're looking at the wrong question. And in doing so, we may be
overlooking the real problem with asking this question.

Whether or not microevolution or macroevolution are real or are even
scientific fact are not necessarily in question. Scientists make the
assertion that if you believe that microevolution is a thing (it is),
therefore macroevolution must be a thing as well. Let's leave this
assertion alone for now. I'd even be willing to accept this as a given.
I'd even go so far, right now, as to say that yes, macroevolution is
scientific fact.

However, there is a really big problem that macroevolution now
illuminates, and it is a problem which cannot be ignored if you are to
ask the question about macroevolution. If scientists can make the
inference between microevolution and macroevolution, it is only fair
that we make a similar inference between macroevolution and the first
life: **For unguided, naturalistic macroevolution to be true, the first
life must have generated spontaneously from nonliving chemicals.**
Evolutionists have failed to show where this first life came from,
especially given DNA present in even the earliest single-cell organisms.

The Principle of Uniformity says that only an intelligent cause could
assemble an intelligent message such as what is found in DNA, because we
have never observed mindless chemical interactions produce any messages,
let alone at the quantities and specified complexity of DNA. And
**spontaneous generation of life has never been observed.** From the
very earliest scientific observation, we know that life only arises from
similar existing life. **Scientists have never been able to combine
chemicals in a test tube and arrive at DNA, let alone life.** All
experiments *designed* to spontaneously generate life not only have
failed, but have all suffered from the illegitimate application of
intelligence. Scientists *intelligently designed* experiments to
simulate spontaneous generation, and yet cannot do it. Why should we
believe that mindless natural processes can do what brilliant scientists
cannot?

And *even if* scientists could create life spontaneously in the lab,
**it would prove creation**, because it would prove that it takes a lot
of intelligence to create life.

On top of that, DNA presents the evolutionist with an even bigger
challenge. It's a chicken-and-egg dilemma. DNA is built with proteins,
but proteins rely on DNA for *their* production. So which came first,
proteins or DNA?

Evolutionists see the evidence for intelligent design, but then ignore
intelligent design as a possibility. Dawkins even admits it. On the very
first page of his book *The Blind Watchmaker*, Dawkins says, "Biology is
the study of complicated things that give the appearance of having been
designed for a purpose." Then, two pages later, despite the "intricate
architecture and precision-engineering" found in human life, Dawkins
flatly denies that human life was designed. Apparently, Dawkins won't
let observation get in the way of his preconceptions. This is odd,
especially given the supremacy that Dawkins gives to the scientific
method, which is predicated on observation.

Evolutionists believe that spontaneous generation of life *must* be the
cause of life *because they refuse to admit that there may be another
cause*. Spontaneous generation is what we call a "just-so" story.
Evolutionists cannot provide any evidence to support spontaneous
generation. It certainly isn't supported by empirical evidence or
forensic scientific inquiry. It's "just-so" because life exists, and
*since intelligent design is summarily dismissed*, it must be the
answer, as there is no other answer available to choose.

**TL;DR:** Macroevolution may exist. Macroevolution may have even
occurred at some point in the long history of the world. But
macroevolution alone is insufficient to explain how we were created,
especially given the problem of explaining DNA.

Original question:

Is there proof that macroevolution is a scientific fact and not just a
theoretical model?
