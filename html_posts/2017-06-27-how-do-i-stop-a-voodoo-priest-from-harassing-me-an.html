The same way you stop any other person from harassing you.

1.  Tell them to stop.
2.  If they don't stop, file for a restraining order, detailing the
    harassment.
3.  If they still don't stop, call the police and report his violation
    of the restraining order.

At some point, the harassment will stop.
