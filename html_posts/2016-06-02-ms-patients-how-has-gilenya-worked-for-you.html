I've been on Gilenya for 15 months. I have had no new lesions, and no
active lesions on any scan I've had during that time. I haven't
experienced any of the episodes of muscle weakness that caused me to
switch off of Copaxone after 7 years.

I have had my fair share of side effects, but they are side effects of
being on an immunosuppressant therapy. I used to get frequent sinus
infections as a kid. I was mostly past that as an adult. Within five
days of starting Gilenya, I got a sinus infection. It took the entire
course of antibiotics to knock it down. Within three months, I got a
second, and it took two full courses of antibiotics to get rid of it. So
I have to take extra medication (antihistamines and decongestants) daily
to try to stay ahead of that. It works, but it's just more pills. I also
take an extra 1000 mg of Vitamin C along with my daily multivitamin,
also for the immune-boosting effects.

I'm also on Vitamin D therapy because my vitamin D levels are
chronically low, and I have to take 5000 IUs a day to keep them in
check.

I also take krill oil (instead of fish oil) to get my Omega-3's for the
day.

I also take flaxseed oil because I have high triglycerides, probably
also caused by the medications, but none of them are specifically
indicated as medications that increase triglycerides, so no one is
really sure about that one.
