While it's certainly possible for the government to "cover up" a news
story, it's really hard to hide a big white weather balloon as it lazily
floats across the sky. People on the ground were taking videos of the
most recent weather balloon, the most notable was a video taken in
Billings, Montana, as it was visible with the naked eye.

So how, pray tell, did Trump not only kill the news story about the
Chinese spy balloons during his administration (because the media was
*so compliant* and never actually wanted to publish anything negative
about Trump that they would universally be willing to kill a story
merely at his request), but simultaneously *make the balloon disappear?*

So you tell me: who is telling the truth? Why did no one see the
mysterious weather balloons during Trump's administration? Is it more
likely that Trump was able to hide the actual balloon, or is it more
likely that the balloon didn't exist at all?

We report, you decide.

(EDIT) I did read some news reports claiming that the Chinese balloons
in question which were, supposedly, during Trump's presidency were
balloons that crossed the ADIZ but never made it over land. This
apparently happened in Florida and Texas (surprising that it only
happened off the coasts of some of the reddest states in the country),
and apparently also may have happened over Hawaii and Guam.

It's fascinating. China already presumably has this same technology in
spy satellites which are already flying overhead. Using balloons like
this is clunky and doesn't provide anything more than what they already
get. Perhaps what they were testing was not intelligence, but our
response to the balloons.
