I searched the DSM-V for a mental disease or defect called "belief in
God" and I couldn't find any.

I did, however, find one called schizophrenia: "a psychotic disorder
characterized by disturbances in thinking (cognition), emotional
responsiveness, and behavior\[.\]"

So at its basest level, one is a mental disease, and the other is not.

But, you're probably saying, doesn't "belief in God" fall squarely
within the psychopathology of *delusion?* That's unlikely. The DSM
defines "delusion" as a false belief based on incorrect inference about
external reality that is firmly sustained despite what almost everybody
else believes and despite what constitutes incontrovertible and obvious
proof or evidence to the contrary. Belief in God is not usually out of
keeping with the patient's educational, cultural, and social background.
It is also not held with "extraordinary conviction" either. Even the
religious acknowledge the uncertainty of life, but faith drives their
belief. Finally, with over 2.3 billion believers around the world, it
certainly isn't something that only a small group believe and that
"almost everybody else believes" something other than religion. Clearly,
belief in God does not fit the definition of delusional or flawed
thinking.

It's also not a personality disorder. The way that faith is expressed,
and to which faith one believes, is very much influenced by the person's
personality, it is not the personality that *creates* the belief. The
personality doesn't cause faith; the faith exists outside of the
personality.

So one is a faith and a belief, and the other is a mental disease. The
two are mutually exclusive, even though people with faith and beliefs
can also experience similar mental diseases.
