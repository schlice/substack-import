You can sue anyone for anything. The question becomes how likely you'll
be to prevail.

And in this case, how likely you'll be to prevail depends greatly on
where you live, and whether or not the neighbor had a duty to prevent
the tree from falling in the first place. And that duty is dependent, at
least in Florida, on whether or not the tree was *alive*.

If the tree was alive when it fell on to the homeowner's property (i.e.
a hurricane came through and knocked the tree down), the homeowner is
responsible for his own damages. However, if the tree was dead and it
fell on to the homeowner's property, the homeowner where the tree was
located is responsible for the damages, as he had a duty to remove the
dead tree before it fell.

If a known hazard exists, it is in your best interest to notify the
homeowner of the hazard. A dead tree is just such a hazard. Even worse,
if you were the homeowner with the dead tree and you were notified that
a hazard existed and you did not fix it, it's likely that your insurance
carrier won't cover the claim either.

Please check with a lawyer in your jurisdiction to see if the same holds
true for you.
