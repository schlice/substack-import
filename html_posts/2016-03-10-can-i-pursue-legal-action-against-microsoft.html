In addition to the other good answers here, the TOS likely also says
that Microsoft can change your gamer tag at their sole discretion at any
time.

Secondly, you would have to show some harm was caused by Microsoft
changing your gamer tag. For example, if you\'re losing money because
your gamer tag was changed, you can challenge their ruling. The TOS
probably specifies that you must use binding arbitration, not the
courts, for such actions (most TOS\'s do; I don\'t know for Microsoft\'s
TOS, you will have to research it).

Good luck.
