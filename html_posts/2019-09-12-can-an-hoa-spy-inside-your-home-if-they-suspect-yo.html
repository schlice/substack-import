**Can an HOA spy inside your home if they suspect you are breaking the
law?**

First of all, no one is law enforcement except for law enforcement. The
HOA is not a law enforcement agency, and should not be looking inside
your house to see if you are breaking the law. If they suspect you are
breaking the law, they should call the police and let them handle it.

HOAs *may* have authority to enforce the Rules & Regulations, but for
the most part, those rules don't pertain to the inside of your house.

One limited exception I am aware of: some HOAs require that your garages
not be used as storage units, but as locations for parking cars. In HOAs
like this, if you're parking a car in your driveway instead of in your
garage, the HOA staff *may* look in your garage windows to see if you
are able to store a car in your garage, and fine you if you cannot.

But looking into the actual house has nothing to do with the Rules &
Regulations and is unrelated to HOA business.

That's not to say that if a Board member happens to be inside your home
and they see something illegal that they can't report it to the police.
Anyone can do that, not just the HOA.
