This is a great question, and it would be best answered by a criminal
defense attorney in New Jersey.

Depending on the situation, the New Jersey close-in-age exemption may
completely exempt qualifying close-in-age couples from the age of
consent law, or it might only provide a legal defense that can be used
if you are charged with statutory rape.

The law does not draw such bright-line distinctions, it only says that
the couple must be \"within four years of age.\" It\'s a decidedly gray
area, and a prosecutor could press ahead with charges if you\'re 19 and
she\'s 15, even if you\'re less than four years apart by birthday. You
might win, you might not. I haven\'t found any case law which really
shows how the court generally rules in New Jersey, this is why you\'d
need a criminal defense attorney

In my opinion, why risk it? I know it may be difficult, but I really
think your best course of action is to abstain for a little while until
she turns 16. Then you\'re both in the clear. The line is really fuzzy,
and while you might be vindicated, it would still be a lot of time and
money if you\'re arrested and charged.
