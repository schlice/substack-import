I don't mean to sound rude, but your assumptions are all incorrect.

- They cannot "single-handedly" send someone to jail. They can only
  bring someone to the jail and present the District Attorney with
  evidence that shows that the suspect has committed the crime of which
  he is accused. The police only have the power to bring you to jail for
  three days (72 hours). It is at that point that the District Attorney
  must find that the police have collected enough evidence to formally
  charge you, and the DA must have filed formal charges against you, or
  you must be released.
- They are already highly trained. Police receive extensive classroom
  training in state law (over 300 hours), mostly in the section of state
  law which pertains to crime and the criminal justice system. Each
  police department runs a Police Academy for each incoming class. The
  curriculum for the class is approved by the state POST (Peace Officer
  Standardization and Training) Board. Officers also receive continuous
  refresher training on a monthly basis, updating them on changes to the
  law and informing them how those changes impact their daily jobs
  (called in-service training). Despite what some may lead you to
  believe, they do not have to memorize the law book or you get to go
  free. They do have to know enough to know what you did wrong, and they
  can look up the relevant statute. So long as the evidence matches the
  charge as written, they are fine.
- Again, despite your misconceptions, police officers are far from dumb.
  Yes, basic entry requirements only require a high school education (or
  a GED), but if an officer expects to move up in his career, advanced
  degrees are nearly a requirement. Many officers already possess
  advanced degrees, usually in Criminal Justice or other related fields.

Not sure where you got all your misconceptions (TV? Movies?), but
they're all wrong. Sorry about that, they just are.

Now, to answer your basic question: Why aren't there more requirements
to become a law enforcement officer in the US?

It's hard enough getting enough people to fill a class. With the
stringent requirements we already have, we can receive 600 applicants
beginning the testing process for an upcoming academy, and by the end of
the testing and investigations period (usually takes about three months
to complete), we can barely field a class of 40 recruits. On top of
that, look at the environment we are currently in here in the United
States. Organizations like Black Lives Matter have spread a false
message: that the police are the most dangerous thing that a young black
man has to be concerned with. This couldn't be further from the truth.
According to statistics compiled by *The Washington Post*, police killed
990 people in 2015. 494 of them were white, and 258 were black. A police
officer is actually 18.5 times more likely to be shot by a young black
man than the other way round. These realities, and the false messages
being spread today, make getting recruits in the door in the first place
very difficult.
