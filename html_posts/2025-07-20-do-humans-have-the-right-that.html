Certainly, some people believe that humans have rights because they are
an extension of "mammals rights." While the idea that humans have rights
that are an extension of \"mammal rights\" raises important ethical
considerations about the shared capacity for sentience and the need to
avoid suffering, it\'s also crucial to acknowledge the **unique
capacities and interests** that underpin the full scope of human rights.
The debate continues about the most appropriate ways to address the
moral status and protection of animals within a framework that *also*
recognizes the distinct qualities of human beings.

Human rights are unique to humans and exist *because* humans exist.
