First of all, if anyone attacks you and you are in fear for your life,
you can use whatever means at your disposal to defend yourself. Some
restrictions apply in some states, your mileage may vary, check your
local laws first, etc.

States do have laws regarding involuntary commitment, but those states
usually require that the person be "dangerous," and usually that means
that the person is "imminently dangerous." So if he's not actually
caught in the act of being dangerous by police, usually nothing will
happen.

Unfortunately, there is nothing you can do. Just know that if you do
kill your BIL, you will cause a tremendous rift in your family, even if
you were fully justified in doing so. Killing him should be the *last*
resort, not your go-to action.

You know that in most states, Tasers are actually legal to own and
carry? Perhaps you can stop him without killing him. It's a risk to
everyone, but it might assist in getting him help.
