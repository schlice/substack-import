Short answer: they can't, but they do things to "encourage" you to keep
it.

There's no difference between "renting" a radar detector and buying one,
trying it out, deciding you don't like it, and returning it because you
don't like it.

How they limit this practice is using **shipping fees**, and in some
cases, **restocking fees**.

You can return the product if you don't like it, but you'll pay return
shipping and (if it's a marketplace seller) a restocking fee (which I've
seen as high as 15% of the original cost of the item), which will all
come out of your refund. So in some cases, it may not be worth it to
send that item back.

Only some items are eligible for Free Returns, and it must state on the
product page that the product is eligible for Free Returns, but even
those are minus the original return shipping fees if the return is not
due to a problem caused by Amazon.
