Police are not there to incriminate you, per se. They're nearly
universally not there to falsely accuse you. But **police are there to
find a person who fits the facts, arrest that person, and make it
stick.** That's their job. Their job is not to believe you or not
believe you. Their job is not to find the truth. Their job is to find a
person who fits the facts they have and build a case against that
person. If police are talking to you, it's because they are trying to
find a person who fits the facts and build a case against them, and you
might just be that person, despite what they tell you.

To that end, ***police WILL use EVERYTHING you say against you,
regardless of how innocuous you think it is.***

And the things you think are completely inconsequential could provide
the police the reasonable suspicion they need to start looking in to you
as a suspect. Even if you are completely innocent and you say nothing
but the truth, you will always give the police something that they can
use to help them convict you.

Here's a little tidbit that may help you: you cannot give the police any
information that would ***help*** you at trial. The Federal Rules of
Evidence \[ยง801(d)(2)(a)\] explains what evidence can be used against
you. It's interesting to note that your words can be used *against* you
but never *for* you. In order to use what you said to the police *for*
you, you'd have to put the police officer on the stand and have him
relay the conversation (which benefits you), but he can't, because it's
*hearsay*. It is for that reason alone that there is never benefit to
you from talking to police.

Even if you do tell the truth but the police have **bad evidence** or
**unreliable evidence**, and it contradicts what you said (which happens
to be the truth), they can use the contradiction to presume you are
lying and incorrectly look at you as the suspect.

Additionally, even if you are completely innocent, it is very difficult
to tell the same story twice in exactly the same way, which may make you
look like you are changing your story, and provide evidence to the
police to look into you further.

Professor James Duane was a former defense attorney turned law professor
and is an outspoken voice on police interactions. When you ask about
"don't ever talk to police," Professor Duane is always mentioned first.
He has even written a book about it, titled [[*You Have the Right to
Remain
Innocent*](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=a75900&url=https://www.amazon.com/You-Have-Right-Remain-Innocent/dp/1503933393){.external_link

qt-tooltip="amazon.com"}]{.qlink_container}. Here's a few videos of him
if you want to learn more:

One of the things Professor Duane points out in that second video (I
know it's 45 minutes, but it's worth every second) is part of the
opinion from *Ohio v. Reiner:* "\[O\]ne of the Fifth Amendment\'s basic
functions is to protect innocent persons who might otherwise be ensnared
by ambiguous circumstances. Truthful responses of an innocent witness,
as well as those of a wrongdoer, **may provide the government with
incriminating evidence from the speaker\'s own mouth**."

**TL;DR:** The Fifth Amendment exists so that you can never be forced to
be a witness against yourself. Don't be a willing witness against
yourself. If the police ask you questions, don't talk to them.
