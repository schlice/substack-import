**Content:** [In addition to what\'s already been stated, the Framers
were also worried that the Federal government would gain and hold too
much power, as the original configuration had Congress electing the
President. Again, at the time, popular elections for President were
unrealistic. So the compromise was the Electoral College: the people
vote for Congress; the states vote for President.\
\
The idea behind this is that the state elector(s) vote for the candidate
that their state has elected, giving the states appropriate voting power
based on population as well as landmass, so as not to disenfranchise
smaller states. Without it, Presidential candidates can effectively
ignore smaller, less populous areas and pander to big cities to win the
majority of the votes. Larger cities tend to lean Democratic, while
smaller, more rural, and less populous areas tend to lean Republican.
Undoing the Electoral College would tip the balance of power and allow
candidates to effectively ignore whole regions of the country.\
\
The EC is also supposed to help prevent voter fraud, but if we can\'t
even agree that you need to show ID to vote, then we\'re never going to
truly address that problem. But I digress\...\
\
Part of the confusion is in the ballot presented by the state. It shows
you voting for a Presidential candidate (a popular vote), when, in fact,
you are voting to tell your state Electors what candidate to vote for.
You don\'t actually directly vote for a President. The popular vote
total is interesting, but not relevant.\
\
Should it be? When we become a true democracy, and every person has a
vote AND EVERY PERSON USES THEIR VOTE, we can disband the Electoral
College. But with less than 40% of the population actually voting, I
don\'t want to leave that to chance. I\'d rather keep the system we
have.]{.rendered_qtext}
