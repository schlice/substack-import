The Second Amendment didn't specifically call out any type of arms at
all. Repeating, wooden, flintlock, composite, etc. No characteristics
were called out at all.

How do we know that the Second Amendment was intended to apply to
repeating arms? Because it doesn't say anything at all about any kind of
"arms."
