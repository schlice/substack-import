**How do you feel about Trump being removed from office? Schumer is
calling for him to be removed.**

Senator Schumer knows how to remove Trump from office. His branch is
part of the process to do it.

That process is *impeachment*.

If the Senator from New York believes that Congress should act, he
should call his colleague over in the House of Representatives, Speaker
Nancy Pelosi, and push her to draft Articles of Impeachment.

He's done this before, just two years ago, in fact. His memory isn't so
bad that he doesn't remember.

But he also knows that there's no way in the seven levels of Hell that
they'll be able to get it done in two weeks. Congress can't even
formulate a coherent thought in two weeks, let alone impeach and hold a
trial in that amount of time.

At the very least, Congress should do what they can: they should
***censure*** the President so that it is in writing that they disagree
with his behavior. That's literally the best they will be able to
accomplish before he leaves office, thanks to the voters.
