In most jurisdictions it is legal to paint your car like a police car.
However, there are restrictions on flashing lights which vary by state.
Check your state's Vehicle and Traffic Law before you mount any flashing
lights on your car. You generally cannot have colored lights flashing on
your car, with the exception of white or orange (for slow-moving or
frequently stopping vehicles).

It would be *illegal* to attempt to exercise any police powers. If you
pulled a car over, you would be guilty of the offense of "impersonating
a police officer," and police officers do not take kindly to that
offense.
