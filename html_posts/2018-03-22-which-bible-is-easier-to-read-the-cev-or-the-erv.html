**Which Bible is easier to read, the CEV or the ERV?**

CEV.

The Contemporary English Version (CEV) was designed to allow for anyone
who reads contemporary English to read it and understand it. It was
based on studies into how people read and understand English, and the
translation was done with that understanding. It is designed to be read
and understood by people without stumbling in speech, and by people who
have little to no understanding of "bible" words. It therefore achieves
its goal of being an easy-to-read bible translation.

The Easy-Read Bible (ERV) originally started out as the English Version
for the Deaf (EVD). Deaf people sometimes have difficulty reading
English, because sign language is their first language. The EVD was
designed specifically for them, with simpler vocabulary and shorter
sentences.

In 2004, the EVD was translated into the ERV (the EVD was left as-is and
is still available). They expanded some of the vocabulary in the
translation, but being based off of a version designed for the deaf, it
still suffers from the same shortcomings that a translation of a version
originally designed for the deaf would suffer. Its original sources are
good, but its translation could suffer because of its origins. And while
it is indeed easy to read, it suffers slightly over the
CEV.[\[1\]](#svcmB){#cite-svcmB .citation_link}
