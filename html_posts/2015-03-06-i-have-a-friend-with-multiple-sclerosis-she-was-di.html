**Content:** [If you are there for her, there\'s no \"wrong thing\" you
can say or do.\
\
Just let her know that while you don\'t fully understand what she feels
because of her disease, you\'re there for her in whatever way she
needs.\
\
Most MS patients have symptoms which can\'t be seen, and really the only
way you know she has MS is when she has trouble walking. Just having
someone there who knows that \"how you look on the outside is completely
different from how you feel on the inside\" is a great
comfort.]{.rendered_qtext}
