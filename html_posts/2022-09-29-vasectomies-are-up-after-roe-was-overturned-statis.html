Honestly, this isn't a political thing.

If you get a vasectomy because it's now potentially harder for your
current fling to abort your unintentional pregnancy, that's probably a
good thing, because you probably shouldn't be having children anyway,
much less becoming a parent.

Original question:

Vasectomies are up after Roe was overturned. Statistically, is this more
liberal or conservative men? If it is more leftists, isn't this good for
the country?
