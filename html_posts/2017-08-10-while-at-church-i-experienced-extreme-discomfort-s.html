In case you still don't understand why you were the problem, and not the
officers, remember the hula hoop.

Get a hula hoop. Drop it on the ground. Stand inside of the circle.

Now, recognize that you have control over everything inside the hoop.
You have absolutely no control over anything or anyone outside the hoop.

We cannot control what goes on outside of our hoop. We can only control
**our reaction** to things that go on outside of our hoop. For example,
people *don't make us angry* as we commonly like to say. People do what
people do; we respond with anger. No one can ***make*** you angry. If
that were true, then it's because someone has a special, magical,
psychic ability to manipulate your emotions and make them change. Since
this is not the case, then they are not *making* you angry. They simply
do whatever they do, and you *respond* to that with anger.

Applied to this situation, the officers did not do anything wrong. They
are citizens of the United States and are allowed to be inside a church.
The fact that you felt uncomfortable was *your reaction* to their
presence. Since you cannot control what happens outside of your hoop,
you must recognize that your reaction was the only thing you *can*
control.

So were you *wrong*? Well, if you questioned the officers asking them
why they made you uncomfortable, that would be wrong. They did nothing
to make you uncomfortable; you reacted to their presence with
discomfort. If you questioned them and asked them why they were in
uniform in a church, they probably told you that they are citizens and
have a right to be anywhere that you can be.

Was that *wrong*? No, it wasn't wrong. But it was unnecessary and
unneeded. It's questions which come from a fundamental misunderstanding
regarding the source of your discomfort, and assigning that source to
*someone else* when it should have rightly been assigned to *you*.
