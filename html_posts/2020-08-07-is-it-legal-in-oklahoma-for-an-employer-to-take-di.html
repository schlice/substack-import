**Is it legal in Oklahoma for an employer to take disciplinary action
against an employee because the employee filed a worker\'s comp claim
and cost the company money?**

*(Remember: I am not a lawyer and this is not legal advice)*

In general, an employer cannot take adverse actions against an employee
who, in good faith, has filed a claim for workers' compensation
benefits.

Oklahoma employees are covered by the Oklahoma Administrative Workers'
Compensation Act (OAWCA). Section 7 addresses claims by current or
former employees against employers for retaliation.

To find out if you have a claim against an employer for retaliating
against you for filing a claim for workers' compensation benefits, you
must consult with an employment attorney licensed in your jurisdiction.
