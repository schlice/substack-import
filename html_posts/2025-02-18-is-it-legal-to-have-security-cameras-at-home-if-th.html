It's even legal to have security cameras at home even if they
incidentally capture neighboring properties.

You have a right as a homeowner to protect your property with security
cameras, even if, while in the course of protecting your own property,
you incidentally capture your neighbor's property.

Now, if your neighbor has a problem with your camera, it is hoped that
in polite society, they come talk to you. You can show them your camera
feed, and if it is still unacceptable to them, perhaps you can both work
out a better location for the camera that still protects your property
while not unduly capturing their property as well.

But all that aside, nothing say you have to move it, pissed off neighbor
or not. So long as you are not purposefully pointing your camera at your
neighbor's property or their doors or windows, it is still legal. If the
only positioning to properly protect your property still incidentally
captures theirs, *c'est la vie.*

Incidentally, some cameras have a "privacy mask" feature, allowing you
to voluntarily block out portions of your camera feed (for example, if
it is capturing your neighbor's property) for just this reason. You can
show this feature to your neighbor and show them you are making a good
faith effort to not observe their property. Of course, there is a
downside for your neighbor. If your camera could have captured something
that happened in their yard, they (and the police) lose that opportunity
to have captured that incident. Your neighbor could have gotten free
security monitoring on your dime, but they gotta take the bad with the
good in some cases, I guess.

And as always, check your state and local laws before you put up
cameras.
