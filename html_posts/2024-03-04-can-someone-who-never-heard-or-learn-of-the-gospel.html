Even those who have never heard the name Jesus have had the truth
written on their hearts. All people are accountable to God whether or
not they have "heard about Him."

The Bible tells us that God has clearly revealed Himself in nature
(Romans 1:20) and in the hearts of people (Ecclesiastes 3:11). The
problem is that the human race is sinful; we all reject this knowledge
of God and rebel against Him (Romans 1:21-23). If it were not for God's
grace, we would be given over to the sinful desires of our hearts, which
shows us how useless and miserable life is apart from Him. He does this
for those who continually reject Him (Romans 1:24-32).

He has given us free will so that we can freely choose Him, for love
must be freely given, it can never be coerced.
