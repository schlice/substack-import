Contact Facebook. They will help you through the theft of your photo.

To do this, tap the suspect photo to open it full size. If the profile
is locked, the only option you will see is **Find Support or report
photo** , and choose that.

Once you see the full size photo, click the "hamburger menu\" button,
and then click **Find Support or report photo.**

In either instance, follow the instructions to report the photo.
