**My friend (17; legally a minor) recently attempted suicide. She is in
a mental hospital and was prescribed Zoloft for her disorders. However,
her parents are refusing to let her take it for no reason. What are her
legal rights in this situation?**

She is a minor, and while her wishes are certainly valued, it is
ultimately her parents who are empowered to make medical decisions on
her behalf, and that includes the right to refuse or discontinue
treatments, even those that may be life-sustaining. However, parental
healthcare decision must always be in the best interests of the child.
Decisions that are clearly not in a child\'s best interest can and
should be challenged.

When older children have a disagreement with their parents over medical
decisions, those should be taken seriously. It is up to the medical
professional to assist with the discussion, always with the best
interests of the child at heart. The older child's voice should always
be considered, and in cases which cannot be resolved through discussion,
the hospital ethics team should be consulted. As a last resort, the
hospital can turn to the courts for assistance if they truly believe
that the parents are not acting in the best interests of the child.
