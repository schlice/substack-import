**How do I add variety to my Quora? Over time I\'ve noticed fewer and
fewer different authors on my feed. Is there a way to make Quora less
personalized, and avoid getting stuck in an echo chamber?**

Search for and follow some new topics.

Search for a topic you're interested in, and read a few answers. If you
find them interesting, go ahead and follow the topic. You'll start to
see more answers from that topic show up in your feed.

Similarly, if you're getting tired of seeing a particular bent of
question, unfollow those topics which contribute stories of that bent.
