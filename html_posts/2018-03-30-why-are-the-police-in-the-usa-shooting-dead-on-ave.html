**Why are the police in the USA shooting dead, on average so far this
year (03/30/18), 3 people per day? Is anybody concerned about this? If
so what should be done?**

In order to be "concerned" about this, a few things would have to be
true:

- The people who are being shot by police were not posing a threat
- The number of people shot by police should be a significant number in
  comparison to the number of people **not** shot by police during
  police interaction with the public.

The vast majority of the roughly 1000 people a year shot by police
(roughly three per day) are literally shot when they are attacking
police. They are shot while they are holding deadly weapons. And they
are shot when an officer is in fear for his own life, in the same way
that any citizen can defend himself or herself when they are in fear for
their own lives, so the people who are shot are generally posing a
threat to the officer or to the general public.

There are literally *millions* of interactions between the police and
the public each year, and each year only roughly 1000 people are shot by
police, and most of those people were armed and/or threatening an
officer. 1000 out of *millions* of interactions is a frighteningly small
number that doesn't even move the needle. It tells me that if you are
*not* armed and threatening a police officer, your odds of being shot by
the police are, comparatively, exceedingly small.

Each police shooting is thoroughly investigated by three, possibly four
agencies: the department itself through its review boards to see if
department policy has been violated, the District Attorney's office
investigating to see if the officer committed a crime, a lawyer
representing the estate of the person killed investigating whether or
not the officer could be liable for wrongful death, and possibly the
Department of Justice investigating to see if the victim's civil rights
were violated. This is 200 to 300% more investigation done against a
police officer than a civilian, who is only investigated by the DA's
office and possibly a lawyer for the victim's family (but they may not
since most people don't have enough money to make such an investigation
and subsequent finding a monetarily viable proposition).

So is anyone concerned by this? Is anyone concerned that this is a
thing? Is anyone concerned that nothing is being done about this?

**No.**
