Your statement "according to California law, it is my property" is not
precise. Depending on a lot of circumstances, it *may* be your property,
but it is unlikely since you "just" bought a condo.

In this case, there are two ways you get to keep it:

1.  Check your purchase agreement. If it includes "everything in the
    unit" including furnishings, then you own it and everything in it.
    The staging company must go after the seller for not removing their
    furniture before you took possession.
2.  If you can reasonably claim that the furniture was abandoned, then
    you get to decide what to do with it. In California, this means you
    must have given them a reasonable opportunity to come back and claim
    it. If you sent them a California Notice to Reclaim Abandoned
    Property (under \$700) and they still didn't come to get it, after
    the date on the form, you can do whatever you want with it: keep it,
    sell it, or destroy it.

In this case, the staging company wants it back, so item 2 is unlikely
to apply unless it's been years since they left it. So your only option
is option 1.

If your purchase agreement doesn't include "everything in the unit,"
then the furniture doesn't belong to you, period. If the staging company
contacted you and said they want their stuff back, keeping it is
**theft** and you can be criminally charged for that theft. How severely
you are charged is dependent on the dollar amount of the theft.

You can still keep the furniture if you **offer the staging company a
buyout deal** considering the original amount of the furniture, its age,
and its current condition, minus a reasonable discount. In other words,
make them an offer. If they agree, you can buy the furniture, own it for
a fraction of what it would have cost new, they don't have to take the
time to come get it, and you don't have to have the hassle of movers
coming in to your condo.

Original question:

I just bought a condo in California, and the staging company left
furniture in my condo. According to California law, it is my property.
Now the staging company wants it back. What should I do?
