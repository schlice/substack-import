I don't have to think. We can calculate the chance.

The Supreme Court gets, on average, 7000 requests a year for certiorari.
They accept, on average, fewer than 100.

That means, assuming they accept 100 out of the 7000 requests a year
they get, the chances of this case being heard are 1.43%.

But are they really? This case is an isolated case between one homeowner
and one HOA, not a referendum on religious freedom. The Court probably
won't be able to set a precedent that they are dying to set, so it's
unlikely that they will grant cert in this case.
