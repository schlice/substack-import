No, for several reasons:

1.  It's not a tax. It's a payment for a contracted service.
2.  It's not without representation. Every HOA has a Board, and that
    Board is usually comprised of homeowners in the neighborhood.
    Regardless of who makes up the Board, you chose the configuration of
    the Board when you agreed to the Covenants when you bought your
    house.
