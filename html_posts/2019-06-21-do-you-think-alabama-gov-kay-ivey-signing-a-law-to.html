**Do you think Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey signing a law to allow a Birmingham
megachurch to form its own private police force to protect its
affiliated school campuses a good idea?**

I think it's a non-issue. School campuses all over the country have
their own private police forces; you probably know them as "campus
police." Most school districts in the United States have their own
private security as well.

Churches all over the country have their own private security, armed and
unarmed. The only difference here is that now this church can do exactly
as college campuses do to protect their sprawling school campuses: hire
campus police who can arrest suspects who commit crimes on their
property.
