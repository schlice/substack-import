When someone becomes Christian (i.e. they accept Christ as their Savior
and commit their lives to Him), it is because God has already called
them to belief, and He has changed their heart from their old "hearts of
stone" and has given them hearts which can only love Him.

This process is what we called "being born again," or the more correct
terminology is ***regeneration.*** This new "heart of flesh" we receive
is only capable of loving God. Notice that it says that God will put His
Spirit in us which will move us to "follow His decrees and keep His
laws."

**If God has done this, then you will love Him.**

Therefore, logically speaking, if you "stop" loving Him, you did not
have His Spirit in you, because His Spirit is incapable of not loving
Him, and therefore you too would be incapable of not loving Him.

So for someone to say they are an "ex-Christian," it is perfectly
reasonable for Christians to question whether or not that person was
ever truly saved in the first place.
