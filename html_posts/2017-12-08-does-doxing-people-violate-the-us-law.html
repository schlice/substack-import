**Does doxing people violate the US law?**

The answer is that it may.

"Doxxing," or public outing, of people may violate privacy laws if the
person has not previously revealed his or her identity. Was the person
intending to remain anonymous? For example, if you're doxxing a white
supremacist, did they attend a white supremacy rally in public, showing
their face? If they did, revealing them as a white supremacist doesn't
necessarily violate privacy laws, since they already revealed themselves
in public anyway. But for someone who has not, doxxing may be illegal.

And if you do it wrong (you identify someone incorrectly) and they lose
their job or their house or anything else of value because of it, then
***you*** become liable for that, under libel laws.

Finally, doxxing someone unethically, simply because the person holds
views you disagree with, will likely just push them "underground," into
Anonymous posts and IP hiding using Tor and similar identity
concealment, from which there is *no* accountability at all. Is that
really where you want to send these people?
