*He* doesn't. *You* do.

And you shouldn't.

You should learn to recognize His existence ***without referencing the
Bible at all.*** It would make your argument for the existence of God
much more compelling.

To be more blunt: **you can prove the existence of a creator god**
***without ever referencing the Bible or any religion at all.***

That's a much more powerful tool than using the Bible as a reference for
His existence.
