I just want to say off the bat that I am sorry that people are the way
they are. Draw a circle around your feet. You only have power to change
everything inside the circle. Anything outside the circle cannot be
changed by you.

To me, the answer to your question is easy. But all too often, we simply
don't see it, or we ignore it because it's difficult or we simply don't
want to do it.

**If there is someone in your life who does not treat you the way you
deserve to be treated,** ***remove that person from your life.***

I have had to remove people from my life, some people who I was very
close to over the years, and even some biological family members,
because they did not treat me the way a *human being* deserves to be
treated. Notice that I distinguish *biological family* from other family
members because membership in a family does not need to be biological to
be important.

Humans deserve to be respected as individuals simply because of their
humanity.

If someone fails to do this, they do not *deserve* to be part of your
life. Cut them off. Stop calling them. Block them on Facebook. Don't
spend time with them.

Remember, it's not about *punishing them*. It's about *freeing
yourself.* Theirs is not an influence you need in your life. Get rid of
it.
