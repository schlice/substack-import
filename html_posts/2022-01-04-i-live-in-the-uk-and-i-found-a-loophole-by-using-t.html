A **loophole** is defined as a *perfectly legal implementation of a law
or a rule*, but which does not achieve the goal of the law or the rule.

Therefore, by definition, if you found a true loophole (and you were not
using any deception or illegal practices in order to execute it), it
would not be illegal.

Now, if your "loophole" was a *software glitch* which made the ticket
machine spit out a free ticket when you hit a specific key combination,
that's not a loophole, that's *theft* and you can indeed be charged with
that.

Here's an example of a loophole:

The bus company gives free bus rides to students. You are a regular
working shlub just like the rest of us, but in your spare time from
home, you are enrolled in an online class wherein you are learning how
to use a particular piece of software. The course is 12 weeks long, and
it is free to join. *But your status as a "student" is recognized by the
bus company* and you are registered as a "student" and thus you get free
bus rides.

This would be a "loophole." The idea of the free rides for students plan
is to allow students to get to and from school, but you are not using it
that way. However, since you are technically a "student," you do
technically qualify for student rate bus passes.

(EDIT) Since people still seem to be confused about what a loophole is,
let me give you an example of what a loophole *is not.*

When you ride the train, you are supposed to buy a ticket. The ticket
shows your origin and your destination, and charges you a fee
appropriately. If your origin station is rural, your origin station may
not have turnstiles or any other form of barrier before boarding. No
matter, you are still required to buy a ticket at your station of
origin. **Failing to buy a ticket at your station of origin** ***is not
a loophole***, because you are not legally using the system. This is
actually called [[fare
evasion](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=5a34fc&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fare_evasion){.external_link

a loophole.

Original question:

I live in the UK and I found a loophole. By using that loophole, I don't
pay for any bus tickets. Is it a crime or not? If it is a crime, what
would be the result of it?
