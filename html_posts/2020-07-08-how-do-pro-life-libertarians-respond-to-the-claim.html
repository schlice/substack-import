**How do pro-life libertarians respond to the claim that the baby does
not have a contract with the mother to be on her property, and as such
the mother is allowed to \"evict\" the child if she sees fit to do so?**

The claim is ridiculous on its face. Children under the age of 18 (in
most states) are unable to enter into contracts, so there would never be
a way for a baby to legally be present inside a mother's body. A
mother's body is not a room for rent. It is a place where babies can
grow.

Additionally, the baby didn't choose to be there; you chose to host the
baby there. The mother agreed to host the baby in their body at the time
that she consented to sex. Because consenting to sex also implies
consenting to the possible side-effects of sex (some might call them the
actual reasons we have sex in the first place, but whatever) which
include creating a baby and having it live in your body for nine months.
Clearly, this is not true when the mother is raped, as she did not
consent to any of the possible side-effects of sex. Even pro-life
libertarians are willing to be reasonable in this case because of this
logic.

You cannot disclaim consent to pregnancy by saying that you used birth
control. Birth control is not 100% effective, so using it implies that
you take on the risk of pregnancy, and taking on the risk of pregnancy
implies that you consent to all conditions of that, because you cannot
consent to the risk of pregnancy without consenting to the conditions
which come with that. So even using birth control is not foolproof. The
only 100% effective birth control is abstinence. If you get pregnant
while abstinent, you shouldn't be talking to the doctor, but the priest.

But *contracts*? That's a legal thing, and minors lack the capacity to
enter into contracts, so the argument analytically false.

*If you don\'t like what I wrote, tough shit. If my answer is
grammatically low-quality or is un-cited opinion masquerading as fact,
downvote it. If you think I\'m wrong, write your own answer. But Quora
is a question-and-answer site, not a debate site. If you were simply
going to comment to tell me \"ackshually, you\'re wrong,\" then you're
the reason why I disable comments. Well done, Karen. You ruined it for
everyone.*
