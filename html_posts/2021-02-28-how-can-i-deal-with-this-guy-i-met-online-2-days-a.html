**How can I deal with this guy I met online 2 days ago? . He calls me
like 5 times in a row and if I dont pick, he sends tons of messages both
on text and WhatsApp. I don't want to sound rude too and also what does
this mean? Please I need answers.**

Block him now. Block him everywhere. Make it clear that you are not
interested and you don't want to hear from him again, then block him. If
he tries again, tell him that continued attempts at communication will
be considered harassment and reported to the police.

Why am I taking such a hard line now? Because if you give a guy like
this *even a little bit of wiggle room, letting him think you might be
interested,* ***he will never give up.*** This one just sounds a little
too needy, or too controlling, and trust me, you don't need either in
your life.

Just cut it off now, cut your losses, and move on.
