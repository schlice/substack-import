The radar cross section (RCS) of a target is defined as the effective
area intercepting an amount of incident power which, when scattered
isotropically, produces a level of reflected power at the receiving
station which is equal to that from the target.

- The RCS of an F-15 (which was not designed with any stealthy
  characteristics) is 25 square meters.
- The RCS of an F-117 is 0.003 square meters.

So above background noise, the F-117 is effectively invisible to radar.
