**Why is it acceptable to say \"teach men not to rape\", but bigoted to
say \"teach Muslims not to commit terrorism\"?**

It's not acceptable to do either.

I think it's clear why it is bigoted to say "teach Muslims not to commit
terrorism." Terrorism is not unique to Muslims simply because there are
some Muslim groups which espouse the use of terrorism. Timothy McVeigh
was not a Muslim, and yet he committed the largest act of domestic
terrorism the United States had seen until September 11th.

But it's also not acceptable to say that we "teach men not to rape," for
several reasons:

1.  *Women can be rapists, too.* While original legal wording of rape
    crimes made it a crime that only a man could commit against a woman,
    more nuanced and modern understandings of the crime understand that
    male stimulation is not a sign of consent. Women can, without
    consent, stimulate and rape men, and they have.
2.  Why is it appropriate to teach men not to rape, but not to teach
    them to not commit other crimes? The answer is that *we don't teach
    people to not commit crime. We teach people to understand the
    difference between right and wrong, and act accordingly*. That's how
    people are able to navigate the world, and not go around committing
    crimes just because they haven't been taught specifically not to
    commit that crime.
