**Now that the GSA has formally acknowledged Biden as the
president-elect, will this force Republicans like Mitch McConnell to
speak out against Trump\'s efforts to overturn the election?**

I'm sorry, I think I missed in the Constitution where you officially
become president-elect when the GSA formally acknowledges you. Can you
refresh my memory and tell me where that's located?

The media, you, the GSA, heck even Biden himself, can refer to him as
the president-elect, but he won't actually be president-elect until he
has been elected.

And despite what you may have heard, *he hasn't been elected yet*.

That's right, when you declare that Trump is trying to "overturn the
election," you are mistaken. We haven't had the Presidential election
yet, so there is nothing to "overturn."

And no, I'm not talking about the election that took place on November
3rd, because that was just the General Election used to select the slate
of electors who will actually vote for the President, which doesn't
officially take place until December 14th. Even though the votes won't
actually be officially counted until the joint session of Congress on
January 6 (after the new Congress is seated), it is fair to say that you
can begin calling the elected person "president-elect" after
that.[\[1\]](#SOEQW){#cite-SOEQW .citation_link}

*Sorry, no comments on this one.*

*If you don\'t like what I wrote, tough shit. If my answer is
grammatically low-quality or is un-cited opinion masquerading as fact,
downvote it. If you think I\'m wrong, write your own answer. But Quora
is a question-and-answer site, not a debate site. If you were simply
going to comment to tell me \"ackshually, you\'re wrong,\" then you're
the reason why I disable comments. Well done, Karen. You ruined it for
everyone.*
