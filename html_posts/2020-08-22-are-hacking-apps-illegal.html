**Are hacking apps illegal?**

We've had this controversy for decades. Does no one remember *The
Anarchist Cookbook?*

[[The Anarchist Cookbook: Powell, William: 9781607966128: Amazon.com:
Books](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=6cd00d&url=https://www.amazon.com/Anarchist-Cookbook-William-Powell/dp/1607966123){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="amazon.com"}]{.qlink_container}

As you can see, it's still freely available on Amazon for purchase. Its
product description:

> The Anarchist Cookbook will shock, it will disturb, it will provoke.
> It places in historical perspective an era when \"Turn on, Burn down,
> Blow up\" are revolutionary slogans of the day. Says the author\"
> \"This book\... is not written for the members of fringe political
> groups, such as the Weatherman, or The Minutemen. Those radical groups
> don\'t need this book. They already know everything that\'s in here.
> If the real people of America, the silent majority, are going to
> survive, they must educate themselves. That is the purpose of this
> book.\" In what the author considers a survival guide, there is
> explicit information on the uses and effects of drugs, ranging from
> pot to heroin to peanuts. There i detailed advice concerning
> electronics, sabotage, and surveillance, with data on everything from
> bugs to scramblers. There is a comprehensive chapter on natural,
> non-lethal, and lethal weapons, running the gamut from cattle prods to
> sub-machine guns to bows and arrows. The section on explosives and
> booby traps ranges from TNT to whistle traps. One hundred and eleven
> drawings supplement the recipes. \"This book is for anarchists,\" says
> William Powell, \"Those who feel able to discipline themselves on all
> the subjects from drugs, to weapons, to explosives) that are currently
> illegal in this country.\" Techniques, disciplines, precautions, and
> warnings pervade what may be the most disquieting \"how-to\" book of
> contemporary times.

So why are we discussing this in a question about hacking apps?

The apps themselves are not illegal. Creating an app which can hack
other things is an exercise in programming, nothing more.

***Using that app could be illegal***.

It could be legal if you use it against your own systems.

It could be legal if you use it against a system you were asked to
analyze for security holes.

But it would probably be illegal if you use it to try to access a site
that you did not have authorization to access.

It's not about the *tool*. It's about *how you use the tool.*
