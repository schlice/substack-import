Morals are developed throughout your life, and there are many influences
which help you develop your morals. Your parents and your community are
closely involved. You also develop morals based on your empathy and your
sense of fairness. Humans have a desire to do what is right and to avoid
what is wrong, and so your personal morals develop throughout your
lifetime while you follow your "inner compass" which influences you to
do what is right, and avoid what is wrong.

Does a deity guide your moral development? No. You develop morals on
your own, following your inner compass, and your empathy and sense of
fairness. The question that atheists cannot answer: ***from where did
your inner compass and your inbuilt sense of empathy and fairness
derive?***

There is no evolutionary process which explains why all humans
everywhere, regardless of country of origin or family or societal
structure, have an inbuilt sense of empathy and strive for fairness and
equality. These things are particularly inconsistent with Darwinism.
"Survival of the fittest" is specifically inconsistent with empathy or
fairness. Evolutionary biologists are coming out and saying that the
currently accepted evolutionary model is insufficient to explain how
things like fairness and empathy developed. At the Royal Society in
2016, they said that they need a "new paradigm" to explain how
irreducibly complex biological structures and inbuilt morality could
have evolved, because neo-Darwinian models are insufficient to explain
them.

So if the universe didn't evolve your sense of fairness and equity, and
if the universe didn't evolve your sense of empathy, where did it come
from, and why does every human have it? Because every human has it, it
must come from some place which is overarching across all humans, and
evolution is insufficient to explain it.

The existence of this sense of empathy and fairness is what we call the
Moral Law, and it is one of the logical proofs which point to the
existence of a creator. The logic goes like this:

1.  Every law has a law giver.
2.  The Moral Law exists.
3.  Therefore, there exists a Moral Law giver.

Some call this inbuilt morality "conscience"; others call it "Natural
Law"; still others (like our Founding Fathers) refer to it as "Nature's
Law." Today, we refer to it as "the Moral Law." But whatever you call
it, the fact that a moral standard has been prescribed on the minds of
all human beings points to a Moral Law Prescriber. Every prescription
has a prescriber. The Moral Law is no different. **Someone must have
given us these moral obligations.**

So you don't need a deity to develop morals. You need a deity to
*explain why you develop specific morals*.

Are there perfect morals? Yes. If the deity is the law giver, morals
which develop perfectly in line with the dictates of the deity in
question would be "perfect morals." In Christianity, there was one
person in history who had "perfect morals" and that was Jesus Christ.
Outside of Christ, humans are born into sinful bodies, and will never
possess perfect morals. Additionally, people suppress what they know
about morals all the time. In other words, even murderers know that
murder is wrong, but they have instead found ways to justify it (this of
course ignores the fact that some people have brains which do not
function properly and cannot even sense their inbuilt moral law).
