You can only be protected from firing if you are being fired because of
your membership in a protected class.

This falls under the Equal Employment Opportunity Act, which is actually
part of the Employment section (Title VII) of the Civil Rights Act of
1964. It prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, creed (or
religion), sex, or national origin.

You can be terminated, without cause, for any other reason. When you are
not a "contract employee," you are considered an "at-will employee,"
which means that your continued employment is only if you both agree to
continue it. Either of you can terminate your employment at any time,
for any reason, except the legally protected classes listed above.

And just because you're a member of a protected class (as everyone is,
as everyone has a race and a color and a national origin), you are only
protected from being terminated ***because*** of that membership. If you
are terminated for a reason outside of that protected class, you are not
covered by anti-discrimination statutes.

Employers routinely terminate employees whose personal conduct does not
positively reflect on them. Just because you're not working doesn't mean
that you can't be terminated for not representing the employer in a
positive light, or having your personal views bring your judgement and
values into question, which do follow you to your place of employment.
