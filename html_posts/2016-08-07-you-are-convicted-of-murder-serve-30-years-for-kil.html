There was a movie made about this starring Ashley Judd called,
accordingly, \"Double Jeopardy.\" Good movie. It just so happens that
this was exactly the plot of that movie.

In this case, you could not be charged with murder since you were
already found guilty of, and served your time for, that murder. The
double jeopardy rule applies. You could be charged with a few other
offenses if you shot him, such as unlawful discharge of a firearm
resulting in death, discharge of a firearm within city limits, etc., and
on the civil side you could be found liable for wrongful death and owe
punitive damages to the family of the person you killed.
