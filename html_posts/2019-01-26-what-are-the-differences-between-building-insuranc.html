**What are the differences between building insurance in a condo HOA fee
and home owners insurance?**

Remember that a condo has a separate purchase and ownership structure
than a townhome or a single-family detached home. In a condo, you own
*only* the property within the four walls of your unit. You own the
walls, and everything inside. You don't own anything outside of the
walls of your unit. In a townhome, you own the land the building sits
on, plus any decks, yards, and all interiors. Townhome isn't a legal
description, it's an architectural style. To that end, townhomes are
governed by the same rules as single-family detached homes.

Condos will belong to a **condominium association** which maintains the
building, all the common areas, and any amenities. Townhomes and
single-family homes will all belong to **homeowner's associations**.
While the difference is slight (and many condo associations will call
themselves HOAs), there is a difference.

Condo associations which are part of a Planned Unit Development (PUD)
provide for *joint ownership* of the common areas, and your condo
association fees pay for that. *This includes any liability insurance
for those common areas.* For condos not part of a PUD, the condo
association owns the common areas, but you still pay for general
liability insurance on those areas. HOAs do not provide for joint
ownership of common areas; the HOA is the legal entity which owns common
space. However, the HOA still carries general liability insurance on
their common areas. The difference between the two, in most cases, is
the ownership.

In a condo, you will pay for common area insurance (or what you've
called building insurance), and you will pay for, generally, a level of
homeowner's insurance that is much more similar to *renter's insurance*
for the interior space and your things (it's a renter's insurance
because it does not cover the structure of the building, similar to an
apartment). In a townhome or single-family home, you pay the HOA dues
which include funding for common area general liability insurance, and
you of course pay for your own *homeowner's insurance*

Hope this helps.
