Marijuana is still a Schedule I drug, which still means that at a
Federal level, it is completely illegal. There are no exceptions.
However, some states have *decriminalized* its use, either for medical
or recreational use, which simply means the *state* will not pursue
charges against you.

How your employer treats its use is entirely up to them. Whether or not
they recognize your **state** medical exemption is, again, up to them.
You will have to check with USPS to see how they treat state medical
exemptions.

Original question:

If I live in Oregon, USA and I'm a federal employee (mail carrier) can I
legally use medical marijuana to treat my MS?
