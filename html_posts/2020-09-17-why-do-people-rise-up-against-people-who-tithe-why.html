**Why do people rise up against people who tithe? Why is there such
animosity between the givers and the people who think the church is
greedy so they don't give? When will these groups realize with God all
things are possible?**

My guess is that people don't understand that **our money is not ours**.
Everything that we possess is a gift from God. The money we earn is
because God allowed it to happen (maybe even enabled it to happen).

There are plenty of Biblical references that explain that everything
belongs to God and we are just stewards of those resources we are given.
A few examples:

> *Beware lest you say in your heart, 'My power and the might of my hand
> have gotten me this wealth.' You shall remember the Lord your God, for
> it is he who gives you power to get wealth, that he may confirm his
> covenant that he swore to your fathers, as it is this day. ---
> Deuteronomy 8:17--18 ESV*
>
> *Every tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the land or of the
> fruit of the trees, is the Lord\'s; it is holy to the Lord. ---
> Leviticus 27:30 ESV*
>
> *For every beast of the forest is mine, the cattle on a thousand
> hills. --- Psalm 50:10 ESV*

We return a portion of that which we steward back to further the
kingdom. When we show that we can do this with small amounts, God
blesses us abundantly.

People don't tithe because they are fearful. They are afraid that if
they give, then they won't get anything in return. But of course, this
stems from a fundamental misunderstanding of who owns that money. If
it's God's money and we are just stewards of it, then who are we to say
that we should not return a portion of it back to further God's kingdom?
If that's the case, we are not very good stewards of what we have.

It's also a problem of *relinquishing control*. As a Christian, you turn
your life over to God. *All of your life,* not just the parts which you
find comfortable to give up. This includes control over your finances.
You tithe knowing that God will not leave you high and dry.

I've seen evidence of this in my life. God has always provided when we
have been generous with him. He sees we trust him and he blesses us.
That control is difficult to relinquish for some.
