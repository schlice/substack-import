**What can be done? My apartment building has a constant theft problem.
Some lowlife keeps on stealing everyone else\'s packages.**

1.  If your apartment has peepholes, replace your peephole with a [[Ring
    Peephole
    Camera](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=9d130a&url=https://www.amazon.com/Ring-Peephole-Cam-doorbell-installation/dp/B07WHMQNPC){.external_link
    rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
    onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
    qt-tooltip="amazon.com"}]{.qlink_container}. It doesn't damage the
    door, it just replaces your existing peephole with a Ring camera. It
    still detects motion and records video. It even detects when someone
    knocks on your door and alerts you.
2.  If you buy from Amazon, consider having your items shipped to a
    nearby [[Amazon
    Locker](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=f91063&url=https://www.amazon.com/b?ie%3DUTF8%26node%3D6442600011){.external_link
    rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
    onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
    qt-tooltip="amazon.com"}]{.qlink_container}.
3.  Get together with your neighbors and agree that if any of you see a
    package sitting out that you'll take it in until the recipient gets
    home. Neighbors taking care of neighbors.
4.  Maybe your complex can help. If they have the space, maybe you can
    ship your packages to the front office, and then you can go pick
    them up when you get home. Your front office may not consent to
    doing this because they don't have the resources or the space to
    store packages, but maybe they will.
5.  Maybe your complex can invest in some better security, either
    increasing their existing security patrols or hallway cameras.
6.  You can always try reaching out to the local police department for
    tips on what to do and how they may be able to help.
7.  If none of this makes any difference, move. You should talk to your
    local tenants rights organization about making a claim that the
    complex has breached their contract by not providing adequate safety
    and security.
