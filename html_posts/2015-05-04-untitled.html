<h2>Answer Comment</h2>

**Content:** [Yes, \"booby traps\" are defined as something that can
deliver some level of force without an operator triggering the device.
They can be anything from a trip mine to a sentry gun. In every
jurisdiction that I am aware of, any sort of automated force application
is illegal. The military may use such devices, but citizens (or the
police) cannot.]{.rendered_qtext}
