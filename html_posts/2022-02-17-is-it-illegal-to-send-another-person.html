First of all, the answer to all legal questions is "it depends," and in
this case, it depends on the age of the recipient and the jurisdictions
of the sender and the receiver. For this example, let's assume that the
participants are all adults over the age of consent and they are all
within the United States.

In most cases in most states, "sexting," or the act of sending explicit
text or photos between adults, is not illegal. However, if the recipient
is not willing to receive such photos, this could constitute harassment.
The sender could also be sued for causing emotional distress to another.
This is also commonly known as "revenge porn," especially if the subject
of the photos had no knowledge that the photos were being distributed.

Your future MIL can not only take him to court for causing emotional
distress, she could involve the police and pursue harassment charges. A
protective order is another route that can be taken to stop the
behavior, and violating the order is a crime in and of itself.

In any case, my best advice is to contact a qualified criminal defense
lawyer in your area. Your lawyer can help you file for a protective
order, and can help represent your interests to the police and in court
in support of a criminal case.

Good luck!
