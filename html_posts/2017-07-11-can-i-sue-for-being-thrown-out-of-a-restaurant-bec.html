You cannot be thrown out of a restaurant because you didn't have
documentation, as there is no documentation requirement in the Americans
with Disabilities Act (ADA) for service animals. An establishment which
did this would likely be in violation of the ADA, and if this happened
to you, you should consult with an attorney in your area who specializes
in disability law.

However. in order for your animal to be allowed in the restaurant, you
must have an actual service animal which has been trained to assist with
a recognized disability, and the restaurant owner is allowed to ask you
about that.

The establishment may ask you two questions:

1.  Is this a service animal required because of a recognized disability
    under the ADA?
2.  What is the animal trained to do?

Beyond these two questions, they cannot ask you for anything else. A
vest on the animal is not required. Documentation or an ID tag is not
required. A service animal recognized by ADA is allowed anywhere that
the public is allowed.

The only time your animal can be asked to leave is if it is being
disruptive and you cannot control it, or it could potentially cause harm
to others.

Note that we have seen a rise in people bringing *emotional support
animals* with them because of certain medical or psychiatric conditions.
It is important to note that restaurants ***can*** exclude emotional
support animals from their establishments, as in most cases, these
animals are not trained to provide a service because of a recognized
*disability* under ADA, and are therefore *not covered* in the same way
that service animals are covered. Psychiatric conditions are most
generally not classified as disabilities under ADA. Also, in the large
majority of cases, emotional support animals are not trained to do
anything, which also makes them ineligible for protection under ADA.

This means that if a restaurant owner asks you if your emotional support
animal is trained to assist with a recognized disability under ADA and
you say no, they can ask you to take it out, and they would not be wrong
to do so. You have no legal recourse in such a case.

However, all of that said, if you ever experience an incident in which
you are asked to leave an establishment and you think your rights under
ADA may have been violated, please speak to an attorney in your area who
specializes in disability law.
