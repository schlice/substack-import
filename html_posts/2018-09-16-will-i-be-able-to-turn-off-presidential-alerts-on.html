In Android, you cannot disable Presidential alerts.

Start the Messages app and press the menu button (three dots) in the
upper right corner, and select Settings \> Emergency alert settings \>
Emergency alerts. There, you will see "Presidential alerts: Presidential
alerts are mandatory and cannot be turned off."

I imagine that if you root your phone, or use a third party SMS app, you
may be able to disable Presidential alerts. I haven\'t looked it up yet.
If I get a chance later, I\'ll see what I can find.
