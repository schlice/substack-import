**Content:** [It\'s a slippery-slope argument that holds no water.
Incest and LGBTQ lifestyles have absolutely zero in common.\
\
Now, replace \"incestuous\" with \"polygamous,\" and the argument isn\'t
quite as slippery slope as you may think.\

The logic goes, \"if we open the marriage door to one type of marriage
which is not traditionally part of marriage, that door is open, and
other types of marriage which were also not part of traditional marriage
can also be considered.\"\

\
This link, that gay marriage equals a general opening up of options, is
where the current polygamist thoughts towards legalization are headed.\
\
It\'s also not too much of a stretch to assume that by legalizing gay
marriage, we are de-coupling the law from its association with \"people
who can make babies\" and associating it (more rightly) to \"people who
can raise babies.\" The government only licenses marriages because it
has a compelling interest in children, and seeing them raised in the
best possible environment. Since there are many familial configurations
that will accomplish that goal, tying benefits to only one of those
configurations is unnecessary and doesn\'t follow the 14th Amendment.
Polygamous relationships also meet the standard of \"people who can
raise babies\" and should be treated no differently under the law than
gay couples. You can start by removing the restriction that says that
one man can only be married to one woman at a time, and vice-versa.
