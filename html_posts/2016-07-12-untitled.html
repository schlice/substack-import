It's too bad that police carry guns.

Oh wait, so can everyone else.

Actually, police are \*less\* likely to shoot you than others are. It
only \*seems\* like they are because...internet.

At any rate, I would remind you that there are literally millions and
millions of police interactions with the public each year. Very few of
those police interactions end in death. In fact, in 2015, police killed
a grand total of 990 people. The vast majority of those 990 were either
armed or were threatening the police officers in some way.

In comparison to the over 8000 people killed by homicide every year,
that number is strikingly low. In fact, the percentage of people killed
by police, per capita, is much lower than the percentage of people
killed by citizens.

(In an unrelated note, the percentage of concealed carry holders who
commit *any* crime is far lower than crimes committed by police)

What I'm saying is that I believe your commentary is pretty much
hyperbole. These "abuses" by police because "they hold all the power"
simply does not occur in real life. Yes, there are isolated incidents.
They may even be considered abuse. But if you, as a victim of what you
perceive is police brutality, do not stand up for yourself and hire an
attorney to investigate the department's conduct, when will these
incidents stop? You can't build a straw man and use it to denigrate the
police as a whole, especially if you have no statistics to back up your
theory.

I'll leave your comments as long as they continue to make valid points.
If you start going off on hyperbole, I'll delete this comment thread.
