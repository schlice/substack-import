100%. Walz basically confirmed that the only way Obamacare works is to
forcibly expand the risk pool, a move which was largely shouldered by
the young and healthy. In practice, it would have burdened people who
make less than \$50,000 a year the hardest.

If the individual mandate were replaced, this would violate Harris'
pledge not to raise taxes on anyone making less than \$400,000 a year.

Of course, he defends his actions by looking at just one small part of
the ACA: pre-existing conditions. He notes that before the ACA was
passed, we didn't have legal protections for pre-existing conditions, so
therefore (in his mind) the ACA is the best thing since sliced bread.

And Vance made a good point, which also addressed Trump's comments
during his own debate about how "we have some options" with how to deal
with the issue. Vance said, "Donald Trump has said that if we allow
states to experiment a little bit on how to cover both the chronically
ill, \[and\] the non-chronically ill, it\'s not just a plan. He actually
implemented some of these regulations when he was president of the
United States. And I think you can make a really good argument that it
salvaged Obamacare, which was doing disastrously until Donald Trump came
along.\"
