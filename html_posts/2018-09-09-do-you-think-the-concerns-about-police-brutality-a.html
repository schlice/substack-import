**Do you think the concerns about police brutality against minorities
are a result of a systematic problem in law enforcement, or just the
result of individual rogue police persons?**

You quoted the "Black Lives Matter" homepage in the source for your
question, and that triggered me.

For almost four years now, Black Lives Matter has held the belief that
racist police officers are the greatest threat to young black men today.
While this campaign has produced some useful outcomes, like a renewed
interest in police uses of force and a harsher look at training, it has
also resulted in the murder and attempted murder of police officers, and
other outcomes like an attempt to get rid of grand juries.

Even worse, because of the (incorrect) belief that Michael Brown was
shot in cold blood while trying to surrender, he's been turned into a
martyr. Police agencies are now backing off of proactive policing
policies because of the backlash, and violent crime has seen its largest
spike in over two decades because of it. All of this (meaning the entire
foundation of the Black Lives Matter movement) is based on a *lie*.

So bearing that in mind, let's answer your questions. *Are there racist
cops?* Sure there are. There are racists in society. Police come from
society. Therefore, there will be racist cops. It's inevitable. You
simply can't weed all of them out. Could that racism drive a police
officer to abuse a suspect? Sure it could. But "the system" is
transparent. We have cameras. We have FOIA. The renewed look into police
use of force has ensured that virtually no incident of use of force goes
unscrutinized by the public. It's highly unlikely that any officer would
be able to get away with such abuses of blacks for long. "The system"
would ensure that at some point, those abuses would be seen and that
officer would be fired.

*Is policing in America fundamentally, systemically flawed, such that
abuses against blacks routinely go unchecked*? Not even close. It's a
government system so it's going to have some flaws. When you have a
system as large and complex as policing, it's going to have some issues.
But since it is a government system, it is inbuilt with checks against
exactly these kinds of abuses. Additionally, the checks are in layers.
For example, every time there is an Officer-Involved Shooting (OIS),
there are at least *three* investigations into that action. First, the
department investigates the officer's use of force to determine if it
was reasonable and did not violate any department policies. And if you
think agencies "cover" for officers, you're highly mistaken. If they
would ever be found out (which in this "transparent" climate is highly
likely), every one of that command staff would lose their jobs and
probably be prosecuted. No one wants that kind of scrutiny. Second, the
District Attorney investigates the shooting to see if any laws were
broken. The District Attorney also answers to the people of that city.
Finally (another result of the Black Lives Matter movement), the U. S.
Department of Justice may also investigate to see if the suspect's civil
rights were violated. If a civilian is involved in a shooting, it's only
the DA's office that investigates the civilian. The officer is subjected
to *two to three times the amount* of investigations as a civilian in a
similar situation, and this is *inbuilt* into the system. So is the
system really designed to allow officers to "skate?" Again, not even
close.

The danger of Black Lives Matter is that it institutionalizes hatred and
violence against the police. It normalizes "resistance" to police, which
actually *increases* uses of force in police interactions. The results
of their own actions actually cause *more* use of force rather than
*less*. One political party in our country has glommed on to the BLM
movement and has made it a jewel in their crown. Each new candidate
tries to outdo the other in a twisted race to the bottom to see just how
PC they can be by doubling down on the other guy's hatred for the
police. If you don't believe me, take a look at the #AbolishICE hashtag
sometime. There are several major candidates for Congress (and a few
Presidential hopefuls for 2020) who espouse this opinion.

We are headed down a very dangerous path, and it has nothing to do with
racist cops.
