**How do you become president of a Homeowners Association (Hoa)?**

Most HOAs hold elections at their Annual Meetings. Every Association is
different; the rules for your association (including the rules for
election of Directors) will be found in your Governing Documents.

In the majority of HOAs that I am aware of, a Director holds a
three-year term, but again, every HOA is different.
