**Can you demand proof of a search warrant if the police want to enter
your house?**

If the police knock on your door and say that they have a search
warrant, they will normally hand you a copy of that warrant while they
enter.

If the police knock on your door and say that they have a search warrant
and they refuse to show it to you, make note of the time and date that
this occurred. Video proof is helpful (take out your phone and record
them or take snapshots). Your lawyer will need this information.

You can demand to see the warrant all you like, but it's unlikely you'll
be able to physically prevent them from entering. They have battering
rams and superior force, and if they want in, they're coming in. Fight
with them in court, not on your doorstep.
