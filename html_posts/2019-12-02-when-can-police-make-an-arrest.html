**What does it actually take for the police to arrest someone?**

The answer is a burden of proof called **probable cause**.

This is a lower standard than "beyond a reasonable doubt" and it is a
higher standard than "reasonable suspicion." Reasonable suspicion
requires specific, articulable, and individualized suspicion that crime
is afoot. A mere guess or \"hunch\" is not enough to constitute
reasonable suspicion (*Terry v. Ohio*). Probable cause means, in
practical terms, 51% or more certainty that a crime has been committed.
Beyond a reasonable doubt means that there is no doubt as to the
defendant's guilt, or that any doubts that remain are unreasonable.

The burden of proof is always on the government. The Latin: *semper
necessitas probandi incumbit ei qui agit*, which means \"the necessity
of proof always lies with the person who lays charges.\"

Reasonable suspicion allows the police to detain someone and question
them. Since this does amount to a 4th Amendment taking of liberty, the
police must be able to justify the specific suspicion that led them to
believe that crime was afoot. Probable cause is the standard by which
police can arrest someone.

Remember, police use reasonable suspicion to stop, probable cause to
arrest, and courts use beyond a reasonable doubt to convict.
