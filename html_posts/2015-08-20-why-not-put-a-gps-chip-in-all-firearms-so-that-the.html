title: "Why not put a GPS chip in all firearms so that the gun would no longer function if the chip were removed? If you really want to curb gun violence, why not promote that idea?"

**Content:** [First of all, what\'s a GPS chip? Are you talking about
the GPS receiver \"chip\" like you have in your mobile phone?\
\
Okay, let\'s glue a GPS chip to a gun. Now what? It doesn\'t do anything
on its own. So you need a **battery** to power the chip, another smart
controller to **read** the GPS data off of the chip, **interpret** it,
and **send** it to **somewhere** where (presumably) **someone** can do
something with it. The myriad of new problems you now have:\
]{.rendered_qtext}

- Battery. Where are you going to store the battery? Will it be
  removable? What happens if the battery has no juice? Will the gun not
  fire? I can\'t rely on my gun if it might not fire.\
- Reading GPS data: What component is going to do this? What operating
  system? Who is going to maintain it?
- Interpreting GPS data: You have a location. Now what? What are you
  going to do with that location data?
- Sending the GPS data: I presume you think that you\'re going to use
  mobile cellular networks to send this data. Who exactly is going to
  pay for the monthly service to send this data? And what happens if
  you\'re not in coverage? Will the gun not fire? Again, if I can\'t
  rely on my gun to fire exactly when I need it to fire, it\'s useless
  to me.\
- Location to send data: Again, I presume you\'re going to send the data
  to some central location. Where is that going to be? What hardware and
  storage will that data be located? Will it be tagged with the user ID
  and the serial number from the gun? Do you not see a HUGE privacy
  issue right here?
- Someone to interpret the data: Who, again, is going to pay for the
  personnel and infrastructure to interpret the GPS data from 300
  million guns?\

So you took an inherently simple device (a device valued for its
reliability and simplicity) and made it infinitely more complex. The
beauty of a gun is that it\'s a simple mechanical device. Besides the
fact that it would be next to impossible to make a gun that wouldn\'t
fire without a working GPS device, it would make it far more expensive
and far less reliable.\
\
It\'s not a matter that we don\'t really want to curb gun violence.
It\'s that this proposal is simply just not feasible. It\'s not
practical, it\'s not workable, it\'s not sustainable, and it takes a
simple mechanical tool and makes it infinitely more complex. It just
won\'t work.
