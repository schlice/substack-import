So if I understand the question, you\'re saying that police officers are
only allowed to exceed the speed limit by 10% if their sirens are not
on.

The statement, as written, does not match the law. Unless you can show
me a state law which restricts the speed of emergency vehicles, I will
have to say that your question is not based in fact.

You might be confusing this with *military police*, who are not allowed
to exceed the speed limit by more than 10 mph, even when running code 3
(full lights and siren). And even that rule is somewhat ignored
depending on the circumstances. This restriction is part of that unit\'s
Operating Instructions for the facility at which they are assigned.

There is no similar restriction for police emergency vehicles. Emergency
vehicles are not subject to speed limits. Period. That said, does that
mean an officer has the legal authority to act recklessly? That he can
place civilian lives at risk by driving unsafely? Certainly not.
Usually, department policy still requires things like clearing
intersections before proceeding through them, and using speeds
commensurate with the surrounding environment (city center vs open
highway, etc)

If you ever see an officer driving in a manner which you believe to be
reckless, take the time to fill out a complaint with the officer\'s
department.
