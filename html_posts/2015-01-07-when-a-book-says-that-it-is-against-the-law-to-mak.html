**Content:** [The principle you are describing is called \"fair use.\"
Even the DMCA (the Digital Millennium Copyright Act) has provisions for
\"fair use.\" It allows for you to make a \"backup copy\" of the
material in question, for your own archival purposes. The stipulation is
that you only have one copy in use at any one time. This constitutes
\"fair use.\"\
\
Using a paper-bound book as an example, if you make a copy of the book
and then two people are reading the same book at the same time (the
actual book and the copy), this is a violation of copyright. You would
need to purchase a second copy of the book to be compliant. If you make
a copy of a book and you put the original book away and only use the
copy, this is considered \"fair use\" because your second copy is only
for archival.\
\
This is the same legal principle that allows you to \"rip\" the audio
from a CD and make it into MP3 files for you to use on your personal
audio player or phone. The CD still exists with the original music on
it, but it is not in use. If you\'re listening to your personal copy of
the CD in MP3 format, and someone else is listening to the actual
plastic CD in their car, this is a violation of copyright.\
\
This becomes hotly contested when a \"copy protection\" needs to be
broken in order to make a copy of the media. For example, \"fair use\"
says you can make a \"backup copy\" for archival. But what about
copy-protected DVDs? Can you break the encryption and make a backup copy
for yourself? This is an area of the DMCA which lies in contrast to
itself. You can make \"backup copies\", but you\'re not supposed to
break \"copy-protection\" schemes. So which provision wins? Your desire
to make a backup copy, or the industry\'s protection against copying?\
\
Many arguments for breaking copy protection on DVDs (to continue the
example) center around the inability to use the DVD on any system that
doesn\'t have a DVD drive (i.e. an iPad). \"Fair use\" means that I
should be able to use the content (since I\'m buying a license to the
content, not the actual plastic disc) on any device I choose. In order
to use the DVD on an iPad, you\'d have to break the encryption and
convert the movie to a format that will work on an iPad. The industry
has countered this argument by providing \"digital copies\" to online
movie streaming and storage companies like Vudu and Flixster using a
service like UltraViolet. But in many cases, the \"backup copy\" or
\"archival copy\" argument is still not addressed. Are you buying a
piece of plastic (which if it gets ruined, is now gone) or are you
buying the right to one copy of the content, in which case you have the
right to protect it?\
\
Essentially, this argument has gotten tabled, as the people with the
technical chops to break copy protection and make a usable copy of a DVD
for their own use or to make a backup copy is a very very small subset
of the people who buy a movie. Most of these people are honest, making
copies of movies they own (not rent) for their own personal archival. I
do this all the time. I will buy a movie and make a digital copy of the
movie on my NAS (if a digital copy is not provided). I then store the
original movie away in my storage area. I rarely touch the actual movie
again. But I can play the movie on any device in my home with ease, or
on my mobile devices.]{.rendered_qtext}
