**Content:** [If it really is true that she was carrying a loaded weapon
without knowing how to use it, she deserves everything that happened to
her, including the public humiliation for shooting her own damn self.\
\
This is only an indictment of human nature, not of the notion that
\"gun-free zones\" should somehow stay that way because a few certain
individuals are idiots. Armed guards, SROs and *properly trained and
fully licensed* teachers carrying concealed should be the norm.
\"Gun-free zones\" are nothing more than \"defense-free zones\" that any
shooter who truly wants to kill as many people as he can before taking
his own life will absolutely target.]{.rendered_qtext}
