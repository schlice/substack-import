<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [If it really is true that she was carrying a loaded weapon<br>without knowing how to use it, she deserves everything that happened to<br>her, including the public humiliation for shooting her own damn self.\<br>\<br>This is only an indictment of human nature, not of the notion that<br>\"gun-free zones\" should somehow stay that way because a few certain<br>individuals are idiots. Armed guards, SROs and *properly trained and<br>fully licensed* teachers carrying concealed should be the norm.<br>\"Gun-free zones\" are nothing more than \"defense-free zones\" that any<br>shooter who truly wants to kill as many people as he can before taking<br>his own life will absolutely target.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
