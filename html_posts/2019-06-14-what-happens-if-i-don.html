Let's take your questions one at a time.

**What happens if I don't pay my HOA fees?**

The HOA can send your account to collections, or they can put a lien on
your house for the unpaid amount (if it gets high enough). If you have a
lien on your house, you can't sell it or refinance your mortgage until
that lien is paid. If it goes long enough, the HOA can foreclose on your
lien, which means they sell your house out from under you and use the
proceeds to repay the debt you owe.

**I've asked the landscapers to not touch my property since they use
cancer-causing chemicals, and I do all my own yard work. So do they
really have any recourse?**

For the purposes of this answer, I'm going to assume that the HOA
provides landscaping services, and it is paid for by your HOA dues.

You probably won't be able to negotiate directly with the landscapers,
as they take their direction from the HOA board under contract, not from
you. However, it's likely that you can opt-out of HOA landscaping
services. You may not necessarily get a credit on your HOA dues. In
fact, it's likely that you won't get a credit. Your HOA dues will likely
remain the same, but you won't have HOA-provided landscaping.

You will have to take this up with your HOA Board of Directors. Tell
them you want to opt out of HOA-provided landscaping. Understand that
they will likely tell you that you won't get any credit on your dues,
and you'll have to accept this. If they are unwilling to let you opt-out
of their provided landscaping service, you will have to consult a real
estate attorney in your area who specializes in HOA law.
