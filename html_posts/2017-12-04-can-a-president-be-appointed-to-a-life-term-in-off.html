In the United States, no. A president is limited to two terms in office
under the 22nd Amendment, a total of eight years. These eight years do
not have to run concurrently, but a single president is limited to eight
years.

[[Franklin D.

serve more than two terms. The 22nd Amendment was ratified in 1951.
