**Can you be guilty of influencing a witness under OCGA16-10-3 by
telling someone to lie if, at the time, you weren\'t charged with any
crime? Don\'t you have to be charged and know that someone was a witness
to be charged with influencing a witness?**

First of all, OCGA 16--10--3 is not "Influencing a witness."

> **16-10-3 - Using Private Funds For Law Enforcement Off-Duty
> Employment Of Law Enforcement Officers**

The statute you're looking for is 16--10--93: Influencing Witnesses.

> A person who, with intent to deter a witness from testifying freely,
> fully, and truthfully to any matter pending in any court, in any
> administrative proceeding, or before a grand jury, communicates,
> directly or indirectly, to such witness any threat of injury or damage
> to the person, property, or employment of the witness or to the
> person, property, or employment of any relative or associate of the
> witness or who offers or delivers any benefit, reward, or
> consideration to such witness or to a relative or associate of the
> witness shall, upon conviction thereof, be punished by imprisonment
> for not less than one nor more than five years.

Do you see anything in there about a requirement that you are charged
with a crime before the statute applies to you?

The elements of the crime under Georgia law:

- A person,
- with intent to deter a witness from freely, fully, and truthfully
  testifying:
  - communicates a threat of injury or damage to person or property
  - threatens their employment,
  - threatens relatives or associates similarly,
  - or offers benefits or rewards or consideration to anyone
- in order that they testify in a certain way

There's nothing in there which states you must be charged with a crime
first. If you tell someone to lie in court, you're guilty of Influencing
a Witness, and you can be arrested right there in the courthouse and go
directly to jail.

You do have to know the person is a witness, otherwise you're not
deterring a witness from testifying, but I bet you'd have a hard time
convincing the judge that you were unaware that the person you were
telling to lie in court was not actually in a court in which they could
tell the truth.

I know of former court officers who would carry this statute (for their
own states) on cards in their pockets and pull aside people who he
witnessed doing this and warn them (they got one warning) that witness
intimidation was not tolerated and if he saw it again, he'd arrest them
in the courtroom at the end of their trial, regardless of how it turned
out, and he'd drive them to the jail personally, to book them in on that
charge. In the same sentence, he'd remind them that he can enlist the
aid of as many officers as he though he'd need in order to effect that
arrest.

Think about that before you tell someone to lie in court.
