**Content:** [Caffeine is very similar, pharmacologically, to
theophylline, which is a bronchodialator. Studies have shown that it
functions similarly (opening up airways and relieving some of the
symptoms of asthma). [[Some
studies](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=8edec5&url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0010864/){.external_link

beneficial to those with asthma, relieving symptoms for up to four
hours.\

Now, for the important stuff:\
]{.rendered_qtext}

- Don\'t drink caffeine for at least four hours before you are scheduled
  to take a lung function test. The caffeine may alter your bronchial
  tubes and you will not get an accurate indication of lung function.
- DON\'T STOP TAKING YOUR ASTHMA MEDICINE AND SWITCH TO MOUNTAIN DEW OR
  MONSTER!!! (or anything with caffeine in it) Never stop or change your
  medications without consulting your doctor!
