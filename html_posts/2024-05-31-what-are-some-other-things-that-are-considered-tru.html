It sounds like you might be asking, "What are some other things that we
are rational to believe that science can't prove?"

There are plenty of things that we are all rational to believe exist
even though science can't prove them. For example:

- Math and logic. Science can't prove them, because science *presupposes
  them.*
- Aesthetic judgements. Science can't prove that a sunset is beautiful.
- Ethical judgements. Science can't prove that the Nazis were evil. The
  beautiful, like the good, cannot be proven with a scientific test.
- Metaphysical truths such as the fact that there are minds which exist
  outside of my own.

And surprisingly,

- Science itself. The belief that the scientific method discovers truth
  can't be proven by the scientific method. You cannot prove the tools
  of science (the laws of logic, the Law of Causality, the Principle of
  Uniformity, or the reliability of observation) by running some kind of
  experiment. You have to assume those things are true in order to do
  the experiment!

So while it's true that science can't prove the "concept of God," there
are plenty of other things that we are all rational to believe even
though science can't prove them.
