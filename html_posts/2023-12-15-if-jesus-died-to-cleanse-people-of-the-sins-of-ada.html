What makes you think that Eve's sins weren't forgiven?

Genesis 3:21 explains that God made clothes out of animal skins for Adam
and Eve to wear. Most scholars believe that this was the first animal
sacrifice, and a foreshadowing to the blood sacrifice of Jesus to
forgive the sins of the world. In other words, *God covered Adam and
Eve's sins with blood.* In **other** other words, this means that God
included them in the salvation provided by Jesus.

Therefore, it's a good bet that both Adam and Eve were saved and did go
to heaven when they died.
