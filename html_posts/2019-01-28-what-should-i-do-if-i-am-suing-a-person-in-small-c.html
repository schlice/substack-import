**What should I do if I am suing a person in small claims and I can not
get them served? I have an email address and phone number? Do I take my
service attempts to court and show the judge or do text / email the
person who has been evading service?**

Generally (of course, this varies by jurisdiction), you file your
complaint with the county. You pay the filing fee, and you pay the
service fee. An officer of the court then serves the other party in the
case.

It sounds though as if you're in a county which requires service but
does not provide it.

The first thing you will have to do is get a mailing address. A simple
reverse phone number search (free or paid) should be able to reveal a
mailing address when you have a phone number. However, there are some
paid people searches that will be able to give you a more definite
mailing address; the more information, the better. In your case, give
the email address and the phone number and you should be able to get a
mailing address. The fee you are charged by the search company should be
disclosed to the court and can be added to your judgement.

Once you have a mailing address, there are several methods by which you
can get papers served. Always check with the clerk of the court to find
out what services are available and authorized in your county:

- **Sheriff's office, Marshall's office, or Constable's office**:
  sometimes, you will have to approach law enforcement yourself with
  papers to be served, and you'll pay that office directly for that
  service.
- **Private process server**: check the local phone book for listings of
  private process servers in your area. In some jurisdictions, servers
  must be authorized by the court
- **Disinterested adult**: Some jurisdictions allow anyone who is 18
  years old or older to serve papers. In some jurisdictions, these
  adults must also be authorized by the court.
- **Certified mail**: Many jurisdictions allow service through certified
  mail. Check with your county to see if they allow this, and what they
  accept as proof of service. Generally you'll have to show that the
  letter was delivered. In some jurisdictions, the clerk of the court
  will do the mailing for you, and you can pay the fee directly to the
  court.
- **Regular mail**: A small number of jurisdictions allow service
  through regular first-class mail. Again, check with the clerk of the
  court to determine what qualifies as service through regular mail.
- **Substituted service**: This is colloquially known as "nail and mail"
  since you can "nail" a copy of the summons to their door, and at the
  same time mail a copy to the person's address. Typically, in a
  jurisdiction which allows it, a copy of the summons is delivered to
  the address and is left with anyone who is 18 or older. On the same
  day, a copy of the summons is sent via regular mail. Service is
  considered complete 10 days after mailing. All of these steps must be
  carried out by someone 18 or older who is not named in the suit.

Once you have completed service to the satisfaction of the court (and
have filed a Proof of Service with the clerk), you can attend your court
date and receive a default judgement against the respondent. So long as
the person was properly served based on what is accepted in that county,
the service is appropriately documented, and the respondent fails to
show up, you can get a default judgement entered by the court.
