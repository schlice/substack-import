**Can a child be arrested for keying a car?**

While destruction of property is, in most places, a misdemeanor (which
means you can indeed go to jail for it, for up to a year), most adult
laws do not directly apply to children.

Children are adjudicated (when the are) by the **juvenile justice
system**. The system is goaled towards rehabiliting youthful offenders.
Parents and children can face a variety of consequences, such as
mandatory counseling, probation, community service, youth court, and in
the most severe of cases, youth incarceration.
