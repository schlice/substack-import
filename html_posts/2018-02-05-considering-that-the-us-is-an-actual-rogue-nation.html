**Considering that the US is an actual rogue nation as it sponsors
Kurdish terrorism, should Turkey end its alliance with the US?**

I'll ignore the fact that this is a clearly inflammatory question, and
I'll ignore the fact that you are begging the question, and I'll ignore
the fact that this is likely a troll question that you have asked,

but it's Monday. I'll address your points.

Supporting the Kurds in their fight against ISIS does not make the
United States a "rogue nation." Beside the fact that "rogue nation" or
"rogue state" is not a legal definition of anything, the generally
accepted definition of a "rogue nation" is one which is ruled by an
authoritarian government that severely restricts human rights, is a
state sponsor of terrorism, and actively seeks to proliferate weapons of
mass destruction.[\[1\]](#OxPlp){#cite-OxPlp .citation_link} By that
definition, it is nations like Cuba, North Korea, and Iran which would
qualify. It is also important to note that the United States officially
stopped using the term "rogue nation" or "rogue state" 18 years ago.

You may believe that the United States supporting Kurdish freedom
fighters is state sponsorship of terrorism, but the Kurds have a better
record on human rights than the Turks. In fact, Turkey's direct actions
against the Kurds show quite clearly which people is more supportive of
human rights.[\[2\]](#DdvbA){#cite-DdvbA .citation_link}

> ***\[S\]hould Turkey end its alliance with the US?***

Turkey should do whatever Turkey chooses to do, as it is a sovereign
nation. If its foreign policy does not align with that of the US, then
yes, it should end its alliance with the US.

But doing so brings its own challenges, and being on the wrong side of
relations with the strongest military power in the world is not
generally the place any nation voluntarily chooses to place itself
(unless you're bat-shit crazy like the Kims in North Korea). If Turkey
decides to end its alliance with the United States, that means that
Turkey declares that it no longer needs a*nything* from the US. So if
Somali pirates attack ships flying Turkish flags in the Red Sea, the US
Navy might not come to their aid. Hey, they don't need US assistance any
more, right? And as I'm sure you're aware, Russia is no friend to Turkey
these days, basically declaring the Turks as "accomplices of
terrorists[\[3\]](#wUsrX){#cite-wUsrX .citation_link}" as late as 2015.
I'm sure Turkey doesn't need US assistance in dealing with Russia, does
it?

Now, I won't go so far as to say that Turkey is actually the rogue
nation in this equation, but on balance, it's hard to see how supporting
Kurds in their fight against ISIS, or backing Kurds against Turkish
aggression and human rights violations makes the United States a "rogue
nation."

But go ahead Turkey, you do you.
