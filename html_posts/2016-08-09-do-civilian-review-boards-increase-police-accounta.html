Your question details actually answered your question.

Civilians don't have their own review boards, but some departments do
allow civilian volunteers to audit their internal reviews. The reviews
don't change; they're exactly the same review that would be done
normally. The civilians on the review board increase ***transparency***,
or at the very least, the appearance of transparency to the general
public. Knowing that civilians sit on the "internal" police review
boards helps the public to feel like the police are being held
accountable.
