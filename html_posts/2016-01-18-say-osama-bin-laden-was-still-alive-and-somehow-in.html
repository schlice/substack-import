Most likely. US citizens are not authorized to assassinate anyone.
Neither is any police department in the US. If a US citizen were to
shoot him dead on the streets, that citizen would be arrested and
charged with Murder 1.

Once at trial, the possibility of extenuating circumstances (i.e. it was
Osama bin Laden) and plea bargains could reduce the time served to a
minimum.
