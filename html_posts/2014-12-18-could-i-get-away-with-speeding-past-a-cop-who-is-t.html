**Content:** [We recently have been cracking down on the new laws
requiring motorists to move over a lane (if possible) or slow down when
an officer is on the side of the road. We\'ve been ensuring that if a
second car is available that he sits just ahead of the target vehicle
and watches traffic, and if passing motorists are non-compliant with the
new laws, they are stopped and informed. They are usually not ticketed.\
\
We\'ve done PSAs and the electronic signs have been posting
informational messages like \"Move over or slow down for emergency
vehicles\"]{.rendered_qtext}
