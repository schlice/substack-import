<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [We recently have been cracking down on the new laws<br>requiring motorists to move over a lane (if possible) or slow down when<br>an officer is on the side of the road. We\'ve been ensuring that if a<br>second car is available that he sits just ahead of the target vehicle<br>and watches traffic, and if passing motorists are non-compliant with the<br>new laws, they are stopped and informed. They are usually not ticketed.\<br>\<br>We\'ve done PSAs and the electronic signs have been posting<br>informational messages like \"Move over or slow down for emergency<br>vehicles\"]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
