The system we are discussing is manufactured by Taser (yes, the same
company that makes Tasers). Like most police body cam systems, it has a
"Record" button. This allows the officer to start and stop recording.

It also has a continuously-rolling 30-second buffer ***sans audio***
which is always recording, regardless of the state of the full
recording. That buffer's contents get pre-pended to the video (meaning
"stuck on the front") once the "Record" button is pushed. This allows
for an additional 30 seconds of video to be added to the full clip
beginning 30 seconds before the button push, but without audio you
didn't intend to record (like the chit-chat between you and your partner
before you stepped out of your car). Therefore, the audio began at the
moment the officer pressed the "Record" button. The video without the
audio was recorded before the officer pushed the button.

Depending on department rules regarding when recordings should start,
this may have been a violation of procedure. In this case, the officer
with the body cam was providing backup and approaching quickly, so he
was more worried about the situation than pushing the button. Therefore,
because he was only a backup officer, I would be surprised if this was
an actual policy violation, but there are only 17,000+ police
departments at the state and local level across the country, how could
all of their policies be identical?

Regardless, body cam video adds to the "body of evidence" which can
either support or refute an officer's testimony. It is not intended to
"replace" an officer's testimony. Remember, the camera cannot see
everything. It can only see what it's pointing at. It doesn't have a 360
degree view.
