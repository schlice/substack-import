**Why doesn\'t the DMV have to follow a court ruling?**

Without more context, it's really hard to answer.

But the DMV is part of the Execuutive Branch of government, a
***co-equal*** branch of government to the Judicial Branch. The
Executive Branch is not run by the Judicial Branch. They are not
beholden to the courts. They can make their own decisions, so long as
those decisions are legal. Court decisions are not necessarily binding
unless they are injunctions of law while constitutionality is being
debated.
