**Content:** [Put simply, I have a *right*. I don\'t have a *privilege*
which can be revoked (like a driver\'s license). I have a *right* to own
a gun. Regardless of what you may think of the gun, I have a right to
own one. I have an *individual* right to \"keep and bear\" one. A
function of living in the United States as a citizen affords me that
right.\
\
To address the horror you feel towards guns, that\'s simply because the
gun is a purpose-built tool to kill. It is designed to kill. It does so
effectively and efficiently.\
\
That fact alone does not mean that the gun has no place in a household
or in society. That fact alone simply means that it is the best tool
available for killing. Because it is. It minimizes collateral damage
better than any other tool available; it is very precise. It kills
whatever I\'m aiming at. As long as I operate it properly, it is one of
the safest (for the operator) methods for killing we have. It\'s an
extremely simple machine, as far as machines go. More tongue-in-cheek,
it\'s the world\'s first \"point-and-click interface.\"\
\
But does the fact that it is a tool to kill make it unsuitable for a
household?\
\
The question must follow: is killing ever needed? Or lawful?\
\
The answer is yes, killing is needed in certain scenarios, and even
lawful. Killing is needed, under common law, for the purpose of
self-defense, and the protection from tyranny. If you are being
threatened with deadly force, you can meet that threat with deadly force
as well. The gun is sometimes known as \"the great equalizer\" because
it removes size and strength differences between people. A famous
advertising campaign from Colt said, \"God made man; Samuel Colt made
them equal.\" A small person can easily take down a very large man by
using a gun; size and gender no longer factor in issues of
self-defense.\
\
And while it is far less likely today, America was founded on the core
belief that the people hold the ultimate power in the government.
Government is \"of the people, by the people, and for the people.\" The
people are the ultimate authority in the government. The people must
also retain the right to overthrow the government should that ever
become necessary. Because it\'s hard to do today, should we then say,
\"Oh well, the government has grown too big and powerful to overthrow,
therefore we should remove all guns from society\"? The logic does not
follow, as this is a logically false conclusion to draw from the
relevant facts.\
\
Finally, regulation. With every right comes an associated
responsibility, and those responsibilities can, and should, and are,
codified in law. We as a society have stated that felons should not have
access to guns. We have also stated that people should not have access
to automatic weapons. We have also stated that guns cannot be brought
into sensitive areas, such as schools (although that\'s up for debate)
and government buildings such as courthouses. Any time you buy a gun
from a licensed gun dealer, you have to have a criminal background check
performed. These laws all exist today. What further regulation would you
propose that would substantially reduce crime without being increasingly
onerous on the legal gun owner?]{.rendered_qtext}
