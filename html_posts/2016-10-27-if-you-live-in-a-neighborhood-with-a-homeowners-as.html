The answer is it depends.

Most residential HOAs only allow you to keep animals which are commonly
referred to as family pets. This is mostly for sanitation and to avoid
nuisance complaints. This means that beyond dogs, cats and small
household critters, you can\'t have it. And there are usually rules
about them too.

However, it\'s entirely up to your HOA. Check your covenants to be sure
before you buy that chicken coop.
