*How do I expose the flaw in logic claims that blacks only make up 13%
of the total population and whites 60% so blacks are twice as likely to
get shot?*

\

Short answer: While statistically you can make the claim that as a
percentage of society blacks are twice as likely to get shot by police,
those statistics are disingenuous because they ignore ***incidence of
crime***, or ***situational factors*** (the **why** behind police
shootings).

Longer answer: The simple statistic that shows that blacks are twice as
likely as whites to get shot assumes that ***all police encounters are
equal.*** It's assuming that an officer pulling up on a disabled
motorist fixing a flat tire is equal to an officer pulling up on a
gunfight. The situation matters! The criminal activity (or lack thereof)
matters! The compliance of the suspect matters! Show me the YouTube
video that goes like this:

OFFICER: Step out of the car\
SUSPECT: \<steps out of car\>\
OFFICER: Put your hands on your head\
SUSPECT: \<puts hands on head\>\
OFFICER: BANG BANG BANG

You cannot show me this video because it does not exist. The risk of
being shot is determined by ***what you do*** during a police encounter,
not solely who you are. Combining ***what you do*** with ***your race***
is what people are trying to come up with. They are claiming that two
people who do exactly the same things during a police encounter have
different risks of being shot simply because of their race.

This, by the way, is a figure you will never be able to compute, because
it has no basis in fact. It's not an objectively measurable figure.

You can calculate percentage of a particular race shot by police. You
can calculate percentage of a particular race in society. But there is
no logical comparison between those two numbers, because that essential
factor of ***situational*** ***factors*** will always be involved in
whether or not an officer pulls the trigger.

But if you look at the statistics, you'll find that the central thesis
of the Black Lives Matter movement --- that police pose the greatest
threat to young black men --- is an indictment that does not contain
***any*** element of truth. In 90% of black homicide deaths, the shooter
is another young black man, not a cop. And in 95% of those cases, the
police are not even involved.

Since 2015 has complete statistics, we'll use those. According to the
[[Washington
Post](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=daba35&url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/national/police-shootings/?tid%3Da_inl){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="washingtonpost.com"}]{.qlink_container}, the police killed
990 people in 2015. 494 were white, 258 were black. That means that
police killed twice as many white people as they did black people.
According to these numbers, whites should be twice as nervous about
being killed by police than blacks.

But these numbers all ignore the blaring elephant in the room:
***incidence of crime***. In Chicago, blacks were 72 percent of all stop
subjects during a four-month period in 2014, reported the ACLU, whereas
whites were 9 percent of all stop subjects. But blacks and whites each
make up roughly 32 percent of the city's populace. Therefore, the police
are racially profiling. Right? Isn't that what these numbers say? But
add in incidence of crime, and you get a different picture. Blacks in
Chicago made up 79 percent of all known nonfatal shooting suspects, 85
percent of all known robbery suspects, and 77 percent of all known
murder suspects, according to police department data. Whites were 1
percent of known nonfatal shootings suspects in 2014, 2.5 percent of
known robbery suspects, and 5 percent of known murder suspects, the last
number composed disproportionately of domestic
homicides.[\[1\]](#AnFcd){#cite-AnFcd .citation_link}

So put those two together and you find that police stop blacks ***eight
times as often*** as whites (because they commit crimes eight times as
often as whites), but they die ***half as often as whites*** at the
hands of police. So statistically, if you're black, you're far more
likely to be stopped, but you're far less likely to be killed, by a cop
as your white counterpart.
