**Content:** [Every sign and/or symptom of MS can be presented by some
other disease or condition. Every. single. one. There is no sign or
symptom of MS that is unique to MS.\
\
So in order to diagnose MS, you have to basically exclude every possible
condition which can cause the symptoms and signs exhibited. And all of
the symptoms and/or signs exhibited must point to MS. This is where it
gets tricky, and it requires a lot of research into the signs and
symptoms. A full neurological exam, MRIs, evoked potential tests, lumbar
punctures, etc. can all contribute to the body of evidence that will
point away from any other disease or condition which can cause the signs
and symptoms and will point towards MS.\
\
MS is also know as \"the Great Imitator\" for this reason, and a
diagnosis of MS is a diagnosis of \"exclusion\" for the same reason.\
\
Previously, because of this, a positive diagnosis of MS could only be
made after two symptoms of the disease were present, disseminated by
space and time. This is known as the **McDonald MS Diagnostic
Criteria.** Dissemination of space meant in two separate bodily systems,
and dissemination of time meant a minimum of six months between
symptoms. This means an MS patient must have had two unique symptoms and
they had to have appeared more than six months apart from each other.\
\
Thankfully, the introduction of the MRI as a diagnostic tool allowed the
McDonald criteria to be updated, and in 2010, the criteria was updated
to allow for a single symptom along with a positive MRI to present a
positive diagnosis. So as of five years ago, positive MS diagnosis is
now faster and more accurate.]{.rendered_qtext}
