**If some mass vigilante group were to go on a mass shooting spree of
Klu Klux Klan meetings across the country, would any good person really
care about any of the Klan members being taken out?**

So you've really gone out in public, [[Lucas

and admitted that a person's life is only valuable if they believe in a
specific way?

I have deleted and re-typed this next sentence like ten times now, and I
just can't get the rest of the words out in a non-BNBR-violating way.

So I won't. I'll let your stupidity stand on its own.
