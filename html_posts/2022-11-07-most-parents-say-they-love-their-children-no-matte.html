Who says that God doesn't love us no matter what we do?

Perhaps you're thinking that because God allows you to choose sin and to
choose your own destiny that He must not love you.

Quite the contrary, actually.

God loves you *so much* that He has given you free will. He loves you so
much that He won't coerce you into loving Him, he only *offers* his love
to you. He loves you *so much* that He allows you to reject His love if
you choose. He allows you to choose an eternity of separation from Him,
and as much as He *anguishes* over this, He loves you *so much* that He
will let you do it to yourself if you choose.

God loves you *so much* that He took the punishment that you and I
deserve **on himself** so that we could be together for all eternity,
but He still allows you to reject that gift.

God *never* stops loving us. Ever. I simply can't imagine how He could
love us *more.*
