Short answer: if she alters the court, she can.

Longer answer: While she may not be able to do things like outlawing
ammunition (which has already been ruled as unconstitutional), she may
be able to get the Heller decision overturned, having the court rule
that the Second Amendment does not confer an individual right to gun
ownership, but instead only provides a right to own a gun if the citizen
is part of the militia, effectively making it illegal to own a gun if
you are not a member of the militia.
