Your assertion is false. You asserted that **all** of the worldwide
known religions originated in the Middle East, and this assertion is
indeed false.

Since only one example needs to be given to show that not all of the
world's religions originated in the Middle East, Buddhism, which is
currently the 4th largest religion in the world, originated in India
almost 2500 years ago.
