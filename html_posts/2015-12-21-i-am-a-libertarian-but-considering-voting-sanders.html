Very few of Sen. Sanders\' policies are libertarian.

Sanders bases the vast majority of his policies on the Democratic
platform, which emphasizes class differences (wealth inequality, salary
inequality, wage inequality, etc). He hopes to fix this through wealth
redistribution (taking more from the top 1% of wage earners and giving
it to other wealth classes through redistribution programs like grants
and scholarships), as well as attempting to force business owners to pay
all entry-level workers upwards of \$15/hr within 5 years of being
elected (which will result in massively increased amounts of automation
and the elimination of many entry level jobs).

There is nothing libertarian about taking property from one class of
citizen and giving it to another.
