**Yes, this is normal.**

But this is *also* a sign that you need help.

It's okay to need help. Sometimes, we need someone else (who is an
expert on these sorts of things) to help us understand and sort through
our feelings.

Professionals can absolutely help you with this. Don't feel bad about
needing to talk to someone about your feelings. Sometimes, our feelings
are hard to sort through, and they don't make sense.

Please, get help. Take a look at the box on this page titled, "There is
Help" and avail yourself of the resources in that box, or if you have
access to your medical care team, ask your doctor who you can talk to.

You *can* feel better. You just need to ask for help. You've already
taken the first step, and that's the hardest one to take. It gets better
and easier from here.

Original question:

In high school, I was 16 and found out that my father killed himself
when I was 3. I started to cut myself and tried killing myself. I feel
unloved by him and unwanted and that I don't belong. Is that normal ?
