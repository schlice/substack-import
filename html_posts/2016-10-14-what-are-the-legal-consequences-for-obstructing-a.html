Depends on the state, but all states have some form of a law which
relates to preventing an officer from performing his duties. And it's
important to note that you don't have to actually touch an officer to
obstruct him or prevent him from carrying out his duties. Physical
obstruction is not the only action which can be charged as obstruction.
These examples are from actual cases brought against individuals who
were convicted of obstructing a police officer:

- Questioning an officer\'s authority
- Giving an officer false information
- Using profanity directed at an officer
- Advise or incite others in their dealings with an officer
- Refusing to accept a parking ticket or speeding

In most states, obstructing a police officer is a high-level
misdemeanor, which generally means less than a year in jail.
