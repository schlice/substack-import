First of all, He has already revealed Himself. Just look around you. God
has plainly revealed Himself through His creation.

This is an example of "special revelation" --- God revealing His
invisible qualities through His creation. He has also revealed Himself
through what we call "general revelation," which is the evidence of God
in the majesty of creation, such as the human body, nature, and the
governing of the universe.

So He has already revealed Himself.

But, I bet you're wondering, why doesn't He just do more? Like why
doesn't he write "I exist, FFS" on the clouds, or come floating down on
a huge cloud zapping evil with His lightning bolt fingers and with
awesome rock riffs playing in the background? I mean, then He would
eliminate all doubt and everyone would believe! Right?

Right?

Well, not exactly.

First, ***even with that awesome entrance,*** there would be plenty who
would still not believe. Why? For many, the problem is not God's
revelation. The problem is that they ***don't want to believe***.
Believing, for them, would cause them to have to change their entire
lifestyle, and they are too comfortable in that lifestyle and simply
want to keep it.

Second, God wants you to choose Him ***freely*** and without coercion.
