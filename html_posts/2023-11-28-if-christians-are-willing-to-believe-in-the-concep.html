If this is a true question, then the questioner does not understand
absolute truth.

Absolute truth exists, and is knowable. And the opposite of truth is
false.

Therefore, if Christians believe that the Bible describes absolute
truth, and that the Bible is the inspired word of God, then anything
opposed to it is false.

The gods of other religions are in direct opposition to the Christian
God, as the Bible says that YHWH is the one and only god. It's literally
the first of the Ten Commandments.

Therefore, any other god is false.
