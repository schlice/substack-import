**Content:** [Students all over the country have been arrested because
of the most inane issues, simply due to the overreach of school \"zero
tolerance\" policy. Things that used to get you sent to the principal\'s
office (fighting, arguing with a teacher, throwing food in the
cafeteria, etc) can now get you sent to jail.\
\
The \"school-to-prison\" pipeline has been rapidly expanding over the
last few years. Some blame the zero-tolerance policies of the schools.
Some say that teachers are using the policies to force lower-performing
students out of the school to boost the school\'s numbers. Others say
there is an overzealous police force. Here\'s just [[one
example.](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=ca3d8f&url=http://wgntv.com/2015/05/13/school-district-busts-students-for-candy-cellphones-profanity/){.external_link

\
And unsurprisingly, these zero-tolerance policies seem to impact black
and Latino students more than whites.\

We have lots of problems, but we don\'t seem to have many solutions.
