**Content:** [Neural engineering (or neuroengineering) is the sub-class
of biomedical engineering that focuses on using engineering to enhance
or repair neural systems. These people work at the interface between the
body and the machine. Two applications come to mind right away:\
\
Biocompatible prostheses: prostheses that respond directly to neural
input. It doesn\'t have to be an artificial limb, either. Imagine
putting on an exosuit (think a Spandex bodysuit with filaments running
through it) and having it conduct the signals from the brain to the body
because the nerves that are supposed to perform that function are shot.
You would be able to walk again, or grab things correctly. This would be
a coup for MS patients. It\'s also something that spinal-cord injury
patients would like to see as well.\
\
Neural repair: one of the problems that MS patients face today is that
nerves don\'t readily repair themselves. Even if the plaques are
removed, the damaged nerves remain. Many times, especially in the brain,
the function that was lost can be \"re-learned\" using other neural
pathways. But in the spine especially, nerve tissue does not readily
re-grow. Finding a way to influence nerve cells to regenerate (perhaps
by bio-engineering adult stem cells) could mean that the body\'s own
ability to heal itself could be enhanced and tuned to fix the damage
caused by MS.]{.rendered_qtext}
