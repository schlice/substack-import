<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Neural engineering (or neuroengineering) is the sub-class<br>of biomedical engineering that focuses on using engineering to enhance<br>or repair neural systems. These people work at the interface between the<br>body and the machine. Two applications come to mind right away:\<br>\<br>Biocompatible prostheses: prostheses that respond directly to neural<br>input. It doesn\'t have to be an artificial limb, either. Imagine<br>putting on an exosuit (think a Spandex bodysuit with filaments running<br>through it) and having it conduct the signals from the brain to the body<br>because the nerves that are supposed to perform that function are shot.<br>You would be able to walk again, or grab things correctly. This would be<br>a coup for MS patients. It\'s also something that spinal-cord injury<br>patients would like to see as well.\<br>\<br>Neural repair: one of the problems that MS patients face today is that<br>nerves don\'t readily repair themselves. Even if the plaques are<br>removed, the damaged nerves remain. Many times, especially in the brain,<br>the function that was lost can be \"re-learned\" using other neural<br>pathways. But in the spine especially, nerve tissue does not readily<br>re-grow. Finding a way to influence nerve cells to regenerate (perhaps<br>by bio-engineering adult stem cells) could mean that the body\'s own<br>ability to heal itself could be enhanced and tuned to fix the damage<br>caused by MS.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
