It's designed to be enforced retroactively, after a gun is used in a
crime. It's not designed to prevent any crime *per se.* It's designed to
ensure that everyone gets a background check.

But to be honest, what good will that do? Almost every mass shooter
acquired his guns completely legally, passing every background check.
Adding more background checks doesn't help anyone.

If a gun is involved in a crime, the ownership and transfer of that gun
between each owner is checked as far back as they can go; back to the
original purchase from the manufacturer, if possible. If a transfer took
place without a background check, the persons involved would face
criminal liability.
