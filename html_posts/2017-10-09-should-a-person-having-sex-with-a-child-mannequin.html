*(US answer)*

If he's doing it in public, he could be arrested for indecent exposure.

If he's doing it in view of a real child, he could be arrested for
contributing to the delinquency of a minor.

If he's in the privacy of his own home with no one else around, or if
he's doing it in the presence of consenting adults, he can do whatever
he darn well pleases with whatever inanimate objects he has at his
disposal.
