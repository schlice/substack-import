The answer is "it depends." The rules for meetings will be in the
Governing Documents, and not all Governing Documents are alike. There
may be a provision in your Governing Documents which permits the
president to suppress taking the minutes for the meeting.

But in the vast majority of cases, this cannot happen.

It all comes down to the structure of the HOA. Most HOAs in the United
States are 501(c)(4) non-profit corporations and as such, are governed
by some individual documents which make up what we call the Governing
Documents of the HOA, such as the Articles of Incorporation and the
Bylaws. These are standard corporate documents which dictate the
structure and operations of the legal entity we call a corporation. You
probably aren't even aware, but usually the "official" name of your HOA
isn't just your neighborhood name plus HOA. It's usually "neighborhood
name" HOA, Inc, because you are a corporation. You have a Board of
Directors, you have elections, you have officers, you have committees,
you have a budget, and you have Annual Meetings. All of these things are
governed by those articles of incorporation and bylaws, which direct how
all of those things are to happen.

You may have a rule in your Governing Documents which says that minutes
must only be taken during the Annual Meeting and are optional for other
Board meetings. You may not. Only your Governing Documents will tell you
for certain.
