**Can a homeowners association forbid the construction of a wheelchair
ramp to the front entrance of a house?**

No, with caveats.

The HOA cannot *forbid* you from building a wheelchair accessible ramp
to your house. That would be in violation of the Fair Housing Act.

However, they can dictate how the ramp looks, what materials it is made
out of, and possibly if there is more than one suitable location for the
ramp, which location you can use.
