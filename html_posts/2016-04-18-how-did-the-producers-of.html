You need to prove three points of fact: 1. The movie accurately portrays
reality, 2. The movie intentionally lies about that reality, and 3. The
lie causes identifiable monetary damage. Let\'s look at this.

**1. The movie accurately portrays reality**

At best, the movie is a *dramatization*. At worst, it is a fictional
story based loosely off of a book (*The Accidental Billionaires: The
Founding of Facebook A Tale of Sex, Money, Genius and Betrayal* (2009)
by Ben Mezrich.) Indeed, a user over at IMDb makes this exact assertion:

> Mark Zuckerberg claims that the movie is almost entirely fictional
> except in the broadest sense that he, Dustin Moskovitz, and Eduardo
> Saverin created Facebook while students at Harvard. \[\...\]
> Screenwriter Aaron Sorkin and director David Fincher insist that the
> film is very accurate. Sorkin has even said that it is not fictional
> at all, merely dramatized. Much of the film is based on testimony
> given at a number of depositions related to \[\...\] lawsuits
> \[against Zuckerberg\]. To this extent, the film might be considered
> very accurate. However, as the character Mark points out in the film,
> people do lie in depositions.

It is clear, however, that the movie definitely does deviate from
reality:

> One notable change made for the film is that the film totally ignores
> Zuckerberg\'s wife Priscilla Chan. The film makes Zuckerberg out to be
> a lonely socially maladroit nerd who has casual sex with groupies but
> no meaningful relationships and, even at the height of his power, is
> still pining away for his college girlfriend. In reality, Zuckerberg
> and \[wife\] Priscilla Chan began dating in their sophomore year at
> Harvard, around the same time Mark was creating Facebook, and have
> been together ever since, marrying in 2012.

Thus, it is pretty clear that even while Sorkin and Fincher insist that
the movie is very accurate, there are portions which are indeed
fictional, and the entire story is most definitely dramatized, meaning
it has been changed from how the actual events to make it more exciting.

Finally, I\'m pretty sure that no one watching the screenplay believes
it to be a documentary, or even a documentary-style re-telling of actual
events. I\'m certain the movie contains pre-roll which states that while
the movie is based on real people, many events are fictionalized.

**2. The movie intentionally lies about facts**

The movie is a dramatization of depositions in a court case at best, and
a screenplay from a book at worst. Because it is not a documentary, it
can make changes in order to keep the script moving along. Changing how
Zuckerberg is portrayed is one of those changes which enhance the story,
but have no basis in reality. So while they make creative changes to the
story, I\'m not sure the reasonable person would consider that lying in
an attempt to discredit Zuckerberg.

**3. There is articulable, verifiable loss caused by that lie.**

Even if you could prove that there was an intentional misrepresentation
of fact, and if you could prove that the reasonable person would
consider the movie an accurate portrayal of fact (which are both pretty
tough hurdles to overcome in themselves), you would then have to show
that there was a verifiable financial loss caused by that lie.

This is a tough row to hoe, and I think that Zuck\'s legal team probably
advised him to just let it go. Considering that at the time, Facebook
was doing amazingly well financially, it would have been really
difficult to prove that there were financial damages done by the movie.
