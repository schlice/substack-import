The answer is it depends, and it really depends on what you want. For
example, I want to know God's will for my life better. Is it selfish to
want that? Is it selfish to want to know God better?

There is nothing selfish in wanting good things to happen. As
Christians, we see how dark and sinful the world is, and sadly, it will
probably only get worse as more time passes. Wanting good things to
happen is not a sin. In fact, it can actually be a reason to hope. By
wanting good things to happen, it means you have not yet given up hope.
Don't give up hope now. Continue to pray for good things to happen by
turning to God.

There is absolutely nothing selfish in wanting that.
