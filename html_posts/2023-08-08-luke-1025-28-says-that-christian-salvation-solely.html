As usual, a small quote misses the context. And as I've said many times
when answering Christian questions, **text, without context, is just
pretext.**

Luke 10:25-28 says the following (it's short, so we can paste it in
here):

> On one occasion an expert in the law stood up to test Jesus.
> "Teacher," he asked, "what must I do to inherit eternal life?"
>
> "What is written in the Law?" he replied. "How do you read it?"
>
> He answered, "'Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all
> your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind'; and,
> 'Love your neighbor as yourself.'"
>
> "You have answered correctly," Jesus replied. "Do this and you will
> live." (NIV)

So what was Jesus saying here? He was talking to a lawyer about the law,
and He said, "What is written in the Law?" So Jesus was pointing a
lawyer right back to the Law, the same Law that the lawyer held himself
to.

In other words, **if you hold yourself to the Law, then you must keep
the Law**.

*But can anyone do that?*

No one perfectly keeps the Law. Only Jesus perfectly kept the Law.
That's why Paul said in Romans 3:28 that "we are justified by faith
apart from the works of the Law" because no one can perfectly keep the
Law.

That is why the Gospel says that Jesus kept the Law perfectly (1 Peter
2:22), so we can be justified before God by faith in Him (Romans 4:3, 5;
5:1; John 1:12; 3:16) without the works of the Law (Romans 3:28).
