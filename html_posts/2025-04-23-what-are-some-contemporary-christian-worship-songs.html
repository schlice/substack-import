Check out "[[That's My
King](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=c07ea8&url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DAB-3Av8RYo8){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"

Winans.

Look at that chord progression in the chorus:

> 1 . . b7\
> We declare the glory
>
> 4/6 . . 4\
> Give Him all the honor
>
> 1 . . b7\
> Altogether worthy
>
> 6 . . b6\
> Who we talkin' about?
>
> That's my King

That flatted 6 is a pure Gospel affectation. But this song still bumps
Contemporary.

And the BGVs in the music video? If that doesn't scream Gospel
influence, I don't know what does.
