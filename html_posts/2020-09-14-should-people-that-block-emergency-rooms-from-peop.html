**Should people that block emergency rooms, from people who need
immediate treatment, be charged with murder in case of their death?**

No. Murder is not an appropriate charge. A better charge would be
involuntary manslaughter (or criminally negligent homicide, depending on
your jurisdiction). This is a crime in which someone acts recklessly or
negligently, and someone else dies as a result.

Intentionally blocking access to an emergency room is both reckless and
negligent. If someone dies because they couldn't access that emergency
room, the blocker could be charged with involuntary manslaughter.
