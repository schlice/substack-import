**What\'s a homeowners association, how is it legal, and why can\'t you
just ignore their rules and live however you want in your own home?**

A Homeowner's Association (HOA) is generally a 501(c)4 non-profit
corporation. Its primary mission is to keep home values in a specific
area as high as possible. They do this by creating and maintaining
policies that keep the neighborhood neat, keeping homes looking good,
and providing other services for homeowners. HOAs provide a benefit to
homeowners by keeping your home's value as high as possible by
maintaining a great community that people want to live in. That
perceived value keeps your individual home values high. They do this not
by controlling what you do with your home, they do this by making sure
that your *neighbors* don't do things that will negatively impact your
home's value.

When you buy a house in a community controlled by an HOA, you sign a
contract. That's what makes it legal. You agreed to HOA control when you
bought your house. The contract is called a "covenant." You may have
heard the phrase, "a covenant-controlled community." That means that all
of the homeowners have signed on to a "covenant" which is basically a
shared contract that everyone agrees to follow.

You could sign on to an HOA and then ignore their rules, but you risk
your finances by doing this. The HOA can fine you, and if you do not pay
your fines, they can put a lien on your home. This is part of the
covenants: the HOA has a financial interest in your property. If the HOA
puts a lien on your home, you can't sell or refinance until that lien is
satisfied. If you still don't pay, the HOA can *foreclose* on your lien
in order to satisfy their unpaid debt. This usually means that they will
have to sell your house, right out from under you, to pay that debt.
