Ah, a common misconception about the law. In a court of law, ***you
never prove innocence.*** You only prove whether someone is "guilty" or
"not guilty." It's not the difference between "guilty" and "innocent."
It's "guilty" or "not guilty." That's a very very important distinction
to make, because "not guilty" does not necessarily equal "innocent."
"Not guilty" simply means that the required elements to prove that the
particular crime has been committed have not been proven beyond a
reasonable doubt. It ***does not*** mean that the defendant is
"innocent" or even that he's a "good person." It simply means that the
evidence presented is not enough to convict the defendant of that crime:
not guilty of that crime. Doesn't mean he didn't do it. It just means
there isn't enough evidence to overcome the reasonable doubt that he did
it.

A prosecutor must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that someone is
**guilty.** A defense attorney must show **reasonable doubt**. The
prosecutor has to prove guilt beyond reasonable doubt, and he has to do
it with solid facts, evidence gathered by the police, etc. The defense
attorney doesn't have to do any of these things. He simply has to show
that the evidence, as presented, leaves holes, questions unanswered,
etc.

As a jury, you have to find that the evidence outweighs the reasonable
doubt. It's the "scales of justice" metaphor: the prosecutor piles his
evidence on one side of the scale, and the defense piles its reasonable
doubt onto the other. If the jury believes that the scale tips in favor
of the evidence, the jury returns a guilty verdict. If they believe the
scales tip in favor of reasonable doubt, the jury returns not guilty.

This is oftentimes why you see a defendant ruled "not guilty" in a
criminal trial, and then be found to be "liable" in a civil trial. While
a criminal trial requires evidence "beyond a reasonable doubt," the
evidentiary requirement in a civil trial is much lower. You only have to
show by a "preponderance of the evidence" that the person is liable. You
may not be able to prove the crime of murder, but you can prove wrongful
death. This is what happened to OJ Simpson. The criminal circus, er,
court could not find him guilty of murder, but the civil court found him
liable for wrongful death, and awarded monetary damages to the families.
