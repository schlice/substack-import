**Can a U.S. citizen be denied entry into the United States?**

Under certain conditions, yes, you may be denied re-entry into the
United States.

In this case, and in the case of air carriers, the carrier is required
to provide security related documentation on every passenger before
entry, and the airline failed to do so, so the individual was detained
until that information was provided.
