**Has anyone found anything besides steroids to be helpful for symptoms
that return between doses (imbalance, motor skill deficits, vision,
etc)? My daughter may need to postpone her infusion a 2nd time (illness)
but has some of these issues.**

MS is called the "Great Imitator" because every symptom associated with
the disease is also associated with some other disease or condition; no
condition can be caused only by MS. In other words, balance issues can
be caused by MS, but they can also be caused by inner ear issues (middle
ear inflammation and benign tumors of the acoustic nerve that connects
the ear and the brain). Vision issues can be caused by MS, or they can
be caused by other neuropathies as well.

Treatments for the symptoms of MS are similarly related to other disease
paths that share the same symptoms. For example, balance issues are
treated in the same way for someone with an inner ear problem as they
are for someone with MS. Occupational therapy can help with balance
issues, and some medications which are used to treat motion sickness can
also be prescribed for balance issues or vertigo.

It's important to talk with your neurologist about all of your symptoms
so that you can come up with effective treatments to ease them. There
are treatments available for all of these symptoms, so the quicker you
can get in to discuss them with your doctor, the sooner you can start to
experience some relief.

Good luck!
