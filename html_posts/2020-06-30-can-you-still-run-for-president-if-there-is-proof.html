**Can you still run for president if there is proof that you are a
traitor?**

Yes. Proof of a war crime is not a disqualification from being elected
president. In fact, the Constitution only lists *qualifications* for the
Presidency, not *conditions which may disqualify you*.

On the other hand, if you have been **found guilty of treason**, you
probably won't be running for President any time soon, as you will
likely be on Death Row.
