The subject should have involved the state's regulatory board
immediately, since HOAs have to follow the Fair Housing Act, which
requires them to allow ESAs in the vast majority of circumstances. That
means that ESAs must be allowed in all HOA controlled areas: houses,
condos, and common areas.

The vast majority of states have similar provisions in their state Fair
Housing Acts, requiring HOAs to follow the federal Fair Housing Act
requirements related to ESAs. Here in NC, their emotional support animal
laws, protected under the Fair Housing Act, grant individuals with
disabilities the right to have emotional support animals in their homes
and common areas of housing complexes, regardless of any \'no pets\'
policy in their HOA. The FHA protects the right of people with
disabilities to keep ESAs, even when an HOA's policy explicitly
prohibits pets.

The subject can retain the services of an attorney who specializes in
ADA and FHA housing law and sue for violation of the state Fair Housing
Act, along with seeking compensation for retaliation, pain and
suffering, and anything else he can think of to tack on.
