Fascinating.

So it seems that you believe that prayer is something you do to get a
desired outcome, as if God is some sort of cosmic vending machine: you
put the money into the coin slot (prayer), you push the right
combination of buttons (finely-tuned prayer) and the item comes out the
little door at the bottom (the ideal item).

The question reveals that the questioner has a serious misunderstanding
of the purpose of prayer.

If you stop and think about it, God doesn't need us to pray. He already
knows everything we need. *So why do we pray?* Do we pray because we
hope to *influence* God to do something He wasn't going to already do?

Here's an example. Let's say we pray for God to heal someone who is
sick. If that person gets better, was it God who did it in response to
our prayer, or was that person just going to get better anyway, whether
we prayed or not? The truth is that there is no way to ever know.

So why bother? If we're not "changing God's mind" by praying, why do we
do it?

Primarily, we pray because He told us to. We are being obedient in
bringing our needs to Him, *even though He already knows our needs*.
Therefore, if we are commanded to pray, and He already knows what we
need, then clearly the prayer doesn't get us something we didn't already
have. ***It is the very act of prayer that God wants***. He wants to
hear from us, not because He doesn't know what we need, ***but because
He wants us to understand that we need Him.*** We submit to His will,
and we know that through Him all things are possible. Therefore, praying
is less about asking for something that we need, and is more about
acknowledging that He is the one who makes all things happen.

So does God ever do something in response to prayer? Absolutely! *But
not in the way you're thinking.*

Let's go back to the sick person. God knew, for all eternity, how that
sick person would end up. But at the same time, God knew, for all
eternity, whether you would pray for that sick person. So God took that
prayer into account when, for all eternity, He decided how to respond to
that prayer. So the prayer is not wasted. The prayer is definitely taken
into account, and God does not "change His mind" since He eternally knew
whether you would pray for them.

God generally answers prayer in one of four ways:

- **No**: God can say that what you are praying for is not what He wants
  for you, or what He wants for someone else, and so He *answers* your
  prayer with "no."
- **Slow**: God may say that what you are praying for ***is*** what He
  wants for you, or what He wants for someone else, but the ask is not
  in God's time for that thing to happen. You need to wait and continue
  to pray.
- **Grow**: God may say that what you are praying for is what He wants
  for you, or what He wants for someone else, but ***you are not
  ready*** for that thing to happen. Perhaps you need to *grow* more as
  a believer before you are ready to receive that prayer.
- **Go**: God may say that what you are praying for is what He wants for
  you, or what He wants for someone else, it is in His time, and you are
  ready to receive that prayer, and God does what you are asking.

So what have we learned? God is not a vending machine. God does not
"change His mind." But God does take our prayers into consideration.
