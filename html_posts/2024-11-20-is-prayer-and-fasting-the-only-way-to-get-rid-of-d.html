First, fasting is a great way to focus our prayer life and to get closer
to God, but it does not necessarily get rid of Satan's attacks. That may
be a result of fasting, but it is not the only way to achieve freedom
from Satan's attacks.

Let's talk about Satan and how we can defend ourselves against his
attacks.

> and what is the immeasurable greatness of his power toward us who

> Christ when he raised him from the dead and seated him at his right
> hand in the heavenly places, far above all rule and authority and

> 1:19--22 ESV

Paul says here that Jesus is seated at the right hand of God, the
ultimate seat of power and authority. Christ has dominion over
**everything**.

But check this out:

> and raised us up with him and seated us with him in the heavenly
> places in Christ Jesus, \-- Ephesians 2:6 ESV

*We* are seated *with Him in the heavenly places!* We are seated **far
above** Satan and the demons.

What does this mean? In short, **we have power over the demons.** As
adopted children of God, seated far above Satan in the heavenly places,
we have authority over the demons.

So how do we use this authority?

> Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee
> from you. \-- James 4:7 ESV

Submit to God and resist the devil. When you do this, he will flee from
you. As long as you are submitting to God when you resist Satan and his
minions, they have no choice but to flee from you.

Second, do not be afraid! In actuality, *it is Satan who is afraid!*
Satan and the demons are scared to death of Christians who understand
the magnitude of power and authority they have in Christ. In short,
Satan and the demons have no power over Christians except **what we give
them**. So don't give them any! Guard your mind, take every thought
captive, and focus on the truth.

How often do we have to do this? Do you have to keep checking every
thought and rebuking the enemy every minute of every day? Well, when you
walk in to a dark room, do you have to command the darkness to flee in
order to be able to see? No, you just turn on the light! So **don't
focus on the enemy; focus on the truth.** If you're a bank teller, you
don't recognize fake money by examining every example of fake money. You
recognize fake money because you have studied *the real thing*. Because
they know what the real thing looks like, they can spot the fake ones.
In the same way, our defense against Satan's attacks and false guidance
is *to know the truth*. Paul instructs us to focus on the truth:

> Finally, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever
> is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is
> commendable, if there is any excellence, if there is anything worthy
> of praise, think about these things. \-- Philippians 4:8 ESV

Hope this helps.
