Short answer: **That's not a fair statistical analysis to make because
people are not shot by police simply because they are a certain race,
regardless of their percentage in the population.**

Longer answer: You certainly can do a statistical analysis and compare
the probability *per capita* of being shot by police based on the number
of people shot by police of that race and then comparing that to the per
capita number of that race in the population. What you would find is
that Native American people are shot at the most alarmingly high rate
per capita, followed by Hispanics, blacks, and then whites. This is
solely because of their percentages in society.

But that doesn't tell the whole story.

In order to see who gets shot and why, you have to determine why people
get shot in the first place, and how many people of each race ***are
doing the things that would lead them to get shot.*** A more accurate
statistic is what percentage of each race *per capita* are committing
violent crimes which might lead them to be shot by police.

There are indeed statistical outliers in every group, but for the most
part, people get shot because they do things that lead police to shoot
them. They are usually involved in violent crimes. They usually respond
to the police with violence instead of compliance. And when you look at
those statistics, you might see some useful trends.

But it's considered taboo in today's society to talk about the reasons
why certain people act the way they do, and whose fault that is. It's
easiest to blame the police because they're on the other side of the
gun, but that doesn't tell the whole story either.

And to be fair, it's an answer for a different question than what was
posed here.
