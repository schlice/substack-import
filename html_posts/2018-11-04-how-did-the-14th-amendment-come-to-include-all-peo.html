**How did the 14th Amendment come to include all people born in the
United States when it was originally intended to give freed slaves and
ethnic Native Americans citizenship?**

Judicial misinterpretation and the beauty of case law.

Despite the best efforts of its apologists, and the ignorance of the
original meaning of the 14th Amendment as expressed by the writers, the
truth can't be silenced.

**The 14th Amendment was never intended to grant citizenship to the
children of illegal immigrants or tourists.**

How do we know this? Ask the writer of the 14th Amendment! Senator Jacob
Howard worked closely with Abraham Lincoln in drafting and passing the
13th Amendment (which abolished slavery). He also served on the Senate
Joint Committee on Reconstruction, which drafted the 14th Amendment. In
1866, Senator Howard clearly spelled out the intent of the 14th
Amendment by writing (emphasis mine):

> Every person born within the limits of the United States, and subject
> to their jurisdiction, is by virtue of natural law and national law a
> citizen of the United States. **This will not, of course, include
> persons born in the United States who are foreigners, aliens, who
> belong to the families of ambassadors or foreign ministers accredited
> to the Government of the United States**, but will include every other
> class of persons. It settles the great question of citizenship and
> removes all doubt as to what persons are or are not citizens of the
> United States. This has long been a great desideratum in the
> jurisprudence and legislation of this country.

I want you to note where Senator Howard says "This will not, ***of
course***, include persons born in the United States who are foreigners,
aliens..." This is important. This means that it was *well known* at the
time that children born to foreigners (i.e. people visiting the country
legally, but not citizens) **would not** be automatic US citizens. He
also says "aliens," which is the old, not-politically-correct term for
"illegal immigrants." He also lumps foreigners and aliens in with
children who are born to ambassadors or foreign ministers, two
categories of people that birthright citizenship activists actually
admit are not US citizens by birth. Why them and not foreigners? Why
them and not illegal aliens? Because they work for a foreign government?
Doesn't a foreigner owe allegiance to a foreign government? Doesn't an
illegal alien owe allegiance to a foreign government?

See, the original phrase in the 14th Amendment which is so frequently
overlooked and distorted with today's meaning, **and which actually
prevents birthright citizenship for anyone but citizens,** is "*subject
to the jurisdiction thereof*." That phrase meant something completely
different when the 14th Amendment was written than it does today:

> All persons born or naturalized in the United States, **and subject to
> the jurisdiction thereof**, are citizens of the United States and of
> the State wherein they reside.

In the late 1800s, this did not mean "subject to our laws." In fact,
court decisions later on determined who is "subject to our laws." The
*Plyler* decision determined that every person in the United States,
legal or illegal, is subject to most of the provisions of the
Constitution. But disingenuous people are using *Plyler,* to this day,
to argue that this also applies to the **whole 14th Amendment**, and
that every person who drops a kid on US soil is instantly a citizen,
when that was never the intention of the Amendment in the first place.
The phrase "subject to the jurisdiction thereof," in the late 1800s,
meant "to whom you owe allegiance." It meant to which nation you are a
subject. If you are not a US citizen, you do not owe allegiance to the
US; you are not subject to the jurisdiction of the US. I know it's hard
to wrap your head around because that's not what the phrase means today.
But that's what it meant in 1860. Remember that it was also written to
*exclude Native American children*, who were subject to the jurisdiction
of their tribe, not the US government. They became *tribe citizens*, not
US citizens.

Yes, the Constitution applies to everyone. But ***citizenship*** is
something that the government gets to determine, and that is separate
from whether or not the Constitution actually applies to a person.

The 14th Amendment was never intended to grant citizenship to children
of foreigners visiting on tourist visas, and it was never intended to
grant citizenship to children of illegal immigrants, and it was never
intended to grant citizenship to children of foreign ambassadors. As you
know, it was actually written to ensure that the children of freed
slaves were automatically citizens, in an effort to quash some of the
terrible aftermath of the *Dred Scot* decision. But it was also written
to ensure that citizens of Native American tribes were *not* citizens,
even though they were born in the US.

There is a case to be made that the Supreme Court should clarify the
meaning of "subject to the jurisdiction thereof" when it comes to
citizenship at birth. They should clarify whether it means that a
wealthy foreign couple can fly to the US on a tourist visa, have a
child, and fly home, and then 18 years later, that "anchor baby" can
return to the US (it's already a citizen) and sponsor the entire family
in to the US, bypassing the entire immigration waiting list. They should
clarify whether or not a pregnant woman can raft across the Rio Grande
and have a child on the US side of the river and it automatically be a
citizen. Because you crossed a river. Illegally.

These are problems ***unique to the United States***. You can't compare
our problems to any other country, because ***no other country has our
diversity, or our problems***. We, as the United States, need to correct
the problems we have, regardless of what the rest of the world does. The
world isn't even evenly split when it comes to birthright citizenship:
only 30 countries in the Western Hemisphere have birthright citizenship.
*But the United States is the only one people will flock to in order to
take advantage of that fact.*
