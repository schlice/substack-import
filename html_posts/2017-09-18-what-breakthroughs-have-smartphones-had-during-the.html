In actuality, **smartphones have not had any breakthroughs in the last
ten years.**

Not since the first iPhone was released and smartphone manufacturers
went away from physical keyboards to all-touch displays was there a
"breakthrough" in the smartphone industry.

Larger cameras, more cameras, better cameras, fingerprint readers, iris
readers, face readers, bigger screens, bezel-less screens,
brighter/flatter/rounder screens, etc. etc. are ***evolutionary***
changes, not ***revolutionary*** changes. The move from a physical
keyboard to an all-touch display was the biggest change in smartphones
in the past ten years. Everything else has been simply improving what we
already have.
