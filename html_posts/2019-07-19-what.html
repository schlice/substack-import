**What\'s your reaction to the U.S. Air Force telling the Washington
Post that the\"Facebook Storm Area 51\", cannot happen and that\" any
attempt to illegally access military installations is dangerous\"?**

The Air Force was telling the truth. You cannot storm Area 51.

This is a sign from the outer border of Area 51. The little inset sign
on the big one has little red words on the bottom which read: "Use of
deadly force is authorized." It's true. I used to work at another
Priority 1 non-nuclear facility: NORAD. We had the same signs. I carried
the guns.

The difference at Area 51 is that the actual facility is surrounded by
*thousands of acres of desert terrain,* which is all owned by the
government. Anyone even hanging around the outer border not in a common
public area will incur a visit by the local sheriff. Anyone entering the
outer border will be arrested.

But what about the base, you say? The closest you can get to the base on
public land is Tikaboo Peak, which is still 26 miles from the facility.
You'll have a long way to Naruto run before you even make it to the
fence. Same distance as a marathon, basically, but through the desert.
