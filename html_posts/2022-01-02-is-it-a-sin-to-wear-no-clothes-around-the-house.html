Let me try to give you a *complete* answer, or as complete as I can.

Nakedness, on its own, is not a sin. The only reason we are clothed at
all is due to Adam and Eve's sin in the first place. We were naked in
the Garden until Adam sinned, and then the first blood shed in the Bible
was God killing an animal to make clothes for them, because they were
naked (just as they were before), except this time, they knew it.

So it's not the nakedness that constitutes the sin. So then, what is it?

In the Western world, nakedness is often associated with sex and
sexuality. And this is the problem.

Whether you are alone or with someone else in the house, nakedness is
still associated with sexuality. Nakedness can lead others who visualize
you to have impure thoughts, even if they have no intention of having
them. They don't have to actively think about sex in order to experience
the impure thoughts. Nakedness could even lead *you* to have your own
impure thoughts, if you think about yourself naked or if you see
yourself naked.

Maybe you don't think like that, ever. Maybe your mind doesn't work that
way. You're lucky.

So while it is not directly a sin to simply be naked, nakedness could
lead *others* to impure thoughts; and at worst, nakedness could lead
*you* to impure thoughts.
