I will take the unpopular position and say **no**.

Rape is certainly difficult enough to deal with, regardless of who was
the rapist and who was the victim. It's infinitely harder to deal with
when a child is involved.

***But the simple fact is: there is a child involved.***

And the undeniable truth about the whole situation:

***Child support is not about the rape victim, or the rapist. Child
support is about the CHILD.***

Child support is awarded by the state in order to provide for a child.
The circumstances surrounding how the child was brought into this world
are **irrelevant** when determining child support. Child support is
given to the custodial parent by the non-custodial parent to support the
raising of the child.

It's very challenging to divest your feelings about how the child came
into the world when it comes to the awarding of child support. It's
almost unthinkable to consider the male victim of rape now having to pay
child support for the child that he unwillingly fathered. But the bottom
line is *you have a child, even if you didn't want to have a child. Even
if you didn't want to participate in the sex act that produced a child.
You now have a child for whom you are the biological father. No amount
of legal gyrations divests you of the physical reality that is the fact
that you are the biological father of that child.*

*Should that child suffer because you didn't want that child in the
first place?*

*Should that child suffer because that child was produced against your
will?*

*Should that child suffer because you were a rape victim?*

I will repeat my statement from above:

***Child support is not about the rape victim, or the rapist. Child
support is about the CHILD.***

Punish the rapist. Don't punish the child. Until such time as the state
develops a fund to raise children who are unintended consequences of
rapes, and raises taxes on all state citizens to cover that cost, the
first place you go to get money to raise a child is to the biological
parents of that child. Yes, it's unfair. But life isn't fair. And who is
responsible to raise that child that you made (albeit unwillingly)?

If you want to pass a law that makes it illegal to sue for child support
after a rape, you also have to pass a law that raises taxes on all state
residents to cover the child support costs of the child of a rape, and
it has to be unisex. Doesn't matter if a man raped a woman or a woman
raped a man. The custodial parent (or the guardian *ad litem*) can
receive child support from that fund to raise that child if the child is
a product of a rape.

Until that happens, then the non-custodial parent should pay child
support, even if he was the victim or perpetrator of a rape.

(EDIT) I want to add something. The article talks about statutory rape
where the male was underage (as in the scenario where a female teacher
has sex with one of her male students). In that scenario, the "victim"
was indeed a willing participant. I know in our discussions we're
talking about an unwilling male participant, and I believe that is a
corner case that should be addressed separately. In such a scenario,
forcing the male victim to pay child support for a child produced during
an unwilling and unwanted sexual assault isn't right, and state law
fails if it does not address this issue. However, my feelings are
different (and mirror my original answer) when the "victim" was willing,
but was unable to legally consent because of his age. The "victim" in
the article should absolutely pay child support.
