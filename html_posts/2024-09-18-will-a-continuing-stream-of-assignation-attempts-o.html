Unquestionably, this hurts the anti-Trump agenda. To see this lopsided
stream of assassination attempts (your guys' spell checkers are failing,
you btw) while both sides are engaged in inflammatory rhetoric is
indicative.

But Democrats don't seem to care, *because deep down, they truly believe
that Trump is an existential threat to democracy.*

*So deep down, they truly believe that assassination is a valid
response.*

You see it from the few who say the quiet things out loud, like [[Jack
Black's partner in "Tenacious D", Kyle
Gass](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=2f13fe&url=https://fox4kc.com/news/entertainment/jack-black-taking-break-from-tenacious-d-after-bandmates-trump-shooting-remark-i-was-blindsided/){.external_link

Remember this: **if democracy is** ***truly*** **on the line, then
assassination is** ***truly*** **a valid option.**

So if you're going to come out and say that you truly believe that Trump
is an existential threat to democracy, you cannot separate yourself from
the opinion that you are in favor of his assassination.
