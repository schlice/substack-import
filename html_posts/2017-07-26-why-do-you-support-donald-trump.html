To be fair, neither of the candidates we got are the ones I wanted.

But I like Trump.

At the end of the day, Trump, better than anyone else out there, is the
guy who might be able to actually pull off change in Washington. He is a
true outsider. He has never been in politics. He has only been in
business (which he is continually derided for). He has, arguably, been
successful in business. He uses the law to the benefit of his business.
So if you wanted someone who is a "Washington outsider," no one else who
was a candidate fit the bill. Fiorina was the only other candidate who
was close, but Trump talks tough and pulls no punches. Fiorina never
came across as tough enough compared to Trump.

And he loves this country.

He was willing to leave his business so that he could be denounced,
derided, and ridiculed for his orangeness on a daily basis. And yet he
did this willingly. Because at the end of the day, he loves America and
what it stands for. He truly believes he can make a difference.

Apparently, enough voters in enough states agreed.
