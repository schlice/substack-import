**A House transportation committee has concluded that the Trump inspired
lax regulatory environment at the FAA led to the 737 MAX fiasco. What
other Trump deregulations will come back to bite taxpayers,
corporations, etc in the butts?**

As usual, in an attempt to ***BLAME TRUMP FOR EVERYTHING BAD,*** you've
missed the facts.

There are absolutely problems at the FAA. A whistleblower complaint
published in September 2019 revealed that FAA inspectors were not
sufficiently qualified to "certify pilots or to assess pilot training"
for aircraft including the 737 Max. This is not a change that occurred
at the FAA beginning in 2016. This competency gap has been fomenting at
the agency for *decades*. You don't suddenly show up to work one day and
you're no longer competent.

Another significant factor in the crash is the little-known fact that
**aircraft makers can certify parts of their own designs with limited
FAA oversight.** That's because aircraft require thousands of
highly-skilled engineers to create them. You would need at least as many
to oversee everything that they do.

The aircraft manufacturers employ a process called the Organizational
Designation Authorization (ODA), which allows them to do just that. Did
Trump's administration write this? Nope, implemented in ***2005.*** And
who was it that implemented the ODA? Was it the President? Was it
Boeing? Nope, **it was Congress who mandated the FAA create the ODA**.
Fascinating that Congress is scratching its head now, after it created
the conditions which led to this disaster.

There were several other factors that also led to the Max issues with
the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS)-induced
crashes The problems at the FAA were only one of those.

And no, Trump didn't cause the problem. Government did, and it happened
long before Trump was in office.
