**Is Bhang legal in the USA?**

Bhang is a drink made from the cannabis plant, colloquially called
*marijuana* in the US.

Under Federal law, marijuana is on Schedule I of the Controlled
Substances Act and is therefore illegal to possess or use.

Some states have decriminalized marijuana possession for medical use,
and other states have decriminalized it for recreational use. So there
are some states in the US where Bhang can be made, but not everywhere.
