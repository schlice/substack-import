You can ask, but you\'re better off asking for a signing bonus rather
than RSUs that really aren\'t RSUs.

The whole point of RSUs is to give you stock without giving you stock.
It\'s an incentive to stay, because if you leave, any unvested RSUs go
away. It\'s an investment in your future, but it also is banking on the
company succeeding. It ensures you will do your part to make the company
profitable.

If you want money up front, you\'re looking for a signing bonus, or a
hiring bonus, not immediately-vesting RSUs.
