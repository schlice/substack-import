**If you were aware of the first plane hitting the tower before the
second one, what were your thoughts about it during the brief period
between the two attacks?**

I heard about the first plane as I stepped out of the shower that
morning. I thought it was possible, highly unlikely, but possible, that
it was an accident.

We put the news on, and we were watching the live broadcast when we
*saw* the second plane hit.

It was at that very moment that my mind (and the minds of millions of
others watching at that moment) made that leap from "this could have
been a tragic accident" to "this was clearly deliberate."
