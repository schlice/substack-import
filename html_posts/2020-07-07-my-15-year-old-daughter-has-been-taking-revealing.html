**My 15-year-old daughter has been taking revealing photos of herself
and they're showing up on my phone from iCloud. How do I address this to
her and should I be worried?**

on Quora. I know their search sucks, but try.

First, should you be worried? It depends on how revealing the revealing
photos are.

Child pornography is defined as "visual images of sexually explicit
conduct involving a minor (someone under 18)." The legal definition of
"sexually explicit conduct" does not require that an image depict a
child engaging in sexual activity. A picture of a naked child may
constitute illegal child pornography if it is sufficiently sexually
suggestive. Additionally, the age of consent for sexual activity in a
given state is irrelevant; any depiction of a minor under 18 years of
age engaging in sexually explicit conduct is illegal.

In short, if the revealing photos involve nudity, she could face charges
for distribution of child pornography, a Federal crime if someone in
another state gets hold of the pictures. You're talking [[15 to 30 in
Federal
prison](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=2dbd77&url=https://www.justice.gov/criminal-ceos/citizens-guide-us-federal-law-child-pornography){.external_link

qt-tooltip="justice.gov"}]{.qlink_container} for a child pornography
charge. If she's interested in spending the prime of her life in prison,
this is a good way to get there.

Even if the images are just underwear pictures, or "side-boob" pictures,
or other "toeing the line" kind of pictures, and they technically won't
land you in jail, once you post a picture on the Internet, it will stay
there forever. Future employers do scan social media profiles and do
reject applicants who they determine don't meet their standards. Eerily
creepy or not, that's what they do. It will be an interesting
conversation with her own children why these pictures exist on the
Internet.

I know this all sounds very "doom and gloom," but as a parent, this is
the one thing I absolutely took a hard line on with my kids. They would
have instantly lost all access to electronics or the Internet had they
done any of that. They knew my rule: no dick pics, period. No "send
nudes," period. If they wanted to pay for their own devices and risk the
jail time, that's on them, but on my devices that I pay for, that stuff
does not happen, period. That kind of thing just didn't become a
priority for them, because I restricted it. Don't worry, they found
plenty of other things to get them in trouble. Just not this.
