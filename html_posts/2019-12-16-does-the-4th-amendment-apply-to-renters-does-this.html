**Does the 4th Amendment apply to renters? Does this only apply to home
owners?**

The 4th Amendment protects citizens, keeping them secure from
unreasonable search in their "persons, houses, papers, and effects."

Your "house" is your domicile, wherever you live, be it a rented
apartment, townhome, condo, or single family home. Own or rent, the 4th
Amendment applies.

Clearly if you rent, there are certain things your landlord has the
right to do, such as access your apartment for maintenance with the
proper notification. But that doesn't constitute a government agent
performing an unreasonable search.
