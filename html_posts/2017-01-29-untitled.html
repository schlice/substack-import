You're headed in the right direction, and it sounds like your mind is in
the right state, so I'm afraid I don't have any constructive advice for
you other than keep doing what you're doing. You've found what doctors
found, surprisingly, not too long ago, that exercise and muscle-building
exercises actually improves MS symptoms, where just 15 to 20 years ago
(not all that long at all, medically speaking) doctors were advising MS
patients to work out less, because they were more concerned about the
after-effects of heating up the body. Thankfully, they've learned what
we already know: working out makes you feel *better*, not worse.

I'd also consider adding a nutritionist to your care team. So many
people don't have a registered dietitian as part of their care team, and
I think they miss a fundamental function by not including that aspect as
well. It might be something you could benefit from. Your physical
therapist, unless they are quite unique, probably won't fill the bill.

I actually added an eastern medicine-trained chiropractor to my care
team. He has added acupuncture and hyperbaric oxygen therapy to my
treatment plan, along with some, er, interesting herbal choices, but
it's a great addition to my plan. His holistic approach balances out the
very western medicine-oriented remainder of my care team.
