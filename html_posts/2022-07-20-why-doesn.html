What gave you the idea that he *should*?

Is there something in Scripture which says that God will skip along in
front of his believers with his great cosmic leaf-blower, clearing our
path through life from any unpleasantness?

Seriously, what ever caused you to believe that being a Christian meant
a trouble-free life?

*Because the Bible says otherwise.* That's right, the Bible tells us to
*expect* the hard times, because they will come. Jesus told His
disciples that they should anticipate suffering. He said, "I have told
you these things, so that in me you may have peace. In this world you
will have trouble. But take heart! I have overcome the world" (John
16:33). Paul wrote, "In all our troubles my joy knows no bounds. For
when we came into Macedonia, this body of ours had no rest, but we were
harassed at every turn---conflicts on the outside, fears within" (2 Cor.
7:4-5). Peter left no doubt about difficulties in this Christian life
when he wrote, "Dear friends, do not be surprised at the painful trial
you are suffering, as though something strange were happening to you.
But rejoice that you participate in the sufferings of Christ, so that
you may be overjoyed when His glory is revealed" (1 Pet. 4:12-13).

This is the consistent, unequivocal expectation we have been given by
the biblical writers, and yet we seem determined to rewrite the text.
Why? From where have we gotten this notion that God will take all our
troubles away?

Don't get me wrong, sometimes God intercedes in our lives. Sometimes he
does so greatly. And other times, when we call on him, he simply
responds with "trust me, be patient" (I've gotten that message before).

And trying to understand why is really difficult, because God's mind is
so much greater than ours. The Bible is exceedingly clear about this
point as well. Solomon wrote in Proverbs 25:2, "It is the glory of God
to conceal a matter. . . ." Isaiah 45:15 states, "Truly You are a God
who hides Himself." First Corinthians 2:11 says, "No one knows the
thoughts of God except the Spirit of God." Deuteronomy 29:29 reads, "The
secret things belong to the Lord our God" (NKJV). Ecclesiastes 11:5
proclaims, "As you do not know the path of the wind, or how the body is
formed in a mother's womb, so you cannot understand the work of God, the
Maker of all things." Isaiah 55:8-9 teaches, "'For My thoughts are not
your thoughts, neither are your ways My ways,' declares the Lord. 'As
the heavens are higher than the earth, so are My ways higher than your
ways and My thoughts than your thoughts.'"

Clearly, Scripture tells us we lack the capacity to grasp God's infinite
mind or the way he intervenes in our lives. How arrogant of us to think
otherwise. Trying to analyze his omnipotence is like an baby in the womb
attempting to comprehend the splendor of God's creation. Romans 11:33
(NKJV) indicates that God's judgments are "unsearchable" and his ways
"past finding out." Similar language is found in 1 Corinthians 2:16:
"Who has known the mind of the Lord that he may instruct Him?" Unless
the Lord chooses to explain himself to us, which he does not often do,
his motivation and purposes are beyond the reach of humans.

But he has promised good for us, and he has kept every one of his
promises. "'For I know the plans I have for you,' says the Lord, 'plans
to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a
future.'" (Jeremiah 29:11 NIV).

I heard it said once that "Christians don't have a death wish, but they
do have an exit strategy." So rather than wondering about why God
doesn't take away your diseases, rejoice that God has given us the
greatest exit strategy for this life than anyone else ever could. And
only he could do it. Remember Jesus' words: "In this world, you will
have trouble. But take heart! I have overcome the world."
