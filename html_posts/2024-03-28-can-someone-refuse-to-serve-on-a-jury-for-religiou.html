In some jurisdictions, seated politicians can be disqualified from jury
service. There are no religious objections to jury service that I am
aware of, so it's unlikely that you would be disqualified from jury
service due to religious reasons.

However, a person who holds strong religious or political views may be
*excused* from serving on a particular jury during an interview process
called *voire dire.* Potential jurors are questioned by the judge and
the attorneys to assess their suitability to serve on a jury. They
determine, among other things specific to each case, whether or not they
can be impartial, even if they disagree (religiously or politically)
with what the accused is accused of doing.

Someone participating in *voire dire* can voice their religious or
political reasoning during that time, and if the judge and/or the
attorneys agree, that person can be excused from that jury.

But there is no *permanent* excusal for religious or political reasons
that I'm aware of in any jurisdiction.
