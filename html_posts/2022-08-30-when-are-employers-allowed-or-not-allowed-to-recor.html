Since your question is a little thin on details, I'll assume by "record"
you mean with video cameras, in common spaces (not private spaces like
changing rooms or bathrooms).

First of all, they are not recorded without their consent. Entering the
protected facility (i.e. the space where cameras are in use) means that
you have read and agreed to the rules of that space, which clearly state
that cameras are in use. Therefore, by you entering that space, you
imply that you read and understood the rules, and that you would be
recorded, and you consent to such recording.

Same holds true for your Internet usage at work, and your phone calls
while using a company phone line. For your Internet, you signed a usage
agreement when you hired on, which includes your usage of any technology
(computers, telephones, etc).

None of it is done "without your consent."

Why do companies monitor you? They have a right to protect their assets,
and their usage of their assets. They also have a right to ensure that
company confidential information is not being misused or stolen. They
have the right to make sure that their assets are not being misused.
