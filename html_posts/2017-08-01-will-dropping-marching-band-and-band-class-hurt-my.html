The answer is "it depends."

Take a look at the [[Academy Admissions
website](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=60e33c&url=https://www.academyadmissions.com/){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="academyadmissions.com"}]{.qlink_container}. There's a
truckload of information on that site which explains how the admissions
process works. It says:

> *To gain admission to the United States Air Force Academy, you must
> strive to supply your best possible performance regarding each
> admissions requirement and at each application step. Your performance
> on all admissions factors combine to create your overall competitive
> standing amongst prospective students, or cadets, and may lead to an
> offer of appointment to the Academy.*
>
> *A Selection Panel, composed of a cross section of senior Academy
> staff, reviews each completed admissions file according to our
> admissions guidelines. The quantitative admissions factors reviewed by
> the panel are your Weighted (Objective) Composite score, which is
> derived from your Academic Composite and Extracurricular Composite
> scores. The panel also evaluates qualitative components of your
> application to assess each candidate's motivation and potential for
> success at the Academy and future performance as an Air Force officer
> of character.*
>
> *It is in this qualitative review that Character Assessment items such
> as your writing sample and Academy Liaison Officer Interview as well
> as your Fitness Assessment and everything else in the admissions file
> is considered in evaluating the "whole person." The assignment of a
> Selection Panel Rating to each file is the final step in the selection
> process and occurs as soon as your file is complete (note that your
> Medical Evaluation and your Nominations can still be pending). Your
> Selection Panel Rating combines with your other scores to derive your
> Selection Composite score.*
>
> *Your scores are used to derive your overall competitive standing
> amongst applicants. Note that strong academic qualifications alone are
> not enough to make you competitive for appointment to the Academy.
> Conversely, if your academic qualifications are not extremely high,
> you may have the potential to become competitive through the remaining
> qualifying factors. The relative weighting of the scores that go into
> your overall competitive standing are:*
>
> - *Academic Composite: 50%*
> - *Extracurricular Composite: 20%*
> - *Selection Composite: 30%*
>
> *After review of the entire file, the selection panel will also make a
> qualitative/holistic recommendation on admission. This recommendation
> is considered along with the Selection Composite, the needs of the Air
> Force and any legislative requirements in selecting individuals for
> appointment.*

If you haven't done so, review that website. Check out the
[[Extracurriculur
Composite](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=b8d301&url=https://www.academyadmissions.com/admissions/the-application-process/extracurricular-activities/){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="academyadmissions.com"}]{.qlink_container} and what goes
into it. You may be able to drop band and still be okay in terms of your
EC score.

This would be a perfect question to ask your ALO. What, you don't have
an ALO yet? An ALO is an **Admissions Liaison Officer** who will guide
you through the entire admissions process. Check the [[ALO
Locator](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=3baf43&url=https://www.academyadmissions.com/admissions/outreach-programs/find-your-admissions-liaison-officer/){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="academyadmissions.com"}]{.qlink_container} on the admissions
website to find your ALO.

Good luck!
