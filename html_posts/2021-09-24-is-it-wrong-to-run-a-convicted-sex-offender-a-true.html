100% wrong. It's both illegal and immoral.

This doesn't mean you get to be blissfully unaware of that person's
whereabouts. It doesn't mean they get to live next door to a school.
There are plenty of rules which they have to follow as a person on the
sex offender registry. But we are not unaware of their presence, and
they fully know that.

They know that every single person in a 10 mile radius knows who they
are and exactly where they live. They will spend the rest of their lives
under a microscope. I suspect that most people simply look at them with
derision instead of trying to run them out of town with threats of
violence. Threatening someone, even someone on the registry, is a crime,
and now you are the aggressor, not the offender.

They served their time. They are allowed to live, and they have to live
somewhere. Running them out of town just sends them to someone else's
town, and there is nothing morally acceptable about NIMBY.
