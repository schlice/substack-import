**Would anyone in the Justice Dept have the authority to stop an
indictment from the Mueller probe grand jury?**

There's a lot of non-starters that have to happen before the Justice
Department would even have the opportunity to stop an indictment.

First, the Special Counsel would have to convene a grand jury. The only
reason they would do this is to see if charges are warranted. However,
it's fairly Constitutionally certain that you can't indict a sitting
president, so the purpose of such a grand jury is dubious at best. Yes,
I know, no one has ever tried to indict a sitting president, but if you
look at it from a Constitutional standpoint, then it's highly likely
that you cannot indict a sitting president.

So let's assume for a moment that the Special Counsel's office *does*
convene a grand jury, and they file an indictment. Trump's attorneys
would most definitely object to the indictment, stating that a sitting
president cannot be indicted, and must have a Constitutional remedy
applied (impeachment, removal from office, etc). The Justice Department
is not really in the loop if the Special Counsel's office convenes a
grand jury, and they indict.
