<h2>Answer Comment</h2>

**Content:** [Shootings are never taken lightly. Shootings are fully
investigated, and if officers were not in fear for their lives, they
will then be in fear for their careers, or facing jail time.\
\
But if I told someone to get on the ground and they said I have bad
knees, I can\'t get down there, and I could see that their hands were
empty, I\'d still consider them a threat because I could imagine lots of
situations where people have used \"fake\" medical conditions to avoid
compliance.\
\
The fact that they couldn\'t get down would not justify shooting them.
The fact that they acted threatening and posed a real threat would. If
they said they had trouble moving and then started lunging at people
with a sharpened screwdriver, I think I wouldn\'t believe the whole \"I
can\'t move\" thing.\
\
That\'s where common sense comes into play.]{.rendered_qtext}
