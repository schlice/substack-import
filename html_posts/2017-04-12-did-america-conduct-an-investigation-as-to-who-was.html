We didn't have to "assume" that it was al-Qaeda behind the attacks. The
evidence was pretty clear and was corroborated by the rest of the world.
We determined it was al-Qaeda based on good, old-fashioned police work.
And while he initially denied it, Osama bin Laden eventually claimed
full responsibility for the attack.

However, we knew it was them before they admitted it.

A quick look at Wikipedia gives the complete timeline:

> For several months after the 9/11 attacks, no one, nor any group,
> claimed responsibility for the attacks, so the primary responsibility
> fell solely upon the hijackers, all of whom were killed and all of
> whom left no message or any claim of responsibility, explaining why
> they had carried out the attacks. As the media covered the 9/11
> attacks unfolding, many quickly speculated that bin Laden was behind
> the attacks. On the day of the attacks, the National Security Agency
> intercepted communications that pointed to bin Laden, as did German
> intelligence agencies. This helped rule out other immediate suspects,
> such as Croatian nationalists, who had bombed Grand Central Terminal
> on September 11, 1976.
