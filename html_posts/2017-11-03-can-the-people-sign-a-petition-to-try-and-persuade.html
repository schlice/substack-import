*Can* the people sign a petition to try and persuade a judge to sentence
a terrorist to death penalty? **Yes**, people can sign any sort of
petition they want to say anything they want to say.

Is it likely to make any difference? **No**, it is not.

Why?

Because despite what "the people" may want, ***the judge does not use
"petitions" in determining sentencing.*** The judge will follow the law
when it comes to sentencing. Additionally, in most states which permit
capital punishment, there is an extra level of "protection" against
abuse: After the guilty verdict and before sentencing, the jury must
also decide whether or not the death penalty will be authorized in that
particular case. It is not authorized in every case. If the death
penalty is sought, and the verdict in the crime which allows the death
penalty is guilty, the jury will then have to decide if the death
penalty will be authorized.

Most crimes have enumerated punishments listed directly within the same
statute that defines the crime. If the person is found guilty of that
crime, the judge imposes the sentence listed in the statute. Some
statutes may read something along the lines of, "Violations of this
statute constitute a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine not to exceed
\$500, imprisonment not to exceed 30 days, or both." This means that the
judge can assign any fine up to \$500, any amount of incarceration up to
30 days, or both the fine and the incarceration.

So the judge has some leeway in his final determination of sentence. At
this point, he uses *mitigating circumstances* or *aggravating
circumstances* to determine where along the range of punishments offered
the defendant's punishment should fall. Some mitigating or aggravating
factors that a judge may consider:

- whether the offender is a \"first-time\" or repeat offender,
- whether the offender was an accessory (helping the main offender) or
  the main offender,
- whether the offender committed the crime under great personal stress
  or duress,
- whether anyone was hurt, and whether the crime was committed in a
  manner that was unlikely to result in anyone being hurt,
- whether the offender was particularly cruel to a victim, or
  particularly destructive, vindictive, etc.
- (sometimes) whether the offender is genuinely contrite or
  remorseful.[\[1\]](#mLTsG){#cite-mLTsG .citation_link}

Finally, the Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure requires that the
attorney for the defendant speak on behalf of the defendant before a
sentence is declared. The court will also usually give the defendant an
opportunity to make any statement if he chooses. In most states, the
prosecutor (the representative of the state) also has an opportunity to
similarly speak on behalf of "the people." In some states, the families
of the victims or of the survivors may also have an opportunity to
address the court and recommend leniency or strictness in sentencing.

The judge will use all of this information to determine the final
sentence.

Therefore, the "petition" you sign has no bearing on whether or not the
judge imposes the death penalty.

So what should you do? **Send your petition to the prosecutor.**
Whichever agency is prosecuting the terrorist should be the recipient of
your petition. If there was any doubt as to whether or not to seek the
death penalty as opposed to life in prison without parole, your petition
may help the prosecution decide.
