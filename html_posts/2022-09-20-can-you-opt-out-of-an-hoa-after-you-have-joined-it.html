Depends on the type of HOA.

If it came with the house (i.e. it's tied to the deed), then it's a
*mandatory* HOA. You can't leave it by any means, other than:

- selling your house, or
- dissolving the HOA (which is difficult, time-consuming, and not-free)

If you joined it after you moved in, it's a *voluntary* HOA, and you can
leave following whatever procedure the HOA has established for people to
cancel their membership.

Original question:

Can you ever leave an HOA once you\'re in?
