In order for God to "wonder" something, there would have to be a time
when God did not know something, then God would have to "wonder"
something, and then God might have a different answer after the
wondering.

However, *God is not subject to time*, so there is no "before the
wondering," there is no "time of wondering" and there is no "after the
wondering." There just **is**. For God, all is now. The past is now. Now
is now. The future is now.

Additionally, God cannot "wonder" in the way you are positing because
that would indicate that there is something that God does not know, and
then He ponders it.

This is the danger when we think of God using man's physical
limitations. God cannot wonder in this way because doing so subjects God
to the limitations of time and limited knowledge. God is not limited in
either way.
