It\'s a judgment call. Cops make those judgment calls all the time. Most
times they make them correctly, but sometimes they don\'t get them
right. Most times they do get them right.

If there were no witnesses and no video, it\'s his word against yours
anyway, so it comes down to whose story is more plausible, who has a
cleaner record, who has a better lawyer, etc. You may both get arrested
at that point, and the cops just say let the lawyers sort it out.
