**Will history view handing out cell phones to children in the same
light as including cigarettes in military rations?**

Only when they can show that cell phones cause cancer in children, or
when they can show that the "cell phone lobby" was preventing the
scientific studies from being presented to the public in order to
maintain that childhood addiction to cell phones.

They've been working with the likes of Snapchat and Instagram to keep
kids hooked, too.
