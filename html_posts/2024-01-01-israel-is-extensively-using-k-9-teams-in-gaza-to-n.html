You don't have to be Muslim to be terrified of a K-9.

I should know. I used to be a "chew toy" for the K-9s during training.
They bite. They bite *hard*. They **hit** *hard*. And then they don't
let go until their handler tells them to.

And even in training, even with a training sleeve under my uniform,
*it's still terrifying*.

I'd hate to actually be on the receiving end of our "fur missiles."
