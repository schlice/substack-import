**Content:** [In the military, you are basically \"under contract\" to
work for them, and a \"breach\" of that contract can get you separated.
If you don\'t meet military standards, you can be separated. Normally as
a civilian, you are an \"at will\" employee, and if either the employer
or you don\'t want to work there anymore, you can leave.\
\
There is substantial financial investment in training an individual in
the military services. Generally, the services are required to opt for
rehabilitation before separation, which civilian employers are not
required to do. Basically, the bar for \"being fired\" in the civilian
world is much lower than the bar for being separated from active
military service.\
\
There are two types of separations one can be awarded: punitive
discharges, or administrative separations. Punitive discharges can only
be awarded by court-martial (regular or special) and are either
dishonorable (general court martial) or bad conduct (general or special
court martial). These are the biggies, and are things that you would
normally be arrested for, and could potentially be tried in civilian
courts for as well.\
\
Administrative separations occur much more frequently, as all honorable
discharges are an administrative separation. Enlisted personnel can be
separated with a *characterization of service* (characterized
separation) or *description of separation* (uncharacterized separation)
depending on the facts of the particular case. For example, an
uncharacterized separation would be someone who has served for less than
180 days (i.e. leaves from Basic Training). This is considered an
\"Entry Level Separation\" and there is no characterization of service
at all.\
\
Administrative separations contain a characterization and a basis. The
*basis* is the reason for which a person is being administratively
separated. Many things such as weight control, pattern of misconduct,
convenience of the government for parenthood, completion of required
military service, etc. can be a basis for separation. Included with the
basis will be a characterization of service which refers to a quality of
the individual\'s military service. Characterizations can be one of
three: Honorable, General, or Under Other Than Honorable Conditions
(UOTHC). The character of one\'s departure from the military has many
consequences, from ability to receive retired pay to re-entry into
another service to receiving VA benefits or educational assistance.\
\
As long as a member\'s conduct meets the military\'s requirements for
normal conduct and their job performance meets standards, the discharge
will be Honorable. Members will be entitled to all post-separation
benefits, and will also be permitted to re-enlist in another service (if
available).\
\
General (Under Honorable Conditions) discharges occur when a military
member\'s job performance outweighs the positive aspects of their
military record, or a military member\'s conduct outweighs the positive
aspects of their job performance. Members will likely be able to get VA
benefits, but will not be able to get educational benefits. They also
will not be able to re-enlist in another service.\
\
UOTHC discharges usually occur when there are significant departures
from normal military conduct which don\'t rise to the level of
court-martial, or have not been frequent or severe enough to rise to the
level of court-martial. Acts or omissions that endanger military members
or the United States would generally be considered for OTH discharges.
In most cases, the member will not be able to get VA benefits, and will
not be able to re-enlist in another service.]{.rendered_qtext}
