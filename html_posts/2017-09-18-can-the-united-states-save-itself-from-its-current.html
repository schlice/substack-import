I suppose you would have to believe that the United States is currently
undergoing some form of "political death" in order for it to "save
itself" from said death.

I see no evidence of this "death" you speak of. Our political system is
alive and (somewhat) healthy. Certainly, there are things that need to
be changed. We need Congressional term limits. We need a Balanced Budget
amendment. We need better border security. We need to allow DREAMers to
stay in country without allowing them all the rights and privileges of
citizens (i.e. voting), until they *become* citizens.

Sheesh, it almost seems like the vast majority of problems in this
country are Congress' fault, doesn't it?
