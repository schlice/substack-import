I feel like everyone is dancing around the elephant in the room:

**transubstantiation**

In the Catholic Mass, the bread and wine are prayed over, and they are
supposed to become the *actual body and blood* of Christ, even though
they retain the look of bread and wine.

Catholics use several Scriptural verses to reinforce this teaching:

- [[Matt.
  26:28](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=95cbb0&url=http://biblia.com/bible/nasb95/Matt.%252026.28){.external_link
  rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
  onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
  qt-tooltip="biblia.com"}]{.qlink_container}, \"for this is My blood of
  the covenant, which is poured out for many for forgiveness of sins.\"
- [[John
  6:52-53](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=1392ad&url=http://biblia.com/bible/nasb95/John%25206.52-53){.external_link
  rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
  onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
  qt-tooltip="biblia.com"}]{.qlink_container}, \"The Jews therefore
  began to argue with one another, saying, How can this man give us His
  flesh to eat? 53 Jesus therefore said to them, \'Truly, truly, I say
  to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink His
  blood, you have no life in yourselves.\'\"
- [[1 Cor.
  11:27](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=8f390e&url=http://biblia.com/bible/nasb95/1%2520Cor.%252011.27){.external_link
  rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
  onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
  qt-tooltip="biblia.com"}]{.qlink_container}, \"Therefore whoever eats
  the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner, shall
  be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord.\"

However, there are several biblical arguments against the practice:

[[*CARM.org*](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=73f019&url=https://www.carm.org){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="carm.org"}]{.qlink_container}*)*

**1. There is no indication that the words were meant to be literal.**

Nowhere in scripture do we find this teaching. We see scriptures refer
to the elements as the body and blood, but we also see Jesus clearly
stating that the words He was speaking were spiritual words: \"It is the
Spirit who gives life; the flesh profits nothing; the words that I have
spoken to you are spirit and are life,\" ([[John
6:63](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=e973c4&url=http://biblia.com/bible/nasb95/John%25206.63){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="biblia.com"}]{.qlink_container}). He did not say they were
literal words; that is, He did not say that they were His actual body
and blood.

But, a Catholic might object and say that Jesus clearly said, \"This is
My blood\...\" and \"This is my body\...\" This is true, but Jesus
frequently spoke in spiritual terms: \"I am the bread of life,\" ([[John
6:48](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=336ba0&url=http://biblia.com/bible/nasb95/John%25206.48){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="biblia.com"}]{.qlink_container}); \"I am the resurrection
and the life,\" ([[John
11:25](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=3b5238&url=http://biblia.com/bible/nasb95/John%252011.25){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="biblia.com"}]{.qlink_container}); \"I am the true vine,\"
([[John
15:1](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=b0ba41&url=http://biblia.com/bible/nasb95/John%252015.1){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="biblia.com"}]{.qlink_container}), etc. Jesus often spoke in
figurative terms and in the context of Jesus telling His disciples that
they must eat His body and blood, He clearly says He was speaking in
spiritual terms, \"\...the words that I have spoken to you are spirit
and are life,\" ([[John
6:63](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=e973c4&url=http://biblia.com/bible/nasb95/John%25206.63){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="biblia.com"}]{.qlink_container}).

After Jesus said, \"This is my blood,\" ([[Matt.
26:28](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=95cbb0&url=http://biblia.com/bible/nasb95/Matt.%252026.28){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="biblia.com"}]{.qlink_container}), He said, \"But I say to
you, I will not drink of this fruit of the vine from now on until that
day when I drink it new with you in My Father's kingdom,\" ([[Matt.
26:29](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=2a8b44&url=http://biblia.com/bible/nasb95/Matt.%252026.29){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="biblia.com"}]{.qlink_container}). Why would Jesus speak
figuratively of His blood as \"the fruit of the vine\" if it was His
literal blood? We can clearly see that Jesus was speaking figuratively.

**2. There is no indication the disciples thought the elements changed**

There is no indication in the biblical accounts of the Last Supper that
the disciples thought that the bread and wine changed into the actual
body and blood of Christ. There simply isn\'t any indication of this.
Should we say that the disciples who were sitting right there with
Jesus, actually thought that what Jesus was holding in his hands was his
own body and blood? That would be ridiculous.

**3. There is no indication the disciples worshipped the elements**

We see no indication at all that the disciples worshipped the elements.
The adoration of the Eucharist is practiced during the Mass. Catholicism
says, \"Moreover, the Catholic Church has held firm to this belief in
the presence of Christ\'s Body and Blood in the Eucharist not only in
her teaching but in her life as well, since she has at all times paid
this great Sacrament the worship known as \"latria,\" which may be given
to God
alone.\"[[1](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=13456f&url=http://carm.org/transubstantiation%23footnote1_ndr89ec){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="carm.org"}]{.qlink_container} Where is the worship given the
sacrament by the disciples anywhere in the New Testament? It is not
there.

**4. The supper was instituted before Jesus\' crucifixion**

The Mass is supposed to be a reenactment of the sacrifice of Christ.
Therefore, according to Roman Catholic theology, the bread and wine
become broken body and shed blood of Christ and represent the
crucifixion ordeal. But how can this be since Jesus instituted the
Supper before He was crucified? Are we to conclude that at the Last
Supper, when they were all at the table, that when Jesus broke the bread
it actually became His sacrificial body \-- even though the sacrifice
had not yet happened? Likewise are we to conclude that when Jesus gave
the wine that it became His actual sacrificial blood \-- even though the
sacrifice had not yet happened? That would make no sense at all.

**5. The Roman Catholic view is a violation of Levitical law**

The Roman Catholic interpretation of the Eucharist requires the
participant to eat human flesh and drink human blood. Remember, Roman
Catholicism teaches that the bread and the wine become the actual body
and blood of Christ. Essentially, this amounts to cannibalism. What does
the Scripture say concerning this?

\"For as for the life of all flesh, its blood is identified with its
life. Therefore I said to the sons of Israel, You are not to eat the
blood of any flesh, for the life of all flesh is its blood; whoever eats
it shall be cut off,\" ([[Lev.
17:14](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=a609e0&url=http://biblia.com/bible/nasb95/Lev.%252017.14){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="biblia.com"}]{.qlink_container}).

Notice that the scripture says that you are not to eat the blood of any
flesh. It would certainly appear that the Roman Catholic view is in
contradiction to the Old Testament scripture since it advocates the
eating of the blood of Christ. To the RCC it is not just symbolic, it is
the actual eating and drinking of the body of Christ.

**6. It is a violation of the incarnation**

The biblical doctrine of the incarnation states that the Word which was
God and was with God ([[John
1:1](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=148c83&url=http://biblia.com/bible/nasb95/John%25201.1){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="biblia.com"}]{.qlink_container}), became flesh and dwelt
among us ([[John
1:14](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=9fa1c5&url=http://biblia.com/bible/nasb95/John%25201.14){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="biblia.com"}]{.qlink_container}). This \"became flesh\"
involves what is known as "the Hypostatic Union." This is the teaching
that in the one person of Christ are two natures: divine and human. That
is, Jesus is both God and man at the same time and He will forever be
God and man.

Furthermore, by definition, for Jesus to be human He must be located in
one place. This is the nature of being human. A human male does not have
the ability to be omnipresent. He can only be in one place at one time.
To say that Jesus in His physical form is in more than one place at a
time, is to deny the incarnation. That is, it denies that Jesus is
completely and totally a man \-- since a man can only be it one place at
one time. Therefore, to say that the bread and wine become the body and
blood of Christ is to violate the doctrine of the incarnation by stating
that Christ is physically present all over the planet as the mass is
celebrated. This is a serious problem and a serious denial of the true
and absolute incarnation of the Word of God as a man.

But, did not Jesus say in [[Matt.
28:18-20](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=2f2e8f&url=http://biblia.com/bible/nasb95/Matt.%252028.18-20){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="biblia.com"}]{.qlink_container} that He would be with the
disciples always, even to the ends of the earth? Is this not a
declaration that Jesus will be physically present everywhere? No, this
is not what is stated.

The answer is found in the teaching of the communicatio idiomatum. This
is the teaching that the attributes of both the divine and human nature
are ascribed to the single person of Christ. It does not mean, however,
that anything particular to the divine nature was communicated to the
human nature. Likewise, it does not mean that anything particular to the
human nature was communicated to the divine nature. It means that the
attributes of the divine nature are claimed by the person of Christ.
Therefore, Jesus is omnipresent, not in His human nature, but in His
divine nature.

To make this more clear, let\'s look at some verses that illustrate the
communicatio idiomatum:

- [[John
  17:5](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=c25d22&url=http://biblia.com/bible/nasb95/John%252017.5){.external_link
  rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
  onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
  qt-tooltip="biblia.com"}]{.qlink_container}, \"And now, glorify Thou
  Me together with Thyself, Father, with the glory which I had with Thee
  before the world was.\"
- [[John
  3:13](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=3458d2&url=http://biblia.com/bible/nasb95/John%25203.13){.external_link
  rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
  onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
  qt-tooltip="biblia.com"}]{.qlink_container},\"And no one has ascended
  into heaven, but He who descended from heaven, even the Son of Man.\"

Please notice that in these two verses, Jesus lays claim to the glory
that He had with the Father before the foundation of the world. He also
claims to have descended from heaven, but how could these be true since
He is a man? The answer is because the attributes of the divine nature
are claimed by the person of Christ. Therefore, the person of Christ
could claim to have glory with the Father and could claim to descend
from heaven. But we know that the man Jesus, in the flesh, did not exist
until His conception. Furthermore, this means that the two natures of
Christ are distinct, yet they are in Union in the one person of Christ
(the hypostatic union). It further means that the attributes of the
divine and the attributes of the human are not transferred to one
another \-- the divine does not become localized and the human does not
become infinite. If this were the case, then the nature of the divine
and the nature of the human will be violated. Therefore, we can see that
for Jesus to be a man, He must retain the attributes of humanity. This
means that He must be localized and it means He cannot be physically
omnipresent. If He were, by definition He would not be a man. But the
Roman Catholic position is that the bread and wine become the actual
body and blood of Christ and this violates the doctrine of the
incarnation. Therefore, transubstantiation cannot be the correct
teaching of Scripture.

**7. The Lord\'s Supper is not a sacrifice of Christ**

The Bible tells us:

\"By this will we have been sanctified through the offering of the body
of Jesus Christ once for all. 11 And every priest stands daily
ministering and offering time after time the same sacrifices, which can
never take away sins; 12 but He, having offered one sacrifice for sins
for all time, sat down at the right hand of God, 13 waiting from that
time onward until His enemies be made a footstool for His feet. 14 For
by one offering He has perfected for all time those who are sanctified"
([[Heb.
10:10-14](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=1a6f61&url=http://biblia.com/bible/nasb95/Heb.%252010.10-14){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="biblia.com"}]{.qlink_container}).

In the Roman Catholic Mass, there is a sacrifice of Christ. In other
words, in the ceremonies, is a reenactment and an actual sacrifice of
Christ per the Mass. This is an obvious contradiction to the Scriptures
which teach us that Christ died once for all and that by the one
offering He has perfected for all time those who are sanctified. It does
not state in the Word of God that the sacrifice of Christ must be
repeated in order to forgive us of our sins or somehow help us to
maintain our salvation by the infusion of grace. The fact that Christ
died once and the sacrifice occurred once, is proof that it is
sufficient to cleanse us of our sins. We connect with the sacrifice of
Christ by faith, not by a ceremony.

Finally, because the sacrifice of Christ was once for all, it is
sufficient to save us and we do not need to maintain our salvation by
our efforts or by our participation in the Lord\'s supper. It is not a
means of grace that secures our salvation or infuses into us the grace
needed that then enables us to maintain our salvation by our works.
Instead, we are made right before God by faith.
