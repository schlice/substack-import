**Is it illegal if I put boards with nails in my side yard to get who is
even driving through my yard?**

It's questionable whether or not the nails would be considered a "booby
trap" (some states may see it differently) but even without that legal
distinction, it's universally a very bad idea. The nails are designed to
disable a vehicle's tires, much like a spike strip. However, police
spike strips actually insert small metal tubes into the tire, deflating
it slowly (at least, that's how it's designed).

Let's say you put your nail boards in the side yard and a car drove
through and lost control and smashed into a tree, killing the passenger.
I'm sorry to say that you'd be on the hook for criminally negligent
homicide.

There are much better ideas for controlling the vehicle traffic through
your side yard. You could put landscaping on one side to prevent
vehicles from driving through. You can put boulders in place; the
boulders would have to be big enough to stop a car from passing through
undamaged, but small enough that they can be easily moved with a Bobcat.
Landscape companies can put the boulders in place for you. Intermix the
boulders with some plantings and it looks very natural.

You could try fencing, or even removable vehicle barriers if you
actually want to be able to move your own vehicles into that area.

Save yourself the legal trouble and just stop cars from going through
that area in the first place.
