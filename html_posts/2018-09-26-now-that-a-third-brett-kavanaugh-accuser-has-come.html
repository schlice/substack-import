**Now that a third Brett Kavanaugh accuser has come forward, with a
sworn affadavit that she saw Kavanaugh drugging and sexually assaulting
women, should Republicans withdraw his name from nomination for SCOTUS
justice?**

First of all, it's up to the **President** to withdraw his nominee, not
"Republicans." It's up to Republicans (and the Senate as a whole) to
either approve or reject the nominee, via a vote. No one should be
withdrawing nominations simply because of some unsubstantiated,
uncorroborated allegations. It's up to the Senate to provide "advice and
consent" to the President, and if these allegations are compelling to
them, then that should influence their "advice and/or consent."

Second, there are indeed three separate people who have made
allegations. But there are *many* problems with these allegations.
Namely, *no one but the accusers can corroborate them.* No one else who
was alleged to be at these "parties" has even corroborated that the
parties *even happened*, let alone that Kavanaugh was present or doing
anything that was alleged. One of the accusers says she was so drunk
that she barely remembers being present *herself*, let alone what
happened and who did it.

It's not my place to say whether or not they are lying. It doesn't
really matter to me, in all honesty. What matters to me is not their
truthfulness. What matters to me is what can be *proved*. And so far,
none of these allegations can even be corroborated, let alone proved.

I know we're not going to get anywhere near "beyond a reasonable doubt."
This is a political process, not a legal one. But we're also not going
to get anywhere near "more likely than not" which means more than 50%
likely, and that's troubling.

Finally, you should know that people who commit sexual assault don't
commit sexual assault and then *just stop*. People who commit sexual
assault have a specific personality that allows for such behavior, and
that personality doesn't just magically switch off because they hit a
certain age. Kavanaugh can show *decades* of history of interacting with
women where none of the requisite personality traits ever presented
themselves.

I don't doubt that something happened to these women. I can't say with
enough certainty that he did it that it should change someone's vote
from yes to no.
