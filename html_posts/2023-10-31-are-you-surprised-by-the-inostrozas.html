Yes. The Inostrozas' experience is definitely the *exception* rather
than the *rule.*

For those who are unfamiliar, here's their story:

In the vast majority of states, you cannot sell a home unless the HOA
dues are satisfied. This couple found that their property had an
outstanding balance from before they bought it: unpaid dues, along with
other penalties and charges.

In almost all states, the HOA dues must be satisfied before the deed can
be transferred. In some states, the sale can take place, and the unpaid
dues will be separated from the property. The HOA can still go after the
previous owner to try to get the money that they are owed. Typically
however, the Association has to recover the debt through foreclosure or
personal lawsuit (except in maybe one or two states, they can\'t legally
ask the new buyer to pay it). In most states there is a three year
statue of limitations on this. In some cases, if the debt is for a
special assessment (i.e. a new amenity that the new owners may benefit
from), the Association *may* ask that the new buyer to pay some or all
of that (but in most states, this isn\'t legal either), and even if they
did, that would be part of the sale contract.

In the vast majority of US states, the debt stays with the owner, not
the property.

In any case, if you're buying a house in a HOA-controlled community, you
should ensure during the closing that the property is "free and clear,"
and the HOA does this for you by providing you with a certificate of
account showing that there are no past due fees on the property. In most
closings, the title company retrieves this information and you get a
copy during the closing.
