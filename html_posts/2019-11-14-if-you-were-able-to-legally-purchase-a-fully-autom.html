**If you were able to legally purchase a fully automatic weapon such as
an M16 or submachine gun, would you, and why?**

Able by law or able by finances?

Because there answer to the first question is that everyone is able to
buy a fully automatic weapon. Some states have restrictions, and there
are additional licensing steps you need to go through, but they are
legal to own. The National Firearms Act limits fully automatic firearms
for sale to the general public. No fully automatic weapon manufactured
after May 19, 1986 can be registered to a civilian.

To that end, the answer to the second question: finances. All fully
automatic firearms made before May 19, 1986 have pretty much been
registered by this point, and the market has been artificially limited.
So let's go back to Supply and Demand 101: when demand goes up but
supply is constant, price goes up. To that end, prices for transferable
automatic weapons are very high. Where a new fully automatic M-16 might
cost a police department about \$500, the limited supply makes the price
for a transferable one well over \$10,000, and that doesn't count the
licensing fees and the costs for the background investigations in order
to be able to be licensed to own one.

So to answer your full question (now that you know the background): if I
had a spare \$10K, no I would not be spending it on a fully automatic
firearm. I'm not a collector, and I have no desire to put myself through
the nonsense licensing and registering that is required to own one. I am
quite happy with my semi-auto rifles.
