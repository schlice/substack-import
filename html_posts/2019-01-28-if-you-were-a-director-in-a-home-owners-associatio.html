**If you were a director in a Home owners Association (HOA) and there
was a complaint that a member\'s flag pole exceeded the rules how could
you with just a tape measure determine the height without climbing the
flag pole?**

Note, you will need to do this on a sunny day.

1.  Measure the length of the pole's shadow on the ground, record in
    inches. Then measure the length of your own shadow on the ground,
    also recorded in inches. You can also measure the height of
    something nearby along with the length of its shadow, if it's more
    convenient to do so (like a fencepost).
2.  Divide the nearby object's (or your) actual height (in inches) by
    the length of the shadow.
3.  Multiply the answer from step 2 by the length of the pole's shadow.
    This will be the height of the pole, in inches.
