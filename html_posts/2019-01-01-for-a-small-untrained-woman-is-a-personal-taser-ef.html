**For a small, untrained woman, is a personal TASER effective for
warding off an attack?**

No. A Taser is much less effective than, say, pepper spray.

For most assailants, pepper spray is highly effective and does not cause
lasting damage. Tasers must be deployed precisely in order to be
effective, and some use cases make Tasers ineffective.

Additionally, pepper spray is far less regulated than Tasers, so
depending on where you live, you may not even be legally permitted to
carry a Taser without a concealed weapons permit, assuming you're even
allowed to possess one at all.
