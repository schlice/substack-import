While this question has been answered in pieces here and there on Quora,
it\'s good to get it all in one place.

Your question makes it sound like mass shootings only take place in the
U.S., which is [[far from the
truth](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=66c7b5&url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/07/20/deadliest-mass-shootings_n_1688820.html){.external_link

In fact, with more access to legal guns than anywhere else, the U.S. has
less than the worldwide average of homicides around the world.

And countries like Switzerland have far higher rates of gun possession,
but their homicide rates are much lower.

Changing forms of mass media don\'t help to make the situation seem any
less fearsome. In fact, you\'ll find that the worst time for mass
shootings in the United States was 1929, according to criminologist
Grant Duwe of the Minnesota Department of Corrections.

So why do mass shootings happen in the United States? Well, they
certainly don\'t happen because we have guns, as the above chart shows.
Trying to restrict guns themselves doesn\'t work; with 200 million guns
in circulation, chances are a willing criminal will find his way to a
gun one way or another, and it certainly won\'t be by following the law.
While we can\'t say what specifically drives every mass shooting, there
are certainly common themes. The two big ones we need to work on:

\- Gun-Free Zones\
- Laws around mental illness

First, there is the issue of Gun-Free Zones. Richard Mack, a former
Arizona Sheriff, called them \"Helpless Victim Zones.\" Criminals may be
mentally unstable and may have skewed ideas about right and wrong, but
they know one thing: to kill the largest number of people in the
shortest amount of time before eating a buckshot sandwich is to go to a
place where there is guaranteed to be no resistance: a Gun-Free Zone. If
you\'re the only one with a gun, you are guaranteed to get the biggest
\"bang for your buck\", no pun intended. Gun-Free Zones have been
universally denounced as having no effect at stopping mass shootings. In
fact, FBI data clearly shows that in the largest percentage of cases, it
is only a gun that stops mass shooters.

Also, a [[study of 100 mass
shootings](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=a9c25a&url=http://dailyanarchist.com/2012/07/31/auditing-shooting-rampage-statistics/){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="dailyanarchist.com"}]{.qlink_container} by Davi Barker
revealed that the average number of people killed in mass shootings when
stopped by police is 14.29, while the average number of people killed in
a mass shooting when stopped by a civilian is 2.33, and not all of those
were stopped with a gun. The data suggests that less people get killed
when acting proactively than cowering in fear and waiting for the
police.

Second, there is the issue of the laws surrounding the mentally ill. Did
you know that the three biggest mental institutions in the United States
are prisons? That\'s because ever since
[[deinstitutionalization](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=f8eac2&url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deinstitutionalisation){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container} and the laws surrounding
it, we have been treating our criminally mentally ill as criminals
instead of patients, and sending them to jail. Sorry correctional
system, but those people don\'t get the kind of mental help that they so
desperately need in a jail.

These are just some of the reasons that mass shootings occur, but most
of the reason is because of well-intentioned people who have made some
very poor choices that have created a perfect storm for the mentally ill
to kill lots of people in a small span of time.
