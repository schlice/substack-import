<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>While this question has been answered in pieces here and there on Quora,<br>it\'s good to get it all in one place.<br><br>Your question makes it sound like mass shootings only take place in the<br>U.S., which is [[far from the<br>truth](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=66c7b5&url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/07/20/deadliest-mass-shootings_n_1688820.html){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="huffingtonpost.com"}]{.qlink_container}.<br><br>In fact, with more access to legal guns than anywhere else, the U.S. has<br>less than the worldwide average of homicides around the world.<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-156f957e72dccd7d73da93258491d418){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-156f957e72dccd7d73da93258491d418"<br>master_w="1280" master_h="653"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>And countries like Switzerland have far higher rates of gun possession,<br>but their homicide rates are much lower.<br><br>Changing forms of mass media don\'t help to make the situation seem any<br>less fearsome. In fact, you\'ll find that the worst time for mass<br>shootings in the United States was 1929, according to criminologist<br>Grant Duwe of the Minnesota Department of Corrections.<br><br>So why do mass shootings happen in the United States? Well, they<br>certainly don\'t happen because we have guns, as the above chart shows.<br>Trying to restrict guns themselves doesn\'t work; with 200 million guns<br>in circulation, chances are a willing criminal will find his way to a<br>gun one way or another, and it certainly won\'t be by following the law.<br>While we can\'t say what specifically drives every mass shooting, there<br>are certainly common themes. The two big ones we need to work on:<br><br>\- Gun-Free Zones\<br>- Laws around mental illness<br><br>First, there is the issue of Gun-Free Zones. Richard Mack, a former<br>Arizona Sheriff, called them \"Helpless Victim Zones.\" Criminals may be<br>mentally unstable and may have skewed ideas about right and wrong, but<br>they know one thing: to kill the largest number of people in the<br>shortest amount of time before eating a buckshot sandwich is to go to a<br>place where there is guaranteed to be no resistance: a Gun-Free Zone. If<br>you\'re the only one with a gun, you are guaranteed to get the biggest<br>\"bang for your buck\", no pun intended. Gun-Free Zones have been<br>universally denounced as having no effect at stopping mass shootings. In<br>fact, FBI data clearly shows that in the largest percentage of cases, it<br>is only a gun that stops mass shooters.<br><br>Also, a [[study of 100 mass<br>shootings](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=a9c25a&url=http://dailyanarchist.com/2012/07/31/auditing-shooting-rampage-statistics/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="dailyanarchist.com"}]{.qlink_container} by Davi Barker<br>revealed that the average number of people killed in mass shootings when<br>stopped by police is 14.29, while the average number of people killed in<br>a mass shooting when stopped by a civilian is 2.33, and not all of those<br>were stopped with a gun. The data suggests that less people get killed<br>when acting proactively than cowering in fear and waiting for the<br>police.<br><br>Second, there is the issue of the laws surrounding the mentally ill. Did<br>you know that the three biggest mental institutions in the United States<br>are prisons? That\'s because ever since<br>[deinstitutionalization(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=f8eac2&url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deinstitutionalisation){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container} and the laws surrounding<br>it, we have been treating our criminally mentally ill as criminals<br>instead of patients, and sending them to jail. Sorry correctional<br>system, but those people don\'t get the kind of mental help that they so<br>desperately need in a jail.<br><br>These are just some of the reasons that mass shootings occur, but most<br>of the reason is because of well-intentioned people who have made some<br>very poor choices that have created a perfect storm for the mentally ill<br>to kill lots of people in a small span of time.<br><br>\<br><br>(EDIT, 27 May 2022)<br><br>This aged well.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
