**Content:** [\"Regularly\" is a pretty big word. I don\'t think banks
\"regularly\" pay billions in fines.\
\
Jail time is only indicated if criminal law is broken. Generally, there
is no \"crime\" involved in bank misconduct. Banks are regulated by
banking regulation, and can face fines by their constitutient
organizations if they violate those regulations, but those regulation
violations are not criminal violations of any Federal, state, or local
law.]{.rendered_qtext}
