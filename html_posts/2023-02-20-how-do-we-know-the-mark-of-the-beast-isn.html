The mark of the beast will be very clear, whatever the mark actually is.
It hasn't been offered yet.

We know that the mark of the beast hasn't been offered yet because the
events recorded in Revelation have not taken place yet. Revelation
discusses how this will all happen in detail:

There will literally be 3.5 years of famine, world wars, earthquakes,
plagues, and false Christs. Then, the Antichrist will be enthroned over
the whole earth. He will demand fealty, and you will pledge your fealty
through the mark of the beast, either on the head or the hand. This
begins the period of time known as the Great Tribulation, where
Christians who refuse the mark of the beast are rounded up, tortured and
killed. Sometime during this second 3.5 year period, Christ will return
and the rapture will take place. This will signify the beginning of the
time period known as the Day of the Lord. Once the rapture is complete
and the elect are raised and ascend into heaven, God's wrath will be
unleashed onto the rest of the world. He will send Satan and his demons
to hell, once and for all.

In short, when the mark of the beast is presented to you to take, you'll
know it. You'll be ordered to take it or suffer the consequences.
