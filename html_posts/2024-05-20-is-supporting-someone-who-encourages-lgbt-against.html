So since you're asking about violating God's will, this is clearly a
religious question. Be aware of that while we proceed.

There is a world's worth of difference between **who you are** and
**what you choose to do**. Just because you "are" some way, or you
believe you "are" some way, doesn't require you to behave in any
specific way. You control your choices. You are not a slave to your
biology.

Now that that's out of the way, Christians believe that homosexual
***behavior*** is sinful, because it goes against God's plan for the
sexes, and for marriage and relations between a husband and a wife.
There's a mountain of evidence talking about how homosexual activity is
sinful, in both the Old and the New Testaments (all quotes from NIV):

> Do not have sexual relations with a man as one does with a woman; that
> is detestable. --- Leviticus 18:22
>
> If a man has sexual relations with a man as one does with a woman,
> both of them have done what is detestable. They are to be put to
> death; their blood will be on their own heads. --- Leviticus 20:13
>
> Or do you not know that wrongdoers will not inherit the kingdom of
> God? Do not be deceived: Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters
> nor adulterers nor men who have sex with men nor thieves nor the
> greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the
> kingdom of God. --- 1 Corinthians 6:9-10
>
> We also know that the law is made not for the righteous but for
> lawbreakers and rebels, the ungodly and sinful, the unholy and
> irreligious, for those who kill their fathers or mothers, for
> murderers, for the sexually immoral, for those practicing
> homosexuality, for slave traders and liars and perjurers---and for
> whatever else is contrary to the sound doctrine --- 1 Timothy 1:9-10

And lest you think that only gay men are implicated in the Bible,
lesbians are also specifically called out:

> Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their
> women exchanged natural sexual relations for unnatural ones. In the
> same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were
> inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed shameful acts with
> other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their error.
> --- Romans 1:26--27

Now that we've established this point, where do we go from here? How do
we treat someone who encourages LGBT behavior?

We love them. That's all we're commanded to do. Love them.

Does that mean we have to be best friends? Nope. The Bible says to love
them, not to like them. Love, in this context, is a doing. It's a verb.

When most people talk about love, they're usually referencing a feeling.
They say things like "falling in love" as if it's something outside of
your control. You lock eyes with someone, your heart beats faster, you
get all sweaty, and that's described as love. That's a feeling, it's not
love! You can run around a building and feel the same way. That's
*romance*, that's *infatuation*, it may even be *lust* if it's not
controlled. But it is not love.

God commands us to love, but you can see that in the Bible passages
which discuss God's command to love, it's a command to *action*, not a
command to *feeling* (as if you can control your feelings, anyway):

> *But to you who are listening I say: Love your enemies, do good to
> those who hate you, bless those who curse you, pray for those who
> mistreat you. --- Luke 6:27--28*
>
> *But love your enemies, do good to them, and lend to them without
> expecting to get anything back. --- Luke 6:35*

Luke says "do good" right after he says "love." Love is associated with
doing.

That said, it's important to understand that feelings come and go based
on external stimuli or your interpretation of them. Feelings are
involuntary; love is a command. Don't equate feelings with love. Love
includes feelings, but it's more about action.

If you want to feel good about someone, do good for them. Doing good for
someone is a stimulus that can change your feelings.

\

So what do you do with the person who encourages LGBT against God's
will? **Love them**. Do good for them. If you get into a religious
discussion, you might mention what the Bible says about homosexual
activities and that Christians should discourage those actions,
especially among believers. But most of all, love them by doing good for
them.
