It's actually a lot more simple than folks are trying to make it.

The bottom line: humans have human minds. Angels (including Satan) have
*angelic minds.*

Humans, with our human minds and its limitations, do not possess the
full knowledge of the glory of God. Thus, our choice to sin (and in many
cases, our sin without choice) can be directly associated with a lack of
the full knowledge of God. In other words, much of our sin can be
attributed to our fallen, human condition.

Angels do not have this limitation. Satan, and all the angels, were
continually in God's presence and had the full knowledge of the glory of
God. Therefore, they had no excuse for rebelling against God and turning
away from Him. They were not tempted. Satan and the other angels
rebelled against God despite what they knew was the utmost evil.

God built a mechanism to redeem humanity, through the person of Jesus.
No mechanism was designed for the salvation of fallen angels. Besides,
there's no indication that they would repent, given that they were not
deceived and made their decisions while having full knowledge of the
glory of God. Theirs wasn't a sin based on a fallen nature. Theirs was
an **active rejection of God** with the full knowledge of what they were
doing and why. Why would we be upset that God gives them exactly what
they asked for?

Luke 12:48 tells us that the severity of God's judgment varies according
to how much knowledge a person possesses. The angels, therefore, with
their vast knowledge, deserve a much greater judgement.
