**Does the SGLI or VA military life insurance honor the policy and pay
out if a service member or veteran commits suicide?**

Cause of death is irrelevant for paying out of SGLI. So if the
servicemember was not wearing a seatbelt, or commits suicide, it's
irrelevant. SGLI will pay out.

There are certain scenarios under which SGLI will not pay, but they are
related to whether or not the servicemember was covered at the time of
his death.

That's not the same as Dependency and Indemnity Compensation (DIC) under
the VA. DIC is for servicemembers who died in the line of duty or whose
death was caused by a service-related disease or condition. In order for
your dependents to be eligible for DIC, your death must not have been
due to your own misconduct. SGLI doesn't have this restriction.
