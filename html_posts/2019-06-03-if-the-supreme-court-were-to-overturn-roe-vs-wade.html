**If the Supreme court were to overturn Roe vs Wade, how would that
decision affect a person\'s right to privacy?**

Hopefully it would eliminate the notion that a Constitutional right to
privacy exists.

Because it doesn't. Unless you can find the words "The right of the
people to privacy shall not be infringed" in the Constitution, it
doesn't exist. *Griswold v. Connecticut* made it up, out of the
"emanations and penumbras" of the Constitution, not its "text."
*Griswold* is the decision upon which *Roe* was built.

It would be left to states to enact laws which protect your privacy.
Sort of like the Privacy Act of 1974, still in force today. Along with
privacy in healthcare (guaranteed by the Health Insurance Portability
and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996) and other privacy laws, Federal
and state law should protect privacy. There is no Constitutional right
to privacy.
