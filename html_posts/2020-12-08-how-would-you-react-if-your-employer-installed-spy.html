I would start with a lawsuit, and possibly criminal investigation.

My employer has no authority to place anything at all on my personal
devices without my permission. My employer can do whatever it likes on
employer-owned devices. They can set whatever restrictions they like on
their own hardware. They can also set whatever restrictions they like on
accessing their networks.

But they can't install spyware (or any software packages that I do not
approve or am unaware of) on any of my personal devices without my
consent. And I must affirmatively consent --- that means, I need to know
what is being installed, why it is being installed, what I get with it
installed, and what I lose if it's not installed.

Companies have the absolute right to protect their assets, and that
includes their hardware, software, and networks. Companies do not have
the right to invade my privacy or otherwise violate the law in order to
do so.
