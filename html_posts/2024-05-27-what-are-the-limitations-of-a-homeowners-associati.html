Usually, the CC&R must follow Federal and state law when it comes to
housing.

Most "limitations" that an HOA could place in its CC&Rs run afoul of the
Fair Housing Act, which prohibits discrimination based on "familial
status." This status is limited to families with minor children. A
numerical occupancy limitation, the effect of which would prohibit a
husband and wife with three children from residing in a two bedroom
home, would therefore violate the Fair Housing Act, and constitute
discrimination based on familial status. However, it does not implicate
"family" relations of individuals who are 18 or older, as is the case in
age-qualified communities.

That said, the Act doesn't really go into detail about how many people
comprise a "single family" when they reside in "single family housing."

If an HOA is going to have numerical limits in its CC&Rs, they must do
so carefully to avoid butting up against Federal housing law.

If your Association has a numerical limit you think violates Federal
law, consult with a real estate attorney who specializes in HOA law.
