**Why can an FFL proceed with a sale if they haven\'t received an answer
on an NICS background check in three business days?**

Primarily because it prevents government from violating the Second
Amendment.

The "default allow" policy prevents the government from shutting down
the NICS system and imposing a *de facto ban* on gun sales simply by
failing to process any NICS requests. If that policy was not in place,
the government could bypass the 2nd Amendment and create a *de facto*
gun ban simply by shutting down the NICS system.

In this way, it is incumbent on the government to not only provide an
answer, but to provide a *timely* answer.
