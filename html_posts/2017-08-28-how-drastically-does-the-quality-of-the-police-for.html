It does differ drastically, but not between states. It differs between
*jurisdictions*.

I can guarantee you that the standards which have been applied to the
Backwater, MiddleOfNowhere Sheriff's Office where there is one Sheriff
and one deputy for about 500 square miles where 20 people live would
pale in comparison to the LAPD or the NYPD or the Chicago or Denver PD.

In other words, the quality of the police force is directly proportional
to the needs of the community it serves.

I should qualify. Does that mean that the Sheriff of Backwater,
MiddleOfNowhere is *unqualified?* Hardly. It simply means that the needs
of his jurisdiction are far less than what is needed in Chicago or LA or
Manhattan. The quality of his work meets the needs of his jurisdiction.
