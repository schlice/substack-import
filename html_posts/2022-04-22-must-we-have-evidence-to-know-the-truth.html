It depends on what you count as "evidence." Not all evidence is the
same. There is *scientific* evidence. There is *philosophical* evidence.
There is *historical* evidence. There is *observatory* evidence. There
is *testimonial* evidence.

And all of it has a *degree of likelihood*. In other words, some
evidence is more likely to be true than other evidence. For example, are
you 100% sure that gravity works on every dropped object? You cannot be
100% sure, because you have not seen every dropped object. However, you
can be *really* sure that gravity will work on every dropped object.
Why? Because it has yet to be documented that gravity has ever *failed*
to work on any dropped object. Therefore you can presume, ***with a very
high degree of likelihood which approaches, but never equals, 100%,***
that gravity works on all dropped objects.

So some evidence is unreliable, and other evidence is very reliable.

But in order to know the truth, we must have some evidence. Faith is not
believing something despite a lack of evidence. Faith is believing that
your evidence is true.
