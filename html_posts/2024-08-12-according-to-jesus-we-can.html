This isn't quite accurate. Remember, the Bible can be either
*descriptive* or *prescriptive*. Not everything *described* in the Bible
is a rule for us.

It's interesting that you key in on Luke 14:33:

> So therefore, any one of you who does not renounce all that he has
> cannot be my disciple. \-- Luke 14:33 ESV

So when we focus on *this verse,* it appears to say that in order to be
a *disciple* of Jesus, we must renounce all that we have. But is Jesus
telling us that in order to be Christian, we can have no possessions?
Considering the fact that Jesus' disciples did, in fact, have
possessions during their time of discipleship, then this must mean
something else.

In Bible exegesis, if we don't see the significance of the verse, we
expand out to the chapter, and then expand out to the book, to help us
explain the verse. In this case, simply expanding out beyond just the
verse to the few verses around it explains exactly what Jesus was
talking about.

> Now great crowds accompanied him, and he turned and said to them, "If
> anyone comes to me and does not hate his own father and mother and
> wife and children and brothers and sisters, yes, and even his own
> life, he cannot be my disciple --- Luke 14:25--26 ESV

If you had a problem with Luke 14:33, you must ***really*** have a
problem with Luke 14:25--26, right? Becuase now, it appears that to be a
disciple, you have to **hate your mother and father!** You have to
**hate your wife and children!** You have to **hate your brothers and
sisters!**

So put all these things together. What we're reading is that in order to
be Jesus' disciple, you need to:

- Hate your mother and father
- Hate your wife and children
- Hate your own life
- Sell all your possessions

Clearly, if you know anything about Jesus' teaching, He would never
teach any of these. So why did He say this?

Jesus is being *intentionally hyperbolic* here. He isn't providing
*conditions* to following Him. He is talking about *allegiance* to Him.

You can see it a little more clearly if you look at the parallel
recording of this teaching from Matthew:

> Whoever loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me, and
> whoever loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me. \--
> Matthew 10:37 ESV

Where Luke uses the more inflammatory language, Matthew seems to be
focusing on *allegiance* to Jesus. Jesus must be our **primary**
allegiance, even above our family, or our possessions. When you look at
Luke's writing in *that* light, what he recorded makes sense.

In addition, the word "hate" is used in the Bible to indicate preference
or allegiance rather than "the opposite of love" (cf Deuteronomy
21:15--17 and Genesis 29:30-31).

Ultimately, what does this mean? Jesus is not calling his followers to
hate their families or sell all their possessions. Instead, he calls for
undivided loyalty to himself above family loyalties, and complete
allegiance above desire to store and retain possessions. **Jesus desires
your primary allegiance.**

The stark language tends to be very off-putting, but that's by design.
Being a disciple of Jesus is not easy, nor is it low-cost. Jesus must
become the center of your life, and that means other things (family,
possessions) will have to move to the periphery. Not that they are not
important, but they are not the **most** important. And when people
place possessions foremost in their lives, they will find it difficult
to not only follow Jesus, but also to gain salvation.
