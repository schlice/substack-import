**Content:** [Jon, I can take this.\
\
For a food service establishment, these days they have to follow certain
health codes. Their employees have to be trained on the use of the
sanitization equipment that is used for the plates, glasses and utensils
and in the correct use of the dishwashing machines. The business retains
the liability if the employee does not properly sanitize the dishes and
utensils and a customer contracts any manner of foodborne illness due to
unsanitary conditions. The restaurant would then be subject to closure
by the local government\'s health department because of unsanitary
conditions. There is no way that any person would be allowed to use
food-grade sanitization equipment without being a trained employee.\
\
In short, this may have been something that happened years and years ago
in a small town in a mom-and-pop diner that washed their dishes by hand,
but that kind of thing would never happen today because of health/safety
and liability concerns.]{.rendered_qtext}
