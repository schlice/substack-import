The short answer is **no**, there is nothing in the Christian worldview
that would explicitly contradict the possibility that God created life
somewhere else in the universe that He created.

First, we need to keep in mind that despite decades of searching and
listening and examining and probing, we have found no evidence of life
anywhere else in the universe. Physicists call this the *Fermi Paradox*:
the apparent discrepancy between the lack of conclusive evidence of
advanced extraterrestrial life and the apparently high likelihood of its
existence.

In other words, if it's so easy for life to form from non-life, *where
is everybody?*

The truth is that it is *not* highly likely that life would form
anywhere. There are more than a dozen special circumstances which make
life on Earth (and apparently, *only* Earth) possible: our distance from
the sun, the existence of water and heavy metals, a moon, a magnetic
field, gravity (but not too much), and even the sun itself is unique.

Second, it's important to note that the Bible nowhere says that the
universe was created only for humans. If God had created another
intelligent species who loves Him, there would be nothing in the Bible
which would contradict that understanding. The Bible is intended to lead
believers into salvation through the death and resurrection of Christ,
not to answer the question about what God has done with the rest of the
universe.

Finally, the Bible *does* tell us that there are other beings in the
universe. And they don't always come in peace. God created angels (who,
like God, we also cannot see), and some of the angels fell and became
demons. As some Biblical scholars have posited, some "alien encounters"
may have actually been demonic possessions. Now, that's not to say that
every UFO story is a demon. But by the same token, if demons exist, then
it's possible that at least some of those "close encounters" stories may
be linked to demonic activity.

TL;DR: The Bible does not tell us specifically about aliens. But the
Christian worldview at least allows for the possibility of alien life.
