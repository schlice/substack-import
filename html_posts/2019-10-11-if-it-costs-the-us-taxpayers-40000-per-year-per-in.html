**If it costs the US taxpayers \$40,000 per year per inmate, then why
don\'t we force the inmates to pay that themselves by forcing them to
work?**

Because last time I checked, Abraham Lincoln abolished slavery. The 13th
Amendment says that \"\[n\]either slavery nor involuntary servitude,
except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly
convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to
their jurisdiction.\"

We can thus make them work as punishment. We cannot force them, however,
to *pay for their own incarceration*. The former is *involuntary
servitude as punishment*. The latter is *slavery*.

The taxpayers pay to incarcerate criminals. The criminals do not pay for
their own incarceration.

And what happens when someone is injured and can't work? Who pays for
their incarceration then? Do we just let them go because they can't
work?
