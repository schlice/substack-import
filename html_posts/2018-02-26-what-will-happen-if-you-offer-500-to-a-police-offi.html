**What will happen if you offer 500\$ to the police officer in the USA
when he stops you for infringement of the rules of road traffic?**

We've answered this already but I can't find the other question at the
moment.

You will be arrested and sent to jail for attempting to bribe a public
official. Bribery is a far more serious offense than whatever you were
charged with in the first place, so you should just accept the ticket,
pay the fine, and move on. Don't attempt to bribe the officer.
