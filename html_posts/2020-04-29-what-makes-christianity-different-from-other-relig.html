**What makes Christianity different from other religions, what makes it
so believable?**

Christianity is the only major world religion in which its believers are
saved by *grace alone.* In this respect, there are only two major world
religions: Christianity, and "everyone else," as all other major world
religions require some form of action (i.e. "human achievement") in
order to attain their salvation. Even some subsets of religions which
call themselves Christian or retain some Christian theology or belief
still require human achievement in order to achieve Heaven or Nirvana or
Valhalla or Paradise or whatever they believe is the final end-state of
mankind. Certain denominations or cults, such as Jehovah's Witnesses,
Seventh-Day Adventists, Church of Christ, Roman Catholics, Russian and
Eastern Orthodox, and others still require something that needs to be
accomplished or is necessary for you to do in order to achieve
salvation.

Christianity is the only religion which states that there is absolutely
nothing you can do to earn your way into Heaven (i.e. "divine
accomplishment"); your salvation has already been bought and paid for.

**What makes it so believable?**

It's actually quite believable. What's fascinating is how unbelievable
all other world religions are in this respect.

When Mormons come to my house, I'll often ask them questions about what
gets them to heaven, and we'll usually have a discussion about just how
much they've done to merit that reward. I'll ask where, on a scale of 0
to 100, they think they fall, in terms of just how good they've been. No
one has yet told me 100, as everyone acknowledges some failings. Why
wouldn't they? It's only human. Then I ask them what they believe God
expects, based on what they have read in the Scriptures, and each says
100. It's true, God expects perfection. Jesus even expands on this,
making the Ten Commandments even more stringent. "You have heard that it
was said, 'You shall not commit adultery.' But I tell you that anyone
who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her
in his heart." (Matthew 5:27--28 NIV) Of course, based on that standard,
who among us is *not* guilty of at least some sin? No one. We are all
sinful, and we have all fallen short of God's standards.

Therefore, it is impossible for anyone to do enough to get themselves
into Heaven. It is *only* possible with God. Only God can save you
through his grace.
