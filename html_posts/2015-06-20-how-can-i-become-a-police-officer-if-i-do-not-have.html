You are *generalizing*, which means you are taking your encounters with
police and extrapolating them as normal behavior across the entire
force. How many cops have you had dealings with? Maybe 20? Unless
you\'ve been in the system, in which case that would be higher. There
are over 300,000 active police officers in this country and you got a
good random sampling of them through your personal experiences?
