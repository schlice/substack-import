**Do I have to be a US citizen to get into the United States Military
Academy?**

Short answer is yes.

Entrance into the US Military Academy requires US citizenship and age
between 17 and 23. You must also be unmarried and not have any
obligation to support any children. Females may not be pregnant.

There are foreign exchange students at USMA (as there are at all service
academies), but they have already been admitted as students of service
academies in their home countries, on exchange programs with the United
States.
