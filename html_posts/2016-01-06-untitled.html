<h2>Answer Comment</h2>
<div>

**Content:** [And as I replied, it is definitely true that if you remove
guns from society, there will be a decrease in gun-related crimes. But
will there be an associated increase in stabbings? Bludgeonings? Violent
crime is the problem. Guns make it easier, not possible.\
\
What is the problem you are trying to address? Are you simply trying to
reduce gun crime? Certainly, removing guns from much of society
(disregarding the near impossibility of doing so) will accomplish that
goal.]{.rendered_qtext}
