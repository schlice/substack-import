**Can I cut my neighbor\'s tree limb without their consent? The branch
runs into the master bedroom window on the 2nd floor, and I am afraid of
small rodents getting access to my roof. I\'ve asked them for two years
to do something about it.**

You will have to check your local ordinances, but in most cases, the
other property owner is committing a tort trespass by allowing his tree
to grow on to your property (which you own up to 500 feet over your
property (in most places), where the FAA takes over).

In most places, you can cut any tree that is extending into your
property. Of course, it's best to get the homeowner's permission before
you do that, but if you can't (or they won't give permission), you
should be able to safely cut any of the tree extending on to your
property. Make sure you take before/after pictures of the tree so that
you can document exactly what you removed and that you are not harming
the tree by doing so.

If you really want to be a stickler about it, you can hire a
professional arborist to do the work, and then bill the homeowner for
the amount due. If he doesn't pay, you can take him to small claims
court to recoup your investment.

Ideally, according to most extension offices, the best time to trim a
tree is late winter, when fungi and diseases are at their lowest
activity level. The only difference is for spring-blooming trees; trim
those immediately after they bloom. For all others, prune in late
winter, while the trees are fully dormant.[\[1\]](#ljfbJ){#cite-ljfbJ
