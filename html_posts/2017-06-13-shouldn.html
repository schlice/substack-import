**YES!!!**

You should absolutely regulate gun permits in exactly the same way you
regulate driver's licenses!

That is:

- You don't need a background check or a permit to buy a car, so you
  shouldn't need one to buy a gun
- If you're not taking your gun off of your property, no license is
  required. You only need a license if you intend on carrying your gun
  off of your property.
- The state issues licenses to **everyone** (unless you can't possess a
  gun, like if you're a convicted violent felon, etc) who can pass a
  simple usage test and pay a small processing fee, and the license
  covers all usage scenarios and all carry conditions (concealed, open,
  etc), since you don't need special licenses to drive in the rain, or
  on paved vs. dirt roads.
- Licenses issued by one state are recognized as legal and are honored
  in all 50 states
- You don't need special licenses to add features to your car (like
  turbochargers, spoilers, specialized exhausts, rims, etc), so no
  special licenses should be required to add features to a firearm
- Police would need reasonable suspicion before they could question you
  about your gun license. So if you're open carrying and minding your
  own business, police won't hassle you.

I could go on, but I think you might not have truly considered what
licensing guns in the same way we license drivers would actually look
like.

Be careful what you wish for...
