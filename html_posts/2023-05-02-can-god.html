It depends on what you mean by freedom. So let's start by defining
freedom, which I can probably presume you mean "free will."

The applicable definition of "free will" is that a person has the power
to make the ultimate decision.

So can God be sovereign over all (including our free will) and yet we
still have free will?

The answer is **yes. Because if it is anything other than yes, then we
do not have free will.**

Think about it this way. If I have a gun and I am pointing it at you, I
literally have the power to take your life. I have *sovereignty* over
your life at that very moment. But I choose not to do so, because I
don't want you dead (and I don't want to go to jail for murder), so I
don't. I have the power, but I do not exercise it.

Similarly God is indeed sovereign over all (including our free will). He
does exercise some influence (in a process we call *regeneration*), but
He does not exercise complete or ultimate influence, because He doesn't
want to. He truly desires for us to be free and to make the choice to
love Him freely. That means that the *ultimate* decision is ours.

God does exercise His will in granting new hearts to those who He
chooses. God *regenerates* them, giving them hearts which will love God.
But the choice to follow Jesus is still ours, *even if God allows us to
love Him.*

Therefore, just because God has the power over our free will doesn't
mean we don't have free will. It would only mean we don't have free will
if God exerts His control over our self-determination, which He does not
do.

\

But more importantly, and this probably gets at the very heart of this
question, *if God has sovereignty over our free will,* ***are we still
accountable for our choices?***

And that answer is assuredly **yes**. We have free will. We can make our
own choices, and we are indeed responsible over our choices, and we will
account for them. We will, as Jesus says, "give account for every
careless word" (Matthew 12:36). Indeed, we will give an account,
according to Romans 14:12, of all of our preferences and choices and
behaviors. Each of us will give an account of himself to God.
