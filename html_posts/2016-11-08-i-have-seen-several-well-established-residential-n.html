If you don\'t like being told what to do, ever, it\'s a nuisance. If you
believe that you should be able to do whatever the hell you like with
your own property and neighbors be damned, then you\'ll hate HOAs.

If you like assurance that your neighbor won\'t make his house a pit and
kill your property values, it\'s a necessity. If you like lower trash
prices than you could ever negotiate on your own, it\'s very nearly a
necessity.
