**Content:** [[[Better technology to track planes exists so why don\'t
more airlines use
it?](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=79bf41&url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/better-technology-to-track-planes-exists-so-why-dont-more-airlines-use-it/){.external_link

\
ADFRs, or Automatically Deployable Flight Recorders, eject from the
aircraft just before a crash. They float on water and send their
location to satellites for retrieval. This gives searchers a better idea
of where the aircraft actually went down, even in water.\
\
The ADFRs have been in use by the US Navy since the 60\'s (since their
aircraft generally fly over water more often than others). Most models
of F/A-18 Hornets have ADFRs installed.\
\
Governmental grants could fully fund ADFRs in commercial aircraft in the
US, but Congress has failed to act in getting that funding to the
aviation industry to implement the new system. The United States has
been trying to get them installed since 1999, when the NTSB began
recommending upgrades to the CVR/FDR units in commercial
aircraft.]{.rendered_qtext}
