I've always found FindLaw to be a good resource.

If you want a more official source, you can go to the State Bar of
Wisconsin's website and search for an attorney there. I like the State
Bar website because it allows you to either confidentially talk to a
specialist or fill out an online form which will help direct you to the
appropriate resource in your area.
