**Is a woman a pedophile if she likes 10-12 years younger guys as her
boyfriend and husband?**

The answer is no, a woman is not automatically a pedophile if she wants
a man who is 10 years younger than her as a boyfriend or a husband.

- If the woman is 30 and the man is 20, this does not make the woman a
  pedophile.
- If the woman is 20 and the boy is 10, this ***does*** make the woman a
  pedophile.

*Pedophilia* literally means "love of children." It is a mental disorder
in which an adult finds a **pre-pubescent child** sexually attractive.

Whether or not the woman is a pedophile is not determined by the
*difference in age between the two*. It is determined by the age of the
person to whom she is attracted.
