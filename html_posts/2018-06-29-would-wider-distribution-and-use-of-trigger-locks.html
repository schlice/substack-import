**Would wider distribution and use of trigger locks prevent many
suicides, accidental shootings and criminal shootings in the US?**

Suicides - no.

Accidental shootings - possibly.

Criminal shootings - no.

The only thing you might reduce a little bit would be accidental
shootings, but you shouldn't be locking a loaded gun anyway. You should
only put a trigger lock on a gun that you do not need rapid access to,
and such a gun would be unloaded. So you're only really locking unloaded
guns, which don't accidentally discharge.

You'll never stop stupid. You'll never prevent someone leaving a loaded
gun unattended somewhere. Even if there are laws against it, it will
still happen, so unintended discharges will still, at some point, take
place.
