A2A, but there are too many good answers for me to add anything
meaningful other than to summarize what you\'ve already heard:

The \$3 charge was a \"test charge\" to see if the card actually worked.
Criminals can use these charges in \"batches\" to find working card
numbers from lists of stolen numbers.

They will then either use the cards themselves or resell the numbers as
\"known good\" numbers, assuming that most people are not going to catch
the \$3 charge in time to do something about it. A criminal can then get
two or three good charges processed before the card is deactivated.

But credit card companies are getting smarter in their pattern
recognition, and if something doesn\'t fit your normal pattern of
spending, they will decline the charge and contact you.

This happened to me yearly. I go down to Florida with my family on
vacation. Every time I go into Walmart to buy snacks and sundries, my
credit card gets declined at the register, and then both my wife\'s and
my phones start buzzing with texts and ringing with calls. The bank\'s
app logs notifications, too.

Now, I can notify the bank in advance that I\'m going to be on vacation.
Less chance my valid charges will be rejected when I\'m there.
