All departments train differently, but officers most definitely learn
this during baton training. The idea is incapacitation with a single,
quick blow to avoid the appearance of "beating" the suspect with
repeated strikes. Ideally, you want the minimum number of strikes to
incapacitate the suspect, at which time you can finish the takedown and
handcuff the suspect.

This is a part of police training called "arrest control."
