<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Why does the law need to be changed? If teens are sending<br>nude pictures of themselves through text messaging, they are already<br>guilty of distributing (the sender) and/or possessing (the receiver)<br>child pornography, and I think the laws surrounding that offense are<br>fairly robust as they are. Do we really need new laws? Will a new law<br>change teen behavior? Should we ban teens from using cell phones until<br>they turn 18 should they be convicted? Like convicted felons or<br>suspected spouse abusers can\'t own guns?\<br>\<br>My point is that I don\'t think changing the law will change teen<br>behavior. But I think you are questioning why we think that it is okay<br>that we take pictures of a 17 year old\'s penis to compare them to the<br>pictures he sent via text so that he can be convicted of distributing<br>child pornography.\<br>\<br>I think that if teens want to send nude pictures of themselves to each<br>other, they\'re going to do it, one way or another. Instead of text,<br>they\'ll use Snapchat (which I greatly discourage anyone from using) or<br>FaceTime, or some other technology. The problem is not the law or the<br>technology, it is the teens, and the parents who do (or don\'t)<br>supervise them.\<br>\<br>My kids don\'t use Snapchat because it is banned in my house. If I catch<br>them using it, they lose their phone for an indeterminate amount of<br>time. I regularly monitor my kids\' phones; I have all of their<br>passwords and their lock codes for their phones; they surrender their<br>phones to me on demand and I can search them at any time for violations<br>of MY texting policies. I own the phones, I pay for the phones, I pay<br>the monthly bills for the phones, and by being the account owner, I am<br>responsible for what the phone users do using my account, so in essence,<br>I too could be charged with trafficking in child pornography because<br>it\'s my account. I can\'t claim ignorance because I am the<br>\"responsible party.\"\<br>\<br>Some may argue that this is Draconian; that somehow I\'m not allowing my<br>kids to have freedom because I\'m so controlling of their phones.<br>HELLO???? I\'M THE PARENT! If I don\'t control my teen, who will? I<br>certainly won\'t take a laissez-faire attitude when it comes to what<br>they are doing; they\'d run amok! I don\'t expect anyone to control my<br>teen but me.\<br>\<br>So using that line of thinking, maybe we should change the law by<br>forcing parental involvement in teens\' cell phone usage by extending<br>the child pornography charges to them, since they are the responsible<br>parties on the account. Maybe then you\'ll get parents a little more<br>involved in their kids\' behaviors, which is indeed what needs to happen<br>here.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
