**Content:** [Why does the law need to be changed? If teens are sending
nude pictures of themselves through text messaging, they are already
guilty of distributing (the sender) and/or possessing (the receiver)
child pornography, and I think the laws surrounding that offense are
fairly robust as they are. Do we really need new laws? Will a new law
change teen behavior? Should we ban teens from using cell phones until
they turn 18 should they be convicted? Like convicted felons or
suspected spouse abusers can\'t own guns?\
\
My point is that I don\'t think changing the law will change teen
behavior. But I think you are questioning why we think that it is okay
that we take pictures of a 17 year old\'s penis to compare them to the
pictures he sent via text so that he can be convicted of distributing
child pornography.\
\
I think that if teens want to send nude pictures of themselves to each
other, they\'re going to do it, one way or another. Instead of text,
they\'ll use Snapchat (which I greatly discourage anyone from using) or
FaceTime, or some other technology. The problem is not the law or the
technology, it is the teens, and the parents who do (or don\'t)
supervise them.\
\
My kids don\'t use Snapchat because it is banned in my house. If I catch
them using it, they lose their phone for an indeterminate amount of
time. I regularly monitor my kids\' phones; I have all of their
passwords and their lock codes for their phones; they surrender their
phones to me on demand and I can search them at any time for violations
of MY texting policies. I own the phones, I pay for the phones, I pay
the monthly bills for the phones, and by being the account owner, I am
responsible for what the phone users do using my account, so in essence,
I too could be charged with trafficking in child pornography because
it\'s my account. I can\'t claim ignorance because I am the
\"responsible party.\"\
\
Some may argue that this is Draconian; that somehow I\'m not allowing my
kids to have freedom because I\'m so controlling of their phones.
HELLO???? I\'M THE PARENT! If I don\'t control my teen, who will? I
certainly won\'t take a laissez-faire attitude when it comes to what
they are doing; they\'d run amok! I don\'t expect anyone to control my
teen but me.\
\
So using that line of thinking, maybe we should change the law by
forcing parental involvement in teens\' cell phone usage by extending
the child pornography charges to them, since they are the responsible
parties on the account. Maybe then you\'ll get parents a little more
involved in their kids\' behaviors, which is indeed what needs to happen
here.]{.rendered_qtext}
