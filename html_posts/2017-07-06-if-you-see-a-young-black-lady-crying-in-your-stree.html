Calling the police is free and easy. It doesn't place me in danger. It
doesn't place me in any legally binding contract. It doesn't obligate me
to do anything else but push a few buttons on my mobile phone.

Of course I would help her.

What I would probably do is ask her why she needs the police (so I can
gauge the level of severity of the incident so I can determine which
number to call) and then I would take out my phone and dial the
appropriate number (either 911 for emergency or our local switchboard
number for non-emergency) and then hand her the phone. I would wait
while she spoke to the dispatcher, and then once she was done, I'd take
the phone. I might wait around for police to arrive, but if she's not
injured or in immediate danger, I'd probably not, especially if I had to
be somewhere.

Probably the easiest thing I did all day.

Your mom is concerned about you. She doesn't want you getting mixed up
in something that might hurt you. Could it be possible that the woman
was involved in some sort of scam? Or perhaps your calling would somehow
wrap you up in something that could get you in trouble. She's just
concerned for your welfare; she's not letting her fear dictate her life.
