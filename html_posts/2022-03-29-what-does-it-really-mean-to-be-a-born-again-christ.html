So two questions here:

**What does it really mean to be a born again Christian?**

The phrase "Born-again Christian" actually comes from the Bible:

> Now there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a ruler of the
> Jews. This man came to Jesus by night and said to him, "Rabbi, we know
> that you are a teacher come from God, for no one can do these signs
> that you do unless God is with him." Jesus answered him, "Truly,
> truly, I say to you, unless one is born again he cannot see the
> kingdom of God." Nicodemus said to him, "How can a man be born when he
> is old? Can he enter a second time into his mother\'s womb and be
> born?" Jesus answered, "Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born
> of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God. That
> which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the
> Spirit is spirit. Do not marvel that I said to you, 'You must be born
> again.' The wind blows where it wishes, and you hear its sound, but
> you do not know where it comes from or where it goes. So it is with
> everyone who is born of the Spirit."

> Nicodemus said to him, "How can these things be?" Jesus answered him,
> "Are you the teacher of Israel and yet you do not understand these
> things? Truly, truly, I say to you, we speak of what we know, and bear
> witness to what we have seen, but you do not receive our testimony. If
> I have told you earthly things and you do not believe, how can you
> believe if I tell you heavenly things? No one has ascended into heaven
> except he who descended from heaven, the Son of Man. And as Moses
> lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be

>
> "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever
> believes in him should not perish but have eternal life." --- John
> 3:1--16 NIV

As you can see, Nicodemus is clearly very confused when Jesus tells him
that you must be "born again" in order to enter the kingdom of heaven.
He says, "How can this be? Can you enter into your mother's womb a
second time and be born again?"

But Jesus wasn't talking about crawling back into your mother's womb to
be reborn. Reading the rest of the section, Jesus makes clear that the
"rebirth" we are discussing is *spiritual* ("so it is with everyone who
is born of the Spirit"). Clearly, Jesus is discussing a spiritual
rebirth.

Indeed, the BIble tells us that when we are saved, we **die to self**
and we are **born again in spirit**. We die to our old ways. We die to
our old life. And we are reborn as a new person in Christ. This is the
point at which *salvation* occurs. Salvation is a one-shot deal, an
instantaneous reconciling of the believer to Christ.

The Bible says that before we accepted Christ, we were *dead* in our
sin, following the evils of this world. But God made us alive together
with Christ (Ephesians 2:1--10). So you can see what they were talking
about when Jesus was discussing being "born again" in spirit. When the
believer makes a true confession of his or her sins, a true repentance
of those sins (which includes a "turning away" from that life), and a
complete acceptance of Jesus as their personal Lord and Savior, that
*salvation* happens. This is the point at which the believer *dies* to
their old way of life, and is *born again* in spirit and truth.

Salvation is a gift from God. Those who accept that gift die to their
old life.

**Can one study the Bible without actually having a close relationship
with Christ?**

It depends on what you mean by "study the Bible." You can absolutely
read the Bible and gain nothing from the experience except for reading a
story about something that happened to some people about 2000 years ago.

But the Bible, being the inspired word of God, will change you *if you
let it*.

The difference is **how you read**.

If you enter into your time of reading prayerfully, asking God to clear
your heart to accept the truth of the words in Scripture, he will allow
the words to touch your heart. True transformation is of God, not of us
reading a book. The book doesn't do the work; the words on the page
don't do the work, **God does the work**. And God will only do the work
*when you let him*. He respects your free will and will never force you
to believe. But he will never say no if you ask.

So if you read the Bible without preparing an open mind and an open
heart, and without doing so after prayerfully asking God to allow the
words to speak to your soul, all you'll be doing is reading a book. But
if you accept that the Bible is the inspired word of God, if you open
your heart to its truths, and you humbly ask God to whisper his truth to
you through your reading, ***this book will change your life.***
