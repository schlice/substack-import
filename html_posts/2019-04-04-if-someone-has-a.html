**If someone has a so-called \'disability\' does he have additional
rights if facing an eviction?**

The wording of your question is quite telling.

So let's start with the most blaring point: *do you have a disability,
or do you not?* A person with disability is defined by the Americans
with Disabilities Act as "a person who has a physical or mental
impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activity."
So there is either a disability, or there is not.

But this is covered by the Fair Housing Act, not ADA.

There's a lot to digest there, but if you can find evidence that the
eviction is based on the disability, or even the perception that someone
is disabled, you may have a claim under the Fair Housing Act.
