**Am I required to retroactively meet city water codes in CA? Water
company is saying I must install a backflow preventer because I have
fire sprinklers. They met code, were inspected and signed off on when I
had them put in.**

You can't "retroactively" meet a code. You can only meet codes as they
are listed today.

Now, if they want to ***fine*** you for not previously meeting a code,
you can then show them that the inspectors signed off on the
configuration as it is, so that's on them.

But you can only meet codes as they are today. And if code today says
that you need a backflow preventer, you have to add it today, because
the code today says you must have it. And you will likely have to get it
re-inspected once you install the device.
