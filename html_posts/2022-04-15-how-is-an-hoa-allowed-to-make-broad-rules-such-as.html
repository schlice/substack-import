The way it is normally written in HOA Governing Documents is that the
group which does Architectural Review (either known as the Architectural
Review Board or the Architectural Approval Board) has **complete
control** over what the neighborhood looks like, and it is their **sole
discretion** which determines what stays and what goes.

The guidelines in the neighborhood would be just that: guidelines. The
ultimate authority is the ARB.

So if you were to do what others suggest (such as, where in the CC&Rs
does it say you can't grow ivy, etc), you'll likely be referred to the
section in the CC&Rs which gives the ARB the sole authority to determine
what changes can stay and what changes must go.

Original question:

How is an HOA allowed to make broad rules such as, \" unsightly
growth\"? I asked if I could grow creeping fig around my front door. The
response I received was ,\" you cannot grow ivy it is considered
unsightly growth.\"
