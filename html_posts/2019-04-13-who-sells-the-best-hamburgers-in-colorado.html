**Who sells the best hamburgers in Colorado?**

There are chains all over the place that sell really good burgers.
Smashburger is a chain which actually started in Colorado (Denver) and
now has locations in other states as well. Plenty of other chains
(Crave, Drifter's, Bad Daddy, etc) are also here and serve decent
burgers. If you're in town and looking for a great burger,
[[Yelp](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=1d1053&url=https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc%3Dburgers%26find_loc%3DColorado%2BSprings%252C%2BCO%26ns%3D1){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="yelp.com"}]{.qlink_container} is the place to go to find one
near you. I highly recommend it.

But if you want a truly original restaurant that's not a chain serving
up great burgers, you cannot go wrong with [[The Skirted
Heifer](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=efe7d4&url=http://skirtedheifer.com/%23home){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="skirtedheifer.com"}]{.qlink_container}.

In fact, it's so good that Guy Fieri visited it on [[an
episode](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=1bd32c&url=https://www.foodnetwork.com/shows/diners-drive-ins-and-dives/episodes/between-the-bread){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="foodnetwork.com"}]{.qlink_container} of his Food Network
[[TV
show](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=7d10c3&url=https://www.dinersdriveinsdiveslocations.com/skirted-heifer-colorado.html){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="dinersdriveinsdiveslocations.com"}]{.qlink_container},
*Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives*. The owner also competed on Guy's other
Food Network show, *Guy's Grocery Games*.
