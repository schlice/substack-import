*(US answer only, your country's bike laws may be different)*

The only way a bike lane would be deemed "unsafe" is if there is a
hazard in the bike lane (i.e. ice, loose gravel, etc). This occasionally
happens after sand/gravel is used during a snowstorm and then the snow
melts before street sweepers can get out to pick up the sand/gravel. The
passing vehicles will tend to push the sand and gravel into the bike
lane.

If that is true, or if any other hazard exists in the bike lane, the
bicyclist can ride in the traffic lane, as close to the bike lane as is
safely possible, on the right hand side of the vehicle lane, as if the
bike lane wasn't even there. Follow the same traffic laws you would
follow if there were no bike lane there in the first place: ride as
close to the shoulder as is safe to do so, move into the lane to cross
an intersection, move into a turn lane to make a left turn, etc.

If there is an issue with a bike lane, please report it to your city's
street maintenance division as soon as is practical.

And as always in the US, state laws vary wildly from state to state, and
your state may have different laws than the general guidelines I
presented here. Never take anything you read on the Internet as a
substitute for doing your own research into your own local traffic laws,
especially if you are planning on riding a bike in traffic.

*For the time being, I have re-enabled comments on selected answers.
Some people like to comment. Some people like to engage with me in a
civil manner, and I did kinda miss that\...a little. But do not
misunderstand, I take this step very cautiously, and I have no tolerance
for harassing or inane behavior. If you don\'t like what I wrote, tough
shit. If my answer is grammatically low-quality or is un-cited opinion
masquerading as fact, downvote it. If you think I\'m wrong, write your
own answer. But Quora is a question-and-answer site, not a debate site.
If you are simply commenting to tell me \"ackshually, you\'re wrong,\"
don\'t be surprised if I quietly delete your comment. Put anything
vaguely harassing in there, and your deletion will be followed by a
block/mute, and a BNBR report. I will do this immediately and with no
compunction. You have been warned. Be nice.*
