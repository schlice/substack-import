When you're not working at your job, you can do whatever you choose with
your off-duty time. The regions where Air Force bases are quite diverse
and within a few hours' drive or train ride of any of them, you can
reach nearly every corner of the world.

Each job is different, and the requirements in each position in which
you find yourself could limit how far away from your duty station you
can go. But each one of those requirements is different depending on the
position you are billeted to.

You should discuss those restrictions with your immediate supervisor
when you get to your duty station. The transition office at each Air
Force base has all sorts of information on what you can do on and off
base.

Hopefully this is what you were asking. If not, please add some more
description to the Question Comments, and I'll revise.
