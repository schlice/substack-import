**What are NORAD\'s procedures for planes with a 7600 code or radio
failure?**

NORAD defers to the Regional ATC Centers for actual ATC matters. NORAD
is only engaged when an aircraft without a valid flight plan crosses the
ADIZ, or when an aircraft veers off of its assigned flight plan and is
unresponsive to ATC communications.
