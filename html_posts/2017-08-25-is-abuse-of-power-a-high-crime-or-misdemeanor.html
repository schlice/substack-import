"High crimes and misdemeanors" is not a legal term, but a political one.

Therefore, abuse of power *can* be a "high crime and/or misdemeanor,"
and the agency charged with oversight of that office could call for
impeachment proceedings if they can *substantiate* a charge of "abuse of
power."

But what, exactly, is "abuse of power?" It can also be called
"malfeasance in office" or "official misconduct." It is the commission
of an unlawful act, in an official capacity, which affects the
performance of official duties. It is also using official power for
personal gain.

So in order to substantiate a charge of abuse of power, you have to show
that the officiant:

- Committed an unlawful act in an official capacity
- **And** that this unlawful act affected the officiant's ability to
  perform his or her duties

or that the officiant:

- Used official powers of the office for personal gain
