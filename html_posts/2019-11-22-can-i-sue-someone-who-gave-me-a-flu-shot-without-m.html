**Can I sue someone who gave me a flu shot without me signing the
consent form? If so, what type of lawyer should I contact on this
matter?**

You can sue anyone for anything in the United States.

The question remains: will you prevail?

Historical precedent says you will not prevail.

> An adult\'s consent may be expressed in writing or declared verbally.

So, to that end:

- Did you present yourself to the doctor who gave you the shot?
- Did you know what you were being injected with? If not, what did you
  think it was?
- Did you complain at the time of injection?

Your behavior indicated consent, and the doctor was right to proceed.
