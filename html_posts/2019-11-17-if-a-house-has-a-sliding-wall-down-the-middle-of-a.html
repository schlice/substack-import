**If a house has a sliding wall down the middle of a large room, two
closets and 2 windows, can this space be considered 2 bedrooms? Would a
building inspector or lender have any problems with it?**

It should be fine to call it two bedrooms. However, as you know, all
states are different, and each state can define a bedroom differently.

Some states may consider the sliding wall as a "door" and therefore
classify the space as one room. Others may consider the sliding wall as
a wall, and the two individual spaces, both meeting the requirements of
a bedroom, can be considered individual rooms.

In general, most states follow the [[International Residential
Code](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=451cae&url=https://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?c%3Dbldrs_lenders_raters.nh_IRC){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="energystar.gov"}]{.qlink_container} which states, among
other things, that the rooms must be a minimum of 7 feet in any
horizontal direction. On the height issue, at least 50% of the room must
have 7 foot ceilings, even though the rest of the room can be smaller.
The room can be no smaller than 70 sq ft. (so your 2′x35′ room won't
work, even though it's 70 sq ft).

Additionally, each "room" must have two egresses. Generally one of these
is an entrance from the house, and another one is usually the window or
another door.

A bedroom **must** have a window to the outside. The window can be
between 24 and 44 inches from the floor. It needs at least 5.7 square
feet for the opening, and it must measure no less than 24 inches high
and 20 inches wide.

A bedroom also needs installed heating ducts, and a separate light.

While it's nice that both rooms have a closet, **the closet is actually
not a legal requirement to make a bedroom.**

I would think that if you wanted to call them two bedrooms, both spaces
would have to meet the minimum definition of a bedroom with the wall
closed. In other words, with the wall closed, both rooms need two
egresses not counting the wall, both need appropriate windows, and both
must be 70 sq ft and have no horizontal area smaller than 7 feet.

If your second "bedroom" is using the sliding wall as an "egress," I
think a real estate agent or a home inspector would have a hard time
classifying it as a "wall" instead of a "door," which would also mean
that you can't call one of the partitioned spaces a separate "room." You
can call it a "retreat" from the main room, but if it doesn't meet all
of the definitions of a bedroom, it can't be listed as a bedroom.
