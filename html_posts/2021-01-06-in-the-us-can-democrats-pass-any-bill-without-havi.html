**In the US, can Democrats pass any bill without having a majority in
the Senate?**

Yes!

A majority in the Senate is not required to pass a bill. You, as a
Democrat Senator, must reach consensus with your Republican
counterparts, and a bill can certainly be crafted that would pass both
Republican and Democrat scrutiny.

You need a majority in the Senate (to go along with the majority in the
House) to pass legislation that Republicans, by and large, *do not agree
with*. In other words, in order to *advance your agenda*, you need a
majority. Then, a party-line vote will fall your way.

You don't need a majority to pass any bill. You need a majority to pass
bills which the other party finds objectionable, and then you can pass
those bills *over their objections*.

*Sorry, no comments on this one.*

*If you don\'t like what I wrote, tough shit. If my answer is
grammatically low-quality or is un-cited opinion masquerading as fact,
downvote it. If you think I\'m wrong, write your own answer. But Quora
is a question-and-answer site, not a debate site. If you were simply
going to comment to tell me \"ackshually, you\'re wrong,\" then you're
the reason why I disable comments. Well done, Karen. You ruined it for
everyone.*
