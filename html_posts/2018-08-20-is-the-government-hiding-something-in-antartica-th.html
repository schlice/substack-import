**Is the government hiding something in Antartica that they don\'t want
us to see? Is that why planes can\'t fly over Antartic?**

Ice. Lots and lots of ice. That's what the government doesn't want you
to see.

To be more specific, they don't want you to see ice *up close and
personal.*

The problems with overflying the Antarctic:

1.  Cold weather affecting the aircraft
2.  Rescue/recovery efforts over such uninhabited, remote, and
    difficult-to-reach areas
3.  Commercial aircraft would be required to carry cold weather gear for
    all passengers

You could save thousands of hours of flying time and fuel consumption by
going over the poles, but the aircraft requirements to do so, including
the increased weight carrying cold weather gear, would limit the number
of passengers such a flight could hold, and would be extremely dangerous
if an aircraft went down.
