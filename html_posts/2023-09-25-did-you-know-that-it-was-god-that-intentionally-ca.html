I think you have misused the term "intentionally."

There is a great difference between *omniscience* and *predestination*.
People have a really hard time wrapping their heads around this.

**God can simultaneously know what will happen without influencing the
free will of the people involved.**

God desires you to have free will. In fact, He desires it so greatly
that He will voluntarily allow you to choose evil and condemn yourself
to eternal death. He wants your choice to love Him to be **totally
free.**

But in order for it to be totally free, you must have a compelling
alternative.

Let me give you an example. If I set two bowls down in front of you, and
one contains ice cream and the other contains dead decaying rats, which
one will you choose to eat? Now, I don't even have the gift of
omniscience and I can tell you with 99.9% certainty which one you will
choose.

Now, if I set two bowls down in front of you and one contains vanilla
ice cream and the other contains chocolate ice cream, *now* which one
will you choose?

The fact that the choices are so closely desirable is what makes the
decision truly free. In the first example, you have the "appearance" of
choice, but no one would actually choose the dead rats to eat. So there
really isn't a choice. In the second example, you are choosing between
two equally palatable choices, so you really do have a free choice.

In the Garden, God had to do the same thing. He gave Adam and Eve the
chance to obey Him and love Him, but He also gave them a compelling
alternative. It had to be flashy and attractive, otherwise it would be
easy to resist. So the choice was clear: love God, obey God and ignore
the fruit, or listen to the serpent and go for the potential gains of
eating the fruit (and sin against God in doing so).

God knew what choice they would make. But the point is to establish a
life wherein you get to make that choice freely, without coercion.
That's what God desired to do, and that's why He built the system in
this way.
