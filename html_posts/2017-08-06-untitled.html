Really? Alarmist much?

From the article YOU quoted:

So not only were the regulations which were corrected overly broad,
covering waterways which have no connection to navigable rivers and
lakes, and have no connection to manufacturing pollution, but those very
same regulations have been in limbo since a stay was issued by the
appeals court in 2015. So farmers were unable to use those waters for
their farms without Federal government approval.

Also, no one wants to see the regulations simply disappear. This is
simply a Federalist attitude (if the EPA isn't playing "Big Brother,"
states won't be able to care for their own waterways). This would simply
return control of about 60% of river and stream miles in the lower 48 to
states, especially for waterways which do not cross state lines and the
Federal government should not rightly have control over. That's called
"Federal overreach."
