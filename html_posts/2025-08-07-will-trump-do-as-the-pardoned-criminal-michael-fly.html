**Will Trump do, as the pardoned criminal Michael Flynn has demanded,
and impose martial law to re-run the election at gun point?**

First, he's not "demanding" anything, nor is he even suggesting that the
President "should" act this way.

He simply stated that *if he wanted to*, he could impose martial law and
send in the military to seize voting machines and essentially "re-run"
the election in certain states.

It's most likely that the President will simply ignore this statement.
As the President has surely been informed, not only would such a move be
incredibly unwise, it might also be illegal. Invocation of the
Insurrection Act only occurs when the fully-constituted military forces
of the states cannot quell an insurrection, and the state appeals to the
federal government to step in. It does not permit the federal government
to send in troops on its own.
