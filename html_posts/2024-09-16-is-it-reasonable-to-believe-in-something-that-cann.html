Certainly! You believe in many things which cannot be seen or felt, and
you probably don't even realize it. By "seen or felt," we're talking
about things which can be interpreted by the senses, and proven by
science. Here's an example of just five things that can't be
scientifically proven but that we're all rational to accept:

- Math and logic. Science can't prove them because science presupposes
  them, so to prove them by science would be circular reasoning.
- Metaphysical truths, such as there are minds that exist outside of my
  own, or that the external world is real, or that the past was not
  created five minutes ago but has the appearance of age.
- Ethical beliefs about statements of value (i.e. you can't show by
  science whether the Nazis were evil)
- Aesthetic judgments. The beautiful, like the good, cannot be proven
  through science.

And most surprisingly:

- Science itself. Science cannot be justified by the scientific method.
  For example, in the special theory of relativity, there is an
  assumption that the speed of light is constant between two points in a
  single direction, but that cannot be proven. You have to assume that
  to be true in order to do your experiment. Also, the belief that the
  scientific method discovers truth itself cannot be proven by the
  scientific method. You also have to assume that to be true in order to
  do your experiment.

Let me ask you a question: *why do you think that the senses are the
only way to discover truth?* In other words, do you believe that the
scientific method is the only way to discover truth? As we have already
discovered, the belief that the scientific method produces truth cannot
be proven through the scientific method, and clearly, to try to do so
would be circular logic anyway, so it is a self-defeating statement.

The truth is that the senses are just *one way* to discover truth, but
they are not the *only* way. We need a different toolset to discover
truths about things which cannot be perceived with the senses, because
clearly science is not the right method.

It is through the realm of philosophy and logic that we probe truths
which cannot be proven using science. Philosophy helps us to discover
truths about things which cannot be determined using the senses. In this
way, we can come to a belief about the existence of God beyond a
reasonable doubt (but not beyond all doubt).
