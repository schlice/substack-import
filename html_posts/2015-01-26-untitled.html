**Content:** [A few problems I have with your state\'s \"safe storage\"
law:\
\
1. Your state licenses gun ownership. This is in violation of the
Constitution. Unless he is a felon, \"the right to keep and bear Arms
shall not be infringed.\" *DC v Heller* upheld the individual right to
bear arms. Your state\'s law is unconstitutional and should be
challenged. So I\'m guessing you live in either Illinois or New York.\
\
2. It\'s clear that \"unintended consequences\" happen all the time when
writing law. We would have to make several things clear in the law:\
a. This would only be a civil penalty, not a crime. Thus, no jail time.\
b. The only penalty would be monetary fines.\
c. The State cannot be harmed by you improperly storing firearms. So you
cannot be \"charged\" by a police officer, or have a police officer
write you a citation for improperly storing your firearm.\
In this way, this penalty can only be assessed if someone is harmed by
your handgun and you made absolutely no efforts to store it properly.
The law can be crafted in such a way that it only hurts you if you
don\'t immediately report your gun as stolen (i.e. within 24 hours of
discovering the theft), and/or if you failed to properly store a firearm
(i.e. stored it loaded, unlocked, in a drawer, didn\'t make any effort
to separate the gun from the ammo, etc) and someone got hurt.\
\
You also assumed that you didn\'t have kids. I do. What if my kid went
to his friend\'s house and was playing with a loaded gun that the parent
didn\'t lock up? If your state has no \"safe storage\" law, I can sue
him for negligence, but he\'s under no legal obligation to lock up his
weapons in order to keep kids safe. If he wants to endanger his own
kids, that\'s his business I guess. But if he endangers my kids, now we
have a problem.]{.rendered_qtext}
