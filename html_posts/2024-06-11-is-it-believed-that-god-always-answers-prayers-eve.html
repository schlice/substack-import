Well, yes and no. Yes, God always answers prayers, but not in the way
that you think. Because God isn't some cosmic vending machine where you
put your prayers in the little coin slot and your wish comes out the
little door. **God only intervenes in our lives when our prayers align
with His will for us.** This causes frustration for believers; they
sometimes feel like God doesn't hear them or He's not answering their
prayer. He does hear, and He does answer.

Usually, that answer will be one of these four answers: **No, Slow,
Grow,** or **Go.**

- **No.** What you're asking is not in line with what God has planned
  for your life. So praying to hit the lottery probably won't make you
  the next big Powerball winner. Who knows, maybe God wants you to win
  it big, but based on what He thinks of the love of money, I'd bet not.
- **Slow.** What you're praying for is in line with God's plans, but
  it's not in His time. He will make all His plans come to fruition *in
  His time, not in ours.* So this is a bit of "Okay, I got you, but wait
  for a tic."
- **Grow.** What you're praying for is in line with God's plans, and He
  is ready to do it, **but you are not**. Perhaps you need to grow more
  as a believer before He allows you to take on the new responsibilities
  which come along with what you're asking.
- **Go.** What you're asking for is in line with God's plans, and both
  He and you are ready for it, so *off you go*, your prayers are
  answered in the way you prayed them.

The TLDR here is that **God does always answer prayers, but "no" is also
a valid answer.**
