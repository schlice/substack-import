Mostly it's to soothe their aching conscience. But they have to do it in
a very specific way and then convince themselves that Christians have
failed to meet their standard. Then they can continue to justify their
disbelief.

How this works is that they demand ***scientific proof*** of the
existence of God. Some kind of scientific test, like some postulate
using the scientific method, which affirmatively proves the existence of
God.

But of course, if God actually does exist, He is necessarily
*immaterial* because He created the universe and all of the material in
it. Thus, He cannot be material; He cannot be a part of the universe, or
made of the same stuff as the universe, as He created it and can't come
from it.

Therefore, no scientific inquiry we could ever undertake could prove the
existence of God, because science cannot detect the immaterial. It's not
that we haven't found Him *yet*, it's that it is *impossible* to do so.
It's like using an X-ray machine to find a plastic cup. It's simply the
wrong tool.

**But that's the point.** If science can't prove the existence of God,
the atheists say, then I can safely deny He exists, and I can feel good
about my choice.

But just because there isn't *scientific* evidence of God's existence,
there is *philosophical* evidence of it. And there is just enough of
that to convince anyone **willing** to believe. But that lack of
physical evidence provides just enough ambiguity so as to not coerce the
**unwilling**.

So ultimately, it comes down to a matter of *faith*. If you are willing
to believe, then the evidence we do have is sufficient to fill the gaps.
Faith spans the gap between the *undeniable* and the *unknowable*.

Without that faith, you can't make the leap from the undeniable to the
unknowable, and you reside in disbelief.

God permits this because of His great desire for us to exercise our
*free will*. He would never force us to believe in Him, and any proof of
His existence beyond what we have today would coerce the unwilling to
believe, and He doesn't want that. He only wants those in His presence
who are willing to be there. For love can only ever be freely given; it
can never be coerced.
