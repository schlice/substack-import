If you truly want to dissolve your HOA in Florida, you will need to
consult with a real estate attorney in your area who specializes in HOA
law.

Dissolving an HOA is possible, but it is not free, and it is not easy.

For example, the HOA usually owns some property, even if it is just
small areas of grass where the monolith (the sign at the entrance)
lives. That property will need to be sold or gifted to someone.
Utilities for water and electricity in the common areas will need to be
terminated. Insurance policies for the common areas and for the
Directors will need to be cancelled (and any associated fees paid).

And that's just the stuff pertaining to the HOA itself. In order to
dissolve a mandatory HOA, you will need signatures from 100% of the
homeowners in the affected area. If there is just one holdout who likes
what the HOA does for him, you can't dissolve it. The homeowners then
need to get new deeds filed (which don't have an attached HOA) with
their lienholders, assuming they mortgaged their home purchase. Ergo,
more lawyers (read: not cheap)

And even if you do dissolve the HOA, there is usually still a larger
property owner's association (POA) which your HOA belonged to, and
you'll still belong to that, and you can't dissolve that one. Normally
you'd pay those dues once a year (or your HOA would pay that for you),
but it still exists.
