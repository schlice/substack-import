Solumedrol is an anti-inflammatory glucocorticoid, which contains
methylprednisolone sodium succinate as the active ingredient.

In other words, it's an anti-inflammatory drug.

In a MS flare, inflammation in the nerves caused by the disease action
brings on the symptoms, and reducing systemic inflammation can help to
alleviate the symptoms faster.
