**Content:** [Current training de-emphasizes the use of such a phrase.
What is recommended now would be something similar to this:\
\
\"Good afternoon, my name is X from Y Police Department. I stopped you
today because you were going 54 miles per hour in a posted 35 mile per
hour zone. Is anything wrong? Is there any reason you\'re going this
fast?\"\
\
The infraction is what it is. It\'s a matter of what the radar says.
Asking the person whether or not they know if they were speeding makes
them admit that they\'re a poor driver and they weren\'t paying
attention to their speed. It provides nothing beneficial to the
conversation.\
\
It\'s more productive to ask someone if there is a *reason* why they
were going so fast. Is it because there is a medical emergency? Is it
because they\'re late to a meeting? Is it because they simply weren\'t
paying attention? It may not make any difference whatsoever, but it just
might.]{.rendered_qtext}
