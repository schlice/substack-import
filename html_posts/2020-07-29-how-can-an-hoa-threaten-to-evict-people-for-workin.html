**How can an HOA threaten to evict people for working from home during
the Wuhan coronavirus pandemic?**

Homeowner's Associations have broad authority to control what happens
within their areas of jurisdiction.

Many HOAs have rules about the kinds of activities that can take place
inside of a home when they may impact the outside of the home. For
example, if you wanted to open up a barbershop in the garage of your
residential home in your neighborhood, the HOA might be concerned with
things like increased traffic flow and parking, citing safety concerns
about the abnormal amount of traffic endangering children playing in the
neighborhood.

But when everyone is social distancing and the only people with jobs are
essential workers or people who can telework or work remotely, the rules
should not apply.

There are always corner cases like this one, but this is exactly that: a
corner case. The fact of the matter is that many more people are now
working from home, and it doesn't impact the community because they
haven't opened a business or increased traffic into the neighborhood.

If you have a condo complex and, maybe, you have shared Internet
bandwidth, you may have to establish a rule that says you must buy your
own individual Internet plan so that you don't bottleneck the network
for everyone else, but even then, you can work around the issue.

But enforcing a rule because "that's what the words on the paper say" is
stupid. I'm certain those 28 people could get together and file a class
action lawsuit against the HOA and collect a tidy sum, get their units
back, and get the rule changed, all at the same time.
