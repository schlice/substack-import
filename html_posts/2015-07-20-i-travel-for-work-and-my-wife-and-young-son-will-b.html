Ultimately, what everyone has been hinting around but hasn\'t really
articulated is a ***layered defense*** strategy to your home.

There was an old story that is appropriate here. Two hunters in Africa
came upon a very hungry lion about a mile away that started to stalk
them. Upon determining that they were being threatened, the first hunter
stopped, took off his backpack, reached inside, and grabbed a pair of
running shoes.

The second hunter said, \"Why are you bothering to put running shoes on?
You can\'t outrun a lion!\"

The first hunter replied, \"I don\'t need to outrun a lion. I only need
to outrun *you.*\"

While tongue-in-cheek, the reality is still there. Ideally, you don\'t
have to make your home a fortress. You only have to make it *less
attractive* to a burglar than your neighbor\'s home.

Using the layered defense approach, start from the curb and move in.

- From the curb: Everyone\'s suggestions here are appropriate: clear out
  vegetation that conceals the front of your home from the street (plus
  it increases home value by increasing curb appeal). Clear out
  shrubbery that conceal someone\'s actions in and around your windows,
  or perhaps plant thorny shrubs underneath your windows. Add security
  lights, motion-sensing floodlights, or put your exterior lights on
  timers or light sensors so they come on at night and go off in the
  morning.
- Around the exterior: Reinforcing doors and windows can be done
  inexpensively. In older wood-frame windows, adding screws in the
  fixed-pane or in the track so that windows cannot advance beyond a
  certain point and reinforcing main front door hinges with 3\" or
  longer security screws that go all the way into the doorframe are
  sensible and inexpensive fixes which will increase security.
- Interior: Install a dog. I can\'t stress enough how important this is.
  Even if you don\'t get an actual dog, there are bark simulator units
  which are inexpensive which will go off at the slightest sound and
  will bark for several minutes in a random pattern that will fool
  almost anyone except the person paying very close attention to the
  barks. I had a big dog with a big bark but she was the friendliest dog
  you\'d ever meet. If the burglar actually made it in, she would have
  most assuredly warmly greeted them and licked them to death. **But you
  wouldn\'t know it from her bark**. Remember the expression, \"his bark
  is worse than his bite?\" That was my dog. A burglar will not take the
  chance that this isn\'t a cute cuddly Labrador and is actually a Pit
  Bull; he will move on to a less chancy target.
- Interior: (optional) Install an alarm system. Many modern alarm
  systems require very easy do-it-yourself installation (no wires) and
  have very low monitoring fees. You can buy them online and they are
  not ridiculously expensive. Alternatively, systems from bigger
  companies offer more advanced features, like video surveillance and
  remote system operation and control over the Internet.
- Deep Interior: Set up a panic room. Replace one closet door with a
  solid-core door, steel-reinforced hinges that swing inward, a peep
  hole, and a deadbolt. Inside, keep water and a previously-deactivated
  cell phone and charge cable (nearly all cell phones that do not have
  an active service contract will still dial 911). That\'s where you
  keep your baseball bat and (if you choose) a defensive weapon. If
  someone manages to get inside, get into the panic room and lock the
  door. Call 911 and continually announce to the intruders, \"I\'m on
  the phone with the police and I have a gun, do not come in here or I
  will shoot you\" whether you have a gun or not.
