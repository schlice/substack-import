We're going to have to be very careful to parse our words succinctly in
order to properly answer your question.

Most religions already do coexist harmoniously. With the exception of
one major world religion's radical arm, I don't really see any religions
waging holy war anymore. They kinda got over that a few hundred years
ago.

Now here's where we have to be cautious with our words.

*You will never get different religions to believe the same thing.*

Every religion which makes truth claims will claim that their religion
is "right," and logically, by extension, all other religions which do
not believe as they do are "wrong." This is true for all religions.

Yes, some religions say that all religions are right and they all
believe the same thing, but that's very disingenuous. Not all religions
believe the same thing. Just as an example, Christianity says that Jesus
rose from the dead; Islam says that Jesus never died. Christianity says
that Jesus is God; Judaism says that He is not. Clearly, they do not
believe the same things.

\

So here's the takeaway: Religions understand each other. We tolerate
other believers who wish to believe in whatever they want.

But different religions all believe differently. That's why there are
different religions. If they all believed the same thing, there'd be
only one religion.
