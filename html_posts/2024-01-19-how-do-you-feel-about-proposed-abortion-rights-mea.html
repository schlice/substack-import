Viability clauses make for bad law, for a number of reasons.

1.  Viability is a moving target. As medicine advances, babies are
    surviving at younger and younger gestational ages. For example, the
    current (2023) average minimum gestational age is about 28 weeks.
    [[But technology will change that, and
    soon.](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=b91327&url=https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Wellness/artificial-wombs-tested-human-trials-new-technology/story?id%3D103356485){.external_link
    rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
    onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
    qt-tooltip="go.com"}]{.qlink_container} Babies will survive earlier
    and earlier as medical technology advances. Adding a viability
    clause makes bad law because no one has a definite minimum date of
    viability.
2.  What does "viability" even mean? Does that mean survival without any
    assistance at all? Or does that mean survival with medical
    intervention? Does it mean survival in an artificial womb? We'd have
    to agree on a definition of viability.
3.  What difference does viability make? Why is a baby worthy of death
    because it can't survive outside of the womb? If the thought is,
    "the baby can survive if we do nothing to help it," then the logic
    is incorrect, because "do nothing" means leave it exactly where it
    is until it naturally leaves the womb. "Do nothing" does not involve
    killing a living human being, regardless of its stage of development
    or its "viability" outside of the womb.
