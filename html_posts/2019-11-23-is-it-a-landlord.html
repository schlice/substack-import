**Is it a landlord's responsibility to fix everything a tenant breaks?**

As with all legal questions, the answer is "it depends."

Usually, your lease agreement will spell out how you go about getting
repairs, and what they will do if they find a repair to be your fault
and not covered under your standard lease agreement.

Generally, in that situation, the landlord will fix the issue and will
bill you for the repair. Sometimes, landlords will tell tenants to
contract out the repair (and pay for it). Sometimes, they will simply
deduct the cost of the repair from your security deposit. But in nearly
all circumstances, the decision about how to proceed is solely up to the
landlord to decide.
