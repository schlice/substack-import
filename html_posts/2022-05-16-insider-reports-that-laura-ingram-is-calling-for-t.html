The Marshal of the Supreme Court is already investigating. The Marshal,
if he finds evidence of criminal wrongdoing, will turn his evidence over
to Federal prosecutors. If the Marshal's office needs assistance, they
can absolutely call in the FBI as they see fit. But calling on someone
else to do the investigation which is already taking place is probably
unnecessary.

But I am noticing that plenty of people are on Quora answering this
question and saying that there was no violation of law. That answer is,
simply, wrong. Here is just a potential list of crimes which the leaker
could be charged with:

- Disclosure of confidential information (18 USC § 1905) is most
  certainly still on the table, as it doesn't require the documents to
  be classified to be "confidential." The unfinished work product of
  Supreme Court justices is most certainly not eligible for public
  release.
- A law which came on the books as part of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of
  2002, Corruptly Influencing an Official Proceeding (18 USC §
  1512(c)(2)) is on the table if the leaker intended to sway the Court's
  opinions using public pressure brought on by the leak.
- And while it has only been tried once and the case never concluded, a
  determined prosecutor could make the case that Conspiracy to Defraud
  the US (18 USC § 371) also applies. In 1919, Ashton Embry, a clerk to
  Supreme Court Justice Joseph McKenna, sent an opinion to some Wall
  Street executives ahead of a judgment involving a railroad company. He
  was indicted for having violated § 371. The prosecution's theory was
  that, by releasing the opinion early, the clerk and his
  "co-conspirators deprived the Court of the right to announce its
  decisions at the customary time." At the very least, the Embry case
  puts to rest the argument that law clerks have never been prosecuted
  for leaking Court documents.

There are others, but they are less likely to be able to stick. For
example, Theft of Government Documents (18 USC § 1691) may not apply if
the clerk didn't actually "steal" the documents because they already had
legal access to them. So that one may not stick.

However, this should at least tell you that when people say that "there
is no criminal statute" that makes leaking draft court opinions
"illegal," they are simply incorrect.
