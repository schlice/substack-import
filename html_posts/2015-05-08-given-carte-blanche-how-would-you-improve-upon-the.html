My #1 change would be to give it to the Army. It is a CAS fighter,
period. Let the Army fly it. Army Aviation is currently limited to
rotary-wing aircraft; I\'d say let them expand into fixed-wing CAS
rather than relying on the Apache for CAS. It suits their role better.\
\
But if the Air Force is to keep it, then they should double down on
their investment and rebuild it with all modern avionics and engines.
Keep the Vulcan of course, but rebuild the rest. And keep the manual
reversion, it has saved more pilots than I can tell
you.]{.rendered_qtext}
