Celebrate.

Also, **keep working to enhance the culture of life.**

Talk to your legislators. It's time to start talking about pregnancy
resource centers again. We need to dump money into these places, so that
new mothers (if they choose to keep their babies) have all the resources
they need to start out strong. Not only financial and materiel support,
but education and post-natal healthcare, even mental health services
should all be accessible or linked to pregnancy resource centers. You
shouldn't be able to swing a stick on a street corner in American towns
without hitting a PRC. They should be everywhere and they should be free
to expectant/new mothers.

If they don't choose to keep their babies, we also need to talk about
removing the barriers to adoption in this country. As it stands, there
are at least 36 couples waiting to adopt a baby for every one baby
placed for adoption. The availability of adoptive parents is not at
question. The problem is the *years* of bureaucratic red tape they have
to navigate in order to complete their adoption. We must work to slash
that barrier.

Making progress is good. But don't take your foot off the accelerator.
Keep moving forward.
