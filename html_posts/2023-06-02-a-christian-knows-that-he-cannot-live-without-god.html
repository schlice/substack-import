Because the world was designed in such a way that you can live a
perfectly happy, contented life without ever knowing God. As many of the
answers here have already told you, they've lived all this time without
God, and I can tell you that they can literally live out the rest of
their days without Him, too. And they'll live quite happily, I'm
certain, until they die. They can either mock Him (as some have done),
or simply say that they've successfully lived this long without Him and
they certainly don't appear to need Him. In any case, they'll all
continue to live quite happily without Him until they die.

The question is **what happens** ***next*.**

The atheist will tell you, "Well, you die, and you're just gone. That's
it. There's nothing more. Your life is over. You live as good as you
can, but then when your time comes, there is nothing. A big void, a
blackness. Your existence just terminates."

The Christian will tell you, "Well, you die, and then you will stand
before the throne of judgement, where God will judge your life, and you
will have to atone for your sin. And if you haven't accepted Him as your
Savior before you die, you won't get another chance at eternity."

So who is right? Can we be certain? If there's a god, why don't I see
him? Why doesn't he help me with this life?

So ask yourself this question: since we can't know for sure, is it
better to live as if God exists, or as if He doesn't?

This is the basis of "Pascal's Wager" which I paraphrase like this:

**If I'm wrong, and there is no God, I've lost nothing. But if you're
wrong, and there is a God, you've lost everything.**
