**Is there anything I can do about my nieghbor parking his car in front
of my property? I have heard that the road is still concidered public
space and we don\'t have an HOA where I live, so I don\'t think I can do
anything. What do you think?**

You can do the neighborly thing and talk to your neighbor. Tell him why
it's so important that you have the opportunity to park in front of your
own property and ask that he show you the same courtesy.

Beyond that, there is nothing legal you can do. The road is owned by
your local government, and if they don't restrict on-street parking,
then anyone can park there.
