**Should or could the impeachment charges against ex-President Donald
John Trump be amended or expanded?**

The impeachment is complete. It cannot be expanded or amended, as it has
already been transmitted to the Senate, and to modify it now would
require a new Bill of Impeachment. The House cannot pass a new one as
the person is no longer a Federal official. You cannot impeach someone
who is no longer a Federal official.

Which poses an interesting Constitutional question for the trial: ***how
can you try someone in Congress who is not a Federal official?*** You
may have noticed that Chief Justice Roberts declined to serve as the
judge for the trial. He's right to decline, as he can only serve when
the President is on trial. The president is not on trial, a private
citizen is on trial (which is also an issue, and we'll get there). The
Vice President (the President of the Senate) would be the next logical
choice, but she cannot preside, as she has a direct conflict of
interest, which is why they chose Sen. Leahy. The framers of the
Constitution never contemplated an ex-President being tried, as the
punishment is moot (removal from office).

The Constitution specifically forbids Congress trying private citizens
in its prohibition against ***Bills of Attainder***. A Bill of Attainder
is a legislative act that singles out an individual citizen or group of
citizens for punishment without a trial, and while we call the Senate
proceedings a "trial," it is actually not, because the Senate "trial" is
only for Federal officials, not private citizens. The Constitution
provides that \"\[n\]o **Bill of Attainder** or ex post facto Law will
be passed\" (Article I, Section 9, Paragraph 3). Simply put, you cannot
try a civilian in a political venue, especially when the result could be
a punishment.

But Trump is no ordinary citizen; he is a former President. So the
Senate will have to vote to determine whether or not they should proceed
with a trial. Of course, the Senate will vote that it does have standing
to try an ex-President, but it will be a very close vote. It might even
be 50--50, and the Vice President will have to break the tie.

But this also means that there is no way in the Hot Place that you'll
get 2/3 to convict, mostly because of what we just talked about:
Congress does not have standing to punish a civilian, and Congress is
Constitutionally prohibited from passing a Bill of Attainder, which is
what any punishment against a civilian would amount to. So you will find
that if a trial goes forward (unconstitutionally, of course), many of
the people who vote against any punishment will do so because they
recognize the lack of Constitutional authority, and the specific
prohibition against Bills of Attainder.

And ***even if they did***, while unlikely, Trump, as a private citizen,
would have valid grounds to contest the bill in Federal court as a
Constitutional violation against a Bill of Attainder.

If you are simply commenting to tell me \"ackshually, you\'re wrong,\"
don\'t be surprised if I quietly delete your comment. Put anything
