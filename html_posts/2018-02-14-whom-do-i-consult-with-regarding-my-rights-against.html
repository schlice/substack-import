**Whom do I consult with regarding my rights against getting embalmed? I
do not want my blood removed.**

If you don't want to be embalmed, there are only a few things that can
be done with your corpse after you are dead. Your best bet is to talk to
an estate planning attorney and draw up a funeral plan which specifies
what you would like done with your body after you die. The plan should
be given to the executor of your estate, your spouse, your attorney, and
close loved ones. You might also think about working with a mortuary or
a funeral home to determine what can be done and what aligns with your
wishes. Your attorney can assist with this.

Why not add all of this to your will? Wills aren't read, in many cases,
until weeks or sometimes months after you die. You need to ensure that
the people who would carry out your instructions are fully informed and
can act on your decisions as soon after you die as possible. If these
people are not informed, there may be legal requirements for handling a
corpse that kick in after a certain time period, and your wishes would
not be fulfilled.

Bottom line, you should work with an estate planning attorney to draw up
an appropriate funeral plan.
