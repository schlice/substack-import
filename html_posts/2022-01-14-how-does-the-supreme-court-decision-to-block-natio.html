It will ensure that workers will not be forced to quit or be fired for
expressing their *perfectly legal* individual desire to not be
vaccinated. This will ensure that we will not be committing what we call
in baseball an "unforced error." That error would have been by *making
the labor shortage worse,* and thus ensuring that this decision didn't
incidentally hurt the US economy.
