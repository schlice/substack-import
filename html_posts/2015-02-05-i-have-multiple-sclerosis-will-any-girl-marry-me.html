**Content:** [The short answer is no, not any girl will marry you.\
\
The longer answer is what everyone has said so far: only the *right*
girl will marry you.\
\
She has to be ready to be a **caregiver** as well as a **wife**. She
will have to understand that down the road you may need a wheelchair or
a cane. While it\'s not likely, the possibility exists that you could
end up bedridden. It is a very low likelihood, but it is a likelihood
nonetheless. She has to fully understand that.\
\
And her love for you has to overcome that.\
\
When you marry, the minister usually says something along the lines that
you marry \"for richer or poorer, in sickness and in health.\" That
means she loves you for *you*, and not because you have a disease or
because you don\'t.\
\
Does that mean you\'ll never be married? Not at all. It means that the
girl who marries you does so because she truly loves you, disease and
all.\
\
I think, in truth, this puts you in a ***better*** position than anyone
else who gets married today. Girls may not fully understand this vow
before they take it, and then when something catastrophic happens down
the road, she ends up leaving because she never thought she\'d be poor,
or be a caregiver. But that vow says \"for richer or poorer, in sickness
and in health\" so how didn\'t she know that? But who can truly know the
heart of a person, for the heart is concealed by the mouth and the
brain. She may never fully disclose what she truly feels until it\'s far
too late. We do marriage counseling before marriages so we can try to
get that point across: your love must overcome any obstacle.\
\
The woman (I want to get away from the term girl because woman implies a
level of maturity) who marries you will do so *knowing* that you have a
lifelong disease, and *knowing* that you may end up in a wheelchair (or
worse) some day. Knowing all of these things beforehand, she marries you
anyway. ***That\'s*** a woman who deserves you, and who will love you no
matter what may happen to you down the road, because she ***chooses***
to take that journey with you, regardless of what it ends up looking
like.\
\
I am reminded of the Bible, when Jesus appeared to the apostles after
his death and resurrection. Thomas heard the apostles talking about
Jesus\' appearance (he wasn\'t there initially), and he did not believe
that Jesus actually rose from the dead. He said, "Unless I see the nail
marks in his hands and put my finger where the nails were, and put my
hand into his side, I will not believe" (John 20:25, NIV). \"A week
later his disciples were in the house again, and Thomas was with them.
Though the doors were locked, Jesus came and stood among them and said,
"Peace be with you!" Then he said to Thomas, "Put your finger here; see
my hands. Reach out your hand and put it into my side. Stop doubting and
believe." Thomas said to him, "My Lord and my God!" Then Jesus told him,
"Because you have seen me, you have believed; blessed are those who have
not seen and yet have believed." (John 20:26-29 NIV) This reminds me of
women who have married and have encountered hardships like MS in their
spouses and have stayed married because they understand why they
married: they married because they loved their spouse, and a disease
does not change that love. I know one; I\'ve been married to her for 20
years, and I\'ve only had MS for 8. She\'s the best thing that ever
happened to me, and I know she has a true heart, because any other woman
in her right mind would have left me long ago, but she didn\'t. Some
people go a whole lifetime and never find that love. That\'s not my
case, and I will spend the rest of my days thanking her and loving her
for that.]{.rendered_qtext}
