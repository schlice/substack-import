**Content:** [In a case like this, we\'re talking about *circumstantial
evidence*, and **where** you were found in your car makes a big
difference. Sometimes, circumstantial evidence is strong enough to
charge you with the crime. Let\'s look at a few possibilities.\
\
If you\'re at home, on your own property, it\'s unlikely that you\'d be
arrested for driving on a suspended license when the officer didn\'t see
you drive the car. You live there, so it\'s safe to presume that you
could have gotten in and out of the car without driving it.
Additionally, you can even drive the car on your own property without
violating the law. You only need your license to drive on public
roadways.\
\
Now, if you\'re at a friend\'s house, and you\'re just sitting in the
car, listening to the radio with friends, it becomes a little more
sketchy. Did a friend drive the car, and now you\'re sitting in the
driver\'s seat? It\'s possible. You don\'t live at your friend\'s house,
but you\'re with a group, so it\'s fair to say that someone else may
have driven the car. If the officer questions others and finds that you
did drive the car, you can be arrested on the strength of their
testimony.\
\
If you\'re in the parking lot of a store, sitting in the driver\'s seat
of a car that is registered to you, it is a fair presumption to make
that you drove the car to that location. You don\'t live there, so you
(and your car) had to get there *somehow*. The store is only connected
to your property by public roads, and if you\'re there by yourself, no
one else drove the car. It\'s safe to make the assumption that you drove
the car there, even though no one saw you do it.\
\
(EDIT) I just read your comment thread, which I really wish you would
have posted as additional question details instead of a comment.
Nevertheless, the officer ***actually observed you driving***. He is
also allowed to approach you anywhere and ask you questions. Since he
observed you driving on a public road, he can approach you and talk to
you ***as if*** he pulled you over. He can detain you, he can ask for
permission to search the car, and he can also call a drug dog to sniff
the outside of the car. If the dog hits, it\'s enough for probable cause
to search the car, which is a warrantless search.\
\
Not to mention you confessed to driving on a suspended license and
possible drug charges on Quora.\

It\'s time to stop playing around on Quora and use your browser to find
a good criminal defense attorney. You\'re going to need
one.]{.rendered_qtext}
