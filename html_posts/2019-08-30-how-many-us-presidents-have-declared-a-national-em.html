Eleven.

The list is fairly extensive, and appears to have been fully cataloged
over on

> The first President to issue an emergency proclamation was Woodrow
> Wilson, who on February 5, 1917, issued the following:
>
> *"I have found that there exists a national emergency arising from the
> insufficiency of maritime tonnage to carry the products of the farms,
> forests, mines and manufacturing industries of the United States, to
> their consumers abroad and within the United States"*
>
> This proclamation was within the limits of the act that established
> the United States Shipping Board.
>
> Starting with Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1933, presidents asserted the
> power to declare emergencies without limiting their scope or duration,
> without citing the relevant statutes, and without congressional
> oversight. The Supreme Court in [[*Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v.
> Sawyer*](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=8299b5&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youngstown_Sheet_%2526_Tube_Co._v._Sawyer){.external_link

> president could do in such an emergency, but did not limit the
> emergency declaration power itself. A 1973 Senate investigation found
> (in Senate Report 93-549) that four declared emergencies remained in
> effect: the 1933 banking crisis with respect to the hoarding of gold,
> a 1950 emergency with respect to the Korean War, a 1970 emergency
> regarding a postal workers strike, and a 1971 emergency in response to
> inflation. Many provisions of statutory law are contingent on a
> declaration of national emergency, as many as 500 by one count. It was
> due in part to concern that a declaration of \"emergency\" for one
> purpose should not invoke every possible executive emergency power,
> that Congress in 1976 passed the [[National Emergencies
> Act](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=eaf2df&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Emergencies_Act){.external_link

> Presidents have continued to use their emergency authority subject to
> the provisions of the act, with 42 national emergencies declared
> between 1976 and 2007. [\[1\]](#YAhnE){#cite-YAhnE .citation_link}
