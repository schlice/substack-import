Depending on the jurisdiction, [[Christopher

is correct for the US and
[[Ralph](https://www.quora.com/profile/Ralph-1517)]{.qlink_container}
for the UK.

The issue here is that a \"public\" computer is not \"owned\" by the
\"public.\" A public computer is available for public use, but is still
owned, operated, and maintained by some organization.

It\'s like calling a restaurant a \"public place.\" It is not. It is
\"open to the public,\" but it is still privately owned, and your
\"privilege\" to be there can most definitely be revoked by the owner.

Therefore, you can be charged with \"Damaging Private Property\" if
there is no specific computer-related charge that fits. Most files on a
public computer are not personal files, not sensitive in any way, but if
you deleted them, the system would fail to function. This causes
increased maintenance for the entity which maintains the system, and
possibly increased costs if they have to seek outside assistance to get
the machine operational again. Also, the machine is out of service while
it is being maintained, which degrades the overall service the entity
can provide to its customers. These are all reasons that an organization
might seek charges against you if you intentionally damage files on
their system.

At the very least, failing to follow the user agreement would get you
barred from future access to those systems; at worst, could get you
charged with a crime.
