**Why do some states require a homeowner to have a "duty to retreat"
from an intruder before using lethal force? Shouldn't all people have
the right to protect your home, your family, and your life from anyone
willing to enter your home illegally?**

That's the beauty of the state system. The voters in that state get to
determine the kinds of laws that will be present in that state. Since we
have such wild variation in population types across the country, the
local governments are best able to meet the needs of the local voters.
Therefore, some states have a duty to retreat because that's what the
majority of that state's voters want.

If you don't like the laws in your state, you can either elect people
who will change those laws, or move to another state.
