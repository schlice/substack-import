I'm going to start with the short answer first. **Get help**. Find a
good mental health professional in your area and go see her. I would
suggest finding a woman therapist (I'm assuming you're physiologically a
girl).

Does this mean you're broken? Does this mean you're bad? Does this mean
you've done something wrong? **No, no, and no.**

So why did I recommend getting professional help?

*You have a lot of issues to work through.* Some of them: depression,
denial, and yes, sexual assault.

I'll let you in on another little secret: *You were assaulted. He did it
on purpose.* You're lucky he stopped when you got your own bed.

Now that you know this, it's time to get off Quora and find some help in
your local area.

And don't even think of talking to him again until after you've gotten
help.
