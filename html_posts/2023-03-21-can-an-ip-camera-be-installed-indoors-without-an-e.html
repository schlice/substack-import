Well, yes and no. It still needs power, so you\'ll still have to get it
that power.

If you find the right camera, you may be able to find one with a
built-in battery that you can manually recharge periodically. Nest
Indoor, Ring and Blink indoor cameras allow this. In fact, Blink cameras
(owned by Amazon) run off off AA Lithium batteries and will run for
about two years on a single pair of batteries. Or perhaps you may find a
camera which can be powered by an external battery bank, maybe that will
meet your needs. The small Blink indoor cameras can do this. Or perhaps
you could install the camera and add an external solar panel and mount
the panel on a window. Camera offerings from Ring and eufy can be
powered by solar panels.

There are others, but those are some of the more popular offerings.
