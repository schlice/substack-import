**Justice in the USA is supposed to be blind, so what would court cases
be like if the judge and jury were obligated to be blindfolded for the
proceedings?**

"Lady Justice" is an *allegory*.

An **allegory** is a literary device in which a character, place, or
event is used to deliver a broader message about real-world issues. Lady
Justice is the personification of the moral force of the justice system.

She is holding scales in one hand and a sword in the other. She uses the
scales to balance the strength of the arguments in the case. She uses
the sword to mete out punishments, indicating that justice can be swift,
and final. Finally, she is blindfolded (which has only been a thing on
Lady Justice since the 16th century), which indicates *impartiality*. It
conveys the idea that justice is equal to all, not influenced by wealth,
power, or any other status.

It is the *idea* of justice being blind that we are trying to convey;
the idea that justice is impartial, not that people in the justice
system need to be *actually* blind. The purveyors of justice (judges,
lawyers, etc) do not gain any value by being actually blind. This
doesn't mean that we can't have an actually blind judge or lawyer. It
simply means that someone who actually has no sight doesn't administer
justice any better. It's an idea, not a condition of employment or a
feature of the workplace.
