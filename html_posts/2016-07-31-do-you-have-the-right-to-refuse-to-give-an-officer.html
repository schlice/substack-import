*When you are the driver*: no, you do not have the right to refuse to
give the police your license or registration. You have a license which
is issued by the state. Your license is not a **right**. Your driving
**privileges** were granted by the state, and the state can revoke your
license at any time.

Part of the privilege of driving on state-owned roads involves agreeing
to the state's rules. You must have insurance on your car; it's
required. Most states require you to carry proof of insurance in your
car at all times. Most states require you to carry a copy of your
registration information in your car, and when you are the driver, you
are required to carry your license on you.

State law also says that the police can stop your car, and you must
stop. Finally, you are required to present your license, your proof of
insurance, and your registration card at any time when a police officer
asks you to do so. If you fail to do this, you can be arrested for
driving without a license. You can get that charge dismissed in court,
but you have to go to court to show them you have a license. Big waste
of time.

*When you are a passenger*, you are not required to carry identification
on you. The only piece of information you are required to give to the
police when you are asked is your real name. If you fail to do that, you
can be arrested until the police verify your identity. Beyond that, you
do not have to talk to the police if you don't want to.
