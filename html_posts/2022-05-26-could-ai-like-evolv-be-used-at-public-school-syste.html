So, could AI be used to help thwart school shooters?

Emphatically, ***YES!!!***

........but who's going to pay for it?

You do realize that sports franchises (and companies like Disney, who
[[also deployed Evolv
scanners](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=ea7592&url=https://blogmickey.com/2020/07/massive-changes-coming-to-disney-world-theme-park-bag-check-experience/){.external_link

businesses that can *afford* AI systems, right? Public schools will
*never* have that level of funding as long as they are run by the
government. You can dash that idea right now, because until AI becomes
as ubiquitous as the mobile phone, it will never be implemented in
public schools.

And even if it is, it will be so overburdened by regulations and
requirements to accommodate this minority group and that minority group
that it will be, mostly, ineffective.

The best that public schools can do is to lock down harder and increase
armed guards more. Of course, that becomes distasteful to the general
public because *public school* starts to look a lot like *prison*.

So it doesn't matter how many school shootings happen, people don't want
to do what is necessary to secure our students. Because the solutions
are **hard**. And they are not **fun**. And they do not contribute to
the **ideal learning environment**.

But they are **necessary**.

So who will make the tough decisions?
