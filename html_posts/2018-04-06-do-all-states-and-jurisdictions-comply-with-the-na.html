**Do all states and jurisdictions comply with the national instant
criminal background check system, (NICS) and if they don\'t should the
federal government refuse FFL licenses to gun shops in all of the non
compliant local and state jurisdictions?**

Yes, all Federal Firearms License (FFL)-licensed dealers use NICS, as
required by Federal law.

It is true that some FFL dealers do not do the requisite background
checks. The criminals know who these dealers are.

Ideally, the BATFE would thoroughly monitor every FFL and would revoke
their license if they violate the law. But BATFE doesn't have the
resources to thoroughly monitor every FFL, and in the cases where they
do find that a FFL has failed to follow the correct procedure, it is
very rare that they actually revoke a license. Don't forget that the
dealer himself has an appeals process he can follow, and he has a
business and a livelihood to maintain as well.

Nevertheless, BATFE could do more if they had more funding and more
investigators.
