We don\'t have retributive justice in America. That\'s why Justice wears
a blindfold. She only weighs the facts, nothing more. Your desire for
retribution plays no part in her decision.

People would like a retributive justice system here. These people are
the same ones who say \"justice was not served\" when a court finds
someone not guilty, when \"clearly, everyone I know says he was totally
guilty\" and we have to have \"an eye for an eye\" for what he did.

That\'s not justice. That\'s **vengeance.** Do you want justice, or do
you want revenge? Do you want to take from them what they took from you,
or do you want the *right* person to be convicted?

If you\'re only looking for revenge, it wouldn\'t make much difference
to you if the person might not be guilty. If *you* think he is guilty,
he must be guilty, and the court was obviously biased, or the whole
system is rigged, or something.
