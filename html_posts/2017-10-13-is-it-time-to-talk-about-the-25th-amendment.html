The article basically says that the 25th Amendment is good as it is.

It's simply up to the Vice President to be on his toes, along with the
members of Trump's cabinet, for signs of "mental breakdown."

And the speculation in the article is outrageous. They make it seem like
every day in the Trump White House is an exercise in trying to prevent
the president from making one stupid mistake after another, and if
anyone has an "off day," we're all in for World War III.

I didn't believe anything I read from media sources before, and I
certainly don't believe any of this now. None of those people have any
credibility any more; they are all dyed-in-the-wool liberal
propaganda-spreaders; their articles should be labeled "FOR
ENTERTAINMENT USE ONLY" as they rarely present any reliable facts that
can be verified.

Just as this story shows, there are no verifiable accounts of what the
"reporter" says about the Trump White House. For all we know, he made it
up just before he wrote it because it fits his narrative. And how does
he know? Where did he get his information? Was it verified? We'll never
know, and the media does like to hide behind their "protected sources"
front.

Nevertheless, the 25th Amendment is good as it is. If the President
can't fulfill his duties, the Vice President can take over. Simple. The
purpose of the Amendment is not to remove a president because "you don't
like what he's doing." That's what *elections* are for.
