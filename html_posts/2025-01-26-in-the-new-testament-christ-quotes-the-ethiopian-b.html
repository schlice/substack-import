Jude may have, but Christ did not.

And while some in the early church (like Jude, or Clement of Alexandria)
may have referenced the Book of Enoch, even they didn't consider it
authoritative scripture.

The Book of Enoch was never considered canonical by Jewish or Christian
authorities; it was not seen as divinely inspired scripture.
