**If you were offered 500 dollars to wear a level III bulletproof vest
and let someone empty a snub nosed 38 special revolver into you at short
range for testing, would you volunteer?**

No way. Not because I'm afraid of getting shot, but because if you
believe the vest needs to be on a *person* instead of an *analog* in
order to have a valid test, then your test is obviously flawed.

Placing the vest on a human analog will provide exactly the same force
feedback on the obverse side of the vest as a human chest would. Some
human analogs actually have human skeletons and human organs inside of
them to more accurately reproduce the force feedback that would result
from a trauma to that analog.

In other words, there is *simply no amount of money* that would
necessitate shooting at a real person **for testing**.

And even if there were an amount of money that would convince someone to
allow themselves to be shot in a vest, \$500 is most certainly not it.
You're missing quite a few zeros.
