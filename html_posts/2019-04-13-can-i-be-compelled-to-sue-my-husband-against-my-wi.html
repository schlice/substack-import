**Can I be compelled to sue my husband against my will due to unpaid
wages his entity owes me due to the negligence of my co-employer
refusing to reimburse him for my wages?**

***You cannot be compelled to sue anyone against your will. Whether or
not you ever file a lawsuit is entirely your decision.***

No one can compel you to file any lawsuit unless you choose to do so.
You simply may not get your wages back, but no one can compel you to
file a lawsuit, ever.

There's not enough detail to really understand exactly what is going on
between the three parties (you, your husband, and the co-employer). Is
your husband in a business partnership with the co-employer? Do they
have a legal business entity (i.e. an LLC) under which they conduct
business? Are you an "on-the-books" employee of the LLC? Or do you
sideline for your husband? There are too many variables which are
missing from your question to be able to really give you a solid answer.

I'd suggest talking to an attorney in your area who specializes in
employment law.
