Unlikely.

Those who argue for removing the "life of the mother" exceptions say
that doctors can still intervene to save the life of a woman without
being prosecuted. They make a distinction between the death of a fetus
*as a result of lifesaving treatment*, and the intentional killing of a
fetus by abortion. Additionally, they argue, some "life of the mother"
exceptions are ambiguous. Exceptions span the range from "life of the
mother" to "health of the mother," and there is no standard as to what
procedures are medically necessary, and what procedures cross the line.

In states with minimal explanation of what constitutes an exception,
doctors fear crossing the line and being subject to penalties, including
jail time and loss of their licenses.

There is nothing in the Constitution which guarantees that a medical
decision will not cost someone their life. There are laws against
medical malpractice in place already. The only guarantee in the
Constitution is that life cannot be taken without due process of law.
There is no requirement to save any particular life in the Constitution.
As far as the Constitution is concerned, all life has equal value. So
it's unlikely that such an argument could be made successfully.

Original question:

Could it be successfully argued that an anti-abortion law which doesn't
take into account the life of a mother is unconstitutional?
