answer here very much. And in thinking about it, it makes sense to me
why I also will delete some comments:

**Quora is not a debate site. Quora is a question and answer site.**

I'm here to answer questions. I'm not here to debate you. You have as
much right to post an answer to the question as I do. I posted my
answer. You can post yours. May the person with the better reputation
win.

But I have neither the time nor the inclination to waste my time when
you don't like my telling of fact, or don't agree with the topic, or
would like to tell me about the latest social media frenzy. I post
facts. And I do **not** use the word fact loosely. Because when I
present a fact, I include citations to the relevant works which support
the factual statements I have made.

If you would like to question the facts with your own facts, I may
entertain your questions, but mostly because your questions highlight
more nuances about my own answer. If you're simply arguing with me,
don't bother. Post your own answer with your own "facts." Don't argue
with me. If you're arguing just to argue, I'm deleting. I simply don't
have time to fiddle with fools.

If comments have no relevance to my answer, I will also usually delete
them. It's my answer, and your comment is attached to my answer. If you
want to be heard, answer the question yourself. Don't argue with me.

Again, if you have constructive points to make, make them in a BNBR way.
If I feel they contribute to the discussion about my own answer, they
stay. If I feel they are simply trolling, they're gone.
