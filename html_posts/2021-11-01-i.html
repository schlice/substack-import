As you can see, there is a great deal of ambiguity over your mere
possession of such pictures.

This is partially because whether or not a nude picture rises to the
level of child pornography (CP) is *subjective*. It depends on whether
or not a picture is *sexually suggestive enough* to be considered
pornography.

If it is, then it is *possible* that in your state, you may be eligible
to be charged with "possession of CP."

You could *then* commit any number of both Federal and state crimes for
sending those pictures to someone else, as you could then be guilty of
"distribution of CP" which becomes a Federal crime when it crosses state
lines, as well as state crimes for possession in either state.

Age of consent does not factor in to whether or not a photo constitutes
CP, or whether possession of it counts as a crime. **There is no age at
which possession or distribution of CP becomes lawful.**

Original question:

I'm 16 and I privately own nude images of myself on my phone, is this
illegal in all 50 states and would it be considered CP by law all over
the U.S for a teen my age? And would sending it to someone be illegal
even if the age of consent is 16?
