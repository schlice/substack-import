**Should the HOA be affected by the constitution? In some communities,
the HOA can force residents to go to church or face fines and eviction
if not paid.**

*(US Answer Only)*

In the United States, a Homeowner's Association only has control over
your property. They do not have control over your life. They absolutely
cannot force you to go to church. If you have evidence to the contrary,
feel free to submit it as a comment to your question and we'll review.

The HOA only controls the community and how it looks (as well as how it
smells, some have noxious odor rules). To that end, they can write rules
(which you do have to follow) which dictate what the exterior of your
property must look like, and how you go about making changes to the
exterior of your property. They can also control things like how many
and what kinds of pets you can have, how you maintain the lawn, where
you park your cars, etc.

But whether or not you go to church? Nope, not under HOA control. Any
HOA trying to force a homeowner to go to church would find themselves on
the wrong side of a Constitutional lawsuit.
