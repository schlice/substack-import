**Content:** [In general, most police officers start out as patrol
officers. It is different in some jurisdictions.\
\
For example, in the county, we run the county jail. Our deputies start
out in the jail as their first duty assignment out of the academy,
before they ever hit the streets as a patrol officer. However in most
departments, since patrol is the biggest and most personnel-demanding
bureau in the department, this is where most police officers go first.
This is also the place where officers get OJT (on-the-job training),
performed by a FTO (Field Training Officer) who progresses them through
their \"probationary\" period until they are fully qualified to work
solo.\
\
They are generally reassigned from patrol to other divisions in the
department as they are promoted or after they have an acceptable service
record as a patrol officer. Who gets assigned to other divisions, and
when, differs by department.]{.rendered_qtext}
