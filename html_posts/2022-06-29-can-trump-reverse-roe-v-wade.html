You mean, like with his super-secret trump card (see what I did there?)
that he created while he was President that gives him "Supreme Leader
Over All" powers that he can delete a Supreme Court decision?

Sure, but I think he lost his wallet in the move out of the White House.
So that trump card is gone. Darn, I guess not.

All kidding aside, the Supreme Court isn't the last word because they're
always right. The Supreme Court is always right because they're the last
word.

There is no other word beyond them. Once they render a decision, that
decision is final. To my knowledge, the Supreme Court has never
overturned a decision that was already overturned. They've never
"overturned an overturn."

And why would they? They found that the original ruling had no
Constitutional basis. Would a subsequent Court find that the decision
actually *had* Constitutional basis? It makes no sense.
