As others have hinted to, it's probably in your Governing Documents.

And it wouldn't be a neighbor, it would be the HOA.

In some Governing Documents, the HOA would have the authority to enter
the property to address immediate concerns between homeowners, such as
pest mitigation or broken water pipes, or any other safety concerns
between neighboring properties.

My Governing Documents says it this way:

> Should the Board of Directors in its sole discretion deem that any
> condition on any Lot exists which detracts from the appearance of the
> Property or causes a safety risk,the Board of Directors, its agents,
> employees or contractors shall have the right to enter upon any Lot
> for the purpose of correcting any such deficiency or condition and
> shall be entitled to assess the cost to the Owner. The costs of such
> maintenance shall be assessed against such Lot and this assessment
> shall not be considered to be a part of the annual or special
> assessments. The costs of this maintenance shall be a lien against the
> Lot and shall be payable along with any interest, attorney fees and
> costs of collection as provided in Article VII.

So in my neighborhood, the Board can enter my property to address "any
condition on any Lot with detracts from the appearance of the Property
or causes a safety risk."

Normally, in most HOAs in which a rule like this exists, they would only
do this after attempting to get me to fix the issue, and then would fix
it themselves if I refused. *But as you can see, there is no requirement
for them to attempt to have me fix it.*
