**Content:** [You\'ve got a bit of a myopathy problem, and it\'s driven
by today\'s culture. Sadly, society puts a lot of focus on the act of
sex rather than the joys of marriage. Marriage is a commitment to live
with someone, for better or worse, for richer or poorer, in sickness and
in health, \'till death do you part. The better or worse part includes
sex. So if you\'re looking for the Christian perspective, sex is really
low on the totem pole. Marriage is the lifetime commitment, sex pales in
comparison to the commitment of marriage.\
\
Looking for a religious loophole so you can have sex that God sanctifies
is not gonna cut it. We are human, we are imperfect. If sex means that
much to you, you\'re going to have to make a choice. If sex is more
important to you than marriage, skip the religion. Find a girl and do
your thing. It will be a wonderful first experience.\
\
But if your religion is truly important, find a woman you think is the
right one for you, and who shares your values. That\'s going to be key.
When you\'re married, sex won\'t occupy that much of your time anyway
(well, it will during the honeymoon phase, but I\'m thinking more
long-term). Spending your life with the woman who completes you is what
it\'s all about. Sex is just gravy.]{.rendered_qtext}
