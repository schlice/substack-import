They *can*, but they *won't*. They'll only ask for your consent if they
don't have probable cause to search. If you consent, it's an immediate
waiver of your 4th Amendment rights, and the police can search with
impunity.

If they have probable cause, they will ask you to step out of the
vehicle, and then they will conduct their search. Probable cause may be,
among other things, "evidence in plain sight," such as seeing drug
paraphernalia, or the smell of marijuana (the "plain smell" test is a
subset of the "plain sight" test).

The police can search your vehicle with nothing more than probable cause
in 49 states (in the state of Washington, the police must use their
probable cause to obtain a warrant).
