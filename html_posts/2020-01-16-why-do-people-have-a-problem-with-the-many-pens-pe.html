**Why do people have a problem with the many pens Pelosi used to sign
the impeachment articles? Surely we've seen much more egregious actions
than that.**

The pomp and circumstance is usually reserved for bills you wish to
celebrate. The President signs signature legislation in this way. House
Democrats took celebratory photos with the Speaker and the pens, like
sorority girls handing out beers.

All this after Speaker Pelosi spent all of this time saying that this
was a "somber" event.

I think the American people are finally seeing through this charade.
