**Why are there so many \'Trump exonerated\' claims by the right and
alt-right when not even US Attorney General (and Trump flunky) William
Barr says this?**

I'm not exactly sure what you've been reading, but AG Barr's report
*does* say this. You may be getting confused by the fact that Mueller's
team did not render an opinion on the obstruction charge, but the lack
of evidence led AG Barr to determine that there is not enough evidence
to even think about pursuing an indictment on obstruction charges.

The report is in two parts:

> 1.  **Russian collusion:** *The Special Counsel\'s investigation did
>     not find that the Trump campaign or anyone associated with it
>     conspired or coordinated with Russia in its efforts to influence
>     the 2016 U.S. presidential election. As the report states:
>     \"\[T\]he investigation did not establish that members of the
>     Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian
>     government in its election interference activities.\"*
> 2.  **Obstruction of justice:** *After making a \"thorough factual
>     investigation\" into these matters, the Special Counsel considered
>     whether to evaluate the conduct under Department standards
>     governing prosecution and declination decisions but ultimately
>     determined not to make a traditional prosecutorial judgment. The
>     Special Counsel therefore did not draw a conclusion - one way or
>     the other - as to whether the examined conduct constituted
>     obstruction...The Special Counsel states that \"while this report
>     does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also
>     does not exonerate him.\"*

This verbiage is obviously confusing and problematic, since it doesn't
make clear that the President either did or did not do something
criminal when it comes to obstruction of justice.

When this happens, it's up to the Attorney General to review the
findings and make his own determination, which he does:

> *After reviewing the Special Counsel\'s final report on these issues;
> consulting with Department officials, including the Office of Legal
> Counsel; and applying the principles of federal prosecution that guide
> our charging decisions, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and I
> have concluded that the evidence developed during the Special
> Counsel\'s investigation is not sufficient to establish that the
> President committed an obstruction-of-justice offense.*

He goes on to explain his rationale behind this decision:

> *In making this determination, we noted that the Special Counsel
> recognized that \"the evidence does not establish that the President
> was involved in an underlying crime related to Russian election
> interference,\" and that, while not determinative, the absence of such
> evidence bears upon the President\'s intent with respect to
> obstruction. Generally speaking, to obtain and sustain an obstruction
> conviction, the government would need to prove beyond a reasonable
> doubt that a person, acting with corrupt intent, engaged in
> obstructive conduct with a sufficient nexus to a pending or
> contemplated proceeding. In cataloguing the President\'s actions, many
> of which took place in public view, the report identifies no actions
> that, in our judgment, constitute obstructive conduct, had a nexus to
> a pending or contemplated proceeding, and were done with corrupt
> intent, each of which, under the Department\'s principles of federal
> prosecution guiding charging decisions, would need to be proven beyond
> a reasonable doubt to establish an obstruction-ofÂ­-justice offense.*

Basically, the AG determined that since a corrupt intent could not be
established because there was no evidence of any underlying crime
related to Russian election interference, the crime of obstruction of
justice could not be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Therefore, the AG
will not be bringing obstruction charges against the President.

That amounts to about as much of a complete exoneration as you're going
to get.[\[1\]](#qtmbH){#cite-qtmbH .citation_link}
