**How many of those with Multiple sclerosis receiving disease modifying
meds have had their ordering physician also order a Covid test to clear
them before being given the meds that will drastically reduce their
immunity?**

I've never heard of this, but it makes sense. Before you start any new
MS medication, you receive a battery of tests to ensure you are not
infected with any specific diseases, and that certain other things
specific to that medication are not out of whack. For instance, liver
function tests are common when starting a new MS medication. White blood
cell count is closely monitored for some meds, so getting a baseline
before starting the medication is important.

In order for COVID-19 vaccines to work, you have to allow your immune
system to respond to the vaccine. Immunosuppressant medications, often
used to treat MS, may interfere with that process, and may make the
vaccine less efficacious for you. This is why MS patients may have to
stop their medications before they get the vaccine, and then re-start
their medication after their immunity builds up. Of course, this is
highly dependent on your specific MS medication, and your doctor would
advise you whether or not you should do this. I REPEAT: **DO NOT STOP
YOUR MS MEDICATION UNLESS YOUR DOCTOR TELLS YOU TO DO SO.**
