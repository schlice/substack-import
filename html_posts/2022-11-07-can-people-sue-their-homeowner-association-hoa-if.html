You can sue anyone for anything.

The question is, of course, what your odds are of being successful in
your suit.

And in this case, the odds are pretty slim that you'll be successful.

Because unless you can prove that the HOA is fining you for something
that they're not fining your neighbor for, and you're both doing the
same wrong thing, then your fines are not "unfair." If you broke the
HOA's rules, you pay the fines. If it's in your Governing Documents
which you signed when you bought your house, you have to play by the
same rules.

You might *feel* that your fines are unfair. But if the HOA has the
power to levy fines, and they have documentation which shows you broke
the rules, they can fine you, and you must pay.

You should probably fix whatever it is that they're fining you over, or
work with them to show that you're making progress to get it fixed. That
would be a much better use of your time than telling the Internet that
the HOA is unfair.
