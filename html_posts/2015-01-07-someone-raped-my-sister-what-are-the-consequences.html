**Content:** [You go to jail for assault (or assault and battery,
depending on the state), he becomes the victim and you become the
aggressor. Besides giving you a criminal record, it also taints future
possibilities of prosecution for him because he \"looks like\" the good
guy and you look like the bad guy. You should be able to explain that to
a jury, but why take that risk?\
\
Three years is well within the statute of limitations of nearly all
states for the crime of rape. It\'s usually 10-20 years, so he can still
be held accountable for his crime. I know you don\'t have money to
retain an attorney, but a consultation is normally free, and you never
know, if a lawyer feels particularly passionate about it, he/she may
feel inclined to take the case *pro bono* so that you can get some
justice, especially if they feel like they can win.]{.rendered_qtext}
