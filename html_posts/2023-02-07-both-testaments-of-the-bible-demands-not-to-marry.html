title: '"Both Testaments of the Bible demands not to marry a unbeliever, who is called
  Belial (2 Cor 6:15). Can a Bible-believer say that s/he has not drifted away from
  the faith when s/he intentionally selects a unbeliever over believers as the spouse?"'

Be sure to not take this passage out of its context:

> Do not be unequally yoked together with unbelievers. For what
> fellowship has righteousness with lawlessness? And what communion has
> light with darkness? And what accord has Christ with Belial? Or what
> part has a believer with an unbeliever? And what agreement has the
> temple of God with idols? For you are the temple of the living God.
> --- 2 Cor 6:12--16 NKJV

First, the unbeliever is not called Belial in the passage. The
unbeliever is *equated* with Belial, another name for Satan
(interestingly only being used here in this passage). The reason that
the word Belial is used here is because, while it is supposed to
ultimately represent Satan, what it actually represents is
"worthlessness," "vileness," and "wickedness.\" Its use here is to
stress Satan's deep-seated wickedness: \"the one who is utterly
worthless because he is vile.\" It is the opposite of the person of
Christ, and therefore should be thought of as the adversary. But, in
context Belial represents all unbelievers, just as all believers are in
Christ.

The whole point of this passage is the *comparison of opposites,* and
the imagery is that of oxen on a yoke.

In order for the team to make progress, they have to pull in the same
direction. Imagine what would happen if these two were *pulling in
opposite directions*. They wouldn't get very far, would they.

The same goes for a Christian being "yoked" to a non-Christian. How
could a Christ-follower be united in any meaningful way to a non-Christ
follower? Unbelievers are still under the authority of "the god of this
age" who has blinded their minds "so that they cannot see the light of
the gospel that displays the glory of Christ, who is the image of God."
(2 Cor 4:4 NIV). When you are "yoked" in marriage, how is it possible
that a believer and an unbeliever could ever "pull in the same
direction?" One of them would have to change course. Not only that, but
the believer and the unbeliever have completely different eternal
destinies. How could you ever walk the same direction in your marriage?
You'll always be walking on different paths.

Perhaps you are banking on the fact that one of you will alter course
later in life. I won't say that this is not possible, because it does
happen. But Paul warns against this, because as I mentioned, one of you
is going to have to change direction, and Paul warns that it may be the
believer.

Does the passage *demand* that you *not* marry an unbeliever? No, it
does not. Instead, it *warns* the believer not to marry an unbeliever
because of the potential eternal consequences of doing so.
