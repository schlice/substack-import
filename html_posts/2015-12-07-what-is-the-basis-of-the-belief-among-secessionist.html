There is no such \"belief\". Unless you have some credible sources for
your assertion, I\'m going to believe that this is a question which
contains an assumption.

I think you will find that if the government orders the military to
attack civilians without just cause, in violation of the Posse Comitatus
Act, you may find many military officers refusing those orders as
illegal. However, if the military is ordered to assist a state
government with quelling an insurrection in full compliance with the
Insurrection Act, the military will comply.

You\'re not going to see the military go against the orders of its chain
of command unless you see the government ordering the military to act
lawlessly, or in contrast with currently-established law.
