To fully answer the question, we need to define "fake."

If, by "fake," you mean filling out an application with fraudulent or
incorrect information, it's nearly impossible to apply to University
with a "fake" application. [[Alice
Baker](https://www.quora.com/profile/Alice-Baker-31)]{.qlink_container}
already detailed that in her answer, so I won't re-hash that here.

If, however, by "fake," you actually mean "your true information, but
you have no intention of actually attending the school you're applying
to," then the calculus shifts slightly.

While it's not *illegal* to apply to a school for which you have no
intention of attending, it would be considered *wrong* to do so.
Remember, the University does a non-trivial amount of work processing
your application. Teams of reviewers pore over your records, determining
whether or not you will be a good fit. And that's before we get to
*financing*, which is a big deal in and of itself. Because when it comes
to financing, government gets involved, with all of its grants and
student aid programs.

To do all that work and then to be potentially accepted when you have no
intention of attending the school accomplishes little but wasting the
time of the people at the university, and they'll likely remember that
when you *are* ready to attend the college.

Maybe, instead of filing a "fake" application, you could reach out to
the Admissions department of the university in question and work with
them (on their time, of course) to see if your application package is
strong enough to be considered when you are ready to attend university.
They may be able to give you some pointers to strengthen your
application package, which could give you a leg up when it's time to
actually attend. And your efforts won't go unnoticed at that university,
and may actually help you when it comes time to actually apply.
