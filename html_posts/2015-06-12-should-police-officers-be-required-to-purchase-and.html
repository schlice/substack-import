**Content:** [Only if you want to have to pay through your own insurance
in order to be serviced by your local police department. Policing will
become \"fee-for-service,\" and only people with insurance will get good
police service. I really don\'t think that\'s what you want.\
\
Perhaps police departments will need to start buying indemnification
insurance for their officers to protect them against the myriad of
lawsuits they continually face.]{.rendered_qtext}
