An unfortunate translation error in one version of the King James Bible.

In that version, the word *ratsach* was translated as *kill* instead of
the actual translation, which is *murder*.

Therefore, in most translations today, you will see that the commandment
actually says that you shall not murder. Soldiers do not murder, thus
they are not violating the commandment.

There is killing in the bible, and in some cases it\'s even God who does
it. But God does not *murder*, which would be killing without
justification, and we are commanded to not do that either. Soldiers take
lives only when they must, and they do so with justification.
