Virtually none.

Indeed, for people standing on a ledge, there is rarely a crime when
people below start chanting "Jump! Jump!" But as usual, it is highly
state-dependent.

Encouraging someone to commit suicide is not illegal in almost every
state. A small number of states have statutes that specifically address
encouraging suicide: California, Minnesota, Oklahoma, and South Dakota.
Minnesota's law, however, was ruled unconstitutional by its state
Supreme Court as an infringement on free speech rights under the First
Amendment. In addition, California's courts have held that criminal
liability for "encouraging" suicide requires something more direct than
just words encouraging the act.

In Futurama, what criminal charges would Bender face in real life for
shouting out \"Do A Flip\" to his friend threatening suicide?
