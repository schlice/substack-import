Short answer: Yes.

Longer answer: Not every one of these businesses is run by a remote
corporate office in some other city or state. Many of these \"chains of
huge businesses\" are what we call ***franchises***. A franchise is a
local business, owned by a local owner, which signs a *franchise
agreement* with the **franchisee**, the owner of the franchise. The
business can then operate as the franchise, even though the business is
locally owned and operated. The McDonald\'s locations in my city are all
franchises, none of them are owned by McDonald\'s corporate. However,
the Taco Bueno locations here are all owned by Taco Bueno Corporate in
Texas.

Regardless of where the business is owned, or where the ownership is
located, the local business must follow all state and local business
regulations in order to be licensed by that state to do business in that
state. This includes all state and local laws surrounding employment,
and, of course, anti-discrimination.
