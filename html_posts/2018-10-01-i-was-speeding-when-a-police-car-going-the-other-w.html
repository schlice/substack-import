This has happened twice to me. Slightly different each time, but the
location and time of day was the same.

I was driving to work at 4:15 AM on the Interstate. It was literally the
middle of the night and there was no one on the road. I was even sorta
half asleep, driving on autopilot as I have done so many days before.

I was exceeding the speed limit by a bit.

To be fair, the speed limit was artificially low through that section of
interstate, and to prove that, it has since been raised. But it was
still lower (by about 15 miles an hour) than I was going.

The officer decided to have a little fun with me rather than just
flashing his lights.

My guess is that he was on one of the overpasses when he clocked me. He
came down the overpass with all of his lights off (even his headlights),
and passed me on my left at a much higher rate of speed than I was
travelling, and right about when he hit my blind spot, he turned on his
full light bar and his siren.

**Scared. The. Crap. Out. Of. Me.**

I literally jumped in my seat as he screamed past me and shut all his
lights off. He got off at the next exit, presumably to turn around and
go scare someone else. I'm sure he was absolutely rolling with laughter
after instantly raising my heart rate and my breathing rate.

Another early morning drive, probably a different officer. I was in the
right lane, again no one around but me. This officer approached in the
far left lane, flashed his light bar, hit his siren switch one time, and
then turned off his light bar and turned on his "alley light," which is
a white spotlight on the light bar which shines at a 90 degree angle
from the direction of the patrol car.

This was a clear statement: "YOU, who I'm now illuminating with a
spotlight, slow down."

I slowed down.
