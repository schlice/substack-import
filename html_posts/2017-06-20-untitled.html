It's not incorrect, the correct answer is actually "it depends." It
depends on the primary purpose of the email, whether it is commercial or
relational. I would argue that this message is "other," which means it
only falls under some of the rules of CAN-SPAM.

Before you send mass emails as a matter of business practice, you should
either be \*extra\* careful and only use opt-in lists, or consult with
an attorney.
