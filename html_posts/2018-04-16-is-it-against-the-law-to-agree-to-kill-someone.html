**Is it against the law to agree to kill someone?**

Let's find the exact point where you have run afoul of the law.
Remember, there are many differences between the states with respect to
other things with which you may be charged (solicitation to commit
murder comes to mind), but I'll try to highlight the most common in the
US.

A woman says, "Will you kill my husband?" and you say "Yes." **NOT
ILLEGAL.\
-** At this point, you have not yet technically done anything illegal,
other than speak freely. In the United States, simply making the verbal
agreement does not constitute conspiracy; there must be an "overt act"
in furtherance of the crime by at least one of the parties.

You plan out how you will commit a murder. **NOT ILLEGAL\
-** While pretty damning circumstantial evidence (especially if the
husband turns up dead later and his death matches your plan), it's still
not illegal to plan out how you might kill someone. You might be writing
a murder mystery novel. Just making a plan to kill someone might be
stretched to be the "overt act" needed to prove conspiracy, but it would
be a stretch (as I said, you might be writing a murder mystery novel).

A day later, you buy a gun. **POSSIBLY ILLEGAL\
-** Gun purchases are not illegal, even if you have conversations a day
prior. However, in some cases, purchasing the gun after having the
conversation could be considered the "overt act" needed to prove
conspiracy to commit murder.

You drive to the husband's house with the gun and the plan in your car.
**DEFINITELY ILLEGAL\**
- Driving around with a gun in your car and a plan on how to kill
someone is not, by itself, illegal. However, this is the point at which
you have actually engaged in criminal activity. You can now be charged
with attempted murder when you have made a step towards committing the
crime of which you are accused. You and the wife (with whom you made the
verbal agreement) can still be charged with conspiracy to commit murder.
