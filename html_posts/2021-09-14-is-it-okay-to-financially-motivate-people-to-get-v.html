The answer to whether or not it is okay depends on how you go about
motivating people to get vaccinated.

For example, it is perfectly acceptable to offer financial *incentives*
to get vaccinated. If you want to offer someone a \$100 gift card to
your local retailer to get the jab, this is perfectly acceptable.

But if your definition of financial motivation includes whether your
vaccination status determines whether or not you get to keep your job,
we have now moved into an area which I would consider to not be
acceptable. If it is legal to be unvaccinated, it should be legal to
allow you the choice to remain unvaccinated. If social distancing and
masks work, then your employer should force you to do those if you
choose to remain unvaccinated, and if it at all possible, they should
isolate you from other employees.

If a company, for example, wants to offer you a discount on your health
insurance premiums if you are vaccinated, this is perfectly acceptable.

Similarly, it would also be acceptable, but not advisable, for a company
to raise health insurance premiums for those who are unvaccinated. This
particular route of financial motivation tends to ignore the fact that
natural immunity following infection is a valid form of immunity.
