The question begins with an incorrect interpretation of Exodus 21--22.
Pro-choice people use this passage to claim that the Bible not only
endorses abortion, but encourages it.

However, that couldn't be further from the truth. Exodus 21 isn't about
*abortion*, it's about *retribution*. *And it actually proves that the
law should protect the unborn.*

Basically, Exodus 21 says this: "If people are fighting and hit a
pregnant woman and she gives birth prematurely but there is no serious
injury, the offender must be fined whatever the woman's husband demands
and the court allows. But if there is serious injury, you are to take
life for life." The passage goes on to say that, in general, penalties
should be "eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot,
burn for burn, wound for wound, bruise for bruise" (v24--25).
Ultimately, what the passage says is that **the punishment should fit
the crime.**

This law is only references "abortion" in that it gives the example of a
pregnancy ending prematurely. However, the basis of the statute is not
the ending of the pregnancy prematurely. It is the assumption that the
baby delivered prematurely **has the same rights and protections under
the law as an adult human being**. That is, ***the fetus is a person.***

Oops, that's probably not what the pro-choice person wanted to hear when
they referenced that passage, is it...

Medical science says that life begins at
conception[\[1\]](#FTxVc){#cite-FTxVc

.citation_link}[\[3\]](#rsZho){#cite-rsZho .citation_link}. Probably
also not what the pro-choice person wanted to hear, because now they
have to face the inconvenient truth that abortion kills a live human
being. And if you want to hold to the Old Testament law as is presented
in Exodus 21, that live human being is a person with rights, the same
rights and protections under the law as an adult human being.

Several passages of Scripture also show that truth.

- Psalm 139:13 and 16: "You created my inmost being; you knit me
  together in my mother's womb \[...\] Your eyes saw my unformed body;
  all the days ordained for me were written in your book before one of
  them came to be." What David is saying here is that God is there, in
  the womb, at the beginning of life, and He has plans for that life
  which He has had from the beginning. Phrases like "unformed body,"
  "inmost being," and "knit me together" describe processes occurring at
  the cellular level of embryonic and fetal life. In other words, God
  has unique plans for *every* life He creates, from its inception.
- Jeremiah 1:5: God planned for Jeremiah to be a prophet before he was
  even conceived: "Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, before
  you were born I set you apart; I appointed you as a prophet to the
  nations." The statement "I knew you" indicates that God regarded
  Jeremiah as an individual well before he was born.
- Galatians 1:15: God had set Paul apart for a special work before he
  was born.

In God's eyes, each baby in the womb is already an individual, no matter
where in the developmental process that baby happens to be.

Under the law in Exodus 21, causing the death of an unborn child was a
serious crime, and the punishment for it was "a life for a life." That
law was an extension of a more basic law from Genesis 9:6: "Whoever
sheds the blood of man, by man shall his blood be shed, for God made man
in his own image." (ESV). Taken together, we see that the fetus, which
was already given legal protection in Exodus 21, is considered a human
life---a human being created in God's own image.

From all of this, we can conclude that all human life, from the moment
of conception onward, is precious to God. He created that life in His
image. Harming or destroying that life was a crime under Old Testament
law, and is a sin.

Murder is the unlawful taking of a human life. Murder is also a sin.

Therefore, God considers abortion to be murder.
