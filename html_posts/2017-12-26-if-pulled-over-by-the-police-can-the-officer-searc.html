Simply "not being the owner of the vehicle" by itself does not provide
reasonable suspicion that a crime has been committed, or that a crime
will be committed. It certainly does not alleviate the requirement for
having probable cause or obtaining permission to search the vehicle.

Remember though, if an officer demands you exit the vehicle and then
proceeds to search without a warrant, feel free to protest by saying,
"Just reminding you that I did not consent to a search," and then leave
it at that. The officer can continue searching if he so chooses. You
will fight this later on, not while he's searching. You let your lawyer
handle it at that point.

Also remember that the officer is not required to explain his basis for
search to **you**, he's required to explain his basis for search to
**the court.** If he fails to do this to the legal standard and the
search is ruled unlawful, anything found during the search is
inadmissible in court.
