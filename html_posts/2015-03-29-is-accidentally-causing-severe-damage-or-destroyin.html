**Content:** [There are a few possibilities here that you haven\'t
elucidated. The first is that the person causing the damage would do it
again, and so you are restraining that person from further action. The
key in that case is \"accidentally.\" If the destruction was definitely
not willful, but was unintentional, accidental, or involuntary, then
there is no fear that it would happen again in any intentional capacity.
So a restraining order is unwarranted.\
\
The second is that the victim of the accident would attempt to harm the
accidental aggressor because he felt \"wronged\" by the accident. In
order to get such an order, you would have to show some actual or
reasonable threat of harm. Verbal abuse is generally not
enough.]{.rendered_qtext}
