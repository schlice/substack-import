*It's not a defect, it's a feature.*

So let's say you're God. You need to deliver Your Wordâ„¢ to your people
in a way that is enduring and easy to replicate and translate, but you
must also respect the free will you gave to people. You therefore must
make sure that what you reveal is not *too* convincing. If it's so clear
as to be absolutely unambiguous, then no one will ever be able to deny
it, and you won't have *believers*, but *sheep*.

So what do you do? **You inspire human writers to write everything in a
book.**

You inspire early humans to write prophesy, and then you bring that
prophesy true. You inspire writers to write it all down. Books are great
because they are easily copied and easily translated. We have enough
manuscripts to ensure that the copies are accurate, and these writers
were personal enough to convince anyone willing to listen with an open
mind that they were telling the truth. But it's "just a book" written by
"humans" so it's easy enough to discount if you don't want to believe
it.

There's enough evidence in the Bible to convince anyone willing to
believe, but there's enough ambiguity so as not to coerce the unwilling.
So people are free to either believe or not, and their free will is
never violated.
