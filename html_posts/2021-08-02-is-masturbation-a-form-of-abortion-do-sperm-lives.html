Sperm is a component of life, not a life in and of itself. Sperm cells
are not, definitionally, "alive."

While I shouldn't have to give you a biology lesson, sperm combines with
egg to produce a zygote, the earliest form of human life. A unique life
form is only formed at the time that a sperm fertilizes an egg and forms
a zygote. This is a time period we call *conception*. It is at this time
that a fully unique set of DNA is created, and thus, a wholly distinct
human life.
