**At what age does it become inappropriate for a little girl to run
around topless?**

Most people couch this issue as an equal rights issue. If men can do it,
so can women.

However, it's not that simple. We have one other problem. Like it or
not, agree with it or not, in the United States (and in many other
countries as well), the female breast is not just viewed as a device
which feeds babies. The female breast is viewed as a sex object.

Clearly, there will be much haranguing about why this is, and whether or
not this should be in the first place. **But women are just as guilty of
objectifying the breast as men are of enjoying the look of objectified
breasts.** You can't simultaneously objectify your own breasts (and
unless you dress like an 1800's school teacher, you do) and at the same
time declare "Free the nipple!" It's an incongruent position.

So if the breast is, at all, objectified as a sex object, then it should
be treated as any other anatomical sex object (the penis or the vagina),
Remember, both of those organs are dual-use as well (elimination of
waste and sex objects), so it's not unreasonable that the breast is also
dual-use (feeding babies and sex objects).

If it is at all a dual-use organ, it must fall under the same rules as
any other sex object.

So what age is it inappropriate for a little girl to run around topless?
Experts say that children begin to distinguish gender differences around
age 3 or 4, and not long after that, they usually begin to feel
modesty.[\[1\]](#MWVlP){#cite-MWVlP .citation_link} So if there is an
age when children should start being clothed in public, it's around 3 or
4.

Additionally, societal norms play a large role in determining when you
should no longer allow children to spend time naked. In the United
States, people have a sense that the body is very private. The
sexualization of nudity, **and a perfectly reasonable fear of pedophiles
taking an unhealthy interest in a nude child,** is yet another reason
why children should not run around naked.

Experts also agree that parents would be wise to teach their children
that different situations call for different behaviors. It's not at all
inappropriate to teach your children to consider the feelings of others
before they act. So while it may be reasonable to let a child run around
naked *at home*, when guests come over, it is reasonable to teach your
child that consideration of the feelings of the guest should dictate
that clothes go back on. A similar attitude should prevail in public.

You can disagree until the cows come home whether or not this *should*
*be*. But you cannot disagree that this is how it *is.*

*For the time being, I have re-enabled comments on selected answers.
Some people like to comment. Some people like to engage with me in a
civil manner, and I did kinda miss that\...a little. But do not
misunderstand, I take this step very cautiously. My mental well-being
isn\'t worth your harassing, inane behavior. If you don\'t like what I
wrote, tough shit. If my answer is grammatically low-quality or is
un-cited opinion masquerading as fact, downvote it. If you think I\'m
wrong, write your own answer. But Quora is a question-and-answer site,
not a debate site. If you are simply commenting to tell me \"ackshually,
you\'re wrong,\" don\'t be surprised if I quietly delete your comment.
Put anything vaguely harassing in there, and your deletion will be
followed by a block and a mute, and a BNBR report. I will do this
immediately and with no compunction. You have been warned. Be nice.*
