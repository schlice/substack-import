To the best of my knowledge, AF1 lands the same as any other 747.
Granted, I only participated in landings and takeoffs of AF2, but the
plane is the same. I'm certain that they require all of the passengers
(including the President) to buckle up for takeoff and landing.

(EDIT) I think what you may be referring to is the fact that 1. the
pilots who fly this plane have thousands upon thousands of hours doing
so before they ever get the privilege of co-piloting that bird. Only the
best of the best heavy drivers get that privilege (which may explain the
really good landings), and 2. while you can advise the President that
it's time to sit down and buckle in, I bet he could safely ignore that
warning and do as he pleases without worrying that his flight crew will
turn him over to the local police when he lands for failing to follow
proper safety procedures. Besides, the flight details are not covered by
Federal aviation regulations as commercial flights are since the flight
is operated by the Air Force and follow Air Force Instructions on flight
operations. The President, as Commander-in-Chief, sits at the top of the
Air Force, so while the flight crew can tell the President that he
should buckle in for landing, he could probably avoid doing so without
consequence (unless the landing happens to be a little rough in which
case he may fall down).
