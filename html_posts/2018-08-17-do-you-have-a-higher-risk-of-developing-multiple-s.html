**Do you have a higher risk of developing multiple sclerosis if you have
a lot of allergies?**

There is no direct epidemiological link currently established between
allergies and development of MS.

From the National MS Society:

> There is no evidence that an allergic reaction to a specific
> environmental allergen is involved in triggering MS. Therefore, there
> is no scientific rationale for the anti-allergy treatment regimens
> that are offered by some alternative medicine therapists to treat MS.
> Some of these treatments involve avoiding certain food groups or
> taking medication directed against a supposed allergen. They might
> actually cause harm by creating a nutritional deficiency, and should
> therefore be discussed with a knowledgeable health-care professional.
>
> Allergic reactions to many things in our environment, including
> synthetic chemical allergens, are commonplace. This has led people to
> suppose that such allergens may also be triggering agents in MS. MS is
> generally considered an \"autoimmune\" disease, one in which the
> body\'s immune system is directed against itself. Just what part or
> parts of the central nervous system the immune cells attack in people
> with MS has not yet been precisely identified, nor has the trigger
> that initiates this autoimmune process been identified.
>
> Since allergies are common in the general population, allergies can
> coexist in a person with MS. Such allergies should be given
> appropriate medical attention, and persons with serious allergies
> should consider wearing medical alert bracelets or necklaces.
> Maintaining good general health, including management of allergies, is
> a positive approach to living with multiple
> sclerosis.[\[1\]](#stDpa){#cite-stDpa .citation_link}
