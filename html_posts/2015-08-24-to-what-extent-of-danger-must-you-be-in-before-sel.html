**Content:** [Self-defense can be used to counter any threat to your
person, or to someone else. Self-defense can be as simple as slapping
someone\'s hand away from touching you, or as final as a gunshot.\
\
The key here is *matching level of force.* You can\'t shoot someone who
was touching you and claim self-defense. The level of force used in your
defense can only match the level of force being applied to you. If you
are facing deadly force, you can respond with deadly force,
etc.]{.rendered_qtext}
