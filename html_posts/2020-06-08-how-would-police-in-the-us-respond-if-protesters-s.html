**How would police in the US respond if protesters start aiming laser at
the police in attempt to burn one\'s retina like the way Hong Kong
protesters did? Would such behavior justify deadly force?**

The correct answer in the United States is **yes, this justifies deadly
force.**

Permanent loss of a limb or a bodily function actually does qualify as
"grave bodily harm."

Someone shooting a laser at you with the intent of permanently blinding
you is using force intending to inflict grave bodily harm, and police
can use any force, up to and including deadly force, to stop the act.

They'll probably try to use a lesser level of force to stop you. I'd opt
for the water cannon on the fire truck. But given Minneapolis, this
isn't guaranteed.
