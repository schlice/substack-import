In general, **no**.

The reason: a Christian who is well-grounded in the word of God and very
prayerful will know a few passages just by memory:

> So do not fear, for I am with you;\
> do not be dismayed, for I am your God.\
> I will strengthen you and help you;\
> I will uphold you with my righteous right hand. --- Isaiah 41:10
>
> Even though I walk\
> through the darkest valley, (some translations say "the valley of the
> shadow of death")\
> I will fear no evil,\
> for you are with me;\
> your rod and your staff,\
> they comfort me. --- Psalm 23:4

The Psalms are full of passages which talk about not being afraid (27,
46, 118, etc). I won't list them all here, but if you're feeling afraid,
Psalms is a great place to go for encouragement.

> Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid or terrified because of
> them, for the Lord your God goes with you; he will never leave you nor
> forsake you. --- Deuteronomy 31:6
>
> Indeed, the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Don't be afraid;
> you are worth more than many sparrows. --- Luke 12:6

So does this mean that nothing should ever frighten you? So if you're
afraid of heights and you climb a tree, should a Christian never feel
that twinge of fear? No, that's not what these passages are saying.
Sometimes, fear is a natural reaction. It keeps us safe in dangerous
situations.

But the fear you're describing is fearing evil, and fearing challenges.
And what these passages tell us is that God will be with us. He wants us
to turn to Him when we are afraid, and He will uphold us. He will
protect us. He will strengthen us and guide us.

In fact, you can take that thought a little further: *if you are afraid
of Satan and of challenges, it's because your faith is not strong enough
yet.*

God has promised that if we turn to Him in our time of fear, He will
strengthen us and uphold us. He will never leave us, never forsake us.
And he has never broken a promise. So we have good reason to trust Him.

Do not live in *fear*. Live in *faith*. Turn to Him in your times of
fear. God is bigger than the boogeyman, as the VeggieTales song goes.
