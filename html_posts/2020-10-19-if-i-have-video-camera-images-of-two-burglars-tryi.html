**If I have video camera images of two burglars trying to break into my
house, will the police do anything even though they were not successful
in invading my house?**

A crime was committed. It was an attempted burglary, which is a crime in
nearly every jurisdiction in the United States.

However, it is highly unlikely that the police will investigate the
incident much beyond taking your statement and your camera footage.
Without some concrete evidence proving the identity of the criminals, it
is highly unlikely that the police can do much.

**Are camera images deemed invasion of privacy?**

No. There is no expectation of privacy on the outside of your home. Your
security cameras are capturing areas on your property, and you as the
property owner control the privacy of those areas. The persons who enter
those areas are bound by your rules of privacy, except in areas on your
property in which there is a reasonable expectation of privacy, like
your bedroom or your bathroom.
