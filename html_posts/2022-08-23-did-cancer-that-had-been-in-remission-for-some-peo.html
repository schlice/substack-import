There are some very limited reports of people with cancer in remission
receiving a vaccine and then seeing increased cancer activity. However,
there is not enough evidence to indicate that the vaccine causes
relapses. Remember: correlation does not equal causation.

The vaccine may indeed cause enlarged axillary lymph nodes, which can be
mistaken for a cancer flare. And of course, the warning about taking the
vaccine while immunocompromised still exists.

However, there doesn't appear to be a causal link between taking the
vaccine and a relapse in a cancer in remission.
