Sure! Anyone can start a voluntary HOA. Just remember that it is a
voluntary HOA. Your neighbor cannot create an HOA that is binding on
anyone who does not voluntarily agree to be part of it.

In most cases in most states (state law is binding here), you can only
start a *mandatory* HOA with the approval of 100% of the homeowners in
the neighborhood. Without that, the best you can do is start a voluntary
HOA.

It's kinda like a club. You pay dues, you get benefits. I don't know
what benefits would be under the control of this particular HOA, but
whatever they are, you'd only get those benefits if you join that HOA.

For example, let's say that you had a clubhouse. Before the old HOA
disbanded, those assets would go somewhere. They either would have been
sold or deeded to someone or some organization. And for argument's sake,
let's say that your neighbor owns the clubhouse now. He can start his
own HOA and call it the Neighborhood Clubhouse HOA, and the people who
join have exclusive use of the clubhouse any time they choose. Others
can request access, but they have to pay usage fees, and they only have
limited access. This would be an example of a voluntary HOA.
