**Content:** [As others have said, it only needs to look like a real gun
in order to be treated like a real gun.\
\
The kid will be dead and the cop will be traumatized for the rest of his
life because he killed a kid with an airsoft pistol.\
\
Be aware of the following:\
]{.rendered_qtext}

- AirSoft pistols have the orange tip. CO2 powered BB guns do not, but
  they are still classified as toys.\
- A can of orange paint will make any gun look like an Airsoft gun.
- And what about guns that are actually concealed inside toys?\
  Like this one?\

These are both real firearms.\

One final picture for your consideration:\

More importantly if I\'m a cop, I\'m not going to take the time to
notice the gun on the left has a smaller interior barrel which fires CO2
powered BBs. If I\'m 50 yards away, I can\'t see that. All I see is a
guy with a gun. Pointed at me. If you stop to think (as the meme says),
you\'re dead.
