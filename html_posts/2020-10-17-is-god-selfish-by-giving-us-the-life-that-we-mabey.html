When do we ever ask whether or not we are going to receive a gift?

Which one of us ever asks to be born? That\'s not even a thing. Whether
God exists or not, we don\'t have a choice whether or not we are
created.

Were our parents selfish by creating us? I mean, they certainly didn\'t
ask us before they made us.

Yet we have the audacity to call God *selfish*?

God created you because he loves you. God created you because he wants
you to be in communion with him.

You\'re welcome to reject that gift. You\'re welcome to not believe that
God exists. You\'re welcome to not accept that Jesus is your savior.

Because one of the greatest gifts that God gave us was *free will.* You
get to look at the totality of the evidence, and decide for yourself
whether or not you want to accept Jesus\' gift.

It\'s your call. God\'s not going to stop pursuing you simply because
you said no.

There\'s a line in a worship song that says, "Your goodness is running
after me." Think about that. God\'s goodness, God\'s love, is *running
after you*. He wants so badly to be in relationship with you that he
*runs* after you. But he will never *force* you. He will always leave
the choice up to you.

So are you going to look askance at the gift you were given because you
didn\'t have a choice in its original giving, or are you going to use
the gift that you were given to do something good in this world?
