**Is there any recourse for a homeowners association (HOA) that requires
80% \"yes\" votes to change anything in the covenants, but can\'t even
get 80% of the homeowners to cast a vote?**

It's not the HOA that requires signatures of 80% of homeowners in order
to change the covenants, it's part of city ordinances. It is your city
which requires 80% of the homeowners to concur to a change to the
covenants on file, because it's part of city charter. Covenants get
incorporated into city charter, and so it requires a majority of
homeowners to change them. Each city and state is different, and not all
of them require 80% concurrence. Some require 75% concurrence, and
others require 100% concurrence.

It's up to the HOA to get out and solicit signatures. We had to go door
to door in our neighborhood to get required signatures. Granted, we only
have 130 homes, so it wasn't too difficult to get the remaining
signatures which didn't come in by mail. But it's the job of the HOA
Board to get out and get those votes, or assemble a committee to do it.

That raises a good point: check your city charter and see if you can
solicit votes by mail. This may be an easy way to collect votes from
your homeowners if you're allowed to do it.
