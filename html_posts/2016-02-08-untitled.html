**Content:** []{.rendered_qtext}

Thank you for your comments and your respectful dialog. This is how a
proper debate should be held. Other Quora users, take note.

I don\'t want to belabor the point of 12-step programs, but they are
founded on the very real belief that addiction is an illness, and that
we are powerless over it. Without such a belief, the very foundation of
any real recovery disappears.

But about your point regarding our national obsession with people who
use drugs, I agree. The two issues (whether or not addiction is a
disease and how the nation views addicts), however, are most definitely
linked. We can\'t change that national obsession until we get the
medical community to admit that addiction is a disease. Once they do so,
we can separate the **user** from the **dealer**. The **user** is a
patient. The **dealer** is a criminal. Under our current system, both
are criminals, which is wrong.
