**Content:** [Here\'s one article that talks about the tort of **public
disclosure of private facts**. While not a cause of action in all
states, it definitely is in some.\

[[Publishing highly personal and embarrassing information about another,
even if completely
true](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=caee70&url=https://www.rcfp.org/browse-media-law-resources/digital-journalists-legal-guide/publishing-highly-personal-and-embarrassi){.external_link

\
And as I mentioned earlier, I\'m not referring to photos taken in an
ostensibly public place but where people have a reasonable expectation
of privacy. I gave the example of the public bathroom. The room is open
to the public, so it is a public space. But there is a reasonable
expectation of privacy in a bathroom, so you can\'t take pictures inside
a bathroom and publish them.\
\
Similarly, there is a reasonable expectation of privacy inside a public
AA meeting, and so you can\'t take pictures there
either.]{.rendered_qtext}
