We already have a method to eject a sitting president in the event we
believe he cannot perform his duties competently.

Amendment 25, Section 4 of the Constitution was added for this expressed
purpose. If the president cannot perform his duties, the Vice President
can remove him from office:

> ***Section 4****. Whenever the Vice President and a majority of either
> the principal officers of the executive departments or of such other
> body as Congress may by law provide, transmit to the President pro
> tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives
> their written declaration that the President is unable to discharge
> the powers and duties of his office, the Vice President shall
> immediately assume the powers and duties of the office as Acting
> President.*
>
> *Thereafter, when the President transmits to the President pro tempore
> of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives his
> written declaration that no inability exists, he shall resume the
> powers and duties of his office unless the Vice President and a

We already have this mechanism in place which uses Congress (who are
elected by the people, unlike the President who is elected by the
states) to determine whether or not the President is fit to perform his
duties.

Besides, we don't need another "no confidence" measure. Presidents are
automatically removed from office every four years, unless the people
decide to leave the president in office for two terms, at which the
president is forcibly limited to two terms.
