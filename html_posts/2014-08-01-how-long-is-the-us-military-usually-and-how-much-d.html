**Content:** [You\'re right, it does depend on the job. Some jobs have
constant duties, and others have cyclical duties. I was a 33S
(Logistics/Communications). Some of my jobs had lots of free time, and
some did not. I spent two years running a data network that was
completely unheard of anywhere else in the military, and it was a
challenge. It was heavily managed from above, so I spent lots of my time
in meetings going over the status of that system. I gave lots of
briefings to the O-6+ crowd, as a 2LT. That was a bit nerve-racking to
say the least, but it was a good experience. I had to build procedures
(and because I had programming experience, I built system utilities for
my crew to do their jobs). I spent three years working at NORAD, and
about half of that time doing shift work. In that particular job, in an
8-hour shift, it was 7.5 hours of absolute boredom punctuated by 30
minutes of sheer terror. I watched more movies than I\'ve ever watched
in my entire life. My wife hated it; she\'d say \"Let\'s rent \<Movie
X\>,\" and I\'d say, \"Sorry, I already saw it at work.\"\
\
During the boring downtime, we would do things like exercises (of the
system; we could go to the gym too) where they would start a simulation
and they would go through all the actions that they would take if that
simulation was live. It was our job to ensure that the test data did not
bleed over into the live system, and we monitored that closely. But
it\'s monitoring a screen, watching for changes. Boring. We monitored
data circuit status screens (like your OC-192 circuits, but we had a
screen showing about 200 circuits), watching for any circuits to go
offline and alerting the appropriate maintenance agency if/when it did.
We knew all the circuits, what they were connected to, and what would
happen if a circuit went offline.\
\
We ran the primary ITWAA systems for North America (Integrated Tactical
Warning and Attack Assessment). If a primary system went offline, we had
an alarm that went off, and we\'d have to take precautionary actions to
ensure that the system failed over to its standby appropriately and that
data was still flowing. Granted, the data was crucial, and we were under
JCS (Joint Chiefs of Staff) requirements that data communications could
be offline for no more than two minutes. When it did happen, we all
snapped to, and there were scheduled (scripted) actions that needed to
take place. We had a big book of checklists that we used when an
incident happened. We\'d flip to the appropriate checklist and step
through it on a secure conference call with all of the affected
agencies. We all had to be certified in our positions, and should there
be a problem that we caused, we would lose our certification and would
have to go through the training program again to be re-certified. So it
was a big deal when something was going on. But like I said, things only
went on for a very short amount of time.\
\
For positions like these, there is a certain amount of personal
accountability that the military expects. They expect you to fill your
downtime with productive activities, like furthering your education (as
you are doing). I did exactly the same, and earned a Masters degree. And
if you find that you have more downtime than you can fill, check with
your shift supervisor. I\'m certain that there are tasks that are of
lesser priority that are waiting in the wings for someone to have time
to do them. That shows initiative, and it\'s those sorts of things that
you will be rewarded for in the future. You want to be known as the
go-getter. You want to be known as the person who takes charge,
regardless of your rank. If you find a deficiency, you do what is
necessary to get it corrected. That\'s the person who gets promoted
first and who people will look out for because they deserve to be where
they are and they want to be retained. This is true in any job, but
definitely so in the military. Because, as you note, there are those who
have a different attitude. We used to call it \"maxing the min\", or
\"just filling the squares;\" doing exactly the minimum amount of
everything required to complete the objective, nothing more. Those
people are what I like to call \"slackers.\" And eventually, good
commanders will see that, and they will be passed over for things like
promotions and good job opportunities, which will be given to the people
that deserve it. Believe me, they will not be able to survive an entire
career with that attitude.\
\
In the civilian world, however, it\'s a little different. Someone who is
an over-achiever could also be looked on negatively: \"You do in 12
hours what your colleague does in 8, so you are inefficient\". So coming
in early and leaving late can be a detriment in the civilian sector.
Government contractors have a military mindset, so that generally
doesn\'t apply there, but at other companies who have to key on
efficiency in order to remain profitable, that attitude of going above
and beyond can sometimes be detrimental, so it must be done judiciously.
But that\'s off-topic, so I\'ll let it go.]{.rendered_qtext}
