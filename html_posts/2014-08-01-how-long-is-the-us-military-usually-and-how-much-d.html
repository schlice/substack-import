<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [You\'re right, it does depend on the job. Some jobs have<br>constant duties, and others have cyclical duties. I was a 33S<br>(Logistics/Communications). Some of my jobs had lots of free time, and<br>some did not. I spent two years running a data network that was<br>completely unheard of anywhere else in the military, and it was a<br>challenge. It was heavily managed from above, so I spent lots of my time<br>in meetings going over the status of that system. I gave lots of<br>briefings to the O-6+ crowd, as a 2LT. That was a bit nerve-racking to<br>say the least, but it was a good experience. I had to build procedures<br>(and because I had programming experience, I built system utilities for<br>my crew to do their jobs). I spent three years working at NORAD, and<br>about half of that time doing shift work. In that particular job, in an<br>8-hour shift, it was 7.5 hours of absolute boredom punctuated by 30<br>minutes of sheer terror. I watched more movies than I\'ve ever watched<br>in my entire life. My wife hated it; she\'d say \"Let\'s rent \<Movie<br>X\>,\" and I\'d say, \"Sorry, I already saw it at work.\"\<br>\<br>During the boring downtime, we would do things like exercises (of the<br>system; we could go to the gym too) where they would start a simulation<br>and they would go through all the actions that they would take if that<br>simulation was live. It was our job to ensure that the test data did not<br>bleed over into the live system, and we monitored that closely. But<br>it\'s monitoring a screen, watching for changes. Boring. We monitored<br>data circuit status screens (like your OC-192 circuits, but we had a<br>screen showing about 200 circuits), watching for any circuits to go<br>offline and alerting the appropriate maintenance agency if/when it did.<br>We knew all the circuits, what they were connected to, and what would<br>happen if a circuit went offline.\<br>\<br>We ran the primary ITWAA systems for North America (Integrated Tactical<br>Warning and Attack Assessment). If a primary system went offline, we had<br>an alarm that went off, and we\'d have to take precautionary actions to<br>ensure that the system failed over to its standby appropriately and that<br>data was still flowing. Granted, the data was crucial, and we were under<br>JCS (Joint Chiefs of Staff) requirements that data communications could<br>be offline for no more than two minutes. When it did happen, we all<br>snapped to, and there were scheduled (scripted) actions that needed to<br>take place. We had a big book of checklists that we used when an<br>incident happened. We\'d flip to the appropriate checklist and step<br>through it on a secure conference call with all of the affected<br>agencies. We all had to be certified in our positions, and should there<br>be a problem that we caused, we would lose our certification and would<br>have to go through the training program again to be re-certified. So it<br>was a big deal when something was going on. But like I said, things only<br>went on for a very short amount of time.\<br>\<br>For positions like these, there is a certain amount of personal<br>accountability that the military expects. They expect you to fill your<br>downtime with productive activities, like furthering your education (as<br>you are doing). I did exactly the same, and earned a Masters degree. And<br>if you find that you have more downtime than you can fill, check with<br>your shift supervisor. I\'m certain that there are tasks that are of<br>lesser priority that are waiting in the wings for someone to have time<br>to do them. That shows initiative, and it\'s those sorts of things that<br>you will be rewarded for in the future. You want to be known as the<br>go-getter. You want to be known as the person who takes charge,<br>regardless of your rank. If you find a deficiency, you do what is<br>necessary to get it corrected. That\'s the person who gets promoted<br>first and who people will look out for because they deserve to be where<br>they are and they want to be retained. This is true in any job, but<br>definitely so in the military. Because, as you note, there are those who<br>have a different attitude. We used to call it \"maxing the min\", or<br>\"just filling the squares;\" doing exactly the minimum amount of<br>everything required to complete the objective, nothing more. Those<br>people are what I like to call \"slackers.\" And eventually, good<br>commanders will see that, and they will be passed over for things like<br>promotions and good job opportunities, which will be given to the people<br>that deserve it. Believe me, they will not be able to survive an entire<br>career with that attitude.\<br>\<br>In the civilian world, however, it\'s a little different. Someone who is<br>an over-achiever could also be looked on negatively: \"You do in 12<br>hours what your colleague does in 8, so you are inefficient\". So coming<br>in early and leaving late can be a detriment in the civilian sector.<br>Government contractors have a military mindset, so that generally<br>doesn\'t apply there, but at other companies who have to key on<br>efficiency in order to remain profitable, that attitude of going above<br>and beyond can sometimes be detrimental, so it must be done judiciously.<br>But that\'s off-topic, so I\'ll let it go.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
