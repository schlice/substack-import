**If a law was proposed that all child molesters be shot when convicted
of their first offense, who would likely oppose such a law and why?**

People who are wrongly convicted of molesting a child.

It does happen. And apparently, most of the false allegations are not
made by the child. They are made by adults who care for children, and
the large majority of those are part of court battles over child custody
during divorce proceedings.

Some legal systems lend themselves handily to people abusing the system.
In the UK for example, large payouts to alleged victims without proof of
the allegations required means that more people will be encouraged to
abuse the system.

A system which is known to be abused should not be given a mandatory
death sentence after the first conviction.

Some people like to comment. Some people like to engage with me in a
civil manner, and I did kinda miss that\...a little. But do not
misunderstand, I take this step very cautiously. My mental well-being
isn\'t worth your harassing, inane behavior. If you don\'t like what I
wrote, tough shit. If my answer is grammatically low-quality or is
un-cited opinion masquerading as fact, downvote it. If you think I\'m
wrong, write your own answer. But Quora is a question-and-answer site,
not a debate site. If you are simply commenting to tell me \"ackshually,
you\'re wrong,\" don\'t be surprised if I quietly delete your comment.
Put anything vaguely harassing in there, and your deletion will be
followed by a block and a mute. I will do this immediately and with no
compunction. You have been warned. Be nice.*
