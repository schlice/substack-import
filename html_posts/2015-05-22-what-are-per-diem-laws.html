**Content:** [Per diem is not required by law under the Fair Labor
Standards Act (FLSA). Paying your employees per diem for travel-related
expenses is a good idea, and is also tax-deductible. [[The US
GSA](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=cec194&url=http://www.gsa.gov/portal/content/104877){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="gsa.gov"}]{.qlink_container} lists the Per Diem rate
schedule by city, state, or ZIP code for employee meals plus lodging,
and for incidental expenses. Paying at the approved rate is likely tax
deductible.\
\
Corporations are also not legally required under FLSA to reimburse their
employees for out-of-pocket expenses they incur for work purposes.
However, if their required out-of-pocket expenses reduces their
effective pay rate to below minimum-wage standards, the company could
face a minimum wage violation claim. Therefore, it is in the best
interest of the company to pay work-related out-of-pocket expenses to
employees, and an even better deal for companies to pay per
diem.]{.rendered_qtext}
