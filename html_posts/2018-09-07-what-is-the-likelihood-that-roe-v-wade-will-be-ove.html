**What is the likelihood that Rove \[sic\] v. Wade will be overturned by
the US Supreme Court once Brett Kavanaugh becomes the newest Justice?**

Extremely unlikely.

Two things to remember:

1.  Remember, the Supreme Court has to have a case to hear before a
    precedent can be changed. And this court does not like to change
    precedents. Kavanaugh can't decide, on his own, to simply overturn a
    previous decision. The Supreme Court doesn't work that way.
2.  ***Even if*** the court overturned *Roe v. Wade* (which I already
    said is extremely unlikely), **that does not make abortion
    illegal.** That would simply mean that abortion is not a
    Constitutionally-protected right. The issue would revert to state
    control, because if it's not a Constitutionally-protected right,
    states can decide for themselves whether or not they want to make
    abortion illegal in their state. And at that point, some states
    (maybe like Texas or North Carolina) would outlaw elective
    abortions, while other states (like New York or California) would
    keep everything as it is. The voters in each state would get to
    decide whether or not they would have elective abortions in their
    state, and how that would work.
