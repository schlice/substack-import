**A mass shooting at an air force base in North Dakota resulted in the
deaths of two men. Why do Nazi Trump supporters still defend the Second
Amendment when it causes nothing but pain and death?**

I almost didn't answer this question because the question itself is so
full of hate. So I copied the question into my answer so that if anyone
decides to soften the language in the question any, you can see how it
was originally written.

So let's pick this one apart, shall we?

- **A mass shooting**

Let's look at the first line from [[the press release from the
base](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=f9bd13&url=https://www.grandforks.af.mil/News/Article/2203272/fatal-shooting-occurs-at-grand-forks-air-force-base/){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="af.mil"}]{.qlink_container}, and you judge for yourself
whether or not this is a mass shooting:

> **GRAND FORKS AIR FORCE BASE, N.D. \--**
>
> A shooting incident at approximately 4:30 a.m. today has left two
> 319th Reconnaissance Wing active duty military members
> dead.[\[1\]](#EmPaR){#cite-EmPaR .citation_link}

I'm extremely saddened that two Air Force airmen were killed. But a
*mass shooting*? I don't think so.

- **Why do Nazi Trump supporters still defend the Second Amendment when
  it causes nothing but pain and death?**

I'm unsure what those three statements have to do with each other

- Nazi
- Trump supporter
- Supporter of the Second Amendment

I'm reasonably certain that not all Trump supporters are Nazis. Some may
be, but I'd guess that most are not. I'm also reasonably certain that
not all people who support the Second Amendment are Trump supporters,
nor are they members of the [[American Nazi
Party](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=1e8ce0&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Nazi_Party){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}. In fact, I think, dear
questioner, you'll have a hard time finding even one person who falls
into all three buckets above.

Let's assume, therefore, that you were just spouting hyperbole with the
whole "Nazi" thing and temporarily ignore it. So you're left with:

- **Why do Trump supporters still defend the Second Amendment when it
  causes nothing but pain and death?**

This one I can answer:

*Because it doesn't cause anything even close to pain and death.*

The vast majority of criminals aren't buying legal guns. So even if you
were to abolish the Second Amendment and make gun ownership illegal,
criminals will still buy guns, and they will still use guns. The only
people who won't are law-abiding citizens. Guns won't go away. They'll
just be the exclusive tool of the criminal and the mass shooter. They
won't get much harder to buy, either, since the black market will be the
exclusive place to purchase a gun. Remember, *if guns are outlawed, only
outlaws will have guns*.

Additionally, guns save more lives than they take. Even wildly incorrect
estimates say that roughly five times more lives are saved by guns than
are taken, and that's without a single shot being fired. So saying that
guns cause "nothing but pain and death" is inaccurate at best,
intentionally inflammatory at worst.

You should work on formulating better questions if you want good
answers.
