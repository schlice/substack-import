**Content:** [Depends on whether or not the \"separate desktop\" is on
the same computer or on a different computer.\
\
If you have two screens on the same computer, I ***highly*** recommend
[[DisplayFusion](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=df55de&url=http://www.displayfusion.com){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="displayfusion.com"}]{.qlink_container}. You can set some
applications to force to one monitor or another, and you can also set
them to start in fullscreen mode. You can also modify the wallpaper
individually on each screen, along with a million other functions that
are eminently useful. The developer is a small business and he makes
continuous changes to the code. He\'s very responsive to user requests
as well. One of the best pieces of software I own.\
\
If your two screens are on different computers, you have to come up with
a better option. I can think of a few off the top of my head; most of
them get programmed with
[[AutoHotkey](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=190a0b&url=http://www.autohotkey.com){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="autohotkey.com"}]{.qlink_container}. You can use AHK to
create a utility that runs on startup and places a text file into a
shared folder. The other system would be continuously monitoring the
folder, and when it saw the text file, it deleted the text file and then
started the item in fullscreen. This presumes that you have a shared
folder between the two systems.\
\
If you don\'t have a shared folder between the two systems, you can
still use Synergy or Input Director or Ditto or Beyond Copy or any
number of network-based clipboard utilities to share your clipboard
between the two systems. You can still use AHK to script something that
you place on the clipboard which would be replicated to the other
system.\
\
You can also use shared web-based clipboards to perform similar
functions. Free ones such as
[[cl1p.net](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=e43a98&url=http://www.cl1p.net){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="cl1p.net"}]{.qlink_container} or
[[Pastie](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=58e152&url=http://www.pastie.org){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="pastie.org"}]{.qlink_container} are great choices. Same
thing: write a utility in AHK that monitors the web-based clipboard. The
source system drops something in there, and the target system sees it
and grabs it. This one might be harder, because there may be difficulty
getting the target system to recognize that text is actually present on
the webpage. I\'ll have to work on that one. Perhaps the webpage would
issue a change notice if I was staring at it.\
\
Anyway, there\'s a few ideas for you.]{.rendered_qtext}
