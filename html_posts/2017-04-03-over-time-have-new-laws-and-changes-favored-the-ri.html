I think you need to qualify the question somewhat. *Criminal laws* do
not benefit or hurt anyone within the text of the law, in the context of
the law's applicability. Laws are required by the 14th Amendment to
apply equally to all people, rich or poor. So criminal laws themselves
do not apply unfairly to any one group in particular.

However, it is well known that people who are wealthy have an *easier
time* working with the law. Lawyers are expensive; good lawyers even
more so. The best, most expensive lawyers are better at protecting their
clients; judgments for rich people tend to be lighter because their
lawyers are better at negotiating settlements. Rich people also have it
easier when it comes to things like restitution. A \$10,000 judgement
against a rich person may be a drop in the bucket, whereas the same
judgement against a middle-class working family may be the death knell
in their finances, forcing them into bankruptcy.

Despite the universal applicability of criminal law, ***tax*** ***law***
most definitely favors the wealthy. The richer you are, the more tax
avoidance strategies you are able to implement; while the same tax
avoidance strategies exist for everyone, you generally have to be rich
to take advantage of them. As an example, you can deduct medical costs
from your taxes, but only after your medical costs exceed 10% of your
Adjusted Gross Income (AGI). If your healthcare insurance is paying the
majority of your healthcare expenses, 10% of your AGI out of your pocket
for healthcare is a massive chunk of change. In some years, and with
some big out-of-pocket expenses, you might be able to deduct some of it,
but for most people, for most normal years, you'll never spend that much
out of your pocket. Unless you're rich, and you pay most of your
healthcare expenses without insurance. Then, you could easily spend 10%
of your AGI on healthcare, meaning you'd get a substantial tax break.
Another example is donations. The more money you have, the more money
you can donate, and every donation shaves off significant dollars from
your taxable income. Tax law, therefore, disproportionately benefits the
rich.
