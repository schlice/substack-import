**Content:** [JP, don\'t give up hope! Betaseron is not the only
medicine out there! For someone like you, who has already progressed to
SP, you might consider something like what I did: move to Tysabri.\
\
There are two possible ways for you to go: Tysabri and LDN. LDN is
obviously less risky, but the risk in Tysabri can be managed. If you
don\'t want to take the risk, LDN is a possibility even though it\'s not
officially approved. For folks who have moved to SP, LDN has provided
some amazing benefits.\
\
Talk to your neurologist about switching to something like LDN or
Tysabri.]{.rendered_qtext}
