For someone like you, who has already progressed to<br>SP, you might consider something like what I did: move to Tysabri.\<br>\<br>There are two possible ways for you to go: Tysabri and LDN. LDN is<br>obviously less risky, but the risk in Tysabri can be managed. If you<br>don\'t want to take the risk, LDN is a possibility even though it\'s not<br>officially approved. For folks who have moved to SP, LDN has provided<br>some amazing benefits.\<br>\<br>Talk to your neurologist about switching to something like LDN or<br>Tysabri.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/Ive-had-the-CCSVI-and-had-no-change-how-do-I-know-the-blood-is-flowing-in-my-veins/answer/Jean-Philippe-Hector<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
