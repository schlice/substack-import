**My HOA\'s insurance is replacing roofing due to hail damage. I have
solar and they are asking I bear the cost to remove them for this work.
Do I have any basis to fight this?**

It sounds like you may live in a condo or in some joint-ownership HOA
where the HOA is responsible for part of the ownership of the building.
In this case, the HOA would bear the cost of replacing the roof.

However, you placed solar panels on the roof for your own use. You made
the solo decision to place the panels (with HOA approval, of course),
you bore the cost to place the panels, and therefore you bear the cost
to move the panels so your HOA can replace the roof. The HOA did not
help you fund the panels, or pay for part of the installation cost (I
assume), so the HOA is not liable for the

If you refuse to pay to remove the panels, the HOA will move the panels,
replace the roof, and replace the panels, and then they will bill you
for the additional labor to move the panels.

Unless you have some preset agreement (in writing) sharing the cost of
the panels with the HOA, the HOA is under no obligation to pay for
relocating your solar panels.
