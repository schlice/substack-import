**Is it illegal to gift a lottery ticket to a minor? If an adult buys a
lottery ticket or scratch-off and gives it to a minor, would that be
illegal? The adult buys and redeems the ticket on behalf of the minor.**

The answer is that it varies by state. However, **in all cases**, an
adult must purchase the tickets. There are no states that allow minors
to purchase lottery tickets.

For lottery tickets, there are both in-state and multi-state lottery
tickets. The state rules for lottery tickets vary (some allow tickets to
be gifted to minors, some do not).

Many states are very strict about scratch games, with ad campaigns in
that state reminding residents that scratch tickets are "not child's
play" and that scratch tickets cannot be gifted to minors.

The reason why there are such strong restrictions (in most states) about
gifting lottery tickets to minors is that there is not insignificant
evidence to suggest that kids who received scratch tickets or lottery
tickets as gifts tended to gamble earlier in life, which is a possible
risk factor for more severe gambling disorders later.

Therefore, while it seems innocuous, research suggests that playing
lottery games could potentially lead youth down the path to more severe
disorders later in life.

To that end, I would suggest a different gift for a child than scratch
tickets.
