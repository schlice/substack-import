**What are the HOA compliant alternatives to grass?**

Are you asking this forum if we know your HOA's landscaping rules?

The rules for each HOA are completely different. You will need to
consult your HOA's governing documents to determine what exterior
landscaping is acceptable to your HOA.

In some cases, HOA rules regarding grass are unenforceable due to water
restrictions. For example, our original landscaping policy was not
written during a water shortage, and we originally required homeowners'
landscaping plans to consist of at least 50% turf grass in the front.
Once water restrictions were put in place, that portion of the rules
became unenforceable.

These days, we have an extensive Xeriscape guide in our Landscaping
Policy. In all cases, homeowners who want to make changes to the
exterior of their homes (including landscaping) must submit their
proposed changes to the Architectural Review Committee before they
implement those changes. It's a fair bet that your HOA has a similar
function defined. Make sure you check with them and follow that
procedure before you make changes. If you don't, and your changes
wouldn't have been approved, you could be on the hook for the cost of
fixing it.
