**Will Michael Flynn lose his pension now that he has plead guilty to
committing a felony while in Federal employ?**

In general, no. Being convicted of a crime almost never causes a person
to lose their military pension.

The exception to this would be for crimes related to disloyalty to the
United States: treason, espionage, etc.

Flynn was convicted of lying to a Federal agent. Not enough to cause him
to lose his pension.
