**What should President Trump do to protect himself from leakers and
dissenters on his own staff?**

He should do what he should have done on Day 1: relieve *everyone* of
their jobs and re-hire all employees, and demand that they do their jobs
even if they don't like the source of the order. If they don't want to
do their jobs, they can quit. They don't work to *actively subvert* the
person they are working for. No work force would ever accept that from
an employee, and I wouldn't expect the President to accept that
behavior, either.

As a military member, I may have been dissatisfied with my nation's
choice of commander-in-chief. I may not want to sit down and have a beer
with him. But he's still the commander-in-chief, and when he says jump,
I ask for a max altitude while I'm on the way up.

The problem in the White House, as is the problem with all Government
Service employees, is the Government Service itself. You simply can't do
what I alluded to. You can't relieve someone of a GS job without cause
and without *copious* documentation showing that you warned said
individual over the years. (You can still relieve someone of their job
*with cause*).

So while I'd *like* this to happen, it probably won't.
