answer. I\'d say your best bet at this point is just to pay it and move
on. It\'s probably going to cost you more to fight it because you may
not be able to fight it remotely (i.e. if your remote attorney can\'t
get the charge resolved without a court hearing, you\'d have to go to
California to appear in court with your attorney, so you\'ll have travel
costs as well as attorney\'s fees).\
\
Do you think it will be cheaper to hire an attorney to argue on your
behalf, and risk that they may not be able to resolve the ticket without
a hearing, in which case you\'ll have to travel back to CA to appear in
court? I think it\'s far cheaper and more convenient to just pay it.\
\
At this point, it\'s just a fine. Points are generally not assessed on
red light camera violations. But even if they are, it would be
relatively low. And if you don\'t drive much anyway, it\'s not something
to be seriously worried about.\
\
Additionally, the fine is assessed against the registered owner (or
renter) of the vehicle at the time the infraction occurred. It makes no
difference who was driving the car. If you were the primary driver on
the rental agreement, you are getting the ticket. If the car was not a
rental, you should not have received the ticket in the first place,
because it\'s not your car.\
\
If you\'re saying it\'s not a rental, and it\'s not your license plate,
then it should be pretty straightforward to get resolved. The extended
time can be explained by the move out of state.\
\
So I think your best bet is to contact a traffic violation attorney in
California and see if they are willing to try to resolve the issue for
less than \$780. If they can\'t do it, just pay it and be done with
it.]{.rendered_qtext}
