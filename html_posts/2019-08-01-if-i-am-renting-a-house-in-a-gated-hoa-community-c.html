**If I am renting a house in a gated HOA community, can I sublet without
letting the HOA know?**

In all cases, check your governing documents to find out.

Most HOAs do not allow subletting in single-family home communities
because this is a city zoning issue. You may be allowed to do short-term
rentals (like AirBnB), but subletting is where you divide up your
property and you live there as well as someone else.
