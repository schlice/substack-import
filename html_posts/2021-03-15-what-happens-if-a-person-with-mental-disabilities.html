**What happens if a person with mental disabilities is caught sexually
abusing children over the internet?**

Well, you can't sexually assault someone you can't touch, but you can
commit online sexual harassment. The problem, of course, is that the law
hasn't fully caught up with the technology. Usually enforcement begins
with the platform on which the abuse is taking place, but if law
enforcement is involved, then it proceeds outside of the jurisdiction of
the provider.

The mental disability of the suspect can be a mitigating factor, but it
does not eliminate the crime. It may cause the state to involuntarily
commit the suspect to treatment, and/or to declare the suspect a "mental
defective."
