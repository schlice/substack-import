**How long does the House have to turnover the impeachment to the
Senate?**

There is no Constitutionally-defined timeframe within which the House
must turn over Articles of Impeachment to the Senate.

But why delay?

Pelosi has no control over how the Senate conducts business, just as
McConnell had no control over how the House conducted its
investigations.

What's she afraid of?

She's said all along that she did her duty by filing the Articles. Now
it's up to the Senate to take them and do their thing with them. That
part is out of her hands.

She claimed just a few weeks ago that we couldn't wait until 2020 to
vote Trump out. He was such an existential threat to democracy that we
had to push forward with impeachment.

What changed today? Why withhold the Articles of Impeachment from the
Senate? What happened to the "existential threat" to our democracy?

So is she trying to control how the Senate conducts its business?
Constitutionally, she has no say in that decision. She should not
attempt to influence the Senate, just as McConnell did not try to
influence how the House did its business.

She simply cannot have the Senate acquit Trump. He can't be "impeached
and acquitted." If he won't be convicted, she's going to ensure that he
is only "impeached" and nothing more. If he's acquitted, then the
Articles were meaningless. If he's "not acquitted" then the Articles
still have meaning, even if by "not acquitted" it's never went to trial.

However, the argument can be made that if the articles never go to the
Senate, he's not really impeached. Impeachment is a process, not a vote.
She must complete the process, or she appears to be the one with the
ulterior motive.

It's a disaster for Democrats right now, and it becomes clearer every
day that they are grasping at straws for whatever advantage they can
garner in 2020.
