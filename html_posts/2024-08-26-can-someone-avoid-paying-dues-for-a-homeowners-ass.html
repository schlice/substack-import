The simple answer to this question is no, you cannot avoid paying dues
to an HOA if the HOA is not following their own rules.

The details: There is nowhere in your Governing Documents in which there
is a provision to allow you to forego your dues payments if you believe
that the HOA is not following the rules. Paying dues and holding the HOA
accountable are two separate operations.

If you believe the HOA is not following the rules, you should (in this
order):

1.  Notify the HOA that they are violating the rules, and await their
    response.
2.  If they respond and they admit their fault, they will fix it.
    Problem solved.
3.  If they do not respond, or if they respond and deny their fault, you
    will have to hire an attorney and sue the HOA, which will most
    likely send you into arbitration. You will meet with an arbitrator,
    you will discuss your concerns, the HOA will present their
    arguments, and the arbitrator will make a decision, and you will
    both sign the agreement, and you will both be bound by the
    agreement.

None of that has anything to do with the provisions which you agreed to
when you bought your property requiring you to pay dues. And nowhere in
the process of holding the HOA accountable is a provision which allows
you to withhold your dues payments.

If you have a complaint about dues, you need to address that separately.
But your perception that the Board is violating its own regulations does
not grant you authority to stop paying your dues.
