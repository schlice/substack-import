If the easement is written into the Governing Documents of the HOA, the
HOA can enforce it.

I can probably safely assume that we're not talking about a utility
easement (because that's between the homeowner and the utility
provider), so we're either talking about a private easement or a
prescriptive easement. Since you said it's in the Governing Docs, it's
probably not an easement by necessity, so it is most likely a private
easement.

If it is a private easement imposed on each homeowner by the HOA, then
it's up to the HOA to enforce. So you can either sue the HOA to force
them to enforce the easement, or you can sue the neighbor to force her
to grant you access to the easement as listed in the Governing
Documents.

Alternatively, you can ignore the lot of them and continue to use the
easement, and then cite the easement if she files trespassing charges
against you.

Original question:

**Can a Homeowners Association enforce an easement written on the HOA
CC&Rs? I\'m asking because HOA won\'t enforce the easement. I was told
it\'s a neighbor\'s issue and to take my neighbor to court since she
doesn\'t allow me entrance to the easement.**
