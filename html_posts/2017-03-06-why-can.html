Because their ownership of a gun has nothing to do with your feelings.
If it did, we'd have to consult with you before we purchased guns. The
simple fact that no one is required to consult with you before
purchasing a gun should tell you that your feelings have no bearing on
anyone's decision to buy a gun.

Own your feelings. They are yours. Only you can fix them. You cannot fix
your fears by removing the source of the fear. You must find out why you
are fearful and work to overcome your fear.

There are probably counselors in your area who can help you with your
fears.
