**What happens when somebody shoots the police in self-defence?**

You can only defend yourself against someone who is ***unlawfully***
using force against you.

In the United States, when a police officer is acting "under color of
law," which means a police officer is functioning as a law enforcement
officer and carrying out his duties under the law, he is not acting
unlawfully.

Using force against a police officer (including deadly force) who is
lawfully performing his duties is a crime. It is called **resisting
arrest**. Some jurisdictions also have a crime called **failure to
follow lawful order or directive.**

If you shoot a police officer and you believe your action was
permissible because you were acting in self-defense, you would have to
prove that the police officer was not acting under color of law, or the
police officer's actions put him outside of the law. That is the only
way your actions would be considered self-defense. Very rarely in this
country is this ever found to be the case.
