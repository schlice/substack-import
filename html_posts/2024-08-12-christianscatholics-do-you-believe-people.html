The talent itself is a gift from God. *Utilizing that talent, to the
best of your ability,* takes practice, dedication, and determination.
There is a difference between discovering you have a talent, and using
practice, dedication, and determination to make yourself *good at*
whatever your talent is.

My parents were a big part in cultivating my talent, because they were
the biggest part of my life at the time my talent began expressing
itself. When I was three, I had one of these children's play pianos

very much like this one. I would watch *Sesame Street* on TV and play
the theme song on this piano, by ear. At this point in my life, the
talent was *raw*. It was *unrefined*. It was purely a gift from God.

But from then on, after *recognizing* the gift, my parents put me into
lessons. I spent the next thirteen years honing that talent. Today, I
use that talent to draw people closer to God and to lead them in worship
of Him. It's what I was meant to do with this gift. I have seen it touch
people's hearts. I have seen it draw people closer to Him. There is no
greater source of joy than to use a talent God has given you to give
back to Him in a tangible, measurable way. I am fortunate and blessed to
be able to share that with people.
