If the animal truly is a service animal, the answer is no. The Fair
Housing Act prevents landlords from discriminating against tenants with
service animals. Service animals are either dogs or miniature horses.

Of course, in the common day, people equate "service animal" with
"emotional support animal" and they are not the same thing. While
"service animals" are dogs or miniature horses, "emotional support
animals" can be any breed or type of animal. While landlords generally
cannot deny someone specifically because they have an ESA, the rules are
slightly different. You can only keep an ESA if you have a doctor's
prescription for one, and you can only get a doctor's prescription if
you have a diagnosed emotional or mental health disorder. Here in NC, we
call that prescription an **ESA letter.**

Here, an individual must be diagnosed with an emotional or mental health
disorder by a licensed mental health professional (LMHP) to qualify for
an ESA letter. Landlords can deny an ESA if the ESA letter is
illegitimate or invalid. This includes letters from fake or counterfeit
online businesses, letters from unlicensed healthcare providers, or
forged letters. They can also deny an ESA if the animal is going to be a
nuisance or would create an undue burden on the facility or the other
tenants (think an emotional support llama or an emotional support pig).
It can also be denied if the ESA will require fundamental alterations to
the service provided.
