**What \"LORD JESUS SPOKE the truth ABOUT life\".IF after 2000 YEARS ANY
person REALIZES What JESUS SPOKE AND the truth, What WILL HAPPEN TO the
person?**

The seminal verse of the Bible, the central theme, the "thesis
statement" of the whole Bible, is John 3:16.

> For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that
> whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.

So let's break this verse down, because there's a lot packed in here:

**For God\**
John is talking about God himself here, and what God has done, and why.

**so loved the world**\
God loves everyone in the world, and the entire world, in exactly the
way he created it, with all of what we perceive to be its "faults."

**that he gave his one and only Son\**
This is a difficult one to wrap your head around. Imagine your wife is
in labor with your one and only son, and the doctor says that it's so
bad that one of them will die. You hear those fateful words: "It's your
son's life, or your wife's. You have to decide." You decide that your
other kids need a mother, and if you're selfish, you need your wife, so
you tell the doctor to save your wife. How difficult would that have
been for you to do? Now think about this: God sent his son to this earth
knowing full well that he would suffer and die. He made that choice,
long before Jesus was ever born.

**that whoever believes in him\**
Again, God says that the ONLY method of salvation is believing in Jesus
such that you know the sacrifice he made for you, that he accepted on
himself the sins of the world --- past, present, and future --- to save
you and to make you right with God again. And it also implies that
salvation is available to *anyone*, regardless of when they lived.
***Jesus died once, for all***. He took on the sins of the world and
opened the door to salvation. It is through him that we are saved. And
anyone can enter that door. All that is required is faith.

**shall not perish**\
This is a tough one to swallow, because it says that *some will perish*.
Yes it's true, not all will be saved. If, by believing, you shall not
perish, then *not believing* implies that you *will perish*.

**but have eternal life\**
God reaffirms that salvation is only by grace through belief in Jesus
and his sacrifice for you.

But you can see the implication in this phrase. **Those who do not
believe will not be saved.** In my estimation, when I hear "do not
believe," that to me implies a conscious choice. Someone has heard the
word, understands the word, and maybe even accepts what it says. *And
they actively choose to not believe in the salvation offered by Jesus.*
That, to me, is someone who "does not believe."

So what happens to them? Eternal separation from God. *And eternity is
an awfully long time to be wrong.*

And what happens to those who believe? Salvation, and eternity in
communion with God.
