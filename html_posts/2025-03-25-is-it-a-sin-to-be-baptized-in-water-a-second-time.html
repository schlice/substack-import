I started out my faith journey as a baby, when my parents baptized me as
a Roman Catholic. I was "sprinkle baptized," which isn't Biblical. No
one was "sprinkle baptized" in the Bible. And no one was a baby, either.

Catholics believe that baptism is required to impart God's grace, so
parents get their babies baptized as quickly as possible.

Protestants do not believe that baptism does anything special to you.
**Protestants do not believe that baptism saves you. Protestants believe
that baptism is what saved people do.**

Later on, I was baptized by immersion of my own choosing and through the
urgings of the Spirit, to show that I was "all in" on my faith.

We were commanded to be baptized, to prove to the world and to ourselves
that we stand for something greater than ourselves, not to gain
salvation. Ephesians 2:8--9 says that it is by grace through faith that
you are saved, not by anything you can do yourself. Baptism (as a thing
you do) no more saves you than putting on a Tampa Bay Lightning jersey
makes you an NHL hockey player. You become an NHL hockey player when you
sign your contract, just as you are saved when you repent and believe.
Much like the hockey jersey represents your NHL contract, baptism is an
outward sign of an inward salvation. But anyone can put on a hockey
jersey; it doesn't make them any more a hockey player than dunking
yourself in a tub of water makes you saved.

TL;DR: **Repentance and belief save you. Baptism does not save you.**
And once you've been baptized (through immersion baptism), you don't
need to be baptized again. You can certainly choose to be baptized
again, but it's not necessary, and one might question your motives if
you were already saved and you've already been baptized.
