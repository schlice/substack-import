**Can you legally ask the officer to leave his gun in his vehicle
because you're afraid of guns?**

You can ask the officer anything you like. However, it's likely that you
won't get an affirmative answer.

I'm sure the officer will respond with something like, "Tell ya what.
Don't give me a reason to take it out, and I'll leave it right inside my
holster where it won't bother anyone."
