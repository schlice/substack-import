**Content:** [To piggyback on Terence\'s answer, Ubuntu is delivered on
a LiveCD. Just boot your computer from the CD and try Ubuntu for as long
as you like. When you\'re ready, you can install it **over top of**
Windows, or **next to** Windows, so that you can boot your computer into
*either* operating system. It\'s called a \"dual-boot\" computer
solution. However, Windows is pretty greedy about booting its own
operating system, so make sure Windows is installed first, then install
Ubuntu next to it. Follow the directions in Terence\'s post for setting
up the dual-boot.\
\
Dual-booting is very safe, and even if you totally hork your bootloader,
it can be fairly easily recovered to get your Windows image back up and
running.\
\
Ultimate in flexibility: get VMware and run Ubuntu, Windows, Fedora,
Mint, etc. on individual virtual machines. I\'ve stopped running
installers now that I have all my VMs up and running.]{.rendered_qtext}
