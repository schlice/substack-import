**Can you get a handicap parking space in front of someone else\'s
house?**

Assuming that there is no parking lot in front of someone else's house,
most on-street parking is *unregulated*. There are usually no marked
parking spaces in front of *any* single-family houses in the United
States. Not always, but in most cases, there is no regulated parking in
a city street.
