For completeness, let me discuss how we translate the Bible, and why
there are differences in methodology when we do translations.

For example, Hebrew, as a language, has fewer words than English, so
each word has multiple meanings. So a word-for-word translation would
actually translate the word, but the sentence may not convey the same
meaning, because the author writing in Hebrew may have meant one of the
other meanings of the words.

We have exactly the opposite problem when translating from Greek. For
example, our word "love" in English has no fewer than *six* different
words in Greek. So when we say "love," which one of the six words in
Greek are we referring to?

Therefore, when doing a Bible translation, there are three different
philosophies that the translator can follow:

- Word-for-word
- Thought-for-thought
- Paraphrase

Each philosophy has its own advantages and disadvantages, which we began
to look at when we started answering this question. Word-for-word
translations translate the words accurately, but sometimes miss the
thoughts. When you move up a level to thought-for-thought translations,
the translator will read an entire sentence in the source language and
then write it in the target language. It may not preserve the original
words, but it preserves the original thoughts. A paraphrase translation
doesn't worry about retention of words or thoughts, but it intentionally
*re-states* the paragraph, often adding many words in order to fully
describe what the original author was trying to say.

Here's a handy chart you can use to see where the various translations
land on the scale, from most word-for-word accuracy, to most
understandable in terms of what the author was trying to say.

According to this, the most accurate word-for-word translation is the
New American Standard Bible (NASB), followed closely by the Amplified
Bible (AMP).
