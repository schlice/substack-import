It's so sad that you think your little cause is worth destroying the
country over. You are so shallow and pathetic and whiny.

It's also so ironic because of WHAT YOUR OWN CANDIDATE SAID ABOUT THIS
VERY ISSUE! Hillary called Trump's failure to clearly state that he
would accept the results of the election "horrifying." She tweeted:

> Donald Trump refused to say that he'd respect the results of this
> election.
>
> That's a direct threat to our democracy.

She went on to say, "That's not the way our democracy works. We've been
around 240 years. We've had free and fair elections and we've accepted
the outcomes when we may not have liked them and that is what must be
expected of anyone standing on a debate stage during a general election.
President Obama said the other day that when you're whining before the
game is even finished it just shows you're not even up to doing the job.
"

She added, "And let's be clear about what he's saying and what he means.
He's denigrating---he's talking down our democracy. I for one am
appalled that somebody who is the nominee of one of our major two
parties would take that kind of position."

And yet, she wants in on the recount. She called it "horrifying," and
she wants in. Yep, figures.

It's so funny that you had no problem with the results of the EC, so
long as it benefited you. Ah, I remember so fondly how the Republicans
wanted to disband the EC and were pushing for a Constitutional amendment
and an end-run around the Constitution when Obama won two terms...wait,
that never happened.

Keep answering. Your hypocrisy only continues to become more apparent
every time you post something. You make my arguments for me.
