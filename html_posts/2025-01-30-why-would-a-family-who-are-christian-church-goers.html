title: "Why would a family who are Christian church-goers disown a non church-going niece because she gave a vacation house they wanted to a Christian charity for children instead of to them? Seems like it would be the opposite."

We can't speak to why one particular person, or one particular family,
would do or not do something.

People only act in a Godly way when they choose to follow God's will for
their lives. And people choose every day to either act in a Godly way or
not. Our free will often leads us to choose actions which are not in
keeping with "God has prepared for those who love Him" (1 Cor 2:9).

Their choice doesn't make them Christian or not Christian. It makes them
*human*. And again, I can't speak to what they did because I don't know
why they did what they did. I can only tell you that *as a Christian*, I
can't speak to what they did because that's not what Christianity is
about.

When you become a Christian, you don't automatically do everything in a
completely obedient manner. Your flesh remains. Your old habits remain.
Your old proclivities remain. It is only through willing and active work
and study that you become, over time, a better version of yourself.
Sometimes, it's a lifelong process, one which Christians call
***sanctification***. Over time, through work and prayer, we become more
like God in our thoughts, words, and actions.
