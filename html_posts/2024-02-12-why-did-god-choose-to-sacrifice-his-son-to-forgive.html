If God's nature is as He says it is, then the answer is no.

God is infinitely forgiving, **but at the same time,** He is infinitely
just.

So in order for him to be both forgiving *and* just, then sin must be
atoned for. God cannot dismiss sin. ***Someone*** must pay the price for
the sin.

So there's really only two choices: we pay for our own sin (and we never
enter Heaven), or someone pays for our sin for us. That's it. Someone
has to pay.

God doesn't want us to *not* enter Heaven (as He is infinitely
forgiving). But He cannot allow us into Heaven if our sin is still
unpaid (as He is infinitely just).

Therefore, the only solution is for someone else to pay for our sin.

The only person who could pay for our sin is someone who is born
sinless. And the only person who did not inherit Adam's sin by being
born from the seed of a man is Jesus, who was born through direct
creation by God. Therefore, He was born sinless.

He then lived a completely sinless life, in contrast to the rest of us,
who do not live sinless lives.

He was then fully capable of taking on our sin on the cross and atoning
for it with His death. Only He was able to do this. No one else was able
to pay for our sin.

\

Now, let's take it even further.

Jesus was the only one capable of taking on our sin. *But Jesus is God.*

So God took our sin *on Himself*.

Think about that for a second. God is infinitely loving, infinitely
forgiving, and infinitely just. There was no other option to get us to
Heaven other than God taking the punishment for our sin *onto Himself*.
His infinite forgiveness drove Him to take our punishment Himself.
