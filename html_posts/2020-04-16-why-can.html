**Why can\'t President Trump impose a national lockdown like India?**

Wow, a lot of answers, a lot of speculation, a healthy dose of TDS
(which always appears when Trump's name is in a question) and still no
one has actually touched on the right answer:

**The President can only do what the Constitution allows him to do.**

There is no power granted to the Executive branch which allows the
President to issue an order that all states must follow. Period.

The President could declare a "national emergency," which he has done
before, but all this does is activate certain provisions of other
Federal laws. Unless there is a Federal law which allows the President
to issue binding orders to the states in cases of national emergencies,
and I'm not aware of one if it does exist, the the President simply
doesn't have the authority to issue a "national lockdown."

The Constitution exists to define and **limit** the power of the Federal
government. Any power or authority not expressly granted to the Federal
government belongs to the states, and to the people, respectively.

Simply put: **the President can't impose a national lockdown because the
Constitution hasn't authorized him to do it.**
