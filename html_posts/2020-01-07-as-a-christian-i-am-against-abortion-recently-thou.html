**As a Christian, I am against abortion. Recently, though, I\'ve been
hearing a lot of pro-choice people making the argument that it\'s \"my
body\" or \"my choice\", and I\'m not sure how to respond. What can I
say to debate against that as a Christian?**

To answer this question from the Christian point of view is to
understand the Christian's objection to abortion.

**Christians believe that life begins at conception, and God creates all
life. Abortion destroys that life, and Christians consider that
murder.**

These arguments are, again, specifically related to the Christian's
point of view. These are not legal arguments, and there are quite a few
valid concerns that people may have regarding the Christian's view.
We're not addressing those in this answer. There are also other,
non-Christian objections to abortion, but we're not discussing those
here either.

The basic argument says that nothing gives a mother the right to kill
her child, whether it's in the mother's body or not.

As for the argument about "my body," the fact that the baby grows inside
a mother is natural and expected. This fact does not give a person the
right to take a life. No person has the ability to murder anyone else.
And before you ask, there is a difference between homicide (taking a
life) and murder (the **unlawful** or **unjustified** taking of a life
with malice aforethought). To that end, just because the baby begins its
life growing inside of a mother doesn't give the mother the unilateral
right to kill that baby.

There is no such thing as an "unexpected pregnancy."

There is "choice," and in most cases (considering the comparatively
small numbers of abortions which occur due to rape or incest), that
choice is voluntarily engaging in a behavior which is designed to create
a baby. But this isn't about "punishing" a woman for having premarital
sex. It's about understanding that decisions have consequences, and
there are many choices available. Destroying a life that God created is
not a choice in which we believe.

The choice we endorse is bringing that baby to term and giving it up for
adoption.

We do know that there are significant barriers to adoption, and
pregnancy does change a woman's physiology, and these are indeed
concerns that need to be addressed.

But from the Christian's perspective, none of those concerns validate
the choice to kill a baby.
