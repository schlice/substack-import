Yep.

Baptism is an outward sign of an inward truth. Baptism means "I'm
declaring to the world that Jesus is my personal savior, and I will
demonstrate how I will die and be buried with Him (go under the water)
and will rise with Him on the last day (come up out of the water). It's
a very visceral, visual representation of what it means to be a
Christ-follower. It was very important in the time of Jesus: to show
*visually* that you were taking that step of faith as a believer. So it
is commanded of believers, and so we do it today.

Baptism doesn't confer any special power or authority on to you. In
fact, you can be unbaptized and still get to heaven. Just look at the
thief on the cross. He wasn't a Christian until he was hung on a cross
next to Jesus, and Jesus promised him heaven.

But for those of us not hanging on a cross, we are commanded to be
baptized *as believers*. We demonstrate our belief through baptism.

In other words, baptism isn't what saves you. Baptism is what saved
people do.

So yes, God will indeed answer prayers from someone who is unbaptized.
And hopefully, that person who is unbaptized will give their life to
Jesus and will *get* baptized.
