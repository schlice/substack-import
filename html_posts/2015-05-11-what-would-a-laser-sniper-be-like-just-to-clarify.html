**Content:** [We do currently have some directed energy weapons such as
the [[Boeing
YAL-1](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=ea5b38&url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_YAL-1){.external_link

is designed to shoot down ICBMs.\
\
Of course, the program is over-budget and behind schedule. It likely
won\'t survive. But the concept has proven that we can do it.\
\
The problem, of course, is size. We have to house this one in a 747. We
won\'t get laser sniper rifles or laser pistols any time in the
foreseeable future. The technology to do it just isn\'t there
yet.]{.rendered_qtext}
