I've never heard of MS lesions referred to as "brain damage." I think
generally we associate "damage" with injury rather than illness. But in
a purely technical sense, the brain is "damaged" when myelin is
destroyed by white blood cells and replaced by plaques (or scars, thus
the term "multiple sclerosis," meaning "many scars").

And while [[Robert Pfaff](https://www.quora.com/profile/Robert-Pfaff-5)
]{.qlink_container}offers some valuable insight about Vitamin D, I must
caution you against too much self-diagnosis or self-medicating, even
with vitamins. Because while we do know that Vitamin D can have a
prophylactic effect against development of the disease (while you are
young), we don't know exactly what its action is, when it is effective,
or how much you should take. We also know that taking D3 can be damaging
in larger quantities, so you must take care before simply starting or
changing any of your medications or supplements.
