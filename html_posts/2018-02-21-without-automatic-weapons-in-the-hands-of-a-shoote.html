**Without automatic weapons in the hands of a shooter, how could the Las
Vegas deaths have happened and 17 children get murdered in mass
killings?**

Maybe I'm not understanding the question, but it seems like you're
asking how people can kill if they don't have guns.

You do realize that guns make killing ***easier***. Guns don't make
killing ***possible.***

Here's a few examples of other items which are not guns which have been
used to kill:

- Trucks. [[Man kills 8 in New York City truck
  attack](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=ba6819&url=https://www.cnn.com/2017/10/31/us/new-york-shots-fired/index.html){.external_link

- Bombs. [[2002 Bali

  rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"

  qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}
- Fire. [[Cases of arson-homicide in Australia almost double in 20
  years:
  study](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=d3aca3&url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-07-03/arson-homicides-on-the-rise-in-australia-institute-criminology/6592448){.external_link
  rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"

  qt-tooltip="abc.net.au"}]{.qlink_container}
  - Arson is the tool *du jour* in Australia. Incidentally, you'll
    notice that arson homicides have doubled since the Australians
    instituted a gun ban, which just lends credence to my stance that if
    you take guns away, killers will simply change their killing tools
- Knives. [[A knife attack every 4 minutes; 130,000 per year - but
  ministers still insist crime rates are
  falling](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=5598da&url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1036154/A-knife-attack-4-minutes-130-000-year--ministers-insist-crime-rates-falling.html){.external_link
  rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"

  qt-tooltip="dailymail.co.uk"}]{.qlink_container}
  - Knives are the preferred killing tool in the UK. There, where guns
    are also banned, roughly 350 people **per day** are victims of knife
    attacks.
- Airplanes. [[September 11
  attacks](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=1c9366&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_11_attacks){.external_link

Any one of these methods could have been used with varying degrees of
success in Las Vegas and in Parkland, FL. Some methods may have caused
fewer deaths, others may have caused far more deaths.

This is the reason that focusing on the tool is the wrong idea. I mean,
let's make sure we're not sloppy with the tool. I think we should raise
the minimum age to buy a long gun to 21 (not possess, just buy, and then
keep a record of transfer to someone under 21). But beyond things like
that, let's make sure we focus on the killer, not the tool they use. You
do remember that murder is illegal too, right? Yet these killers,
regardless of the tool, continue to murder, despite the presence or
absence of the tool.
