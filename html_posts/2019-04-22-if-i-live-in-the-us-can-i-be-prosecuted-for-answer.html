**If I live in the US can I be prosecuted for answers describing illegal
activities?**

You cannot be prosecuted for describing how to commit a crime (it's
monumentally stupid, but it's not illegal). You *can* be prosecuted for
admitting that you gained your knowledge of how to commit a crime *by
actually committing a crime*.

It doesn't matter where or when you admit to a crime, be it an online
forum or in a bar. If you admit to committing a crime, you can be
investigated and prosecuted based on your own un-coerced admission.
