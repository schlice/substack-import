First off, Reagan was never a proponent of gun control while he was
president. In fact, he lobbied for the abolishment of the BATF *after*
his assassination attempt in 1981. He was one of the most staunchly
pro-gun presidents of the modern era.

Machine guns have been banned since the National Firearms Act of 1934.
Reagan didn\'t sign that. What FOPA did was reopening interstate sales
of long guns on a limited basis, legalization of ammunition shipments
through the U.S. Postal Service (a partial repeal of the Gun Control
Act), removal of the requirement for record keeping on sales of
non-armor-piercing ammunition, and federal protection of transportation
of firearms through states where possession of those firearms would
otherwise be illegal. Those are pro-gun measures. The machine gun ban
mirrored what was already in the National Firearms Act. It was a
non-starter.

Two years after Reagan left office, he did soften on some of his
positions, and did support the passage of the Brady Bill, which did
eventually get passed into law in 1993. He said of the Brady Bill:
\"\[t\]his nightmare might never have happened\" in an [[op-ed in the
