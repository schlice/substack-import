**If my mom dies in the hospital, will I have to pay her medical bills?
I\'m 18, going to college in the fall, and I live in Iowa. Her and I are
both on Medicaid.**

The fact that she is on Medicaid is important.

With Medicaid, the state in which she dies can recover medical payments
made from the time she turned 55 until the time of her death.

The state can only use assets to pay the bill; the state can't make you
pay the bill out of your own pocket. They also can't collect from you if
you (or another adult sibling) lived in her house for at least two years
and helped to provide care which kept her out of a nursing home or other
medical facility. Since the only asset you are allowed to keep on
Medicaid is a house, the state can put a lien on the house to recover
the money. Alternatively, some states may be willing to negotiate and
allow the executor to pay a reduced amount to settle the hospital debt.

For people who were not on Medicaid, the estate is responsible for
paying the medical bills, up to its capacity to do so. However,
somewhere[ [around 30

responsibility" laws which state that you can be required to pay for a
deceased parent's medical bills. [\[1\]](#bjgcD){#cite-bjgcD
