In criminal law, **Blackstone's Ratio** says:

> *It is better that ten guilty persons escape than that one innocent
> suffer.*

This was stated by the English jurist Sir William Blackstone in
[[*Commentaries on the Laws of
England*](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=54d21e&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commentaries_on_the_Laws_of_England){.external_link

part of the foundation for what would later become the US Constitution.

Blackstone's Ratio was also re-stated by Benjamin Franklin, who said
\"it is better 100 guilty Persons should escape than that one innocent
Person should suffer.\"

It is a principle with which I wholeheartedly agree. I would rather see
ten murderers be exonerated than one innocent person be wrongfully
convicted of murder.

It's also interesting that those with authoritarian leanings tend to
think the other way. Apparently, both Bismarck and Pol Pot have said the
opposite, that it is better that "ten innocent men suffer than one
guilty man escape."
