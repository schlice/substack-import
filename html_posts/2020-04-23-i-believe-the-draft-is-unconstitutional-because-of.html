**I believe the draft is unconstitutional because of the 13th Amendment.
Is this fair?**

You are welcome to your opinion. But the Supreme Court disagrees.

Basically, the court already weighed this decision and balanced the 13th
Amendment against Article I, Section 8, which gives Congress the power
to "raise and support armies" (Clause 12)

Additionally, the Necessary and Proper clause (Clause 18) permits the
government to "make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for
carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers\[.\]"

The court has interpreted these two clauses together to find that
conscription (i.e. the draft) is Constitutional and is part of Congress'
enumerated powers. The intent of the 13th Amendment was never to abolish
the draft, and serving in the military, even against your will, is not
involuntary servitude. In [[*Butler v
Perry*](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=db5b73&url=https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/240/328/){.external_link

Supreme Court wrote:
