Cellular data only allows the phone to connect to a data network over
its cellular connection (i.e. 3G, 4G, LTE, etc).

You can use Wi-Fi for most of your communications.

Also, you can choose which of your installed applications use cellular
data when you have it active. If you go into Settings \> Cellular, you
can check/uncheck the applications you wish to have access to your
cellular data. When the apps are unchecked, they will only communicate
over Wi-Fi (when you are connected). Doing this, you may be able to
leave cellular data active (which will only engage when Wi-Fi is
disconnected) and only have a small number of apps use it.

The same page (where the cellular data switches are) will also show you
how much data each one of your apps consumes. Note that it is lifetime
data; you have to reset it to see a particular time frame. The counter
reset button is all the way at the bottom of that page.

You can also use the "brute force" method to force everything on to
Wi-Fi:

1.  Activate "Airplane Mode," which turns off *all* radios
2.  Manually turn on Wi-Fi.

*Can I still make a phone call?*

That depends on your service provider. The iPhone has the capability of
supporting "Wi-Fi Calling," but your carrier needs to support the
feature also (since it's the carrier's VoIP endpoint that will service
the call). T-Mobile, by default, supports Wi-Fi calling. It's how they
make up the difference for an, overall, weaker cellular signal. On a
T-Mobile Android phone, Wi-Fi calling is on by default. On a T-Mobile
iPhone, you must activate Wi-Fi calling.

Not all carriers support Wi-Fi calling. For those that do not, you will
have to activate your cellular radios to make a call.
