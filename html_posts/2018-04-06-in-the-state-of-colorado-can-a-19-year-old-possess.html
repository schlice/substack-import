**In the state of Colorado, can a 19-year-old possess a handgun and have
it transferred to his name?**

A lot of answers here, most of which are technically inaccurate. I'll
answer as a Colorado resident.

Colorado law says no one under 18 may **possess** a handgun. There is no
minimum age under Colorado law to possess a long gun. Federal law says
you must be 21 to **purchase** a handgun, and 18 to purchase a long gun.
Colorado follows Federal law for purchasing; there are no additional
state requirements.

Therefore, you can take possession of a handgun at age 18.

Check with your duty station regarding storage of personal firearms.
