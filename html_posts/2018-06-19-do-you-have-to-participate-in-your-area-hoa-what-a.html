**Do you HAVE to participate in your area HOA? What are the penalties
for refusing to follow HOA rules?**

If you purchase a home in a neighborhood controlled by an HOA, you
signed the agreement to pay your dues at the same time you signed all
the other paperwork to buy your house. Remember that marathon signing
session? One of the things you signed was the **covenants**, which is
one of the governing documents for the HOA. The covenants is on file
with the City, and becomes part of City charter. It's fully legal,
supported by the city, and you're a part of it.

In short, if you bought a house in a neighborhood with a HOA, you
already agreed to participate in it. One of the conditions to buying a
house in an area with an HOA is that you agree to being bound by the
HOA. It's essentially a contract that you must sign when buying your
house.

Penalties for refusing to follow HOA rules are defined in the governing
documents, but they are usually limited to fines. If the HOA owns the
streets (i.e. you live in a gated community), the HOA can define rules
for parking and if you violate those rules, your car can be booted or
towed. If the HOA does not own the streets, punishments for breaking
rules governing parking are limited to fines.

But there's a bigger stick that the HOA has: **liens**. The HOA has an
*ownership interest over your house*, which means that if you fail to
pay your fines (and any late fees and attorney's fees which go along
with administering those fines), the HOA can place a lien against your
house. This means that you can't sell or refinance your house until your
lien is paid.

Even worse, if the HOA decides they have gone long enough without being
paid, they can ***foreclose on your lien***, which means they take the
money they are owed out of the cost of your house when it is sold out
from under you.

So short answer: if you buy a house in an area controlled by an HOA, you
must participate in the HOA, and you can be fined if you don't pay your
dues, a lien can be put on your house to cover the fines, and they can
foreclose on your lien and you can lose your house if you still fail to
pay.
