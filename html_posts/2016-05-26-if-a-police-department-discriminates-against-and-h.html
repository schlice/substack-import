That person should talk to a lawyer. If the lawyer finds that actual
harassment and discrimination exists, they will help you file a lawsuit
against the department.

That person will have to understand that they have a tough row to hoe in
order to meet that burden. You stated that the police have "no valid
reason" for what they are doing, yet you honestly can not know every
reason the police have for doing the things they do, and they are under
no obligation to tell anyone except a lawyer during discovery or the
judge if you get arrested.

There are also varying definitions of what "discrimination" is and what
"harassment" is and if the police are doing their job, they have wide
latitude in the actions they can take. What you "perceive" to be
harassment and discrimination may not be so at all, and might even be
perfectly legal given the context in which it is done.

My suggestion: talk to a lawyer.
