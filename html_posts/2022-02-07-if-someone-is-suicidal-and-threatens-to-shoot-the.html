In the United States, there are very few professions which are
"mandatory reporters." Other than those (and if you are one of them, you
know who you are), you are under no obligation to report anything. There
are a few states where some reporting of crimes is mandatory, but in
most cases, there are no mandatory reporting laws in this country.

However, in your situation, you are claiming that you have inside
knowledge that the police will be called to a wellness check and the
person inside wants to die using the "suicide by cop" method of suicide.
That method: try to shoot the police, and see who's a better shot.
Chances are, it will be the police. But that achieves exactly what they
were going for: suicide, but by goading the police into shooting them.

If you know that this is going to happen, while you're not under any
obligation to tell the police about it, and you're not going to get in
trouble for not telling them, how would that sit on your conscience if
they show up and kill the person and you didn't tell them up front that
you knew it was going to be a suicide by cop? Or worse, what if one of
the cops gets shot and you could have forewarned them? The old saying: a
clear conscience makes for a soft pillow.

Look, you won't get in trouble. But for your sake, call the police and
tell them that this wellness check is actually a suicide by cop. They
will know how to handle it from there. Hopefully, the suicidal person
gets the help that they so desperately need, and no one has to die.

TL;DR: **If you could save a life with a simple phone call, wouldn't
you?**

Original question:

If someone is suicidal and threatens to shoot the police if they are
called for a wellness check, could you get in trouble if you didn't
report it?
