**Why can emergency vehicles break traffic laws when there\'s no
emergency?**

The answer is because traffic laws do not apply to emergency vehicles.

Therefore, they're not "breaking" traffic laws, because in order to
break a law, that law has to apply to you.

Traffic laws apply to "motor vehicles." Motor vehicles are a specific
class of vehicle spelled out in every state's vehicle and traffic law.
All traffic laws apply to motor vehicles.

Emergency vehicles are a separate classification of vehicle. Not all
traffic laws apply to emergency vehicles.

And then there is enforcement. Who polices the police? What is the
penalty for a police officer who violates a traffic law?

Therefore, the law itself does not apply to emergency vehicles, but
department policy specifies how department vehicles are to be driven and
when to use lights and sirens, how fast vehicles should be driven, etc.

Enforcement is done at the department level. If you think a police
officer violated a department policy for safe operation of an emergency
vehicle, you can initiate the review process by filing a formal
complaint with the department.
