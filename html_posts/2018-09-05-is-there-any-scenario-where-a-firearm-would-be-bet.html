**Is there any scenario where a firearm would be better than bear spray
in defending against a bear?**

Only if your firearm is a .50 AE or bigger. Anything smaller and you
could literally just piss off the bear instead of stopping it.

If the bear spray isn't potent enough or isn't applied correctly, you
may also just piss of the bear with it as well.

So I don't like either scenario.

But if I had the choice, I'd have a Desert Eagle or a hunting rifle.
