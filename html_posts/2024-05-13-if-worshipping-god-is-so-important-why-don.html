First of all, *worshipping God* is only important to people who feel
like God deserves worship. They feel this way because they have been
*saved*. They have been guaranteed an eternity with Him after they die.

Sounds like everyone would want this, right? So the next logical
question then would be, "Okay, if 'being saved' is so important, why
don't we have a need or a motivation to get saved?"

The answer: **free will**. If we were *compelled* to do it (even by some
intrinsic need or extrinsic motivation), then we are not *truly* free to
choose.

God has built a system whereby you can freely choose to either love Him
or reject Him, and in this life, no consequences will flow from that
decision. And to make sure that choice is truly free, He places us in a
world filled with evidence of His existence, *but without His direct
presence*, which would be so powerful and awe-inspiring as to overcome
our free will and compel us to believe, negating our free will. In other
words, *God has provided enough evidence in this life to convince
anyone* ***willing*** *to believe, yet he has also left some ambiguity
so as not to compel the* ***unwilling****.* In this way, God gives us
the opportunity either to love Him or to reject Him without violating
our freedom. In fact, the very purpose of this life is to make that
choice freely and without coercion. For love, by definition, must be
freely given. It cannot be coerced.

C. S. Lewis, in his *Screwtape Letters,* wrote the following regarding
God's ability to compel people to do things:
