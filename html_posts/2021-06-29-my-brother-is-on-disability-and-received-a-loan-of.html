While they may legitimately loan you \$5000, it likely comes with
ridiculously high interest rates, or collateral requirements, or
difficult repayment requirements. These practices are what we like to
call *predatory lending*.

Nerdwallet has a good article about predatory lending here. One thing
you can do is to do your homework on the lender. From the article:

> Check its rating and customer reviews at the [[Better Business
> Bureau](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=a8762c&url=http://www.bbb.org/us){.external_link
> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
> qt-tooltip="bbb.org"}]{.qlink_container} and see how many complaints
> are registered against the company. Look for the lender's name among
> the Federal Trade Commission's [[scam
> alerts](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=ded469&url=https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/scam-alerts){.external_link
> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
> qt-tooltip="ftc.gov"}]{.qlink_container}. Finally, check the Consumer
> Financial Protection Bureau's [[complaints
