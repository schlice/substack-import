**Content:** [I\'m sorry that I can\'t answer for Ireland. In the United
States, slander or libel can only be brought as charges if you have
suffered some demonstrable harm from the \"opinion\" of the liar. As
hurtful as the comments may be, at least in the United States, they are
not illegal. If the comments cost you a job, or got you into legal
trouble, you may have a claim. But if someone was simply stating their
opinion (albeit incorrect), it is not illegal.\
\
Perhaps you could post the paper trail on your own website (not
Facebook), appropriately redacted to remove personal information, so
that people who have doubts can see for themselves that you have indeed
used the money as you state you have.\
\
I know, you shouldn\'t have to do that. But in an informaton-driven
world, sometimes it\'s okay to fight misinformation with real
information.]{.rendered_qtext}
