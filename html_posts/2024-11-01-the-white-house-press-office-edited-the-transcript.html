Absolutely it does.

But that's the hallmark of this administration. Deflect and rewrite
history. Gaslight America. Don't believe your lying ears; that's not
what he really said. We'll tell you what he really said, believe us, we
are your betters. We are more smarter than you. We'll do the thinkin'
'round these here parts.

Not like Biden's DOJ is going to pursue charges in this case. But
Trump's DOJ *might*.

Oops.

It's the very definition of "elections have consequences."
