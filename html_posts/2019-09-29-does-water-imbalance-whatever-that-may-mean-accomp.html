**Does water imbalance, whatever that may mean, accompany the onset of a
MS relapse? My friend says that is the first sign that he\'ll need
another infusion, soon.**

Water imbalance is another word for fluid imbalance or dehydration.

[[A
study](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=b16fd9&url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5156578/){.external_link

following:

So it is possible that being dehydrated can trigger the onset of certain
symptoms, such as fatigue, and perhaps can increase stress due to
self-limiting of fluids. All of these factors together could trigger a
relapse.
