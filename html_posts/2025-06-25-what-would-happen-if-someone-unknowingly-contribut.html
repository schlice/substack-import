If you're talking about legal consequences, performing an action that
unintentionally causes the death of another person is generally
classified as **involuntary manslaughter**. This occurs when a person\'s
reckless or negligent actions lead to a death, but there was no intent
to cause harm or kill.

The crime of involuntary manslaughter generally turns on the idea that
the person was doing something *recklessly*. Recklessness in this
context means that the person was doing something without considering
the safety of others. This is normally measured using the "reasonable
person" test: they failed to exercise the level of care that a
reasonable person would have in the same situation.

This level of recklessness is what we call "criminal negligence." This
is a key element in involuntary manslaughter cases. It means the actions
fell far below what a reasonable person would do in the same situation,
and this failure to act reasonably resulted in the death.

In some jurisdictions, there is a distinction made between **involuntary
manslaughter** and **criminally negligent homicide.** Involuntary
manslaughter generally requires a greater degree of recklessness than
criminally negligent homicide. So for example, if a person doesn't
properly secure a dangerous area, and someone enters that area and dies,
this would be an example of criminally negligent homicide.
