- Something with an extended magazine. More bullets are better in this
  case.\
- Something reasonably low-caliber. It\'s more accurate, and if you\'re
  hit in the head by a .22, you\'ll be just as dead as if you\'re hit in
  the head by a .50. Some may argue 9mm at this point, but I want the
  accuracy over the stopping power. Personal preference, I guess.\
- Something I can fairly accurately hip-fire. I need to kill the main
  shooter quickly, so that will be a hip shot. Then I can move to cover
  and take out the rest.\

So I might take a Ruger with an extended mag. And a whole bunch of extra
mags too.
