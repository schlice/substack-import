If you are in a condo or if you are in a neighborhood with a Homeowner's
Association (HOA), you may have recourse with them. Most Governing
Documents have rules about nuisances.

In most cases, HOAs do not address conflicts between neighbors, but in
this case, it does. Where the HOA can address nuisances, it does,
especially when nuisances are particularly bothersome and long-lasting.
For example, your neighbor practices with his band three nights a week,
and they...er...need more practice. Or your neighbor is cooking kidney
stew (IYKYK) every week. If your HOA has nuisance rules, it usually
applies to both nuisance noise, nuisance smells, and nuisance activity.

Clearly, you should try to address the issue directly with your neighbor
first. But if your neighbor is unwilling or unable to address the issue,
perhaps your HOA or your Condo Association can help. It's worth digging
into your Governing Documents to see if you have a rule addressing
nuisances.
