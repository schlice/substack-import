Could they? Of course they could. The mechanism for doing so is in place
and is not expected to change.\
\
Will they? Not any time soon. Remember, you need a supermajority in
Congress (that\'s a 2/3 majority, not a simple majority which is just
\"more than half\"). Once they do, it becomes a Constitutional Amendment
once 3/4ths of the states ratify it. So that means you need ratification
in 34 of the states for the Amendment to be added to the Constitution.\
\
It\'s a difficult, but not impossible process. It\'s happened 17 times
in the history of the United States (the first 10 were ratified
together), making 27 Constitutional Amendments. The last Amendment was
added in 1992; the one previous in 1971. So it\'s absolutely possible to
amend the Constitution.\
\
So will the US ever repeal the Second Amendment? When popular support
for doing so actually exists, there will be an amendment that repeals
the Second Amendment. Until popular support exists for it, however, it
will never be repealed.]{.rendered_qtext}
