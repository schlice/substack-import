**Can you get a concealed carry permit after you stop working in the
marijuana industry in Colorado?**

The answer, as with all legal answers, is "it depends."

The marijuana industry is controlled at the state and local level, while
concealed carry permits are issued by a county sheriff in Colorado.

In most cases, persons working in the marijuana industry are not barred
from concealed carry. However, some county concealed carry applications
ask if you "unlawfully use or are addicted to a controlled substance
that\'s illegal at the federal level." If you answer honestly and say
that you also use as well as being employed in the industry, it is
possible that a sheriff *may* deny your application, since marijuana is
still illegal at the federal level.

So depending on how you answer the application questionnaire, you *may*
be denied a permit if you use marijuana along with working in the
industry. But of course, this is always at the discretion of the county
sheriff in the county in which you are applying.
