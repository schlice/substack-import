**Can I use his phones IMEI number to see if he is where is says he is?
That way I am not crossing a line. I don\'t want him to know I am
checking on him. I just need the truth and I\'m not sure he will tell
me.**

Unless you are a law enforcement agency with a warrant, no. You cannot
get cell data from the cellular provider unless you have a warrant.

By checking on his location without his permission, you are already
trying to cross a line. No amount of equivocating will make this
anything other than crossing a line. Sorry to disappoint you, but it is.

But the bigger issue, of course, is that if you feel like you need to
check up on him, and you don't feel like you can talk to him about it,
what you are really facing is a trust issue.

But who has the trust issue? Him or you?

The only thing you can do in this case is ask him. Give him the
opportunity to do the right thing and tell you the truth. At least
you've put the ball in his court and given him a chance.

If you don't ask him, or you don't want to give him the opportunity to
lie (however you choose to see it), you should really think about
breaking up. It's not fair to either of you. Without trust, your
relationship is not long for this world.
