Once you understand the basis of the pro-life movement, you should be
able to easily answer this question yourself. The very existence of this
question means that people still refuse to accept the true basis of the
pro-life movement.

**Pro-life people value** ***all life equally,*** **regardless of its
stage of development.**

That's it. When you boil it all down, that's what we believe.

So let's look at your parasitic twin example. Parasitic twins are
conjoined twins, but one twin develops mostly normally, while the other
twin does not. The incompletely formed twin is usually dependent on the
other, mostly fully formed twin.

**However, none of this changes the value of either life.**

If separating the twins will kill one of them, then separation surgery
is not justified. If they would live longer staying conjoined, then
separation surgery is not justified.

If, however, separation surgery will not kill them, but will leave them
both permanently disabled, then separation surgery **is** morally
justified, because neither twin will be killed by the surgery. They
would each have to accept the results of being separated and the health
problems that the separation will cause.

This is completely in line with the pro-life movement, which values all
life equally. No one should have the right to say that one twin should
live and another should die, regardless of their status of formation or
the dependence of one on the other. All life is valuable and deserves
equal protection. Both twins have value because they are both human and
they are both alive. We believe that all living humans possess an equal
right to life, and to not have that life taken from them without due
process.
