**Can you still drive with multiple sclerosis?**

If you're asking whether or not someone with MS is allowed to drive
cars, the answer is yes. There is no law that revokes a driver's license
once you are diagnosed with MS.

If you're asking whether or not an MS patient can drive a car *safely*,
that's between that patient and his or her doctor. If their impairment
because of MS so impacts their reflexes, eyesight, or gross motor
functions that they can no longer operate a car or do so safely, they
should probably consider not driving. I would hope that a neurologist
would have that kind of discussion with his or her patient.
