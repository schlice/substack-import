**Democrats, if Julie Swetnick\'s accusations are true, do you think she
should be charged with aiding and abetting 10+ cases of gang rape for
failure to report them years ago?**

I'm not a Democrat, but I'm going to answer anyway, because your
assumptions are slightly off.

*(EDIT) Maryland has no laws which require reporting of a rape.*

But I see where you're going. Since none of this has anything to do with
the criminal justice system, and it's all about credibility, we have as
much right to look at Julie Swetnick and determine if she is credible,
just as we are looking at Judge Kavanaugh and Dr. Ford to see just how
credible their stories are.

So let's do that, shall we? Let's have a quick look at Julie Swetnick's
story and see just how credible it is.

1.  She claims to have attended "more than ten" drug-and-rape parties.
    Is this rational? Is this credible? Would any rational human being
    go to *one* drug-and-rape party and then decide, of their own
    volition, to go back to a *second*, let alone ***ten***?
2.  She says she believes that women were raped at that party. How does
    she know? Did she talk to these women? Or is she just assuming that
    the sex was not consensual?
3.  She says she saw boys lined up to enter a room to "train" a girl.
    Again, is she certain that this is what was going on? Was she sure
    that this wasn't just the line for the bathroom?\
    \
    And of course, the elephant in the room:
4.  If she was aware that in over ten occurrences of these parties that
    sexual assaults were taking place, **why didn't she tell anyone? Why
    didn't she make an anonymous call to the police? Anything?** Again,
    is this rational human behavior?

There are only three possibilities for what happened at these alleged
parties that Ms. Swetnick claims to have attended:

- It is all a lie. It is nothing but a complete fabrication.
- The parties did happen, and sex was happening at these parties, but it
  wasn't rape. The people who attended these parties were all looking to
  have sex, and the sex was all consensual.
- Judge Kavanaugh and all of his friends are closet serial gang-rapists,
  and Ms. Swetnick knew this fact, but kept coming back to the parties
  anyway, with her fingers crossed that she wasn't going to be next.

The first two options are actually believable. People do lie. People do
have sex. People do lie about having sex. These things do happen. and it
is consistent with human nature. The third option is less believable,
because it is inconsistent with human nature. Yet she is claiming that
the third option is the truth, which makes her claim less believable
because it is inconsistent with human nature.

Finally, as you mentioned, she claims to have attended these parties in
the 80s, when she herself graduated in 1980. Therefore, if this is true,
she was an adult, attending parties where underage sexual assaults were
taking place, and she failed to report it, after seeing it happen
multiple times. This changes the short list a little bit:

- She's lying about the whole thing
- She was a willing participant

So if her story is to be believed at all, and if the parties did take
place, it appears most likely that there was no rape, and that all of
the sex was consensual, and that women repeatedly attended these parties
for the express purpose of having sex.
