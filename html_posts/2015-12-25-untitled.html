We had some frequent flyers I met in medium security in Cañon City, CO,
who knew the exact crime they would commit at the right time so that
they would stay in medium security for the rest of their natural days. A
\"retirement plan\" of sorts. I do wonder how it worked out for them. I
could see a dozen or so ways that could go sideways in a hurry. Then
they end up in Supermax in Florence instead of Med Sec in Cañon.
