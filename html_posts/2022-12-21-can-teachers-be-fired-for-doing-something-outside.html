Yes. Not only teachers, but anyone can be fired for doing something
perfectly legal ***but that reflects poorly on your employer.***

For example, if you're a military member, it's perfectly legal for you
to attend a political rally. **But if you do it in uniform**, you'll be
"fired."

If you're a teacher and you go to a strip club (perfectly legal), and
your picture at the strip club gets posted to social media, and your
students and their parents see it, the mere presence of that photo could
reflect poorly on you as a teacher, and the school might think twice
about retaining you as a teacher.

This can happen to anyone. Including me. I work for Dell Technologies
(#IWork4Dell). I'm perfectly legally permitted to post here on Quora.
But could one of my customers see something that I post that might not
fall in line with the values the company seeks to display to the world?
Of course. I have to be on guard for that all the time, and it's not
enough that my profile says that any posts I make which are work-related
will have the hashtag above as part of it. Even if I make it clear that
the post is my own personal opinion, a customer could be offended by
what I say, and if they bring it to the attention of Dell leadership, I
could face consequences for my writings. That's why anyone who wishes to
post on social media attends a "Social Media and Community" (SMaC)
Certification course and registers their certification with Dell. It is
then that we can post on social media using the #IWork4Dell hashtag.
It's not that there is never a possibility that I could be misunderstood
and that my posts could be offensive to someone. It's that I do my
utmost to protect Dell's brand when I post about the company. And
anything I do post with the hashtag must comply with Dell's social media
policy, or I could face consequences, up to and including termination.
