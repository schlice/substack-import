**Content:** [To be fair, it\'s hard to imagine a police car hitting the
person he is pulling over. Police are on heightened alert while stopping
a car, and their reaction time is much better than normal, as they are
expecting the car in front to stop. If the car in front stops a little
faster, they can likely accommodate that.]{.rendered_qtext}
