Certainly. Sounds like he may have found a great friend.

**If he is truly happy in his marriage, he will not find his friendship
brings his heart more joy than his marriage.**

And if he knowingly and willingly places himself in such a position, not
only is it disrespectful to his wife, and to the vows he has made, but
it is unfair to her for dividing his attention and his efforts between
women when only one of them rightly deserves that level of attention.

Remember, a marriage is based on love, and love in this context is not a
feeling. It is a *doing. Love* is a verb. You work on your marriage with
deliberate action that you do not take with a friendship. *That* is
love.

With that in mind, if you find yourself in a position where a friendship
makes you happier than your marriage, you may be placing too much
emphasis on the *feeling* of love rather than the *doing* of love.
