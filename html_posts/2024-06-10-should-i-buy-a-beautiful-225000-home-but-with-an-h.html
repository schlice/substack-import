The answer is it's entirely up to you.

Depending on how intrusive your HOA is, they may micromanage the outside
of your house, and you may not like that. You may need permission to
change the plants out in the planting bed in the front of your house. If
you fail to cut your lawn, you may get a violation notice. You would
definitely need permission to make changes to the color of your house or
the structure of it, or if you want to extend your driveway or make any
other exterior modifications to your home outside of what the builder
did.

If this seems all too intrusive for you, than a house in a community
controlled by an HOA may be something you are not interested in.

But if you can put up with getting approval before you start a project,
then it should be fine.

Upsides of an HOA:

- Countless market analyses have shown that homes in a HOA retain their
  value and sell for top dollar
- HOA communities are cleaner and neater because the HOA ensures that it
  stays that way
- Common amenities exist and are maintained (i.e. neighborhood
  clubhouse, playgrounds, swimming pools, planting beds, etc).
- Basic liability insurance is paid for on those areas.
- "Problem" neighbors are dealt with, and the HOA is useful in those
  situations where you can't really call the police but without the HOA,
  you can't really do much else.

Downsides of an HOA

- You must get permission before you make changes to the outside of your
  home. The HOA will be looking to see if the changes meet aesthetic
  guidelines and are not prohibited by the rules. You literally can't do
  anything you want at any time you want to the outside of your home
  without permission.
- You may not be able to rent your home without permission
- You have to pay dues to fund the common amenities and insurance
- While rare, there is the possibility that some "crazy Nazi Karen" gets
  on the board and makes life miserable for some people who aren't fans
  of following rules.

So it's really up to you to decide if your chosen house in your chosen
neighborhood with the listed amenities is really worth the level of
inconvenience imposed by the HOA.
