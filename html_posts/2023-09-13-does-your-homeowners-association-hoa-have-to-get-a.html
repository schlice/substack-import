In general, answers to HOA questions are going to be "check your CC&Rs"
and in this case, it's no different. Check your CC&Rs to find the exact
correct answer for your HOA.

***In general***, in most HOAs, the Board of Directors does not need
additional approval to raise dues, implement fees, or impose special
assessments, with some exceptions. Some construction projects may need
homeowner approval before they are started, but some repair-related
assessments do not need prior approval.

The Board is normally specifically empowered to maintain the budget and
collect money as needed.

But again, as always, check your own CC&Rs to get the specific rules for
your HOA.
