The answer depends on whether or not the event was man-made or natural,
and whether or not you mean \"all at once\" or \"over a period of
quantifiable time.\" I\'m assuming you meant over a period of time.

**Man-Made:** The largest known man-made loss of human life ever was the
European colonization of the Americas from 1492 to 1691. This 200 year
period saw the loss of an estimated 8.4 to 138 million people. The death
toll varies widely because the actual number of Native Americans
pre-Columbus is not known, and will likely never be known.

**Natural:** The floods in China in 1931 claimed an estimated 1 to 4
million lives.
