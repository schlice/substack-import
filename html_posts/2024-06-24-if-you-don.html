So there's a statement and a question here. Let's take them one at a
time.

> **If you don't sin then Jesus died for nothing.**

Jesus made it quite clear that no one "can't sin."

> "You have heard that it was said to those of old, 'You shall not
> murder; and whoever murders will be liable to judgment.' But I say to
> you that everyone who is angry with his brother will be liable to
> judgment; whoever insults his brother will be liable to the council;
> and whoever says, 'You fool!' will be liable to the hell of fire. So
> if you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember that
> your brother has something against you, leave your gift there before
> the altar and go. First be reconciled to your brother, and then come
> and offer your gift. Come to terms quickly with your accuser while you

> "You have heard that it was said, 'You shall not commit adultery.' But

I mean, whoa, this is pretty heavy, no? Jesus just said that if I'm
angry with my brother I'm going to hell? Jesus says that if I look at
another woman with lustful intent I'm an adulterer? Are you serious? I
can't control my own mind! My brain goes where it wants to go! I can't
stop that! And yeah, I've been angry with my brother for the last 15
years, so I'm automatically going to hell?

Jesus' point here was that without Him, it's impossible to please God.
We will *never* be good enough on our own. We can never wash enough to
be clean enough to meet God's standards. Without Him, we have nothing.

TL;DR: We can never not sin. Jesus' death, therefore, was salvific for
everyone, for all time.

> **What will you do to make Jesus proud today?**

Honor that gift. Respect that gift. Thank Jesus every day for giving you
that gift. And pattern your life as someone who has been given such a
gift.
