<h2>Answer Comment</h2>

**Content:** [You said \"leaders.\" The question asked specifically
about short people being successful, not being successful *leaders*.\
\
Modern leadership is a popularity contest. People who are taller do have
a slight advantage, as a leader is often conflated with *stature*, and
taller people are generally viewed as having a greater stature. You want
your leader to be a towering, imposing figure. So in government, there
is an advantage for the taller person.\
\
That doesn\'t mean that short people can\'t be leaders. The lack of
height can be made up for in charisma or charm. But height
helps.]{.rendered_qtext}
