The people who make television shows are morons.

But the contention that no respectable thief would ever steal a running
car is simply incorrect. We in Colorado have a tremendous problem with
\"puffing,\" where someone goes out to start their car on a cold morning
and leaves it running in their own driveway. It\'s called \"puffing\"
because when the car is warming up on a cold morning, the exhaust from
the car billows big clouds of \"puffy\" moisture, sort of a big sign for
thieves that says, \"Hey, here\'s a car warming up with (potentially) no
one in it, come steal me!\" We get roughly one theft a week of cars that
were puffing. And it\'s a double-whammy for the owner, because not only
was your car stolen, but insurance doesn\'t cover you when you do
something illegal (leaving a car running with no occupant is illegal in
Colorado).

We don\'t have any puffing stings yet in our jurisdiction, but it\'s
coming.
