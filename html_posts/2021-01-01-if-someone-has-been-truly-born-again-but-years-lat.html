**If someone has been truly born again but years later succumbs to an
addictive sin on such a consistent basis that they have lost their close
connection with God, do you think it possible that the Lord would
withdraw his salvation from them?**

First, let's start with some clarification. Can God withdraw his
salvation? For any question which begins with "Can God..." the answer is
always yes, God can. There is literally nothing that God cannot do.

The question, therefore, is *would God withdraw his salvation from
anyone?* And the answer to that question is **No, God would not withdraw
his salvation from anyone. Ever.**

The reason: **salvation is a "one and done" thing, but sanctification is
a lifelong process which we will never complete until we meet him face
to face.**

If a person is truly saved, he has given over his life to God. Jesus
paid for *all* sin on the cross; past, present, and future. All sin is
forgiven, not just sin before you were saved.

Once you are saved, God begins working in your life to make you more
like Jesus. It is not an instantaneous process, as we are indeed human.
It is a lifelong process, a process we call *sanctification.* God works
in me every day to make me more like Jesus.

I struggle every day, as I am indeed human. *But God expects progress,
not perfection.*

\

Now, here's the thing about addiction. Addiction is a powerful
dysfunction of the brain which causes a person to succumb to the
addiction *over their free will*. In other words, the addiction is so
powerful in the brain that it overrides our will to stop it.

Yes, addictions result initially from a bad choice, a choice that we
were free to make. We made a bad one.

As humans, we continually struggle to follow God and to do what is
right. We are imperfect in this pursuit. But we need to bring our
failings and our concerns to him, not run away from him in shame.

> *For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our
> weaknesses, but we have one who has been tempted in every way, just as
> we are -- yet was without sin. Let us then approach the throne of
> grace with confidence, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to
> help us in our time of need. --- Hebrews 4:15--16 NIV*

**Addiction doesn't change any of this.** If anything, it becomes even
more of a shameful struggle, as we are powerless to resist the
addiction. It is a very destructive cycle, especially for someone who
has been saved.

But there is help, and there is hope. Get help for the addiction, and
the rest will follow.

But always know this: God will never abandon you. God will never forsake
you. Only we can turn away from him; he will never turn away from us.
