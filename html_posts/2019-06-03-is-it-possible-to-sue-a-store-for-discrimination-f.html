**Is it possible to sue a store for discrimination for not letting me
shop there (with no explained reason)?**

You certainly can. It's unlikely you will prevail.

Why?

The store will come up with an excuse.

It will likely be something like you looked like a prohibited person. A
simple case of mistaken identity, that's all. A harmless accident.

Additionally, you can only sue for discrimination if the discriminating
reason is

1.  Something not prohibited by law (i.e. discrimination due to race,
    color, religion, sex, or national origin)
2.  Something not universally restricted (i.e. "no shoes, no shirt, no
    service" is legal discrimination against the shirtless and the
    shoeless).
