title: "Do anti-deportation, anti-ICE Trump haters believe that their protests are neither violent nor illegal, or that their protests are violent and illegal, but justifiably so, because their cause is righteous and they occupy the moral high ground?"

Most people who attend these protests are, in fact, non-violent. But
their protests are being ***hijacked***. There are **two** different
groups hijacking these peaceful protests.

The first group of hijackers is ***violent agitators*** who are
well-funded by far-left progressive wealthy groups. These people
communicate on decentralized encrypted communications apps like Signal
and Telegram. They coordinate their efforts. They know how to create
gaps in police lines. They know the most effective strategies for
causing mass mayhem. They slip in, they change clothes, they keep in
contact, they cause their mayhem, and they slip out, leaving the
non-violent protesters to take the rap for their violent conduct.

There is also another group of agitators: ***paid protesters***. Yes,
there are people who are being paid by the Democrats (over 70 different
Democrat-aligned groups have been identified so far) to *travel* to
these protests to make it seem like they are organic, grassroots efforts
when they are not that at all. Those protesters are paid to be there.
They were paid to travel to these cities and participate in these
protests. In some cities, it was estimated that over half of the
protesters were paid protesters who were brought in to protest.

So the truth is that many anti-deportation, anti-ICE Trump haters are
nonviolent. They do not intend violence. They merely intend to make
their presence known and to peacefully protest. But their efforts are
being intentionally hijacked by those who want to sow chaos and turmoil,
and by those who are paid protesters trying to bolster something which
initially started as a grassroots effort and became a full-fledged
Democrat lobbying platform.
