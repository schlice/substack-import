**Should police body cam footage be considered a matter of public
record?**

It already is, with caveats. As with any information collected by a
government agency, body camera footage can be retrieved under the
Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). Note that all departments have
different retention requirements based on the laws in that locality and
the regulations in the department. If you want to get body camera
footage, it's best to make your request as soon as you can, otherwise
you risk the footage being deleted.

For non-evidentiary camera footage, you can submit a FOIA request to the
department to retrieve the footage from a specific officer during a
specific interaction on a specific day. Evidentiary footage is sealed
until the trial is over and the District Attorney's office releases that
evidence back into storage, at which time a FOIA request should be
sufficient to release it.

It is not "public record" in the sense that all footage should be posted
to a public website all the time, nor should it be. There is plenty of
sensitive information that would be captured on body cameras which even
you would probably not want circulating on the Internet. That said, a
record of who retrieves what information should be kept, and submitting
a FOIA request to the department is sufficient for that purpose. In
other words, you can take it, but if it ends up on YouTube, we want to
know who it was who started that ball rolling.
