Pregnancy tests test for the presence of pregnancy hormones in the blood
or urine. It may take some time before those pregnancy hormones return
to pre-pregnancy levels in the blood after the fetus has been removed.
So it is still possible that you can still pop positive on a pregnancy
test soon after an abortion.

In fact, It can take anywhere **from 16 days up to 2 months** for hCG
levels in the body to fall below the levels detected by a pregnancy
test.
