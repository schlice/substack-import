**Would it be legal/constitutional to pass a law forcing people to use
all bio-fuel in the US?**

Yes, it would be both legal and constitutional outlawing traditional
gasoline and mandating bio fuel instead.

But it wouldn't go over too well.

All cars not able to burn 100% biofuel would be rendered immediately
useless. The vast majority of auto makers have not approved their
vehicles to run on 100% ethanol, the primary biofuel for use in
automobiles, let alone the 85% ethanol we currently have in the market
(you've probably seen it in the yellow pumps as E85). In fact, most
vehicles today are using some blend of ethanol in their gas (E15 is
relatively common, but virtually no auto maker has approved E100 for
their vehicles). It would take years of redesigns to allow cars to burn
100% ethanol.

Second, we don't have enough ethanol available to create enough biofuel
to completely replace gasoline and diesel. In parts of the world,
deforestation is taking place so manufacturers have enough arable land
to grow the crops needed to turn into biofuel. And we would have to
substantially increase the amount of crops we grow specifically for
biofuel to meet the new demand, causing increased deforestation as we
clear area to grow those crops, making the problem worse instead of
better.

Also, some biofuels made out of waste cooking oil can freeze in cold
weather, meaning not all biofuels are viable gas alternatives in all
areas.
