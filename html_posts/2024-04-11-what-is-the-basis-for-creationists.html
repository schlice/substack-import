Creationists believe in Adam and Eve because their stories are in the
Bible, and Jesus has said on more than one occasion that the Bible is
the word of God. Creationists don't really need more authority than God
to believe what they do.

However, scientific studies show us that there is the distinct
possibility that the Biblical stories are true:

> In 1987, a group of genet足icists published a surprising study in the
> journal *Nature*.足 The足 researchers examined the mitochondrial DNA
> (mtDNA) taken from 147 people across all of today\'s major racial
> groups. These researchers found that all modern humans descended from
> one of two branches in humanity\'s family tree. One of these branches
> consists of nothing but African lineage; the other contains all other
> groups, including some African lineage.

And not to be left out,

> In human genetics, the Y-chromosomal most recent common ancestor
> (Y-MRCA, informally known as Y-chromosomal Adam) is the patrilineal
> most recent common ancestor (MRCA) from whom all currently living
> humans are descended. He is the most recent male from whom all living
> humans are descended through an unbroken line of their male ancestors.
> The term Y-MRCA reflects the fact that the Y chromosomes of all
> currently living human males are directly derived from the Y
> chromosome of this remote ancestor. [\[2\]](#moAcT){#cite-moAcT
