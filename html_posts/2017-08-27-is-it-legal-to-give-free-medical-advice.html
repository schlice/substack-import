Doctors Without Borders gives free medical **treatment** all over the
world. Certainly not illegal for them to do so.

As a non-doctor, you may give your *opinion* about medical matters. For
example, I can tell you that I believe that soy is bad for you, and that
I believe that sugar will kill you. That's free medical advice.

But I'm not a doctor, and I'm not pretending to be. I'm only giving you
my opinion.

Medical advice is a diagnosis based on a medical evaluation, and a
treatment for that diagnosis. Only a medical doctor can give a diagnosis
and prescribe treatments.

I can only give you my opinion and recommend you go see a doctor.
