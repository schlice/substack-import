**What will the (legal) impact on Trump be, should it be found that his
Stormy Daniels payments are in contravention of campaign financing laws
and that the payments were made under his direction? Other than
impeachment, what is the penalty?**

*If* they find that the payments violated campaign finance law, the
campaign gets fined.

However, campaign finance law is tricky. *Even if* he did make the
payment to her, the courts would have to determine whether or not there
was any non-political reason for him to make that payment. In other
words, would he have made the payment if he was not a candidate?

Trump's history of paying off the women with whom he's had affairs
should speak volumes about the fact that he most definitely would have
made the payment even if he was not a candidate.

Trump can even go so far as to claim that he had *both* reasons in mind:
personal and political. Trump does not have to deny that politics played
some part in the decision to pay. Clearly, if he had not paid, the press
would have been all over it, and it would have compounded the personal
and business issues that the revelation would have brought. So having
both interests in mind when he made the payment is enough to make the
payment not a campaign finance violation.

As far as I know, campaign finance laws are not criminal charges; no one
gets arrested for violating them. Obama's campaign was found to have
violated campaign finance laws and they were fined.

In and of itself, violating a campaign finance law doesn't rise to the
level of "high crimes and misdemeanors," but we know that this is all up
to Congress. If the Democrats win the House back in November, violating
campaign finance laws *will* rise to that level, and they will impeach
him for it. The Senate will not vote to remove him from office, and life
will go on. The only thing that this will do will be to weaken the power
of the impeachment, making it little more than a glorified censure. It's
odd: Democrats know that impeachment would be a Pyrrhic victory, yet
they doggedly pursue it anyway.

Oh, and I hate to mention the elephant in the room: *none of this has
anything whatsoever to do with Russian collusion, which is what Mueller
was supposedly investigating in the first place.*

We can only hope that impeachment and non-removal will be the end of
this circus, but I suspect that even that won't end the controversy.
