Correlation does not equal causation.

Jesus did not suddenly gain the power to do miraculous works at the
moment he was baptized by John the Baptist in the Jordan River. Jesus
was still fully God. But he didn't begin his ministry until after that
event.

Once he began his ministry, he started performing miracles. The Bible
has no record of Jesus performing miracles before his ministry began.

There are some Gnostic legends of Jesus performing miracles as a child,
but these have been roundly rejected by both the Protestant and Catholic
churches. These legends were written long after Jesus' and the apostles'
deaths (around 300 AD).

Original question:

Jesus only started doing miraculous works and deeds after he got the
Holy Spirit. Couldn\'t he do those without the Holy Spirit? Does that
mean believers can also do those awesome things?
