So this means that for a first time offender, depending on the
aggravating factors in the case, they will probably face the low end of
the spectrum, but that\'s still a minimum of one year and a minimum fine
of \$1000.

Because stalking is also an extraordinary risk crime, he may face less
leniency and harsher penalties. Make sure you have a good defense
attorney.
