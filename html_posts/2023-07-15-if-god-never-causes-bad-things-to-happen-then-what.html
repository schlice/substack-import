So to you, punishing bad behavior is "causing bad things to happen?"

I think the "bad thing that happened" was Adam and Eve disobeying God.
God expelling them from the Garden of Eden, to live and die in the new
sin-filled world they brought about, is a natural consequence of what
they brought on themselves through their own actions.

God simply cannot abide sin, so when Adam and Eve sinned, God expelled
them from the Garden. This is an EFFECT, not a CAUSE.

God didn't cause that to happen. It's the effect of their bad actions.
