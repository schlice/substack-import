This seems to be something that trips people up all the time.

Yes, atheists have morals. Virtually everyone has morals. Our morals are
usually developed during our formative years.

The difference is ***the source of our morals***.

Most people would agree that thieves, murderers, and other criminals are
lacking morals. But that's not necessarily true. They certainly have a
set of morals, but it is not based on **generally accepted customs of
right living in a society.** Usually, it is based on a "natural
selection" model: I can do whatever I find acceptable in order to
survive, put food in my belly or money in my pocket.

Atheists would say that their morals are those standards of right and
wrong based on **generally accepted customs of right living in a
society.**

Theists would say that their morals are those standards of right and
wrong based on **God's rules for our conduct as delivered in the
Bible.**

The difference is that the atheist's morals are derived from the whole
of society (which may include theists and their moral code) but the
theist derives his morals from God.

In essence, therefore, *the atheist must borrow from the theist in order
to have a moral code. Because out of the whole of society, only theists
have a moral code which transcends the whims of humanity.* Only theists
have a rock-solid, immovable, unchanging external standard of morality
upon which they can have a firm foundation for their morals. It's like
building your house on solid rock.

**Without that base, humanity is self-referential**, and that's no
better than building your house on sand.

The flow works this way:

- The theist's moral code is in line with God's rules for us. The theist
  alters his or her moral code to fit God's commands for us.
- Society's accepted customs of right living are (mostly) in line with
  the theist's morals, at least for the big things. This is evidenced by
  the fact that you see theists able to live peacefully in society
  (currently) without claiming that societal norms are so far outside of
  their moral code that they cannot live as members of society.ยน
- The atheist *adopts* society's accepted customs of right living as
  their morals.

So clearly, atheists, just like theists, can indeed have a moral code,
and they can live a right life by it. The only difference between the
two is the ability to ground their morals in some immovable, unchanging
standard. They willfully discount the source of their morals because
they do not believe in its existence, yet they claim that society's
morals are unchanging (which is clearly untrue).

\

ยน This is not to say that all of society's "generally accepted customs
of right living" are in line with theist's morals. In general, the
things which theists find immoral are not things that theists are
required to do to live peacefully in ordered society.

Also. the truth is that *society adopted theist's morals*, but we don't
really need to get into that right now
