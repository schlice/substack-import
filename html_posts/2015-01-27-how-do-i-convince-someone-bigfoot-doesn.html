**Content:** [In logic, you can\'t prove a negative assertion.\
\
You can prove a positive assertion by showing one example from one point
in time that proves it. In order to prove the negative assertion
(Bigfoot does not exist), you would have to be in all places in all
times and prove that no Bigfoot ever existed. Since this is impossible,
you cannot ever prove a negative assertion.]{.rendered_qtext}
