**Content:** [Please remember that police officers are just doing their
jobs as well. They want the stop to go smoothly. Most times, they want
to find a good way to start the conversation, and generally it\'s going
to surround why you\'re having the conversation in the first place.\
\
Perhaps you don\'t know what you did. Perhaps you didn\'t know you were
speeding. If you honestly don\'t know, you can say, \"Honestly, I don\'t
know why you stopped me.\"\
\
Remember that your best bet is to be honest and polite. The VAST
majority of police officers are good, hard-working people that are
trying to keep the public safe.]{.rendered_qtext}
