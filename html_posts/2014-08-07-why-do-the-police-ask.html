<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Please remember that police officers are just doing their<br>jobs as well. They want the stop to go smoothly. Most times, they want<br>to find a good way to start the conversation, and generally it\'s going<br>to surround why you\'re having the conversation in the first place.\<br>\<br>Perhaps you don\'t know what you did. Perhaps you didn\'t know you were<br>speeding. If you honestly don\'t know, you can say, \"Honestly, I don\'t<br>know why you stopped me.\"\<br>\<br>Remember that your best bet is to be honest and polite. The VAST<br>majority of police officers are good, hard-working people that are<br>trying to keep the public safe.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
