There wasn't "a man" who wrote the Bible, as the Bible isn't just one
book.

It's 66 books, written by about 30 different authors, over the span of
approximately 1500 years. On three different continents.

And yet, with all of that diversity, there is *unity* in the message of
the Bible. There are no contradictions between the books, and the books
are scientifically and historically accurate.

There is no way that humans alone could have possibly done that.
