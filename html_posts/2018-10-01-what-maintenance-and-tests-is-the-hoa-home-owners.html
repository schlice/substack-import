**What maintenance and tests is the HOA (Home owners Association)
required to do for retention ponds?**

If the HOA owns the retention pond, then it is up to the HOA to do the
maintenance of the pond. The relevant laws are managed by the state, but
the EPA [[has set
guidelines](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=eae8eb&url=https://www3.epa.gov/npdes/pubs/pondmgmtguide.pdf){.external_link

]{.qlink_container}for organizations to follow when inspecting and
maintaining retention ponds. It doesn't matter if it's a HOA or a
business which owns the retention pond, whoever is the owner of the land
is required to do the maintenance of the pond.

States can establish stricter regulations than these, but most states
simply follow the EPA guidelines.
