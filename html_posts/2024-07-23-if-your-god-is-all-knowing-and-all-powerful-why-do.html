God's mind is infinite, and God does not dwell in spacetime, like we do.
In order for God to "change His mind," He would have to exist in one
state of mind "before" He changed His mind (which already, He can't do),
and then He would have to learn of something He didn't know before
(which He also can't do because He knows all) and then He would have to
use that "new information" to do something differently.

So God doesn't "change His mind." But God does take our free choices
into consideration when He made plans for how everything would unfold
for all eternity.

This is challenging concept to wrap our brains around, because we are
constrained by life inside of spacetime. But let's try a few scenarios
to see if we can understand it somewhat (if not completely):

Let's say that Dave's wife has cancer. **Dave prays fervently for his
wife to be healed** of the cancer, and Dave gets his whole church to do
the same. Dave knows that God may not choose to heal his wife, but he
demonstrates his faith in God and recognizes God's power to heal his
wife. He requests that God would heal his wife and extend her life if
God is willing to do so. **Let's say that God chooses to heal Dave's
wife in response to the prayer** of Dave and the others in his church.

Now, **on the one hand,** God eternally knew that He was going to allow
Dave's wife to have cancer and **He eternally knew that He would heal
Dave's wife**. **But, on the other hand,** we must not forget that **God
also eternally knew that Dave would freely choose to pray fervently for
the healing of his wife, and God eternally knew that He would respond to
that prayer**.

In this way, God allowed for Dave to make the free choice to pray
fervently for the healing of his wife, which He already knew would
happen, and knowing that it would happen, God already planned for all of
eternity to heal Dave's wife in response to that free-choice prayer. So
in a way, God already knew that Dave would pray to heal his wife, and so
He took those prayers into consideration when He determined what would
happen to this universe and everything in it from all of eternity.

Now, **let's say that God eternally knew that Dave would** ***not***
**pray for his wife to be healed**. If Dave and the others chose not to
pray for his wife because they believed that prayer would do no good
because God's plans are already fixed, then God would have eternally
known that, and He would have taken that into account in His plans for
how the world would unfold. In this case, God's eternal plan may, or may
not, have included healing Dave's wife at all. But, as it is, **God
eternally knew that Dave** ***would*** **pray for his wife, and so (from
eternity past) God took this into account in His plans**.

So, even though God eternally knows what He is going to do about
everything (unlike humans who decide things as we go), He also eternally
knows what we humans will freely choose to do at our moment of choice
(including our prayers), and He incorporates our free choices into His
eternal plans for us. However, like we already mentioned, our prayers do
not cause God to "change His mind." God's decision to answer Dave's
prayer was already made, and the course of action God took was also
already eternally chosen, based on Dave's decision (at the moment of
choice) to pray fervently for the healing of his wife.

So God's actions are known from all eternity, but our decisions are made
on the fly, and we don't know what we will choose at that moment. But
God, being omnipotent, sees all spacetime as "now." The past is now. The
present is now. The future is now. When God made His plans for how
everything would turn out, He already took into consideration what we
were going to freely choose, and He used those free choices to determine
how the universe would unfold, which He already knew for all eternity.
