Because it was already written down, thousands of years before He got
there.

Jesus, being a Jew, read from the Hebrew Bible. He actually came to
fulfill the prophesies which were already written.

After He died and was resurrected, others wrote about what He did.
Clearly, He wouldn't be writing about His own life. Others did that for
Him.

The *hypostatic union* describes the person of Jesus: *fully human, and
fully God*, at the same time. He isn't some sort of superhuman, and He
isn't some sort of demi-God. He is fully human and fully divine.

But His divinity did not influence His humanity, and His humanity did
not influence His divinity. There are examples throughout the Bible of
both His humanity and His divinity, and neither were limited or
influenced by the other.
