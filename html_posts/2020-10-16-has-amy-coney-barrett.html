Your link points out what Everytown believes are Judge Barrett's
"extreme and dangerous" beliefs about the 2nd Amendment:

- **Judge Barrett reiterating her belief that people convicted of
  felonies should not be barred from owning guns:** "What I did was
  apply Heller's methodology...and I concluded that based on that
  history one couldn't take the right away simply because one was a
  felon."

As always, the devil is in the details. Barrett believes (as most do)
that the commission of any crime categorized as a felony should not
necessarily result in the taking of a Constitutional right. Should you
lose a Constitutional right if you commit credit card fraud? That's a
felony. Similarly, there are plenty of non-violent white-collar crimes
for which removal of a Constitutional right seems improper, and not in
keeping with the 8th Amendment. In other words, the punishment should
fit the crime. In order to overcome the high bar to relieve someone of a
Constitutional right, the crime must be commensurate with that decision.
She believes (as most conservative Constitutionalists do) that removal
of a Constitutional right to firearms requires the conviction of a
**violent** felony. Respect for the Constitution requires respect for
all of its provisions, even the ones you don't like, Everytown.

- **Judge Barrett refusing to distance herself from her dangerous and
  extreme position in Kanter v. Barr:** "What I can say is that my
  opinion \[in\] Kanter shows my judicial philosophy. I spend a lot of
  time looking at the history of the Second Amendment and Supreme Court
  cases. The way in which I would approach the review of gun regulations
  is in the same way. To look very carefully at the text, to look at
  what the original meaning was. I promise I would come to that with an
  open mind, applying the law as I can best determine it."

In this answer, Judge Barrett is doing what she has done throughout
these hearings: reiterate that Congress sets policy and crafts
legislation, not the court. The court simply checks to see that laws do
or do not comport with the Constitution as it was written and understood
at the time. It's just sad that Democrats slam her because she won't set
policy. But they want the court to set policy because they can't get the
votes to pass their policy as they see fit.

And if Congress ever has a law overruled as unconstitutional, they are,
of course, free to re-write the law so that it is Constitutional. But
that would involve, you know, Congress *doing their job.*

These points show that Judge Barrett will apply the Constitution as it
was written, after a thorough review of the text, and a determination of
the text's original meaning.

So absolutely, this is exactly what I want in a Supreme Court Justice.
