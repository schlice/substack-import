**My boyfriend and I made out and I put his hand in my pants and he is
accusing me of forcing him to touch my vagina when I did not force him
at all. Is this sexual assault?**

Legally, in most states, the standard is "no means no," not "yes means
yes" as some college campuses have instituted (and some states are
trying to pass).

What does that mean? If someone does not consent to sexual activity,
they must affirmatively say no. So unless he said no, or made some other
overt motion to indicate no, it's not assault.

In order for him to non-verbally indicate no and qualify as assault, you
would have had to drag him, kicking and screaming, into your pants, and
it's unlikely that this happened.

Maybe he wasn't ready for that level of engagement. Maybe he thinks this
is all moving too fast. Any of this could be true.

But sexual assault, this is not.
