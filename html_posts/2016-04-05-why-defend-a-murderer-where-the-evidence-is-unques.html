Thanks [[Chuck
Lee](https://www.quora.com/profile/Chuck-Lee-43)]{.qlink_container} for
your answer, you\'re absolutely correct.

I would ask this: whose job is it to \"question\" the evidence?

The defense.

Let me put it this way. Evidence is never \"unquestioned.\" Evidence is
always reviewed. The defense is there to do exactly what I\'m
suggesting: **question everything.** It is the job of the defense team
to question every piece of evidence. Was it obtained legally? Was it
obtained with properly executed warrants? Were the officers and the
prosecutors objective in their analysis of the evidence? Were there
extenuating circumstances? Was there anything the prosecutors
overlooked?

A \"murderer\" is only truly a \"murderer\" after he is convicted. Until
then, he is an \"accused murderer.\" As much as people like to talk
about OJ as a murderer, he\'s not. He was accused of murder, and found
not guilty, regardless how questionable the circus of a trial was.

It is the job of the jury to determine whether or not the evidence shows
that the murderer is, in fact, guilty \"beyond a reasonable doubt.\" It
is the job of the defense team to bring to light that reasonable doubt.\
