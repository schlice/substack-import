It depends on the particular \"anti-gun effort\" in question.

If the goal is elimination of all guns out of the hands of private
citizens, then yes, that particular anti-gun effort is indeed futile
while the Second Amendment still stands.

If the goal is to reduce the amount of guns that law-abiding citizens
possess, or reduce the amount of law-abiding citizens who can possess
guns, these efforts are not futile. They have worked in the past. They
can be disguised in many different ways, primarily under the guise of
protecting people from certain types and classifications of other
people. For example, **felons**. Once you\'ve been convicted of a
felony, in most states, you never get your gun rights back (it depends
on the particular conviction, and the state in which it was received).
Felons are *adjudicated bad people*, right? So if we can\'t get rid of
guns, we\'ll make certain people ineligible to carry guns, and we\'ll
start with people we know are bad, because the court said so.

But then we move on to other people, like those who are **mentally
ill**. I mean, if they can\'t tell that purple aliens aren\'t coming
down to suck out their brains, how can they possibly wield a gun safely?
Sure, let\'s restrict them too.

But then, and at the risk of invoking the slippery slope argument, where
does it end? Just because the slippery slope argument is a logical
fallacy in general doesn\'t mean that it sometimes doesn\'t have roots
in truth. Case in point: in July of last year, the administration
started pushing for Social Security benefit recipients from owning
firearms if they "**lack the mental capacity to manage their own
affairs**.\" Specifically, they seek to target Social Security
recipients who are unable to manage their own affairs because of
\"marked subnormal intelligence, or mental illness, incompetency,
condition, or disease.\" Social Security has never classified people in
this way, but the VA has. They have reported people to NICS who have
been declared incompetent to handle pension or disability payments and
have been assigned a fiduciary.

How long are we going to let the government chip away at the rights of
the citizens to keep and bear arms? If they can\'t get wholesale repeal
of the Second Amendment, and they can\'t actually get rid of guns, they
will chip away at who can legally own guns, little bits at a time, until
virtually every category of citizen will be disallowed, in one way or
another, from legally owning a gun.
