It does seem necessary that any Palestinians who wish to remain in Gaza
following the IDF operations will have to agree to the right of Israel
to exist.

This is not without precedent. The Israelis offered this deal to them in
the 40s following the war for Israeli Independence, and then again in
the 60s following the Six Day War. Israel told them that if they accept
Israel's right to exist and they live in peace, they could become **full
citizens of Israel.** Each time, some Palestinians took them up on the
offer. Those Palestinians now live free in Israel. Which is amazing,
because Israel is the only true democracy in the Middle East. Think
about that. Those Arabs are living as free citizens in the only true
democracy in the Middle East.

Were you aware that Muslims live free in Israel? Were you aware that
Israel is almost 20% Muslim? Were you aware that for the last number of
years, the most popular baby boy name in Israel was Muhammad? Were you
aware that there are Muslims who serve alongside Jews in the IDF? It's
true.

But back to the Palestinians. For those who choose to not accept
Israel's right to exist, they will not "throw away their right to
exist." They only "throw away their right to exist *in Gaza*." If they
are Palestinian civilians and not Hamas terrorists, they will be "asked"
to leave. We know Egypt will not take them. We can probably guess that
none of the other Arab nations in the region will take them (in one of
the greatest tragedies of the conflict). But they will have to leave all
the same. It's kinda like closing time at the bar: "You don't have to go
home, but you can't stay here."
