**I want to go to a military academy. What steps do I take to assure my
acceptance?**

Your appointment (not acceptance) to a military academy is never
"assured." It is entirely up to the Academy in question to accept you or
not.

The appointment process isn't much different than the acceptance process
at other colleges, other than the criteria for acceptance is much
stricter. In simple terms, you submit a package, and the Academy decides
whether or not they will accept you.

Of course, in order to attend, you must also be *nominated* by either a
Member of Congress or by the Vice President or the President. But you
didn't ask about nominations, you asked about acceptance, so I'll leave
nominations for another answer.

So, since you can never be "assured" of appointment, how can you put
your best package together? Here's a few pointers for putting the best
package possible in front of the admissions board. Note that a lot of
these pointers are what the Air Force Academy admissions board looks at
(I tend to know a little more about their process than the other service
academies), but a strong portfolio at USAFA will be a strong portfolio
at any of the service academies:

**ACADEMICS:**

- Take challenging classes. Special consideration is given to students
  who excel at honors and AP classes, and who have completed the
  International Baccalaureate (IB) Diploma Programme (DP).
  Dual-enrollment courses (in both high school and a local college) are
  also favorably considered.
- Achieve a high class rank. Note that in the most recent USAFA
  admissions statistics, 8% of admitted candidates were ranked first in
  their high school class. 52% were in the top ten percent, and 81% were
  in the top 25% of their class.
- Score well on standardized tests. While there are ranges where most
  candidates fall, suffice it to say that candidates who score below 580
  verbal and 560 math on the SAT Reasoning or below 24 English/reading
  and 25 math/science reasoning on the ACT normally will not be
  competitive for an appointment to USAFA. While the ranges are
  different for the other service academies, this level of academic
  performance is expected of candidates.

**ATHLETICS:**

- Remember that about 95% of accepted candidates participated in high
  school sports, and about 80% earned varsity letters. This means that
  the strongest candidates participated in team sports, and probably
  lettered in that sport.
- The academies aren't looking for *how many* sports you participated
  in. Instead, the academies are looking for *long-term* participation
  in a sport, and *advancement* in that sport, as well as some
  leadership position on that team, if such exists for your sport. For
  example, someone who plays football in the fall, basketball over the
  winter, and tennis in the spring, but never excelled in any one sport
  will be less of a strong athletic candidate behind someone who ran
  cross-country in the fall every year, worked his way up to varsity,
  was a demonstrated team leader, and eventually received the MVP his
  senior year. I'm not projecting, but maybe good examples do come from
  experience.

**EXTRACURRICULAR ACTIVITIES:**

- Similar to athletics, the academies are looking for demonstrated
  leadership in a few activities, rather than the total number of
  activities in which you participated. Here's some ideas from Air Force
  Academy admissions:
  - **Church Organizations:** Participate in leadership of church youth
    group.
  - **Scouting:** Join and excel in a scouting organization.
  - **Public Speaking:** Give speeches to local service clubs (Rotary,
    Lions, Kiwanis, etc.).
  - **Music:** Take lessons and give musical recitals in church or as a
    volunteer.
  - **Community Service:** Work or perform community service through
    church or community organizations[\[1\]](#MKPwn){#cite-MKPwn

These are some general pointers for putting the best package forward.
Good luck!
