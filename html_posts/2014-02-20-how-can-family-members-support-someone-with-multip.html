<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [I can add my two cents\' worth as well.\<br>\<br>By this point in reading through these answers, you know what MS is, you<br>know what it does physiologically, and you know how it feels (for the<br>most part) to be a MS patient.\<br>\<br>So how do you support someone with MS? You support them in whatever way<br>they need to be supported. That means you have to work with them, find<br>out what they need, and almost as importantly, what they don\'t need. As<br>a patient, I need help remembering things, I don\'t need help walking. I<br>don\'t like to be babied. I don\'t like things being withheld from me;<br>I\'m not a child. I know life is hard, and it\'s harder for people with<br>chronic illnesses, and it\'s even harder for the family that has to live<br>with that person. There is no one formula for what everyone needs.\<br>\<br>So the correct answer to how you support someone with MS is by finding<br>out what they need and giving it to them.\<br>\<br>Here\'s an example. I know now that sleep is critical in giving your<br>body the best chance it can have to heal itself. Study after study have<br>shown that when people routinely get less than 8 hours of sleep, their<br>bodies do not operate at peak efficiency. So to give your body the best<br>possible working environment it can have, you must provide it with<br>sleep. I start my day early, so I have to go to bed early. However, my<br>wife likes to decompress by watching TV in bed before she goes to sleep.<br>We looked at the various outcomes for this scenario (I sleep in another<br>room, spouse uses headphones to watch TV, etc) and we decided together<br>that she\'d decompress downstairs on the couch before bed. She realized<br>that it\'s not so much the location as much as the undisturbed time that<br>she likes. So we compromised.\<br>\<br>That\'s the kind of support that a MS patient needs.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
