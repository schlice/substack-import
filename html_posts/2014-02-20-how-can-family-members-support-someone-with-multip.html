By this point in reading through these answers, you know what MS is, you
know what it does physiologically, and you know how it feels (for the
most part) to be a MS patient.\
\
So how do you support someone with MS? You support them in whatever way
they need to be supported. That means you have to work with them, find
out what they need, and almost as importantly, what they don\'t need. As
a patient, I need help remembering things, I don\'t need help walking. I
don\'t like to be babied. I don\'t like things being withheld from me;
I\'m not a child. I know life is hard, and it\'s harder for people with
chronic illnesses, and it\'s even harder for the family that has to live
with that person. There is no one formula for what everyone needs.\
\
So the correct answer to how you support someone with MS is by finding
out what they need and giving it to them.\
\
Here\'s an example. I know now that sleep is critical in giving your
body the best chance it can have to heal itself. Study after study have
shown that when people routinely get less than 8 hours of sleep, their
bodies do not operate at peak efficiency. So to give your body the best
possible working environment it can have, you must provide it with
sleep. I start my day early, so I have to go to bed early. However, my
wife likes to decompress by watching TV in bed before she goes to sleep.
We looked at the various outcomes for this scenario (I sleep in another
room, spouse uses headphones to watch TV, etc) and we decided together
that she\'d decompress downstairs on the couch before bed. She realized
that it\'s not so much the location as much as the undisturbed time that
she likes. So we compromised.\
\
That\'s the kind of support that a MS patient needs.]{.rendered_qtext}
