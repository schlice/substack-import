They do exactly what they can do: *lobby for laws they agree with.*

The Supreme Court basically said there is no Constitutional right to an
abortion. That means that states can make laws either making abortion
legal, making it illegal, or something in between. You'll note that the
majority of states have done the last one (allowing some abortion, but
making it illegal after a certain time, and that time varies from state
to state).

So what can Democrats do now?

1.  **Work at the national level to pass nationwide abortion laws that
    make sense.** The last attempt at passing an abortion law was
    basically taking *Roe* and turning it into law: unfettered access to
    abortion until the baby is born. The majority of people don't want
    that. In fact, the majority of the people want some form of
    legalized abortion early in pregnancy, but understand that a growing
    fetus eventually has some rights and can't be arbitrarily killed
    after a certain point. So far from an "all or nothing" solution,
    most people support something in the middle.\
    \
    So Congress should work to pass a *sensible* abortion law. Something
    that guarantees that a woman can have an abortion at the beginning
    of her pregnancy, but protects the baby near the end of her
    pregnancy.
2.  **Work at the state level to pass state abortion laws that make
    sense**. Just as important as lobbying Congress, Democrats can work
    at the state level to pass reasonable abortion laws that mirror what
    is being suggested at the Federal level.
3.  **Have real conversations with real people about real issues**.
    Democrats tend to find the *emotion* in an issue instead of the
    *facts* in an issue. If the baby doesn't have a right to life, then
    explain why. Convince people, because people's opinions can now
    shape the laws in each state. So it's time to go back to Forensics
    and get some *convincing* arguments as to why your side is right.
4.  **Work to amend the Constitution to add a right to abortion.** If
    you truly believe that the right to an abortion is a natural right,
    then you should be focused on amending the Constitution to enshrine
    that right. Remember that *Roe* was overturned because the Court
    found no right to an abortion in the Constitution. So add one! You
    should easily be able to get 2/3 of Congress and 3/4 of the states
    to agree to an amendment if support is as widespread as your polls
    tell you it is.

Look, I'm pro-life, no exceptions. But here I am, **literally handing
you the playbook to codify abortion into law**. It's no secret. If you
want abortion to be legal, this is how you do it. You don't rely on the
Courts to create law for you. That's the job of elected legislators, not
unelected judges. And you can't fault the judges for fixing bad law,
just because you liked the outcome of the bad law. They don't look at
outcomes, only whether or not the law is good or bad. And the outcome of
the law doesn't make it good or bad, only whether or not it is
Constitutional.
