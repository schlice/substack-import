People agonize over "the unpardonable sin" all the time, but in the vast
majority of cases, their angst simply comes from a misunderstanding of
what the unpardonable sin is, and who can commit it.

Basically, the Bible says that the unpardonable sin is "blaspheming
against the Spirit." But that is too generic to really explain it,
especially considering the vast quantity and types of sins which God
forgave. So it's really unlikely that you "accidentally" committed "the
unpardonable sin."

A person who has committed "the unpardonable sin" decisively rejects
clear Spirit-revealed truth about Jesus *by attributing his mighty works
to Satan*. They *affirmatively and consciously* reject Jesus because
they never repent. They continue to rebel against Jesus until they die.
Instead of submitting to who Jesus is and recognizing that the Spirit
empowered Jesus' mighty works, they affirmatively reject Jesus by
declaring that his works are of Satan.

*The unpardonable sin is not an accidental slip of the tongue. It is
deliberately denying the truth about Jesus.*

We all know that God softens a heart so that a person who truly seeks
him can be touched by his word and be saved. We know that God does the
hard work of conversion in a person to save them. But you should also
know that *God can do the opposite.* God can harden a person's heart in
response to someone who truly rejects him, and not allow that person to
be touched by his word. The sin is unforgivable because God never
enables that person to repent and believe. **So this is a sin that only
unbelievers can commit.**

Finally, we can never know if we have committed the unpardonable sin.
Only God knows who is guilty of this sin. But I can tell you this much:
***you have to try really hard and be really committed to evil in order
to commit this sin.***

TL;DR: You cannot commit the unpardonable sin by accident. There is no
slip of the tongue or passing thought which commits this sin. It is a
conscious decision to utterly and completely reject God. God responding
by hardening the heart against his word is what makes the sin
unpardonable, because the person will never be able to repent.

Original question:

I played an album that relayed evil to Jesus and I mistaked it for the
unpardonable sin and said I was in the unpardonable sin outloud thinking
I was guilty, not knowing it was blasphemy of the holy spirit. Have I
committed blasphemy?
