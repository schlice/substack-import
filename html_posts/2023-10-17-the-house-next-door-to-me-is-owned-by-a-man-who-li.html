Illinois has a shared fence law.

> **Illinois Fence Law Basics**

If, after you have written a letter, gotten the recommendation from the
fence viewer, and attempted mediation, you can file suit in your local
small claims court for reimbursement.

Despite what others have said, the property is located in Illinois and
is covered by Illinois law, regardless of whether or not the owner lives
on the property full-time. You can seek redress in Illinois small claims
court if you cannot get reimbursement in any other way.
