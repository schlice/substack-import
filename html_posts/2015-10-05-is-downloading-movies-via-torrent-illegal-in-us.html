**Content:** [BitTorrent is a protocol. Downloading a movie using
BitTorrent is no more or less legal than using FTP or HTTP file transfer
methods.\
\
The question has nothing to do with the actual protocol. The question is
whether or not you have a right to own a copy of that movie. If you do,
then BitTorrent is arguably the fastest and most efficient way to
download that movie. If you don\'t, it\'s arguably the fastest and most
efficient way to receive an illegal copy of that
movie.]{.rendered_qtext}
