**Content:** [Multiple Sclerosis is an autoimmune condition in which the
immune system attacks and destroys the myelin sheath surrounding nerve
fibers. The resultant scars (scleroses) are areas of decreased nerve
transmission through which nerve signals flow more slowly, thus causing
weakness to muscles.\
\
Psoriasis is also an autoimmune disease, but in psoriasis, the immune
system targets and attacks skin cells, causing abnormal cell growth.\
\
Like MS, psoriasis is an immune-mediated disorder, and also like MS, the
cause is not known. It is also possible that the method of disease
action in both diseases may be similar (T-cells producing inflammatory
responses in nerves or skin cells). Finally, there is no known cure for
either disease, however, both diseases can be treated with
immunomodulatory drugs.]{.rendered_qtext}
