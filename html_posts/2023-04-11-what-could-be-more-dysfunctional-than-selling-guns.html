The ATF intentionally allowing guns to be sold illegally to straw
purchasers to try to stop crime.

*Fast and Furious.* Y'all remember that program?

In case you want to read up on it.

So you know how people always complain that we have to enforce the laws
we already have? The ATF was also the target of such criticism, being
accused of going after relatively minor gun charges while leaving the
"big fish" to operate freely. To counter this idea, **Project
Gunrunner** was born. The idea was to allow southern states to illegally
sell firearms to straw buyers so that they could track the guns to
Mexican drug cartel leaders and arrest them. The program hoped to block
the flow of firearms from the United States into Mexico by catching
straw purchasers in the US. One operation under the program was titled
**Operation Fast and Furious** when one of the straw purchasers they
were tracking was found to be a member of a car club.

They allowed over 2,000 firearms to "walk" under the program. They
eventually recovered 710 of those firearms. They did arrest a few straw
purchasers, but the firearms never made it up to big Mexican drug cartel
leaders, and none were ever arrested.

Worse, the guns found their way back into the United States. Guns from
the program were found on both sides of the US-Mexico border, being
responsible for the deaths of at least 150 Mexican civilians and a US
Border Patrol agent (Brian Terry).
