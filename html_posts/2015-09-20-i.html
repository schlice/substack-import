**Content:** [Thanks for the A2A, I\'ll limit my answer to the US Air
Force.\
\
If you want to enlist in the Air Force, you have to be between ages 17
and 39, be a U.S. citizen or a permanent, legal resident, have a high
school diploma, or have a GED with at least 15 college credits. You will
have to take an aptitude test, and you will also have to take a physical
test as well as undergo a full health exam. So if you want to join the
US Air Force, this is where you start.\
\
If you can become a US citizen before age 34, you can take your degree
and use it towards Officer Training School. OTS requires you be between
the ages of 18 and 34 and already possess at least a Bachelor\'s
Degree.\
