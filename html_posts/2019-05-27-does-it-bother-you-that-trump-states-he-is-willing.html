**Does it bother you that Trump states he is willing to completely
destroy an entire country, namely Iran (i.e. genocide)?**

It would bother me if he woke up one day and said, "You know, I don't
like Iran any more, let's destroy the entire country." That would be
closer to genocide than what we have now.

To be fair, questioner, if a country is destroyed in a war, while it is
technically the destruction of an entire country, so it technically
meets the book definition of the term, it's not done with the express
purpose of wiping out a people, or a culture, or a nation.

For example, the Holocaust was a genocide, as its sole purpose was to
eliminate a religious group. The people killed did nothing to inspire
such measures.

If Iran goes to war with the United States, and they lose, and as
President Trump tweeted, their entire nation is destroyed, that would be
a consequence of their own actions.

Additionally, in order to qualify as a genocide, most scholars believe
that a necessary part is the "intent to destroy." This means that the
intention of the act is to remove the group in question from existence.
While Trump's tweet was grammatically sloppy in this way, he doesn't
intend to destroy the entire country. Specifically, he said that if Iran
provoked the United States, they would be destroyed in a subsequent war.
"Destroyed" stated in this way is a turn of phrase which means "complete
and total defeat" instead of "every person in the country killed." The
US would still follow the Geneva Convention's rules for combat and would
not intentionally harm civilians, would allow the injured to get
treatment, would provide safe quarter for prisoners of war, etc.

To that end, I think the term "genocide" would be wrongly applied to a
war between Iran and the US.
