You have the right to ask God for anything. I used to ask God for
laser-beam eyes. By the way, this is initially when I learned that God
doesn't give you everything you ask for. Sometimes, his answer is No.

While laser beam eyes probably weren't ever going to be a thing in my
life, this is still a pretty important concept to understand.

**We must understand that sometimes, when God answers our prayers, he
does so by saying NO.**

When it comes to asking God to forgive the sins in others when we have
ourselves sinned, Jesus addressed this:

> Do not judge, or you too will be judged. For in the same way you judge
> others, you will be judged, and with the measure you use, it will be
> measured to you.

> Why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother's eye and pay

> brother, 'Let me take the speck out of your eye,' when all the time
> there is a plank in your own eye? You hypocrite, first take the plank

Commentator Kent Hughes said, "We find it so easy to turn a microscope
on another person's sin, but we look at ours through the wrong end of a
telescope. We easily spot a speck of phoniness in another, because we
have a logjam of it in our own lives. Wrath toward the speck in someone
else's life may come from the suppressed guilt over the same massive sin
in our own lives."

So the problem isn't that we don't have the right to ask God to forgive
the sins of others. It's because we spend too much time looking at
everyone else's sins while not looking at the sin in our own life.

In fact, spending all the time worried about other people's sins instead
of our own may be a sign of guilt, because we have the same sin. If you
go back to Matthew's writings in their original language, "speck" and
"plank" come from the same word. In other words, Jesus was saying that
we may be so good at finding the specks in other people's eyes because
we have planks of the same material in our own.

In other words, don't look in the telescope or the microscope for sins,
look in the mirror. "Forgiven people are forgiving
people."[\[1\]](#LLrvL){#cite-LLrvL .citation_link} Seek forgiveness for
yourself, and you will find that you are much more forgiving of others.

Original question:

Do we have the right to ask God to forgive others of sins when we
ourselves have also sinned?
