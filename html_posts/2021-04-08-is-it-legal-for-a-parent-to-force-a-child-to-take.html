**Is it legal for a parent to force a child to take off their clothing?
(Everything but undergarments)**

Not enough information is included in this question in order to give a
fully thoughtful and appropriate answer.

***In certain circumstances***, it may be illegal for a parent to force
a child to take off their clothing. For example, in the middle of a busy
city street or in the main hallway of the school, the parent may be
guilty of child abuse. In a strip club, the parent may additionally be
guilty of contributing to the delinquency of a minor. But in the
doctor's office? It is likely that no crime has been committed.

Details are key.
