**Content:** [The information about ongoing cases is restricted and
cannot be released. Once the case is closed, the information must be
released upon receipt of a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request. If
someone were to make a FOIA request for that information, and it was not
protected because it was an ongoing case, and it didn\'t reveal
\"private information\" (i.e. protected medical information, etc), it
must be released. The sensibilities of the victim are not usually taken
into consideration, with the notable exception of certain crimes against
the victim, such as rape and/or domestic violence.\
\
The simple fact is that if you were murdered in a brothel, you are no
longer alive to defend your honor, so your case for protecting that
information becomes moot with your death.]{.rendered_qtext}
