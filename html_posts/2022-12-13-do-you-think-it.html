Relativism is the belief that all of our beliefs are relative to
ourselves (or provisional). But Relativism suffers from one fatal flaw,
which can be defeated using a technique Geisler and Turek call the *Road
Runner Tactic*.

Do you remember watching the old Road Runner cartoons where Wile E.
Coyote would be tricked into running off of a cliff? He kinda hung there
in mid-air until he realized that he was not, in fact, standing on solid
ground. And then he broke the fourth wall, looking at the viewer in
sudden recognition of his predicament, and sometimes holding up a little
sign that said something pithy like "oops" or "bye-bye" and *then* he
fell down, crashing in a heap to the ground.

Similar to Wile E. Coyote, relativism's arguments can't sustain their
own weight, and when they realize the flaw in their arguments, they too
crash into the ground in a heap.

In this case, you made the statement that "all our beliefs are
ultimately provisional," or said another way, "all our beliefs are
relative."

To this, I ask you the one question that the Road Runner would ask to
show Wile E. Coyote that he was actually hanging in mid-air:

***"Is that statement, that all our beliefs are relative, a relative
statement?"***

Said another way, is that statement, that all truth is relative, a
statement of absolute truth? Aren't you saying that "It is absolutely
true that all truth is relative?" Because if all truth is relative, then
the statement that "all truth is relative" *is also relative*. Which
means that all truth *might* be relative, or all truth *might* be true.
By that definition alone, you can see that the statement that "all truth
is relative" is a false statement.

This statement is what we call **self-defeating** because by its own
definition, it causes itself to be untrue.

But if you still believe that all truth is relative, I have a few
additional questions for you. Why should we learn anything at all? Why
should any student listen to any teacher, much less pay to go to college
to do so? If every professor teaches things that are only relative
truths, why should we listen? In fact, why should we listen to the
professor at all when he or she doesn't have the truth? And what's the
point of obeying the professor's moral rules about cheating on tests or
plagiarizing term papers? It's all relative!

C. S. Lewis talked about what it means to expect virtue from people who
are taught that no virtue exists:

> *In a sort of ghastly simplicity we remove the organ and demand the
> function. We make men without chests and expect of them virtue and
> enterprise. We laugh at honor and are shocked to find traitors in our
> midst. We castrate and bid the geldings to be
> fruitful.*[\[1\]](#qfuFU){#cite-qfuFU .citation_link}

The truth is that truth exists, and it can be known. False ideas about
truth lead to false ideas about life. And if you can kill the concept of
truth, you can kill the concept of any true morality. Our society has
been trending in this direction for many years, and the fruits of their
efforts are not just true for them, but for all of us.
