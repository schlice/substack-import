**Content:** [Larry\'s answer is superb. Rather than mess with the
beauty of it, I\'d like to re-phrase the whole \"fires of Hell\" thing.
I believe that a fair definition of Heaven is \"living immersed in the
full grace, love, and presence of God\" and Hell is \"living in the
absolute void and absence of God and His love.\"\
\
Heaven would be like having all of your senses immediately multiplied
tenfold and getting seven or eight new senses, and Hell would be like
living in an empty apartment, having all of your senses immediately
dulled, and losing your hearing too. No sunlight, just a single
lightbulb in the ceiling. No windows, no tech, no nothing. Forever
alone. Can you live that way? Certainly you can, but it\'s no way to
live. You will find that living in the absence of God\'s love is
torture. You may as well be on fire.]{.rendered_qtext}
