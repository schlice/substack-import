*(Firearms question --- answers apply to the US only)*

Regardless of whether in public or in private, concealed or not, local
laws regarding possession of a firearm by a juvenile will take
precedence. These laws will dictate when and where a juvenile may
possess a firearm in all instances.

Since all states are different, I'll give you the details for Florida,
since I happen to have those in front of me. Here, a juvenile (under 18
years old) is not allowed to possess a firearm other than an unloaded
firearm in the juvenile's home. "Possess" means "to have in one's
possession" which means to hold or carry, concealed or open.

One exception to this general rule is that a juvenile can usually
possess a firearm under one of the following conditions:

1.  The juvenile is engaged in a lawful hunting activity and is:
    1.  At least 16 years of age; or
    2.  Under 16 years of age and supervised by an adult.
2.  The juvenile is engaged in a lawful marksmanship competition or
    practice or other lawful recreational shooting activity and is:
    1.  At least 16 years of age; or
    2.  Under 16 years of age and supervised by an adult who is acting
        with the consent of the juvenile's parent or guardian.
3.  The firearm is unloaded and is being transported by the minor
    directly to or from an event authorized in bullets 1 or 2.

(Source: Fl Stat 790.22)

Possessing a firearm by a juvenile in Florida is a first-degree
misdemeanor. Harsher penalties apply to a second or subsequent violation
of the same statute, which then are classified as a third-degree felony.

These crimes are handled by the juvenile justice system. For a first
offense, the juvenile can be ordered to serve a period of detention of
up to three days in a secure juvenile detention facility, and the
juvenile must perform 100 hours of community service.
