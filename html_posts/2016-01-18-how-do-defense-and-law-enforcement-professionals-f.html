I am reminded of the following quote:

*When seconds count, the police are only minutes away.*

The simple fact remains: **the police are not in the business of
protecting you** ***from*** **crime.**

The police are specifically \"law enforcement.\" That means they enforce
laws. In order to do that, someone must *violate* the law, and the
police will then *enforce* that law. This implies that the police duty
actually occurs *post-violation*. In other words, *the crime has already
happened by the time the police are engaged.* Under their actual
mandate, the police do not get involved until the crime has already
occurred.

Which begs the question: *If the police are not supposed to be
protecting me, whose job is it to protect me?*

Unless you\'re rich enough to hire your own bodyguards, the job of the
safety and security of you and your family falls on **you** (more
specifically, the head of the household).

Under the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution, this country
was created as a *free society*. We have certain unalienable rights,
among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Some of the
other inalienable rights we have which were endowed by our Creator are a
natural right to self-defense. We have the right to be secure in our
persons. We also have the right to be secure in our homes (and most
legislatures in the country have recognized this by instituting some
form of [[Castle
doctrine](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=1588d1&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castle_doctrine){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container} in their laws). Since we
have the right to self-defense, we have the right to defend ourselves
from all forms of tyranny: governmental tyranny, tyranny by armed thugs,
or by anyone who wishes to deprive us of our fundamental rights to life,
liberty, or property.

This is one of the reasons that the Second Amendment was so important,
that it was made number two. As Senator Rubio mentioned during the
debate, they didn\'t place the amendments in a hat and draw them out
randomly. Their ordering was very deliberate. The Second Amendment is
second only to our right to speek freely against the government (in word
or in press), to peaceably assemble, and to practice our religions in
peace. Immediately following that, we ensured that we had the right to
be secure in our persons by ensuring that everyone always retained the
right to defend themselves against all forms of tyranny.

If Senator Rubio is doing **his job** as the head of his household, he
will be buying a gun to defend them against any and all threats to his
safety, and the safety of his family, be it from ISIS or from the
meth-mouth down the street looking to steal something he can fence for
cash for more meth and not caring who he hurts along the way.
