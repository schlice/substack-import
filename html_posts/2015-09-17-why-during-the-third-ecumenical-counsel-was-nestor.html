**Content:** [Your assertion that Nestorius was \"merely defending what
scriptures taught\" was exactly what was at issue during the Council.\
\
During the Third Ecumenical Council at Ephesus (also known as the
Council of Ephesus), Pope Celestine I and Roman Emperor Theodosius II
found that Nestorius, in defending his view of the Immaculate
Conception, was actually advancing the idea that the hypostatic union
did not occur at birth, and Mary gave birth only to Christ, not to the
divine *Logos*. He asserted that the *Logos* could not be \"born\" since
it existed before Mary, and to say that the divine could be born would
be to deny the nature of the divine. He also asserted that the *Logos*
occupied the area normally occupied by the soul, which allowed Jesus to
exist without the stain on the soul from the Fall.\
\
The Council found this to be a contradiction to the hypostatic union,
and found Nestorius\' view to be heretical. The Council found that
separating the divine from the human, and saying that the divine can\'t
be born, would mean that Jesus was *less than* human because he was born
without a soul.\
