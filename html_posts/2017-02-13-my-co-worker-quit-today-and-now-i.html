*(Note that labor laws are different in every state, so some things here
may vary by state. Only a labor lawyer in your area will know for sure
what laws cover you.)*

In an "at-will" employment situation, your employer can fire you at any
time, and you can quit at any time.

That said, your employer cannot fire you for a prohibited reason (i.e.
you failed to break the law).

Additionally, hourly employees **cannot** work off the clock. If you are
ever forced to work off the clock, you can file a complaint with the US
Department of Labor and receive up to three years in back pay for time
you were required to work after you have clocked out. Employers
sometimes (mistakenly) say things like "this isn't work, it's pre-work"
or "post-work". This is an error on your employer's part. All work an
hourly employee does must be on the clock or you can receive it in back
pay. You can hire an attorney to help you file for back pay.

Your employer cannot **force** you to work off the clock, and they
cannot legally fire you for failing to do so.

The trick is that when they fire you, they don't have to give you a
reason in "at-will" employment. They can simply say that your employment
is no longer needed. If they don't tell you that they fired you because
you wouldn't work for free, you don't have much leg to stand on.

If they tell you that you're fired because you wouldn't work for free,
this is what would be considered "unlawful termination." Of course, even
if they did, your only recourse is to hire an attorney and to sue them.
But you just got fired, so how are you going to afford an attorney? Neat
Catch-22, isn't it?

By the way, employers know this. They know that the odds you're going to
sue them for unlawful termination are slim, so they take the chance.

*(EDIT) I had an incorrect understanding of voluntarily working for free
and the Fair Labor Standards Act. Thanks to*
