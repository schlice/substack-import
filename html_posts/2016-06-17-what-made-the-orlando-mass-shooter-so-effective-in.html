He actually didn\'t have little gun experience, as you suggest. He
actually had a permit to carry a gun and he did so as part of his job.
He very likely had quite a bit of advanced firearms training. He may not
have personally owned an AR-15 before that day, but he had probably shot
one at least once before.

The basic principles behind firing any weapons platform are intuitively
transferable between weapons within that platform. If you can fire a
shotgun, you can pretty much fire any shotgun with the same level of
accuracy. If you can fire an AR-style rifle, you can pretty much fire
any AR-style rifle with the same level of accuracy.

This probably had a big impact on his ability to use a firearm
effectively.
