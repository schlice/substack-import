Based on just what you've given us, your entrance package is pretty
competitive already. Remember that the Academy is looking for that
"well-rounded" person, who not only excels as a student-athlete, but is
also involved in the community and who has shown leadership potential
and the ability to make it at the Academy. Remember, sustained
participation in select activities over the course of your high school
career is preferred. Demonstrated leadership in athletic and
non-athletic extracurricular activities will be crucial, but don't worry
if you don't excel in all areas.

Just remember you're trying to put the strongest package you can
together for admission. And if you haven't taken [[Scott
Parman](https://www.quora.com/profile/Scott-Parman)]{.qlink_container}'s
advice yet, it's time to get on to the [[Academy
Admissions](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=d1e87d&url=https://www.academyadmissions.com){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="academyadmissions.com"}]{.qlink_container} website and look
it over. Also, f[[ind your Admissions Liaison
Officer](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=3baf43&url=https://www.academyadmissions.com/admissions/outreach-programs/find-your-admissions-liaison-officer/){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="academyadmissions.com"}]{.qlink_container} and start working
directly with him/her. That person will assist you through every step of
the admissions process.

I will tell you though, based on what you have here, you are already a
pretty strong candidate. You're on the right track! Work with your ALO
to "fine-tune" your path, which will only make you an even stronger
candidate.

Thanks for asking, and good luck!
