Sure. Anyone can pray anything they choose. Nothing bad is going to
happen when someone prays with an insincere heart.

In other words, if you pray for an exorcism when no exorcism is needed,
then your words are empty and your prayer is useless.

It's not the *prayer* that has the power. It's the *faith* behind the
prayer.

How many times in the Bible were people healed by their faith alone?
Just look at Bartimaeus, the blind man recorded in Mark, chapter 10,
verses 46--52:

> Then they came to Jericho. As Jesus and his disciples, together with a
> large crowd, were leaving the city, a blind man, Bartimaeus (which
> means "son of Timaeus"), was sitting by the roadside begging. When he
> heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to shout, "Jesus, Son of
> David, have mercy on me!"
>
> Many rebuked him and told him to be quiet, but he shouted all the
> more, "Son of David, have mercy on me!"
>
> Jesus stopped and said, "Call him."
>
> So they called to the blind man, "Cheer up! On your feet! He's calling
> you." Throwing his cloak aside, he jumped to his feet and came to
> Jesus.
>
> "What do you want me to do for you?" Jesus asked him.
>
> The blind man said, "Rabbi, I want to see."
>
> "Go," said Jesus, "your faith has healed you." Immediately he received
> his sight and followed Jesus along the road.

Clearly, Jesus did the healing, but he didn't need to touch Bartimaeus,
or do anything special. Jesus said that it was his *faith* that healed
him. Jesus wants us to repent and be faithful. That's when we receive
the rewards he has promised us. It is that faith which brings the power.

Faith brings power, not empty, vapid words.
