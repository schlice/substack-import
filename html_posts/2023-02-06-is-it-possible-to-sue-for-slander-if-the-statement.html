"it was only a joke" is never a defense against defamation. Slander is
spoken defamation while libel is printed or written defamation.

There are four elements to defamation:

- The defamatory statement, which is made claiming to be fact
- Publication or transmission of the statement to a third party
- Fault amounting to at least negligence, and
- Damages, or some harm caused to the reputation of the person against
  whom the statement was made.

In order to prevail in a defamation case, you need all four. And if the
"joke" actually caused damages, suing for defamation is still possible.
