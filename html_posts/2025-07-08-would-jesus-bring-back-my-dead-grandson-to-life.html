Yes, He will.

When He returns, all of those asleep will rise. It's in the Bible. I'll
highlight it:

> *But we do not want you to be uninformed, brothers, about those who
> are asleep, that you may not grieve as others do who have no hope. For
> since we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so, through
> Jesus, God will bring with him those who have fallen asleep. For this
> we declare to you by a word from the Lord, that we who are alive, who
> are left until the coming of the Lord, will not precede those who have
> fallen asleep. For the Lord himself will descend from heaven with a
> cry of command, with the voice of an archangel, and with the sound of
> the trumpet of God.* ***And the dead in Christ will rise first.***
> *Then we who are alive, who are left, will be caught up together with
> them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air, and so we will always
> be with the Lord. Therefore encourage one another with these words.
> \-- 1 Thessalonians 4:13--18 ESV*

So there you have it. It's going to happen.
