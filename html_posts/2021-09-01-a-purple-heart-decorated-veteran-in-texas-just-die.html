"My body, my choice" is still the law of the land. Remember *Roe v.
Wade?* Remember *Griswold v. Connecticut?*

Like it or not, the Supreme Court has found that the Constitution
contains a right to privacy, and that extends to what I do with my body.

So no, hospitals cannot turn away people who are unvaccinated. They
would be violating those peoples' Constitutional rights.

Hospitals will have to implement their emergency plans and expand their
Emergency Rooms. States and cities have had emergency plans in place for
overcrowding in hospitals since the beginning of the pandemic, and the
hospital will have to go to the local or state government to implement
those emergency plans.

What changed? Last year, we were doing everything in our power to help
hospitals have all the resources they needed to handle the pandemic.
Except for all of a sudden, it appears to be "distasteful" today to tell
a hospital to implement its emergency plans.

So what changed? **The new variable is the existence of a vaccine.**

Some people don't like the fact that some other people have chosen to
not get vaccinated. However, if I have the right to privacy, and if that
right to privacy extends to my body, then I have the right to remain
unvaccinated. You do not have the right to deny me care at a hospital.

Maybe you want to make sure that no public money is spent on someone who
chooses to remain unvaccinated, and that's fine, the legislature can
vote to make sure that no assistance funds go to their care. If they
want to remain unvaccinated, make them *pay for* their own care.

But you can't *deny them space in the hospital* because they made a
perfectly legal choice with which you don't agree. It is ethically
untenable to turn anyone away from care. Not even doctors are demanding
what you are asking. Is it also okay to turn away a needle-based drug
user who now has AIDS? Is it okay to turn away a morbidly obese person
who doesn't have a thyroid issue?

Determining who gets treatment based on a values judgement has never
been acceptable, and it won't become acceptable now.

*For the time being, I have re-enabled comments on selected answers.
Some people like to comment. Some people like to engage with me in a
civil manner, and I did kinda miss that\...a little. But do not
misunderstand, I take this step very cautiously, and I have no tolerance
for harassing or inane behavior. If you don\'t like what I wrote, tough
shit. If my answer is grammatically low-quality or is un-cited opinion
masquerading as fact, downvote it. If you think I\'m wrong, write your
own answer. But Quora is a question-and-answer site, not a debate site.
If you are simply commenting to tell me \"ackshually, you\'re wrong,\"
don\'t be surprised if I quietly delete your comment. Put anything
vaguely harassing in there, and your deletion will be followed by a
block/mute, and a BNBR report. I will do this immediately and with no
compunction. You have been warned. Be nice.*

Original question:

A Purple Heart decorated veteran in Texas just died from gallstones
because unvaccinated COVID-19 cases are filling all of the hospitals.
Can\'t the hospitals reserve some space for emergencies and turn away
some that chose not to protect themselves?
