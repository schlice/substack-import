**Why did Congress vote to cut funding to the Center of Disease
Control's study of gun violence in 1996?**

Thanks for the A2A. Congress did not cut funding to the CDC for gun
violence studies. They saw the first product of that research that they
funded, and realized that CDC was actually using data to attempt to
influence politics.

A rider was attached to the 1996 Omnibus Spending Bill called the Dickey
Amendment. The amendment simply said:

> \[N\]one of the funds made available for injury prevention and control
> at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) may be used to
> advocate or promote gun control.

The Dickey Amendment has been reauthorized many times, and many
different Congresses have attempted to remove it without success. But as
you can see by the text of the amendment, it doesn't actually prevent
them from doing research.

In fact, in 2013 and 2015, the CDC has published research into gun
violence (consistent with the Dickey Amendment text). The CDC has some
of the best data on gun violence. Their [[WISQARS
system](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=a20d50&url=https://www.cdc.gov/injury/wisqars/index.html){.external_link

statistics.

The Dickey Amendment was clarified in 2018, when a report accompanying
the Omnibus continuing resolution re-stated the fact that the CDC can,
in fact, conduct research into gun violence.
