Why don't atheists realize that their faith in a lack of God has even
*less* proof than the theist has?

If we exist (and we do), and we are not self-existent, then we must have
been created by something. The Law of Causation states that we must have
a cause. Even Hume said, "I never asserted a proposition so absurd as
that something should arise without a cause."

That cause must be eternal, because if it is not, then *it* has a cause.

Therefore, we have a necessary, and eternal, cause.

There are two possibilities: an eternal **universe**, or an eternal
**creator**. Our universe is either self-existent, or someone created
our universe. Our universe was either created, or it was not. The Law of
Noncontradiction states this.

To date, all key scientific and philosophical evidence points to the
fact that our universe had a beginning (the Big Bang). If it had a
*beginning*, then it had a *cause*, and thus cannot be our creator.

Therefore, the only logical conclusion is to believe that an eternal
creator created us.

Atheists must hold on to the belief that we were created by the
universe, in the face of increasing evidence showing that the universe
is not eternal and cannot have created us.

Why don\'t theists realise their faith in God doesn\'t meet the burden
of proof requirements to justify a belief in God?
