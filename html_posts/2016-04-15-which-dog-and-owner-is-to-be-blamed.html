In most cities and municipalities, there exist *leash laws*. The purpose
of the leash law is, in actuality, for situations like this, where
unleashed animals become provocative because they are not under proper
leash control.

It\'s very cut and dried. The unleashed dog is always at most fault,
because it is always in violation of the law. The owner cannot extract
much payment from you, because you were not in violation of the law. The
owner could not positively control her dog (i.e. her dog was not under
positive control) and it provoked your dog into defending itself.

In fault-finding, she is going to hold the lion\'s share of the fault
because her dog was off-leash. However, you knew your dog was aggressive
and you still chose to walk it in an area where it might come into
contact with other dogs. Other things that may come into play are the
overall aggressiveness of your dog\'s breed, other bite incidents you
may have had, etc. That said, you took all reasonable precautions to
protect your dog and other dogs, so your share of the liability will be
greatly limited.

A simple letter from your attorney to hers pointing out the share of
liability held by each party may be enough to ward her off. If she does
proceed with a suit, I think you\'ll be in a decent position.
