**Is pre-existing condition the cause of Republicans damning ACA,
ObamaCare? Are they being thoughtful to American needs or just trying to
undo Obama policies?**

Close. The real reason Republicans didn't like ACA was the pre-existing
condition's requirement: the individual mandate.

Mostly however, it's a Democrat talking point. Every plan Republicans
brought forward to replace ACA with, even before ACA was passed,
protected pre-existing conditions. Every single one. Not a single
Republican has ever talked about denying coverage to anyone with
pre-existing conditions.

However, actions speak louder than words. It is true that many
Republican-proposed plans in the past had "holes" where their
protections were not nearly as strong as ACA.

The reason? **ACA could force pre-existing condition coverage because of
the individual mandate.**

In other words, in order to force insurance companies to pay for all
pre-existing conditions, there has to be a way to pay for it. ACA did it
with the individual mandate. Since Republican plans did not have an
individual mandate, their plans may have had sliding scale deductibles,
or loopholes like insurance plans could deny coverage for specific
conditions if they couldn't deliver services adequately. This means they
could still offer coverage, but they could deny individual services
because they couldn't adequately deliver them. Ergo, Republicans want to
deny you coverage for pre-existing conditions. Not exactly true, but not
exactly untrue either. A perfect talking point.
