**If the unlikely (impossible) happens and Trump overturns the election
with help, how do you think the population will react?**

Trump cannot overturn the election. There is nothing he personally can
do to change the outcome of the election.

*However*, there is one more point in time where the results of the
election could, conceivably, change.

As the procedure goes, the new Congress will be sworn in on January 3.
The new Congress will meet in joint session on January 6 to count the
electoral votes. The President of the Senate (VP Pence) will preside
over the session. The electoral votes will be read and counted in
alphabetical order. Then they will give their tallies to Pence, who will
announce the results, and listen for objections.

**It is at this point** where objections to the electoral votes can
conceivably be made. If they are, the House and the Senate will consider
them separately to determine how best to count those votes, or if those
votes should be counted at all. There are 538 electoral votes. If no
candidate gets a majority (270) of electoral votes, then the House
decides the election in what the Constitution calls a "contingent
election" for President. There have been three other contingent
elections in history: the presidential elections of 1800 and 1824, and
the vice-presidential election of 1836.

*But wait*, I hear you saying, *Democrats control the House!* Yes this
is true, but that's not how a contingent election for President is
decided in the House. During a contingent election, each state gets one
vote. All House members from each state vote as one bloc. The candidate
who gets 26 votes is declared the winner of the election. Since Trump
won more states than Biden, Trump would be elected by the House.

In this case, this is highly unlikely, and even if there are some
objections to some electoral votes, it seems highly unlikely that there
would be enough objections to preclude either candidate from receiving
at least 270 electoral votes.

**But even if that happens, it's still not a case of Trump overturning
the election.**

How would the population react? The same way it did in 2000, when
Democrats thought that the Supreme Court stole the election from Al Gore
and gave it to George W. Bush. There will be cries of "not my president"
and any Congressional obstruction will be re-labeled as "resistance" to
a president who "stole the election." There may be riots in some cities.

But the sun will still come up. Life will go on, regardless of who sits
behind the Resolute Desk on January 21.
