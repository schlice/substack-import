**What is the effect if a criminal act is committed without complete
freedom of action?**

In addition to [[Martin
Simons](https://www.quora.com/profile/Martin-Simons)]{.qlink_container}'
excellent answer, if the finding of duress is compelling enough, it may
move a jury to nullify the charge by refusing to convict.

As previously noted, a defense of duress does not eliminate the *actus
reus*, and it does not eliminate the *mens rea*, as you admit to
intending to commit the crime, even if only to avoid some actual or
threatened harm. Therefore, the complete culpability has already been
accepted by the defendant, but they are arguing for a lighter sentence
due to the duress.
