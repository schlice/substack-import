**If the police bang on your door and you let them in but they don\'t
have a warrant do they then have the right to search because you
voluntarily let them in?**

The answer, as with all legal answers, is "it depends."

Without a search warrant, if you simply allow them in the front door
without granting them permission to search, the police cannot "touch" or
"move" anything inside of your house in order to find evidence. They can
only look with their eyes at the interior spaces of your house. That
said, if you left your crack pipe on the coffee table (in "plain sight,"
the basis for the "plain sight" exception to the warrant requirement),
the police can take the pipe into evidence. Additionally, the presence
of the pipe provides probable cause to apply for a full search warrant
to find the crack cocaine which goes in the pipe. Police can call that
evidence in pretty quickly and use it as the basis for a search warrant.

Now, if the police come and bang on your door and you let them in and
they ask you if they can search your house *and you grant them
permission to search*, this obviates the need for a warrant, because you
granted permission to search. Note that the homeowner does not need to
be the grantor; anyone in the house over 18 years old can grant
permission to search the house. There are some specific rules
surrounding locked spaces inside the house and whether or not the person
granting permission has authority to access those spaces, but in
general, the police do not need a warrant if you grant them permission
to search.
