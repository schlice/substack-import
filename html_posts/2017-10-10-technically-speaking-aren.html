Yes, all firearms are *machines*, and all firearms are *guns*.

But there is a definition of a *machine gun* that exists in law, and
that definition is a weapon which fires more than one bullet for each
pull of the trigger.

Adding an accessory like a bump stock doesn't change this action; you
still produce one round fired per trigger pull, so a bump stock produces
what amounts to a *simulated machine gun*. It is not mechanically
different than any other semiautomatic rifle.
