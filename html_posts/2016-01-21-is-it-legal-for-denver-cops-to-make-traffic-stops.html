It is *legal* for Denver cops to make traffic stops in unmarked cars.

In *practice*, we sorta have a \"gentleman\'s agreement\" that the vast
majority of patrol (with the notable exception of Colorado State Patrol)
will be done in marked cars. We want to minimize any confusion about
whether or not the guy trying to pull you over is a real cop. Similarly,
most agencies (again, with the notable exception of Colorado State
Patrol) don\'t run radar from unmarked cars.

But it is not illegal for Colorado cops to stop you in marked or
unmarked cars if they observe you committing a traffic violation.
