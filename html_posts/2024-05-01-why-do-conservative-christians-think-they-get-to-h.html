I guess these days I can call myself a conservative Christian. So
speaking as one, I don't think that conservative Christians "hate"
anyone. They may not wish to associate with people who they have judged
to be sinners, and I don't blame them. I wouldn't want to associate with
known sinners myself. People tend to emulate those they spend the most
time around. Think about it: aren't most of your friend groups people
with whom you personally identify? Isn't that normal and acceptable? As
part of what James 1:27 refers to as \"pure and faultless\" religion, we
are to feel compassion towards those for whom Christ died and keep
ourselves \"from being polluted by the world.\" So of course I'd want to
distance myself from people who live in open sin; that's only natural
and makes sense. But *hate*? I don't think so.

In fact, we are called to *love* sinners. We do not love their sin, and
we encourage them to live righteously. But we still love them.

So let me ask you this: have you ever talked to an atheist? Have you
ever talked to someone who is strong in another faith? Have you ever
tried to talk to them about Christianity? Most people who have not
dabbled in apologetics or in active evangelism have never really done
that. What you'll find, in many cases, is people who are *intransigent*
and in some cases *openly hostile* towards Christians. This is
especially true of atheists, many of whom are atheists because they have
already had a bad experience with some Christians, and that hatred is
immediately transferred to anyone who calls themselves Christian, and
especially someone who is displaying an attitude of evangelism. So I
actually find that the perceived "hate" goes the other way.

Nevertheless, I think that conservative Christians do not "hate" anyone,
and especially do not hate anyone "by proxy." Remember, it's only the
sin we hate. If God hates sin, so should we, no? Jude 1:22--23 comes to
mind:

> Be merciful to those who doubt; save others by snatching them from the
> fire; to others show mercy, mixed with fear---hating even the clothing
> stained by corrupted flesh. (NIV)

So here, we're told that mercy for the sinner and a healthy loathing of
sin and its consequences should be the defining characteristics of our
evangelism. But we also understand that we are flawed human beings, and
that there is a huge gap between us and God in terms of loving and
hating. Even as Christians, we are not capable of perfect love or
perfect hatred (i.e., without ill will). But because He is God, God is
able to perform both of these things flawlessly. Without any desire to
sin, God can hate. Because of this, He is able to despise both the sin
and the sinner in a completely holy way, while also forgiving the sinner
in love at the point of repentance and faith.

The Bible clearly teaches that God is love.

> Whoever does not love does not know God, because God is love. This is
> how God showed his love among us: He sent his one and only Son into
> the world that we might live through him.--- 1 John 4:8--9 NIV

While we can't comprehend it, it is nonetheless true that God can
perfectly love and hate a person at the same time. This means He can
love him as someone He created and can redeem, as well as hate him for
his unbelief and sinful lifestyle.

We, as imperfect human beings, cannot do this; thus, we must remind
ourselves to "love the sinner; hate the sin." But how do we do that? We
demonstrate our love for sinners by treating them with respect (1 Peter
2:17), praying for them (1 Timothy 2:1), and sharing the gospel with
them. We demonstrate our hatred for sin by identifying sin for what it
is, abstaining from it, and decrying it as incompatible with God\'s
character. Sin should not be tolerated or dismissed; it should be hated.

**It is a true act of love to treat someone with respect and kindness
even though you do not approve of his or her lifestyle or sinful
choices.**

TL;DR: Sometimes, people misinterpret the hate for the sin as hating the
sinner. There is indeed a difference between hating the sinner and
hating the sin.
