**Why are people against child protective services (CPS) when CPS
workers have a duty by the state they are in to protect children and
report it to the local authorities when and if it is necessary, and why
do people make their jobs difficult?**

There are plenty of examples of CPS making mistakes. Yes, they are
human, but it seems that they have a higher rate of failure than other
organizations. We can debate that all day long if you like.

But for those in CPS who do their jobs to the best of their ability,
follow the rules, and generally care about the welfare of children,
people have one major objection to CPS:

**The existence of CPS reminds people that there are consequences to
their actions, and they don't like looking in the mirror that hard.**
