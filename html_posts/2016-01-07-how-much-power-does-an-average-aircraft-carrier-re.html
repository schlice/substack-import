An aircraft carrier requires very large amounts of power. Specifically,
they require enough power to drive the steam catapults to launch the
aircraft, drive the steam turbines which drive the propellers, and to
drive the steam-powered generators to produce all of the electricity for
the entire vessel. Since the US Navy has the lion\'s share of the
world\'s aircraft carriers, we\'ll use US aircraft carriers as the
example.

All currently-operating US aircraft carriers have PWR (pressurized water
reactor) nuclear power plants as the source of all of their power. In
the larger submarines and surface ships, the reactors produce in excess
of 500 MWt (thermal megawatts), and most US surface ships are powered by
two or more of these reactors. US submarines are usually powered by one.
