*We* don't need to do anything to ensure doctors in Texas feel safe
providing abortions without facing legal consequences.

*Doctors in Texas* need to consult with their own attorneys in order to
understand Texas law to ensure that any abortions they do provide are
within the guidelines specified by the law.

TL;DR: In order for any doctor in Texas to feel safe performing any
action without facing legal consequences, they should contact their
legal counsel.
