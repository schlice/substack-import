You asked if the *Court's* decision was justified. The answer is it 100%
is justified. The Justices even published a document explaining the
justification for their decision.

But it doesn't sound like you're actually asking about the Court and
their justification for what they ruled.

\

Let's start with the Supreme Court. To do that, we have to go back to
the beginning.

The President signed an Executive Order directing the Secretary of
Education to dismantle the Department of Education, but keep only
essential functions as required by law. Lawsuits filed by states, school
districts, and employee unions argued that the administration\'s actions
were an illegal attempt to close the department without congressional
approval and that the massive layoffs would prevent the department from
fulfilling its statutory duties, such as supporting special education,
distributing financial aid, and enforcing civil rights laws.

A Circuit court agreed with the plaintiffs and filed an injunction
preventing the administration's actions from proceeding.

The administration appealed to the Supreme Court, who repealed the
injunction and allowed the administration to move forward with its
dismantling of the Department of Education.

The administration argued that these actions were about efficiency and
that the president\'s authority to manage federal agencies includes
determining the necessary workforce. The majority opinion of the Court
held this view.

The minority opinion of the Court emphasized the lack of unilateral
presidential authority to eliminate departments established by Congress
and the potential for significant harm to students and educational
opportunities.

This isn't the first time that there has been a dispute about an agency
*created by Congress* but *given to the Executive* to run. Who has more
authority? The Court has been attempting to balance this duality for
many decades.

What *is* clear is that the President and Congress are going to have to
work together to determine what to do with the remainder of the
Department.

\

But I feel like that may not have been your question. Instead, you may
have been asking if *dismantling the Department of Education in the
first place* was justified.

And that is a *political* question, not a *legal* one.

Consider this. Before 1979, the United States public education system
(which was almost entirely run by state and local governments) was
widely regarded as the best in the world. Today, the United States is
ranked 28th in the world in math and 36th in literacy. One in four
eighth graders lacks a basic proficiency in math. One in three are not
reading at grade level. Only 13% are proficient in US history. In some
US cities, the numbers are truly appalling. For example, in Chicago, 22
schools didn't have a single student who was proficient in reading
comprehension, and 33 schools didn't have a single student who was
proficient in math.

It's certainly not because of a lack of funding. According to the most
recent numbers, the United States spends \$17,000 per student. In
Chicago, it's \$29,000.

So what happened between then and now? There are lots of reasons. Some
of them include too much screen time, and not engaged-enough parents.
But there is one thing of which we can be certain: the federal
Department of Education did not help. In fact, it may have actually made
things *worse*.

Again, this certainly isn't a money problem. Last year, the DOE had a
\$268 billion budget. So where did all that money go? Did it go to
students in the classroom? In any state?

To answer that question, we have to go back to President Jimmy Carter in
1979.

Carter had a pretty full plate. The 1980 election was closing fast and
Carter's chances were not looking good. Beset by the Iran Hostage
Crisis, crippling inflation, and gasoline shortages, Carter's approval
ratings had plummeted to a dismal 28 percent. He needed a big push. He
found it in the National Education Association, the largest labor union
in the country. The NEA really wanted a Cabinet-level department for
education, but frankly, no one else did. But this wasn't about schools
or students, it was about *politics*. So politics being what they are,
Carter created a new Cabinet-level Department of Education and staffed
it with his newfound best friends from the NEA. They got everything they
wanted: a Cabinet level department with control over every school
district in the country and a big budget to dangle over their heads in a
stick-and-carrot mode (do what we tell you or you don't get this big bag
of money) and a big bureaucracy, which they could fill with NEA members
and partisans.

Congress knew this was a bad idea. One anonymous House Democrat admitted
as much at the time: "The idea of an Education Department is really a
bad one. But it\'s NEA\'s top priority. There are school teachers in
every congressional district, and most of us simply don\'t need the
aggravation of taking them on."[\[1\]](#regJF){#cite-regJF

From that moment on, the needs of the students **took a back seat** to
the desires of the DOE. The Department was never designed to help
students. It was purely designed as a political gift to the largest
labor union in the country. Its employees (almost all Democrats) make a
very good living and a big chunk of them (over 2,500) are doing really
well for themselves, making well over \$100,000 a year. The Department
dispenses about \$80 billion to schools across the country for
educationally questionable initiatives like "teacher development,"
"diversity training," "critical theory studies" and "climate change
awareness." Seriously, the things they fund are a little out of pocket.
Here's just one example of many we can cite: under the Biden
Administration, the Department gave Framingham State University \$1.3
million to write a textbook for high school students that "provides a
lens for understanding the evolving definition of 'family' through
socially constructed and ecological theory frameworks." You read that
right: \$1.3 million to write a textbook about *that* (whatever it
means).

Does *any* of its money go to actual classroom instruction? It doesn't
go to pay teachers' salaries. It doesn't pay for curriculum or textbooks
or school buildings (your local tax dollars pay for that). The DOE is
free to spend its money on its own special interests. So the DOE is
absolutely perfect for the NEA: The union get the jobs and the goodies.
The Democrats get the votes (the NEA has endorsed every Democratic
presidential nominee since Carter) and a vehicle to push their ideas on
America's youth. But is it perfect for *literally anyone else?* It
certainly does not appear to be.

\

So is closing it *justified*? It would seem so. If all it does is
distribute money, *any* agency can do that. You don't need a separate
DOE bureaucracy to do that. And if you say, "No, don't close it,
*reform* it," how do you reform a federal agency into something it was
never meant to be?

It appears that all the DOE has ever been is a taxpayer money dispensary
for education administrators and the teacher's union, and as a pipeline
to deliver radical educational experimentation directly to our students.
