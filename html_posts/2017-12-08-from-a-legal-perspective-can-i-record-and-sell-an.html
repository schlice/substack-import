The short answer is **not without securing permission from the original
copyright owner.**

The longer answer is slightly more complicated, and differs around the
world. We'll stick with US copyright law.

An accompaniment track would be considered a *derivative work* under US
copyright law. This quote from
[[Wikipedia](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=0095ee&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative_work%23Originality_requirement){.external_link

answer:

> For copyright protection to attach to a later, allegedly derivative

Therefore, since an accompaniment track is actually the original work
*minus vocals*, it would not meet the originality standard required to
protect it as a derivative work.

Therefore, in order to produce and sell an accompaniment track, you
would need to secure permission (as well as arrange for royalties) from
the original copyright holder.

***Of course, it goes without saying that this is not legal advice, and
if you're actually going to record and sell an accompaniment track, you
need to seek the advice of a licensed copyright attorney in your
area.***
