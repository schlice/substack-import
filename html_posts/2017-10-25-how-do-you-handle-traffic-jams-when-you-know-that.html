If they are expected, try to leave a little earlier or a little later,
so you can avoid them.

If they are unexpected, then there is nothing that you can really do
about them. Try to find an activity that you can do while you\'re
sitting in traffic that you enjoy. Maybe you can read a book, or listen
to a book on tape. Maybe you\'d like to write a book. Maybe you like
Angry Birds. I\'m sure that there\'s something that you can find to fill
the time.
