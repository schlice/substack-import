I have to agree with [[Ian
R](https://www.quora.com/profile/Ian-R-124)]{.qlink_container} on this
one. It's likely that your HOA rules has some sort of clause in it which
requires that a garage be usable for cars.

You should contact the Managing Agent of your HOA and request a copy of
the P,P,R&R (Policies, Procedures, Rules, & Regulations). In Colorado,
we broke those up into two separate documents (Policies & Procedures,
and Rules & Regulations). You'd be looking for both documents. The Rules
will detail the specific rule which requires your garage to be capable
of accepting a car. As a tenant, you should have received the copies of
all of the HOA Governing Documents along with your lease, but some
landlords are less responsible about those things than others.

The HOA can indeed write a rule that says that garages are for cars.

In our HOA, we did it slightly differently. We said that all homeowners
and tenants must park in their garages. Once their garages are full **of
cars**, they must then park in their driveways. Only guests may park in
the street, and only for a maximum of 10 days.

Notice the specific bolded text. It's no excuse to come to the Board and
ask for an exception when you have three cars, a two-car driveway and a
garage full of "not cars."

We didn't say you can't store stuff in your garage. We simply said that
you can't park on the street, and having a garage full of stuff is not
an excuse for parking on the street. We are fining a particular
homeowner in my HOA monthly (which is more expensive than him renting a
storage unit, but whatever) because his garage is full of work stuff and
he refuses to relocate his work stuff and park his cars in his garage
instead. Oh well, it's his money I guess.
