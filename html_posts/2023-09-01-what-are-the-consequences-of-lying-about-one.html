Well, since you don't put your income on a W-4, you don't really need to
worry about it.

What you ***do*** put on it is the number of *exemptions* you have, so
that your employer can calculate how much of your salary to withhold for
taxes. Your company then pays your *estimated* income tax on your
behalf, right out of your paycheck.

Then, at the end of the year, you do an IRS form 1040, wherein you
calculate your *actual* taxes due, taking into account everything you
earned, all of your exemptions, and all of your deductions and credits.

- If the amount your company withheld is more than your actual taxes
  due, you get a refund.
- If the amount your company withheld is less than your actual taxes
  due, you owe the difference.

Putting exemptions on your W-4 to which you are not entitled simply
means you end up owing tax at the end of the year rather than getting
that sweet, sweet refund check.

But if you withhold ***too much***, then you don't get enough of your
paycheck throughout the year. Sure, you get a massive refund check, but
you could have used that money throughout the year.

So it's only to your benefit that you do your W-4 correctly, and set
your withholdings right.
