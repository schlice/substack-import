**Is being free from gun violence a human right? Why do so many US
citizens still support their government given the violation of human
rights?**

So it's clear from your question that you're targeting the US, so I will
frame my answer squarely around the US. Other countries treat this issue
differently.

Here in the US, our rights are defined by the Constitution, not the UN
or any other declaration of rights outside of the Bill of Rights.
Therefore, the only recognized "human rights" you are afforded in the
United States are defined in our Governing Documents, the Declaration of
Independence and the Constitution.

**In the United States, you do not have the right to be free from
harm.**

There is a right to life, which begs the responsibility upon others not
to unlawfully take your life from you, but there is no "right" to be
free from harm.

But if that's the case, you're asking right now, how does that square
with the right for people to own weapons which are specifically designed
to take life? The answer to that question is very simple: **there are
some situations in which it is legally permissible to take a life.**

If you have the right to life, and no one has the right to unlawfully
take that life from you, you have the concomitant right to defend your
life from anyone who might attempt to do so. Remember that the laws and
regulations in the United States are based on personal accountability
and personal responsibility, so no one else but you is responsible for
your safety unless prior arrangements have been made.

Therefore, if you have the right to defend your life against someone who
might attempt to unlawfully take it from you, you must be allowed to use
equal force to the force that is being presented to you. If this is
true, then you have the right to use any amount of force necessary, up
to and including deadly force, to defend your life.

At this point (I have the right to use deadly force to defend my life),
what difference does it make which tool I use to defend my life? The gun
is arguably the tool that will cause the least amount of collateral
damage if employed correctly. The correct employment of a firearm is why
carry permits generally require some level of training before they are
issued. The gun is very directed and targeted, unlike a bomb or a
grenade, which are very indiscriminate. The gun is the most effective
tool to use to stop someone from doing what they are intending to do. No
other self-defense tool is as guaranteed to stop a threat to your life
as the gun.

Additionally, the gun is "the great equalizer." It levels the playing
field: it puts the octogenarian on par with the 250-pound mugger. It
puts the solo homosexual on par with the car full of drunk college kids
with baseball bats. And it puts the single woman alone at night on par
with the male attacker lurking in the shadows. Only the gun can do this;
no other self-defense tool can do this.

If we are to be truly free, then we must be allowed to defend ourselves
from any threat. No one should have the right to tell us what threats
from which we are permitted to defend. Clearly, this means that on some
rare occasions (and it is rare, despite the wall-to-wall media
coverage), some whack-a-doodle with a gun will go shoot up a church. Is
this an acceptable risk? For freedom to exist, **these risks must be
acceptable.**
