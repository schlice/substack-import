**Under what \"international law\" is the US government constitutionally
obligated to accommodate aliens and allow them to apply for asylum?**

That would be **none**.

A sovereign nation is under no obligation to allow anyone to enter its
borders, let alone become citizens.

A sovereign nation gets to determine, on its own, what its rules are for
visitors, temporary workers, permanent resident aliens, and
naturalization.

There is no "international law" that binds any sovereign nation to do
anything under threat of some legal action.

The United States, specifically, is not under any Constitutional
obligation to follow anyone's rules but our own. If you can find a
reference in the Constitution that binds us to someone else's rules, I'm
willing to read that reference.
