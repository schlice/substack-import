**Content:** [We don\'t call them \"APBs\" (All-Points Bulletin) any
more. These days, we release a **BOLO** (Be On the LookOut). BOLOs are
distributed verbally during shift change, and also distributed
electronically when the technology allows it. Officers are then required
to \"be on the lookout\" for the suspect person, vehicle, stolen item,
etc. Nearly every organization has them, and you may even receive BOLOs
from neighboring agencies if their search parameters spread wide
enough.\
\
BOLOs are general orders to look out for specific things. When the
search area becomes more concentrated, and dedicated resources are
tasked to a search, your BOLO turns into a
**manhunt.**]{.rendered_qtext}
