*(US Answer Only)*

It is not a criminal offense to talk about breaking the law. You can
even tell other people to go break the law. You can tell people to steal
and take bribes. That's all protected First Amendment speech.

Specifically, answering your question, saying corruption is fine and
calling upon public officials to steal and take bribes is not criminal

What you *cannot* do is **incite violence**, which is speech which is
**reasonably expected** to produce **imminent**, **lawless** action.
Criminal incitement refers to conduct, words, or other means that **urge
or naturally lead others to riot, violence, or insurrection**.

The law draws a clear distinction between *advocacy* and *incitement*.
