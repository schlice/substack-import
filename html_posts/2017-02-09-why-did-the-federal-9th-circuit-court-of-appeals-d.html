The only thing decided today was that the ban should remain in place
while a federal district court continues to review the legality of the
ban.

The government argued for a stay of that ban. The 9th Circuit did not
grant that stay.

"We hold that the Government has not shown a likelihood of success on
the merits of its appeal, nor has it shown that failure to enter a stay
would cause irreparable injury," the 3-judge panel stated today.

It is unknown whether or not the SCOTUS will review the issue. They
don't like deadlocking, so they may not even grant certiorari.
