You will find that in the United States, anyone can be sued for
anything. Very few lawsuits are *prohibited*.

But what you will also find in most HOAs is that Board members are
covered by insurance. It is commonly referred to as **D&O insurance**
(Director and Officer insurance).

D&O insurance reimburses the defense costs incurred by board members,
managers, and employees in defending against claims made by homeowners
or other third parties for alleged wrongdoing. D&O insurance also covers
**monetary damages, settlements, and awards resulting from such
claims**.

So while you can sue and potentially end up with a settlement, it won't
affect the former Board member financially. Their D&O insurance still
covers them after they leave the Board, so long as they were covered
during the period of time when the mismanagement was alleged to have
occurred. This is important because many lawsuits are filed long after
the Board member has left the Board.
