**Content:** [You learn the ability to \"switch it on\" and \"switch it
off.\"\
\
I did some television broadcasting in high school and in college. It
always amazed me that people would be caught saying inappropriate things
in front of the camera. We were always taught that you have to be able
to \"switch it off\" when you sat in front of the camera, and \"switch
it on\" when you get up from the table and your lavalier mic was
removed. I learned this ability at a young age; when I sit down in front
of the camera, a totally different person emerges, and the silliness is
still there, but I\'ve \"switched it off,\" and I never breathe a word
of it.\
\
When the show is over, and I stand up from the table, I can literally
bust out laughing at something that happened 20 minutes earlier, but I
couldn\'t express.\
\
The same holds true when you work at a big corporation and deal with V
and C level executives all the time. When you\'re in that situation, you
have to be able to \"switch it off\" and become your truly professional
self. Then when the coast is clear, and you\'re with your colleagues
again, you can \"switch it on\" and be your good-natured self.\
\
Acting, television, and Customer Service. It\'s all the
same.]{.rendered_qtext}
