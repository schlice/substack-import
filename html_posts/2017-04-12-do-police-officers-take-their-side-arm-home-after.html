All of my colleagues answering here are correct...for city, state, and
local police departments.

The only major exception is **military police**. Military police are not
issued take-home weapons, even though they are covered by the Law
Enforcement Officer Safety Act (LEOSA). If they wanted to carry
off-duty, they would need to do so with their own personal weapons.

Military police are issued a "weapons card" after training (I used to
keep mine in my holster when it was empty). At the beginning of the
shift, when everyone is suiting up, they'd line up at the armory window,
hand over the weapons card (which displays what weapons the officer is
qualified to carry), and the card will go in the slot from which a duty
weapon is removed and handed back out the window to the officer. He is
then provided with ammunition in an appropriate number of magazines,
which go into the weapon and the duty belt.

The weapon is taken to the **clearing barrel** which is essentially a
55-gallon drum full of sand resting in a wooden stand (or built into a
wall or a door) at a 45-degree angle. The muzzle of the weapon is
inserted into the clearing barrel, the magazine is inserted, the slide
is released chambering a round, and the safety is turned off. The weapon
is then holstered, ready for duty. The process is repeated in reverse at
the end of the shift. The process is monitored by a **clearing barrel
official**, or CBO. Unsafe loading is noted, dangerous practices are
stopped.
