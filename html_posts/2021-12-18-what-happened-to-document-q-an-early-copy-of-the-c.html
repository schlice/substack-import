The "Q Source" (or the Q Document or the Document of Q) is part of the
"two-source hypothesis" which has been debated but never proven
regarding the Gospels of Matthew and Luke.

You can see in the graphic how the Gospels of Matthew and Luke both use
elements of the Q Source, along with two other sources, called the [[M
Source](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=692cc0&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M_source){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"

Source](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=02f050&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L_source){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}, represented by green and
teal respectively.

But for as many arguments as exist for the existence of a Q Source,
there exist just as many *against* the idea of a Q Source:

So at best, the Q Source is a *hypothesis* to explain how the two
Gospels are so closely related at some points. At worst, it's just a
misunderstanding of what came first and who knew whom.

So to answer the question: *what happened to the Q Source?* Only God
knows, since we aren't even entirely sure that it *exists at all.*

Original question:

What happened to Document Q, an early copy of the Christian scriptures?
Like early Greek texts verify, embellishments such as the Johannine
Comma (included to support the Trinity) would have become readily
apparent.
