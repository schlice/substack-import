**Is it lawful for your workplace to secretly record you?**

For the most part, yes. However, for precision, we must clarify what
kind of recording you are talking about, and what is being recorded.

If you're in an office owned (or leased) by the company, you can be
subject to video recording anywhere in that office space, except in
areas in which there is an expectation of privacy (i.e. bathrooms,
locker rooms, private offices, etc). The company has a right to protect
its resources, and video surveillance is a part of that. Audio recording
along with the video is not permitted.

All of your electronic communications can be monitored. This includes
telephone and Internet. If you are using the company's resources, they
can monitor those resources for appropriate use and to watch for
violations of policy which might harm the company.

In nearly all states, the company does NOT need to post a notice that
you may be under video surveillance while inside their facility. They
also do not need to post a login banner which states that your sessions
using their Internet connections may also be monitored (but most do). So
long as their End User Agreement states it (which you signed when you
got a login to their system, or when you hired on with the company),
that is all the notice that is required.
