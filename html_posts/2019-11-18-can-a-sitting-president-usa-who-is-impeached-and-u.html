**Can a sitting US president be re- elected while impeachment
proceedings are in place?**

Yes.

In order for the president to not be able to be re-elected, he must be:

- impeached by the House upon passing Articles of Impeachment, and
- removed from office by the Senate trial.

During the Senate trial, they will vote separately on two items:

- Removal from office, which requires a supermajority of Senators (67)
  to pass
- If he is convicted on the first count, they then vote on
  disqualification to "hold and enjoy any office of honor, trust or
  profit under the United States" which requires a simple majority of
  Senators (51) to pass.

The Senate must remove the President from office and then vote to
disqualify him from future office in order to prevent him from being
re-elected.
