In any corporation, while there is a fiduciary responsibility to do
what's best for the corporation, there is no liability if you do your
job, but just do it poorly. This holds true for the smallest HOA Board
of Directors all the way up to the President of the United States.

Liability attaches if you *intentionally* or *unintentionally fail to do
your job as it is written.*

But if you do your job and it doesn't turn out as you planned, or even
if you did your job but you made poor decisions, that doesn't rise to
the level of legal liability, unless your conduct was so egregious such
that a reasonable person in the same situation would never have made the
decisions you did.

In almost every case, Board members on HOA Boards are covered by
Director and Officer (D&O) insurance, providing liability coverage when
you do your job but legal actions are raised against you.
