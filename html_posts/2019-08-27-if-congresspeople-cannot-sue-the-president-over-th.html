**If congresspeople cannot sue the President over the emoluments clause,
who can?**

Congress cannot *sue* the President if he violates the Constitution.
Violating the Constitution (or any of its provisions) would be grounds
for *impeachment* and removal from office.

In order to impeach the President, Congress must *prove* that he
violated the Constitution. As of today, Congress has not done this.
