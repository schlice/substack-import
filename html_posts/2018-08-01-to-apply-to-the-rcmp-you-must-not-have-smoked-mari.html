**To apply to the RCMP you must not have smoked marijuana in the last
year, but once it becomes legal what will happen to this rule? Will it
instantly be removed or will it take time once it is legal for police
forces to change their guidelines?**

*(Please note, I am a US citizen, so this may not apply directly to
Canada. I'm going to comment generally; legally-speaking, Canadian law
and its application may be different than what I know)*

Just because something is *legal* doesn't mean an employer has to allow
it. For example, it's legal to consume alcohol, but an employer doesn't
have to let you be drunk on the job. It's legal to have sex...yeah, you
get the picture.

An employer can still require their employees to be drug-free, even if
the drug is a legal one, if job requirements dictate that someone be
free from drugs.

Part of the problem in law enforcement is that there are as-of-yet
unknown side effects to marijuana usage, such as how it affects
judgement and long-term memory. You can make an argument in court that
an officer's judgment may have been impaired due to the fact that there
was marijuana in his system from months before, and therefore his arrest
should be thrown out. And what if that officer is involved in a deadly
force incident? The department could face tremendous liability if the
officer was found to have possibly been impaired in ways in which we do
not yet know about.

Since the police simply cannot risk the unknown, it is quite possible
that the rule regarding marijuana usage remains intact.
