**Do I have the right to demand that a person wear their mask correctly
and not just wear it under their nose?**

No.

Even if it is illegal for someone to not wear their mask correctly, you
have no right to demand that another person wear their mask correctly.
The reason is because **you have no right to be free from risk.** You do
not have the right to be free of the potential of someone in society
infecting you (where you are not affirmatively engaged with them), even
if they know they are positive.

There are plenty of illegal things that people do, and even if they do,
you have no **right** to demand that they follow the law, even if it
affirmatively makes you safer. Unless you can show that their actions
**directly** impact your ability to exercise your own rights (not
potentially, but actually), you cannot demand that someone else follow
the law. What you can do is notify law enforcement of a violation of
law.

Additionally, while it may be a very small corner case, a person may
have a particular disability which does not allow them to wear the mask
correctly, or wear a mask at all. For some people, wearing a mask may
exacerbate an existing medical condition. The CDC lists some examples of
people in this group:

> - Individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing---or those who care for
>   or interact with a person who is hearing impaired---may be unable to
>   wear cloth face coverings if they rely on lipreading to communicate.
>   In this situation, consider using a clear face covering. If a clear
>   face covering isn't available, consider whether you can use written
>   communication, use closed captioning, or decrease background noise
>   to make communication possible while wearing a cloth face covering
>   that blocks your lips.
> - Some individuals with developmental disabilities, sensory
>   integration concerns or tactile sensitivities, certain mental health
>   conditions, or limited cognitive ability may have a negative
>   reaction to wearing a cloth face covering. These individuals may
>   consult with their healthcare provider as part of the decision to
>   wear a cloth face covering.
> - Younger children (e.g., preschool or early elementary aged) may be
>   unable to wear a cloth face covering properly, particularly for an
>   extended period of time. Wearing of cloth face coverings may be
>   prioritized at times when it is difficult to maintain a distance of
>   6 feet from others (e.g., during carpool drop off or pick up, or
>   when standing in line at school). Ensuring proper cloth face
>   covering size and fit and providing children with frequent reminders
>   and education on the importance and proper wear of cloth face
>   coverings may help address these issues.
> - Individuals should not wear cloth face coverings while engaged in
>   activities that may cause the cloth face covering to become wet,
>   like when swimming at the beach or pool. A wet cloth face covering
>   may make it difficult to breathe. For activities like swimming, it
>   is particularly important to maintain physical distance from others
>   when in the water.
> - Individuals who are engaged in high intensity activities, like
>   running, may not be able to wear a cloth face covering if it causes
>   difficulty breathing. If unable to wear a cloth face covering,
>   consider conducting the activity in a location with greater
>   ventilation and air exchange (for instance, outdoors versus indoors)
>   and where it is possible to maintain physical distance from others.
> - Individuals who work in a setting where cloth face coverings may
>   increase the risk of heat-related illness or cause safety concerns
>   due to introduction of a hazard (for instance, straps getting caught
>   in machinery) may consult with an occupational safety and health
>   professional to determine the appropriate face covering for their
>   setting. Outdoor workers may prioritize use of cloth face coverings
>   when in close contact with other people, like during group travel or
>   shift meetings, and remove face coverings when social distancing is
>   possible. [\[1\]](#DbNsk){#cite-DbNsk .citation_link}

Masks are "defense-in-depth." Having everyone wear one increases the
potential of you catching your own droplets before they get out, and you
blocking droplets expelled by others. Having multiple layers of defense
helps to protect you. But even the failure or the loss of one of these
layers, while slightly increasing your risk, does not ameliorate the
effectiveness of your own mask. It is the same concept as "herd
immunity;" even if one person is infected and is spreading droplets, the
preponderance of masks should catch any airborne droplets.

Additionally, just as important as masks is social distancing. Avoiding
people not wearing masks like the plague (pun intended) is definitely
best practice. Six feet should be just the start for those people. If
enough people start keeping a wide berth around people without masks, it
might convince them that wearing a mask is better than being a societal
pariah.

Most importantly, if it is illegal to not wear a mask correctly in your
area, notify the management (if you're in a facility), or the police (if
you are not).
