**Content:** [You don\'t have a reasonable expectation of privacy when
you use BitTorrent. Your traffic is not encrypted. You are essentially
using the public Internet. Whether or not someone has the right to
monitor a particular network depends on the ownership of that portion of
the network (i.e. your ISP can watch your usage of their system to
ensure you are not violating their terms of service).\
\
If you are using TOR, that might be a different story. If you\'re using
a VPN, it\'s a different story altogether. But just using a particular
protocol doesn\'t give you a reasonable expectation of
privacy.]{.rendered_qtext}
