***Can human rights be licensed?***

**Most assuredly not.**

You cannot be forced to register before you are able to exercise a human
right. If you have a right because you are human (the definition of a
human right), you need not *do* anything in order to exercise that
right. That right is always afforded to you simply because you are
human. No special process needs to take place before you can exercise
that right.

*However,* the State has a responsibility to ensure the safety of its
people. It may *limit* or *reasonably* *restrict* the exercising of that
right if doing so impinges upon the rights of others (which is called a
*compelling state interest*), so long as the restriction is done in the
least restrictive way to accomplish the state interest.
