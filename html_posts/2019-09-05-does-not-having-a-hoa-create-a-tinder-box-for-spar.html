**Does not having a HOA create a Tinder box for sparking off the mass
devaluation of real estate in a neighborhood, due to homeowners with bad
taste, bad etiquette, poor upkeep habits, etc?**

A tinderbox? You mean like where one person starts bad habits and then
the whole neighborhood catches on?

No.

Because *most* people have **pride of ownership**. Most people will take
pride in the home that they own, and they'll take care of it.

But there are always those who don't. They don't care about the upkeep
of the exterior of their home, and they don't care that their ugly
exterior negatively impacts your property value. And it is abundantly
clear that home values are lower in ugly neighborhoods, where there is a
choice in neighborhoods.

Sure, you can go to Code Enforcement to try to get him back in line, but
then it's him vs you. He'll hate you and blame you for every dime in
fines that Code Enforcement levies on him. Does it work? Most of the
time. *But at what cost?*

In an HOA-controlled neighborhood, ***everyone voluntarily joined the
HOA.*** *But that's not true! Some people didn't want the HOA!* They may
not have wanted it, but they still voluntarily joined it **by purchasing
a home in an HOA-controlled neighborhood**. They signed on the dotted
line, being of sound mind and fully in control of their faculties. They
actively joined the HOA, and in doing so, agreed to follow the
collective rules in order to maintain everyone's home values. Then, if
they choose to violate the rules, it's the HOA that takes action against
them, not the individual homeowner. And the HOA can go so far as to
place a lien on their home for failing to pay their fines, and then
foreclose on that lien. The HOA can remove the violator from the
neighborhood. Can Code Enforcement do that?

Let's be clear: HOAs are voluntarily joined, and the HOA can foreclose
on your house if you don't participate. Without the HOA, it's you versus
your non-caring neighbor, and no amount of visitations by Code
Enforcement will make them care more.
