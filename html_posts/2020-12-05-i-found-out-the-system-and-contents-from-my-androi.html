**I found out the system and contents from my Android device has been
cloned by someone of malicious intend and spread to several others. How
do I stop that and regain my privacy? Will the factory reset reverse the
clone? Any practical tips?**

First, I find the premise of this question highly unlikely, unless you
have rooted your own Android device, or the person works for your
carrier and has access to carrier-specific hardware technical support
tools.

Modern versions of Android are protected from "cloning" by anyone. The
operating system and the applications reside in protected memory space.
They cannot be directly accessed, unless you have gained "root"
privilege (the superuser). On a non-rooted system, the root user is
inaccessible, and thus so is the data in those protected memory areas.
This means that the data within your apps is not accessible from outside
of your apps, unless you intentionally exported that data.

It is possible that your personal data storage was accessed. This would
be your downloads folder, your documents, your pictures, any media files
you may have uploaded, and any files you may have saved while browsing
the Internet. This is a crime, and should be reported to the police if
you have evidence of this.

If you have rooted your phone, a factory reset *may* reverse the root.
Some root tools install themselves in the boot partition, and can
"re-root" the device upon factory reset. If you used one of these tools,
you may have to uninstall it first before factory resetting your device
to ensure that it will not be rooted again upon wipe and reset.

For most normal cases in which you have not rooted your device, a
factory reset will restore the configuration to a default state.
