I have to agree with Rosendale and Perkins on this one. The government
is funded. No one's losing sleep over this. Sure, some government
functions are paused at the moment, but it's nothing amounting to a
crisis.

The media turns whatever it can get away with into a crisis because that
brings them eyeballs that pay their salaries. Don't bother with their
hype.

This is, indeed, the time to get this right. These are legitimate
concerns, and they must be addressed.
