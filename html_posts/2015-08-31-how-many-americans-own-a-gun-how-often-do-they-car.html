**Content:** [Since permitting rules vary by state, the percentage of
people in any population that might be armed at any one time similarly
varies by state. But if you want to generalize, in 2014 it is estimated
that there are about 14 million concealed carry permit holders in the
United States. Out of about 300 million people, that means that about
4.6% of people in the United States holds a concealed carry permit. That
means, on average, out of every 100 people, there are 4 or 5 of them who
could be legally armed. There is no telling how many of them are
illegally armed (i.e. armed without a permit).\
\
This assumes a lot of things, such as whether or not concealed handguns
are permitted in the location where you are (law-abiding citizens will
not carry where they are not permitted by law, which implies that in
those areas, only criminals will be armed).\
\
In states with \"shall issue\" permitting guidelines, rates of concealed
carry would be higher.\
\
Also, as a permit holder, I don\'t look at a situation and say, \"should
I carry today,\" I look at a particular day and say, \"is there any
reason that I **shouldn\'t** carry today?\" I have yet to find a day,
unless I\'m travelling by air, that I say no. Even if I go someplace
that I know I can\'t carry in, I will lock my gun in my car. I have a
gun safe in my car so that I can securely lock my handgun inside my car.
They\'re very common and very inexpensive. So I can carry all day, but
then if I have to run into my child\'s school for something, I can lock
my handgun in my car (which is legal in Colorado \-- leaving your gun in
your car on school property).]{.rendered_qtext}
