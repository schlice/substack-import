You have started your question with an unvalidated assertion.

You said, "The Bible describes hell as a place burning with fire and
brimstone." Well, that's *partially* true. The Bible uses *lots* of
descriptors to describe hell.

Let's start with where we get the whole "fire and brimstone"
description. "Fire and brimstone" describes some of what hell is
*like*---but not all of what hell *is*.

In actuality, the word the Bible uses which is related to "fire and
brimstone" is *Gehenna*, and you might be surprised to learn that
*Gehenna is an actual place:* the valley of Gehenna adjacent to
Jerusalem on the south. The things that went on in Gehenna
were...unorthodox. Babies were sacrificed to the pagan god Molech in
that valley (see 2 Kings 16:3; 2 Chronicles 33:6; Jeremiah 32:35). How
were they sacrificed, you might ask? **Immolation**. In other words,
*they were burned alive.* If you were to ask someone of Jesus' day about
Gehenna, they'd instantly know that unholy things were taking place
there, and it was quite adjacent to "fire" and "brimstone." Basically,
"Gehenna" was related to uncleanliness, demonic activity, and evil
rituals---a fitting metaphor for hell.

Jesus also talks directly about burning fire during His Sermon on the
Mount:

> And if your hand causes you to sin, cut it off. It is better for you
> to enter life crippled than with two hands to go to hell, to the
> unquenchable fire. \-- Mark 9:43 ESV

Was Jesus advocating for self-mutilation? Hardly. But in comparing
self-mutilation to going to the unquenchable fire, Jesus is saying that
we should literally be doing whatever we can (including self-mutilation)
to avoid going to hell, because hell is worse than losing a hand. So how
do we know that Jesus isn't referring to hell as a fiery place? Because
like we said, Jesus isn't advocating for self-mutilation. If the first
part of that sentence is admittedly hyperbolic, we can assume that the
second part (unquenchable fire) is also hyperbolic.

In addition, "unquenchable fire" is not the only description the Bible
uses for hell. The Bible also describes hell as a bottomless pit or
abyss (Revelation 20:3), a lake (Revelation 20:14), darkness (Matthew
25:30), death (Revelation 2:11), destruction (2 Thessalonians 1:9),
everlasting torment (Revelation 20:10), a place of wailing and gnashing
of teeth (Matthew 25:30), and a place of graduated punishment (Matthew
11:20-24; Luke 12:47-48; Revelation 20:12-13). The wide variety of
hell's descriptions seems to indicate that there is no one description
that the Bible uses as **the one** description of hell.

But just because we don't have a singular description of hell doesn't
diminish how bad hell is. In fact, the wide variety of descriptions
should *amplify* the fear of hell, not *lessen* it. Hell is *worse than
we can even describe*. Hell is a place of more tears and more anguish
than any one description could ever portray.

Basically, the multiple descriptions of hell describe a place which is
beyond our language to even explain, and a place far worse than we even
have the capacity to imagine.
