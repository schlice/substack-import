**Content:** [Seek professional help.\
\
It\'s not a bad thing to say \"I need help coping with this. I need help
processing this.\"\
\
It doesn\'t make you \"mentally ill\" to seek the advice of a
professional therapist to discuss your issues. I know there are lots of
stigmas surrounding psychology, but these people are professionals. They
can help you cope with it and move on with your life, which frankly you
should have done by now, which makes it all the more critical that you
seek professional help, the sooner the better.\
\
Seeking advice on Quora also doesn\'t count as professional medical
advice.]{.rendered_qtext}
