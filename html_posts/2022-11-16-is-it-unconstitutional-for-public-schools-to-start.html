No it is not.

The Constitution does not forbid schools from beginning their day with
prayer, so long as the prayer cannot be construed as the state
*establishing* a state religion, which would violate the 1st Amendment.

***THAT SAID...***

In practice, splitting that baby is too difficult to do, and there is
strong reason to believe that *prayer* is not ideal in a public school
which can host students of all faiths (or no faith at all).

Instead, if schools start their day with a moment of silence (during
which students of faith may pray in their own prescribed manner, or
students of no faith may contemplate whatever they choose), this would
allow for "prayer time" for those who choose to pray, without unduly
"imposing" religion on the non-religious, and not unconstitutionally
establishing a state religion.
