**Should a depressed, but not at all suicidal person be allowed to
practice their 2nd Amendment rights?**

The short answer is yes. The longer answer is yes also, but the short
answer is yes.

There is a list of things that can cause you to lose your access to
firearms:

- Conviction of a violent felony. It's any felony in some states, but a
  violent felony will cause you to lose your firearms in almost all
  states.
- Being declared a mental incompetent
- Being declared a known terrorist
- Transporting weapons across state lines
- Dishonorable discharge from the military

There are a few others, but I can't remember them off the top of my
head.

Depression is not on that list. Unless depression causes you to lose
your grip on reality, in which case you could be declared a mental
incompetent.
