If it is legal to end your life, then it is legal to help someone end
their life. There should be no reason that you can\'t help someone do
something perfectly legal, right?

And unfortunately, **helping someone end their life is only a few forged
signatures away from murder.**

Oh, but you could make the person record their consent on video! That
can\'t be faked, right?

Really? Have you even seen AI these days?

Even physician assisted suicide can be weaponized against a person.
Especially today, money trumps ethics.

So unfortunately, if it is unlawful for you to take someone else\'s
life, it must also be unlawful for you to take your own life.
