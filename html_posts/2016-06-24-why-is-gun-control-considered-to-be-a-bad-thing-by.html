I'm going to take you at your word and believe that you are truly
uninformed about guns.

If you truly believe everything you said (and I quoted), you have been
so disillusioned by the media and by the looney liberals in Congress
that I feel sorry for you. *Now I start to wonder, how many more people
actually believe that there are no background checks? How many more
people believe that certain political groups don't ever want background
checks? How much has the education system in this country totally failed
people?*

Now, for your edification (and some stuff that's probably going to
totally blow your mind), I present for you **the unedited facts:**

- Firearm sales in the United States **all** get background checks. The
  only exceptions to this are *private party sales or transfers* (i.e. I
  sell a gun to my neighbor, or I gift a gun to my grandson). In most
  states, no background check is required for in-state, private party
  sales or transfers. But if you're a gun dealer (at a gun store, at a
  gun show, etc), every time a gun is purchased, a background check is
  performed.
- The reason that background checks (or any lack of the same) has *no
  relation to the Orlando shooting* is that the shooter **passed every
  background check he was subjected to.** The shooter's guns were
  legally purchased, and every time he was checked, he passed. He worked
  in an occupation where he regularly used guns, so he was, at worst, a
  decent enough shot to pass all of his practical shooting tests.
- Much ado was made of the multiple FBI investigations into his
  background. The FBI investigated and they found no evidence of any
  ties to terrorism. Despite the opinions of the low-information crowd,
  the results do not prove the theory. You can't go back and look at the
  FBI investigations and conclude that they screwed up simply because he
  turned out to be a mass killer. He either wasn't fully radicalized at
  that point, or maybe he was just really, really good (at being bad)
  and the FBI needs to get better. I doubt very highly it's the latter.
- Despite what the media has told you, **the gun does not give someone
  the ability to hold a life in their hands.** It makes it ***easier***
  to kill you. It doesn't make it ***possible***. Remember Timothy
  McVeigh killed over 180 people and injured over 600 more with an ANFO
  (ammonium nitrate / fuel oil) bomb he built and loaded into a Ryder
  truck. Nineteen people killed over 3000 Americans and injured over
  6000 more with box cutters and commercial airplanes. Again, the gun
  doesn't make it possible to kill. It makes it easier to discriminately
  kill (that means, select a single target and kill it) instead of
  killing indiscriminately, like bombs do. Guns or not, people are still
  going to kill. Again, despite the lies spewed from the cesspool of
  mass media, in every country where guns were banned, people still
  killed other people, at about the same rate. They didn't use guns as
  much, but they still killed. People still died. If somehow America had
  banned guns, you would have heard about the Orlando nightclub
  ***bomber***, not the Orlando nightclub ***shooter***. And we would
  have far more people dead. Be thankful that he only used a gun. If it
  was a bomb, we'd be walking around the site of the former Pulse
  nightclub (now a smoking hole in the ground), picking up body parts to
  try to identify later.
- If someone is truly a "crazy," as you say, then a court can rule that
  person a "mental defective" and they cannot legally purchase guns. The
  question is, at what point does a court rule someone a "mental
  defective"? Was the Orlando nightclub shooter bat-shit crazy? Indeed
  he was. But was it bad enough to be ruled "mentally defective?" No,
  probably not. This is where the disconnect lies. We have to figure out
  how to help these people who are clearly insane, but are still sane
  enough to exist in everyday life. Currently, they live outside the
  reach of traditional methods of helping them, because of a Democrat
  initiative called *deinstitutionalization.* This change in mental
  health laws which took place in the 70â€²s makes it **much** more
  difficult to get someone committed to a mental institution, and the
  bar that the court must meet before a person can be labeled a "mental
  defective" or be committed to a mental hospital is very high. So
  because we have determined that most people with mental health issues
  can be helped without involuntary hospitalization, many people who
  should be helped simply refuse help (mostly fueled by their own mental
  disease) and continue to roam the streets, buy guns, and shoot up gay
  nightclubs.

Please let me know if you still don't understand.
