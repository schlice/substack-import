There is no **law** which says that if you're being audited, you can't
release your tax statements.

That said, I think it's a stupid tradition.

We teach our kids that your financial information is private. So just
because you're running for President, suddenly your tax returns are fair
game?

We don't demand this from ***any other elected official anywhere in the
government***. Why do we demand this of presidents?

To be clear, he was told by his lawyer to not release his tax documents.
That's not because it's illegal. It's because it could hamper whatever
investigation is ongoing that his lawyers are handling. His lawyers told
him not to do it. If my lawyer told me not to do it (and they advise me
on legal matters), I wouldn't do it either, even if I was running for
president.
