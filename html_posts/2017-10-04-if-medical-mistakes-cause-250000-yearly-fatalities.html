title: "If medical mistakes cause 250,000 yearly fatalities (Johns Hopkins estimate), why is that largely absent from public discourse? Gun control, with 34,000 yearly fatalities, seems to get all the attention."

The two are unrelated other than in the context of this question, that
they both cause death. The reason they are not equated is because their
**end** **goals** are different. Doctors exist to *save life* while guns
exist, and are specifically designed, to *take life*.

That's not a bad thing (that guns are designed to kill), so long as
there are rational, reasonable situations in which taking life is
acceptable. Because there are such situations in which taking life is
not only legal, but appropriate and acceptable, the tool used to do so
does not make a difference. In fact, it is safer and easier in such
situations to use the most efficient and accurate tool available to do
so.
