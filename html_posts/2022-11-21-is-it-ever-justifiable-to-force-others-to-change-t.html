No, but it may be justifiable to force someone to not impose their
beliefs on others.

For example, I may truly believe that Italians are demon-spawns, and no
one is ever justified in forcing me to change my belief. But if I want
to live out my belief that I am a demon-hunter and I am thus going to
kill anyone of Italian descent, you can be absolutely justified in
forcing me to not impose that belief on anyone. (by the way, I'm picking
on Italians in my example because I'm Italian, and it's just an example;
I don't believe Italians are demon-spawns).

It's also perfectly justifiable to try to *convince* someone to change
their own beliefs, if you can do so without *compelling* them. This is
exactly what God does: he tries to *convince* you that believing in Him
is a great way to go, but without *compelling* you to do so. You are
still free to love Him or reject Him as you choose.

Ultimately, there are only two ways to interact with people: reason and
force. You can either *convince* me to do something through reason, or
you can *compel* me to do something through force. It is never
justifiable to compel me to change my beliefs through force.
