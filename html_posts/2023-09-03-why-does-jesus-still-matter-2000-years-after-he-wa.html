Because Jesus died once for all, and because we still need Him.

Jesus didn't die once for the people in Jerusalem around 33 AD. He
didn't die for only the people who came before HIm. He died once, for
ALL. That's EVERYONE who has ever lived and ever will live. Jesus'
sacrifice is sufficient for everyone.

And unless you've been asleep at the switch all these years, people
still need Him. They still need His salvation. They still need His
grace. They still need His comfort and His aid, as only He can provide.

And since He is the ***ONLY*** way into Heaven, He will continue to
matter until the end of the age.
