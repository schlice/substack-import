An unfortunate mistranslation in the King James Bible translated the
word *ratsatch* as "kill." The Hebrew word *ratsatch* however actually
means "murder."

There are plenty of examples of killing in the Bible. God even does it.
Heck, he killed the whole world once, except for some people and animals
in a big boat.

God commands us not to murder, which means killing without
justification.

Original question:

God commands us not to kill, does that include insects and animals? Or
just people?
