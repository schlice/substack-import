First of all, it's very very unlikely that any clerk leaked the
decision. Clerkships in the Supreme Court are the "feather in your cap"
that essentially allows you to write your own ticket. If you clerk for a
SCOTUS Justice, you are the best of the best. A breach of trust like
this will ***instantly sink your career***. You will be disbarred, and
you'll never work in law again. Clerking at SCOTUS is a privilege that
the 36 people who have that job do not take lightly.

But if we were to entertain the hypothetical that a clerk leaked the
decision, then it is even more highly unlikely that a conservative clerk
did it. Chief Justice Roberts hit the nail on the head when he said that
the leak was most likely an attempt to increase public pressure to try
to get the Justices to change their votes, and that ain't happening. The
Court is not affected by public pressure. That's why Justices are
appointed for life. So if a clerk leaked it *at all*, it was most likely
one of the progressive clerks.

But if it was a conservative clerk, the reasoning (which is strained to
begin with) might be to trigger the states to enact legislation banning
abortion now that it will no longer be recognized as a Constitutional
right. This was largely unnecessary, as at least 13 states have "trigger
laws" which automatically go into effect should *Roe* be overturned. 10
other states have abortion bans already in their laws, even though those
laws were unenforceable. So if *Roe* is overturned, abortion will
automatically be illegal or restricted in 23 states.

**TL;DR: It's already highly unlikely that any of the 36 clerks leaked
the draft. It's even less likely that it was a conservative clerk.**
