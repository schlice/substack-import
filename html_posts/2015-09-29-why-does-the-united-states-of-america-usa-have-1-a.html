**Content:** [The telephone was invented in the United States by
[[Alexander Graham
Bell](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=53c2e3&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Graham_Bell){.external_link

onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}. The modern-day phone
system started in the United States, and spread to the rest of the
world.\
\
It only makes sense that the country with the largest density of phones
would not need an international calling prefix. *Other* countries would
need one.\
\
More specifically, when international calling was introduced (after the
introduction and popularization of the telephone in America), it was
United States systems that were routing to overseas locations. We needed
country codes to identify other countries.]{.rendered_qtext}
