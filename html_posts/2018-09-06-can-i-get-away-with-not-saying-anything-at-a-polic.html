**Can I get away with not saying anything at a police stop?**

The answer is "it depends."

If you are the driver of a vehicle and a "police stop" means a traffic
stop, you must identify yourself and you must provide your driver's
license, registration, and proof of insurance (if required). You can
refuse to answer any other questions not related to your actions while
driving your car. However, driver's licenses are administrative
documents, and your driving privilege is administered by the state as an
administrative program, so it is not covered by the 5th Amendment. Your
silence can be used as evidence against you, and your license can be
suspended or revoked, using your silence as a piece of evidence. For
example, you can refuse to take the breath test, or you can refuse to
take the field sobriety test, but those actions can cause you to lose
your license. If you refuse the breath test in the police station,
you're almost universally going to automatically lose your license for a
minimum of 6 moths.

If, by "police stop," you mean randomly stopping you on the street, you
still must give your real name. Beyond that, you don't have to answer
any questions at all. Doing so might help to speed you on your way, but
not doing so is not illegal. You also don't have to tell the truth about
anything (except for your name). You can lie all you like. You can
continually ask if you're free to go, until you're either arrested, or
released.
