The First Amendment.

The line between protecting people from cyber harassment and infringing
on free speech rights is very thin and not well defined. Americans are
as passionate about reining in cyber harassment as they are about
protecting their First Amendment rights.

This line is a very difficult one to navigate, and the government is not
the right organization to do it, thanks to the Bill of Rights. In other
words, **the government cannot really do much more to stop cyber
harassment than they are already doing without running afoul of the
First Amendment.**

It is really up to industry to fix this issue, not government.
