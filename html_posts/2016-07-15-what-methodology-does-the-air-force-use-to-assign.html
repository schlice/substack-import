There is a great deal of science behind the structure of AFSCs, but
there is a lot of variability in how you get assigned to a particular
AFSC. For the most part, three facets have to coincide, and the weight
of these factors is different. In order:

- What the member qualifies for
- The needs of the Air Force
- The desires of the member

Every job in the Air Force falls under one of four major aptitude areas:
Mechanical, Administrative, General and Electrical. Each AFSC falls into
one of the four categories and what you qualify for is dictated by your
PULHES and ASVAB scores. PULHES is a numerical score assigned during
in-processing, and determines your (P)hysical, (U)pper Body, (L)ower
Body, (H)earing, (E)yes, and p(S)ychiatric competency. ASVAB is the
Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery test, which is often given to
high school students to help them find employment which matches their
aptitude in the four major aptitude areas, but is also used exclusively
by the military to qualify personnel for AFSCs. Career fields will have
minimum ASVAB requirements as well as PULHES scores required for that
career field. Some jobs, such as Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD)
require minimum scores in two aptitude areas, mechanical and electrical.
3P0\'s (Security Forces) fall under the General Aptitude area.

In some cases, recruiters can guarantee the AFSC you will train into at
the time you enlist. These entries into military service fall under the
Guaranteed Training Enlistment Program, or GTEP. Most career fields are
around 40/60. That means 40% of those jobs are GTEP contracts and 60%
are AI (Aptitude Area) contracts. For example, let's assume that there
are 1000 Fuel Specialist (2F0X1) billets available for Fiscal Year 2016
(FY16). 40 percent of them (or 400 billets) are contracted through GTEP
at the recruiter level; the other 600 billets are assigned during the
second week of basic training. In FY16, Security Forces is 100% GTEP.

If you are not involved in a GTEP contract, your AFSC will be determined
during the second week of basic training. The combination of (in order)
your scores, the needs of the Air Force (i.e. which career fields are
currently the most understaffed) and your wishes will determine what
career field you are assigned to. You may not get the career field you
desire; the needs of the Air Force come first, but if you express a
desire for a particular career field, the Air Force will try to
accommodate you. They want happy people, and if you have a burning
desire to be a Special Missions Aviator, they will try to put you in
that field. If there is availability, and your scores match the
requirements, they can place you there. They will always try to fulfill
your wishes when making assignments, assuming you expressed a desire for
a particular career field. If you have not, they will use your aptitude
and the needs of the Air Force to assign you.
