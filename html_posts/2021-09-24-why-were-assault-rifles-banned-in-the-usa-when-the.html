There is a truth that you may not be aware of:

**Rights are not defined anywhere in the Constitution**.

While we know that you have the freedom of speech, what exactly are you
allowed to say? Are there any restrictions at all on what you can say?
Doesn't the state have the responsibility to provide for the safety of
its citizens? Can't the state regulate the time, place, and manner of
your speech so as to preserve the general welfare of the population? Can
you shout "Fire!" in a crowded theater if there is no fire?

So while there is a right, where that right bumps into other rights is
where we find the sphere of law, both written and case law. The law
defines the limits of the right, and what the state has the ability to
restrict in order for it to meet its obligations to its citizens.

Laws allow my free exercise of my rights to not interfere with your free
exercise of your rights. In other words, *your right to swing your arm
ends at my nose.* They also allow the state to accomplish their stated
mandates, such as preserving the safety of the population.

In this way, you can ask yourself if there is a way to restrict a
specific type of weapon without actually denying you your right to keep
and bear arms.

While you may not necessarily think so, the courts do. The courts said
that you can restrict *a specific type* of weapon, and doing so is not
unconstitutional, and does not deny you the ability to keep and bear
arms. For example, *United States v. Miller* held that the Second
Amendment does not protect your right to own a sawed-off shotgun.
Therefore, we know that certain types of weapons can be restricted.

While we definitely disagree with the government about restricting
"assault weapons," Congress allowed it because it had a built-in
expiration date. The AWB would have to be renewed in ten years, after a
showing that it actually had benefit. Additionally, it didn't make
*ownership* of assault weapons illegal; it just halted sales of *new*
assault weapons.

When ten years had passed, and they saw that the AWB had *no significant
impact on crime rates, or on rates of homicide with a gun* (surprise,
surprise), it was allowed to expire.

Why were assault rifles banned in the USA when the 2nd amendment clearly
states that citizens have the right to bear arms and that right shall
not be infringed?
