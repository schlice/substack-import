**Content:** [Thanks for the A2A. My top five all-time favorite police
duos:\
\
**5. Starsky and Hutch** - from the show that bore their names. No
explanation needed. Classic never-follow-the-rules guys. Totally
tipified that 70\'s mentality people had of the police.\

**4. Poncherello and Baker** - from the second-best 70\'s police show,
*CHiPs*. Erik Estrada and Larry Wilcox will always be best remembered
for this. And what do we remember best? The title sequence, scrolling
through the closeups of the characters on their bikes. Totally cool.\

**3. Benson and Stabler** - The only reason *Law & Order* and *Law &
Order: SVU* isn\'t higher in my list is because it\'s too dramatized for
me. I love it for what it is, but it\'s too \"made-for-TV\" to be higher
in my list. That said, Chris and Mariska play their characters superbly.
And this cast is an insane group of people. You totally got to watch
Ice-T cut his acting chops throughout this series. Seriously, he was
terrible his first few shows (sorry T, I calls \'em like I sees \'em).
And who knew funny man Richard Belzer could play a role like this? He\'s
great. And Dann Florek is a card as well, but he makes a great boss
(I\'d work for him). Awesome cast here.\

**2. Briscoe and Curtis** - Jerry Orbach makes all the difference here.
He (and my #1 pick) are absolutely made for their characters. They play
them so well, it\'s sometimes hard to separate the man from the
character. Lenny Briscoe will forever be the coolest cop. Ever. And Rey
Curtis as his partner was even better than Jesse L. Martin\'s Ed Green,
although he comes in a really close second in my book. This shot of
Bratt, Orbach, Executive ADA Jack McCoy (played by Sam Waterston) and
ADA Jamie Ross (played by Carey Lowell) is one of my all-time favorite
cast line-ups they ever fielded.\

**1. Sipowicz and Simone** - First, I have to say that as a drama, *NYPD
Blue* was, by far, the best police show, ever. Even better than *Hill
Street Blues*, which was right up there (\"Let\'s be careful out there,
people\"). I know it was a dramatization, but they did pull their
content from real cases. I know, because one night while I was watching,
I got a call from my dad, who was excitedly screaming into the phone:
\"That was my case! I worked that case! That was my case!\" And even
though Bobby Simone came on later in the series, he was clearly Andy\'s
best partner. He was good for Andy; he kept him grounded, probably kept
him sane, and saved his life more times than we can count. Dennis Franz
played that role so well, it\'s hard to separate him from it. Just
remove some of the TV dramatization from it, and it really was a pretty
close approximation of squad detectives.\

I should note that *NCIS* is one of my favorite shows, but since it\'s
not a police duo, it doesn\'t make the list. Mark Harmon is just
awesome.
