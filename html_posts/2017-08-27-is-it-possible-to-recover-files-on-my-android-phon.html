You don't need the battery to power the phone...just plug it in. It
should turn on while plugged in.

If you have plugged it in and it still won't turn on, then perhaps you
can get a replacement battery to simply power the unit on to restore
your files. Although I'd be really surprised to find an Android phone
which won't power on just simply being plugged in, dead battery or not.
But you can try replacing the battery.

If the data isn't backed up somewhere and you need access to it that
badly, perhaps you could buy a replacement handset on eBay just for
parts and swap parts in until it starts working. Alternatively, if the
data is that valuable, you can take it to a local repair shop who should
be able to get it running, and the cost would have to be less than the
hassle to recreate the data.
