**Will Colorado Springs become larger than Denver? Why?**

El Paso County (where Colorado Springs is located, along with a few
other small cities like Monument and Falcon) will take over the lead in
population over Denver county (which contains the city of Denver and a
few outlying cities) by 2020. The two counties are expected to trade the
lead until 2035, when El Paso County is expected to take the lead
permanently, and become the largest county in the state by population.
By 2050, El Paso County\'s population is projected to be 1,076,000,
where Denver county is expected to reach 952,000 people.

*Why* this is happening is a question which is still mostly undecided.
The changes in the near term are easily explainable: an increase in
migration (more people moved in than moved out) and natural increases
(more people were born than died).

But why El Paso County is growing faster than Denver county in the
longer term is less easy to pinpoint. We know that spillover from the
Denver area is a factor. People are buying property in Monument and
Falcon and commuting to work up I-25 and Colorado Highway 83 because of
favorable taxes and lower prices relative to the rest of the Front
Range. Also, the area attracts a lot of veterans (with a new VA clinic
consolidating several other smaller clinics in Colorado Springs),
retirees (with three military facilities available for their use,
including healthcare), and young families. Even non-military retirees
are finding conditions favorable in Colorado Springs, with UCHealth
taking over two of the hospitals in the city and bringing them into the
fold of the largest hospital group in the state, significantly improving
(from what I've seen and heard) care at those facilities and making it
easier to get care. And purely anecdotally (no one would dare publish
such a study), it it any wonder that Denver's status as a sanctuary city
and odd policy choices like decriminalizing mushrooms is driving more
citizens and non-drug users away? Not to me.
