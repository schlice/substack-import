**Why is there a ground stop for the US presidential aircraft?**

Because Air Force One does not comply with Air Traffic Control; Air
Traffic Control complies with Air Force One. AF1 goes where it wants,
when it wants, and everyone else gets the hell out of the way. They do
file a flight plan so that ATC can plan around it, but they get everyone
out of AF1's way when it's time for them to fly.

That's why there is a ground hold when AF1 is schedule to take off from
or land at your airfield.
