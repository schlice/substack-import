**How do you feel when people who have handicap tags for a family member
use the designated parking when the handicapped individual isn\'t in the
car?**

It doesn't upset me that people violate the law. We have so many laws in
this country, I'm not completely certain that I don't violate laws that
I'm completely unaware of.

It upsets me when people do this *deliberately*, knowing what the law is
and intentionally violating it. It takes up a spot for someone who
probably truly needs it, and it's just another example of the selfish
"it's-all-about-me" attitude people tend to have these days.

If you are aware of this, you should report it.
