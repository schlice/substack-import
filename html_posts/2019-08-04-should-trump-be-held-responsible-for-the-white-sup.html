**Should Trump be held responsible for the white supremacist massacre in
El Paso, given that the shooter used Trump\'s xenophobic rhetoric in his
online manifesto?**

It\'s common, within the first few weeks of a mass shooting, to point
fingers and try to blame absolutely everyone... except for the shooter
themselves.

And it makes your position even more plausible when you point your
finger at somebody who is already a polarizing figure.

Don\'t fall for it.

The only person to blame here is the shooter, and his sick, twisted
ideology. Any racial ideology which leads to violence is a disease. If
you want to blame anything or anybody, blame white nationalism, and
anyone who would encourage it.

The president is guilty of many things, but he is not someone who
actively espouses violence against anyone. He certainly doesn\'t carry
the blame for any mass shooting, no matter how good it might feel to
attack him for such things.

Focus your anger exactly where it should be focused: on the shooter.
