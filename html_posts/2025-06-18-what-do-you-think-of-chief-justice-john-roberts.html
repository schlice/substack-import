First of all, to correct a little bit of semantics in your question,
"Chief Justice Roberts" did not "rule" anything. The Supreme Court voted
6--3 that the Tennessee law in question did not violate the Equal
Protection Clause of the Constitution. The Chief Justice merely wrote
the opinion of the majority.

The SCOTUS ruling was exceedingly narrow. They did not rule on the
merits of the law itself, only whether the law violated the Equal
Protection Clause. He left the rest to state legislatures.

If you're a Constitutionalist, this is the best result you can hope for
out of a Supreme Court. They literally only decide the Constitutionality
of a law, that's all. The Tennessee law in question prevents medical
providers from delivering puberty blockers and hormones to facilitate a
minor\'s transition to another sex. It also targets healthcare providers
in the state who continue to provide such procedures to gender-dysphoric
minors, opening these providers up to fines, lawsuits and other
liability.

*United States v. Skrmetti* was one of the most closely watched cases of
this term, with potential ripple effects for ongoing legal battles over
transgender rights, including bathroom access and participation in
school sports. The ruling could also serve as a legal pretext in future
cases involving LGBTQ+ protections, including whether sexual orientation
qualifies as a \"protected class\" on par with race or national origin.

\"The Equal Protection Clause does not resolve these disagreements. Nor
does it afford us license to decide them as we see best,\" wrote Chief
Justice Roberts, who wrote the opinion of the majority. \"Our role is
not 'to judge the wisdom, fairness, or logic' of the law before us
\[...\] but only to ensure that it does not violate the equal protection
guarantee of the Fourteenth Amendment. Having concluded it does not, we
leave questions regarding its policy to the people, their elected
representatives, and the democratic process.\"

Also at issue was the *level of scrutiny* that courts should use to
evaluate the constitutionality of state bans on transgender medical
treatment for minors, such as the Tennessee law, and whether these laws
are considered discriminating on the basis of sex or against a
\"quasi-suspect class,\" thus warranting a higher level of scrutiny
under the Equal Protection Clause. SCOTUS today emphatically declared
that these state bans do not violate the Equal Protection clause.

On its face, \[the Tennessee law\] incorporates two classifications: one
based on age (allowing certain medical treatments for adults but not
minors) and another based on medical use (permitting puberty blockers
and hormones for minors to treat certain conditions but not to treat
gender dysphoria, gender identity disorder, or gender incongruence).
Classifications based on age or medical use are subject to only rational
basis review, and do not enjoy heightened scrutiny.

This is a **huge win** for the Constitution. These laws can now be
judged on their merits, and at the state level, with the elected
representatives of those states, without having to fight over whether or
not the law, by its very nature, violates the Constitution.
