<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [So now you know that the seat you are in will have an<br>extra mask for your baby. You also know that the safety card and videos<br>and demos tell you to put your mask on first before assisting others.<br>Certainly sounds selfish, doesn\'t it? Take care of myself before my<br>child? Never!\<br>\<br>In actuality, it\'s a very important piece of trivia which is often<br>glossed over because it doesn\'t happen often. If the aircraft were to<br>depres at altitude, the concentration of oxygen in the air would<br>immediately decrease, so unless you happened to be holding your breath<br>(which would be almost impossible to do), you\'d only have a few seconds<br>before you blacked out. Everyone\'s tolerance for oxygen deprivation is<br>different, so the exact amount of time before you black out is unknown,<br>but it will happen. And you\'re no good to anyone if you black out\<br>\<br>So if you are at altitude and your aircraft depressurizes, please put<br>your own mask on first, then put the mask on your child. Everyone\'s<br>first instinct as a parent is to help their child first, but as I said,<br>you\'re no good to anyone if you\'re unconscious.\<br>\<br>(source: my own personal experience in the altitude<br>chamber)]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
