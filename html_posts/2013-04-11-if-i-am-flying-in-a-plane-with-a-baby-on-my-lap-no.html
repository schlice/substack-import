**Content:** [So now you know that the seat you are in will have an
extra mask for your baby. You also know that the safety card and videos
and demos tell you to put your mask on first before assisting others.
Certainly sounds selfish, doesn\'t it? Take care of myself before my
child? Never!\
\
In actuality, it\'s a very important piece of trivia which is often
glossed over because it doesn\'t happen often. If the aircraft were to
depres at altitude, the concentration of oxygen in the air would
immediately decrease, so unless you happened to be holding your breath
(which would be almost impossible to do), you\'d only have a few seconds
before you blacked out. Everyone\'s tolerance for oxygen deprivation is
different, so the exact amount of time before you black out is unknown,
but it will happen. And you\'re no good to anyone if you black out\
\
So if you are at altitude and your aircraft depressurizes, please put
your own mask on first, then put the mask on your child. Everyone\'s
first instinct as a parent is to help their child first, but as I said,
you\'re no good to anyone if you\'re unconscious.\
