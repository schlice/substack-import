**Content:** [***Can you go to prison for this?*** Generally speaking,
no. Your speech, while hurtful and possibly offensive, is legal. It\'s
protected by the First Amendment. It\'s nothing more than opinions,
since you can\'t really prove any of those things. Depending on how it
was done, it could be considered harassment, but in general, stating
your opinion about someone is legal.\
\
If it was done in a ***threatening*** way, you might be open for issues,
but if you simply stated your opinion in a wholly non-threatening way,
it\'s not likely that you broke any laws.\
\
***Can you be expelled from college?*** Again, generally speaking, no,
you shouldn\'t be expelled from college for speaking your mind, which is
generally protected under the First Amendment. But colleges are not the
law, they are institutions of learning, and they can set their own
standards of conduct. If they find that your speech violated a set
standard of conduct, they can expel you based on their standards. But
that\'s up to the individual college, and not a reflection of law.\
\
***Can you be given a restraining order?*** If a judge finds that there
is a threat or a perception that harm may come to the victim of your
verbal assault, then yes, a restraining order may be granted against
you. But some real or perceived threat would have to be shown in court.
Simply stating your opinion is generally not considered a threatening
statement. Like I said earlier, if you did it in a threatening way, then
that perception of threat could be grounds for a restraining order. The
manner in which the speech was delivered would determine whether or not
a reasonable person might be threatened by that
speech.]{.rendered_qtext}
