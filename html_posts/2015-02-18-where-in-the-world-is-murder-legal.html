**Content:** [State-sanctioned killing is called \"execution\" and is a
punishment handed down through the legal system. Some countries still
have executions; most have gotten rid of executions as a form of
punishment.\
\
There are \"justifiable homicides\" which are common in many places
throughout the world, but that\'s a decision that is made by a court.
There may be killings that are \"allowed\" through religious or cultural
rules in some parts of the world, but again, that\'s a decision reached
through a religious or cultural inquiry.\
\
But as a broad brush statement, murder isn\'t really legal
anywhere.]{.rendered_qtext}
