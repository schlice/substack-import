**What is the reason for the censorship regarding nude swimming in
public schools and public swimming pools in the United States in the
1940\'s to the mid 1960\'s? Why is it such a hush hush thing among the
people who lived back then?**

People in the United States are generally prudish about nudity. This is
why it is "hush hush." People don't like to talk about it because it
violates modern social norms.

However, nude swimming in swimming pools was preferred because at the
time, **swimming in clothes was unsanitary.**

Before modern antiseptic treatments such as chlorine were routinely
used, swimming in clothing caused the buildup of bacteria, and
contamination of the swimming water. Pools had to be frequently drained
and refilled. The American Public Health Administration's guidelines,
all the way through 1962, recommended boys swim in the
nude.[\[1\]](#owENO){#cite-owENO .citation_link}

Girls, on the other hand, were not permitted to swim in schools, both
for modesty and sanitization reasons primarily related to menstruation.

Chlorination, while effective at killing bacteria, was not in widespread
use because at the time, they had difficulty controlling the pH of the
water. The problem was eventually fixed by the mid 1950's:

> Like earlier forms of chlorine sterilizers, these materials function

> When used correctly, the combination of dichloroisocyanurates and
> cyanuric acid stabilizers provides long lasting chlorine, good
> solubility, ease of application, and will not affect the pH of the
> water.[\[2\]](#nRDiO){#cite-nRDiO .citation_link}

Early swimming garments were made of wool, which allowed for bacteria
growth and wreaked havoc on early sand filtration systems, which were
primarily used to filter bacteria. Bathing garments did not become
mainstream until the early 50s and the development and popularization of
fabrics like Lycra and Spandex.[\[3\]](#XfBTz){#cite-XfBTz
.citation_link}

Once good sanitization was available for swimming pool water, the
necessity for nude swimming was obviated, and as gender integration in
public school swimming pools became more widespread and filtration
systems did not suffer ill effects due to modern fabrics in swimming
garments, swimming using bathing suits became the standard.
