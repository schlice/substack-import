**Content:** [Guaranteed delivery doesn\'t exist in email. But there are
other methods.\
\
If snail mail is discontinued, mail delivery to your home will be picked
up by a private company like FedEx. They will have to re-tool some, but
they can do it.\
\
You can send an email/text message asking the prospective juror to visit
a website to confirm the jury duty. You may not get mail at your
physical address, but everyone has a phone, and the vast majority of
them can receive SMS messages.\
\
You can be directed to call a number to verify your jury duty.\
\
The clerk\'s office may call you and leave you a message.\
\
There are lots of creative ways to work around the
problem.]{.rendered_qtext}
