In 19 states, you must have insurance, regardless of how much money you
have.

In 31 states, you can purchase a surety bond in lieu of insurance, which
pays out up to its face value if you are at fault in an accident. The
amount of the bond you need to carry varies by state. If the bond pays,
you have to pay the money back into the bond, with interest. But on the
plus side, the bond is associated with the driver, not the car, so you
can drive any car with a surety bond.

Only two states (NH and VA) allow you to drive without any insurance.
But in New Hampshire, you can expect to pay up to \$50,000 for
liabilities and \$25,000 for property damage if you are at fault, and
they will suspend your license until you do, if you elect to not carry
insurance. So hopefully, you have enough money laying around. In
Vermont, you can drive without insurance if you pay a fee of \$500 per
year. However, drivers are still responsible for the damages they cause
in an accident, and that can rack up really quickly.

Also, fleet owners who own more than 25 vehicles can be self-insured.
