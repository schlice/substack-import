**Local ordinance prohibits \"habitual dog barking\". I have talked with
the owners (per recommendation) and correctly documented cases where the
barking woke me up, startled me, etc. Should I have my neighbor\'s dogs
taken away from them? Or?**

Contact your local police department's Code Enforcement division, and
let them handle it. It's not for you to "have your neighbor's dogs taken
away from them" since local law generally does not include that as a
punishment for violating noise ordinances, or for habitual dog barking,
unless some form of animal abuse or cruelty is involved.
