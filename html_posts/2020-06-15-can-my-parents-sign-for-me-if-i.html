**Can my parents sign for me if I'm too young? I entered an art
competition that requires someone over 18 to submit artwork, so my
parents agreed to sign any contracts if I win. Is this a problem and
could I get into legal trouble if they sign for me**

No one here can answer this question for you, because no one here has
seen the actual agreement your parents may sign.

If that agreement says that "you must be 18 in order to enter the
contest," your parents could claim that they produced the artwork,
receive the prize, and no one would be the wiser. You would be violating
the rules of the contest, and if you were found out, you would have to
return any prizes you were awarded, and you could indeed face legal
liability. You could get sued for the monetary value of the extra effort
the contest organizers had to put in to track you down, get the prizes
back, contact the first runner up, and get the prizes to them.

Now, if the agreement says that "Someone over the age of 18 must sign,
but anyone can produce the art" then you're fine.

It is up to you to proceed how you see fit. I am not going to advise you
how to proceed, other than you should follow the rules of the contest as
they are written. If you have questions regarding any specific contest
rules and how they may apply to you, you should direct those questions
to the people who are running the contest.
