Remember, in many cases, it is the manufacturer (through their
distributors) who directly stock store shelves, not always store
employees. So in some cases, the food makes it to the store shelves
without the store even touching it.

Also remember that some foods spoil before their expiration dates due to
faults in the manufacture or delivery process. Those foods should be
returned to the store for refund. The store will take it up with the
distributor.

If you found expired food on the shelf, but haven't purchased it yet,
immediately take it to the customer service desk at the store. You
should expect to see a store employee accompany you to the area in the
store where the expired stock is located, and you should expect to see
it immediately removed from the shelf. If you get a lukewarm response
(or no response at all, or worse, someone re-stocking the expired item),
call your regional health department and inform them of the issue.

If you inadvertently consumed expired food, you're probably going to be
okay. If it's only a few days past expiration, you should be fine. Be
more careful when you buy things. You should be checking the expiration
on everything you pick up in the store.

If you inadvertently consumed expired food and it made you sick, you
might be able to sue the store for damages, but it's likely they will
simply settle with you and pay your out-of-pocket medical costs,
assuming you can prove when you bought it and when the expiration date
was. They probably won't push too hard which is why I said they'll
likely settle out of court.
