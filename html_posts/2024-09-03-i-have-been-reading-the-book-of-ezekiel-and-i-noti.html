So your assertion that neither happened is slightly incorrect. When the
prophecy said that Tyre and Egypt would be destoryed and "would never
return," we believe that meant that they would never regain their former
glory. They would never have the power, wealth, and influence that they
once had. And in that view, the prophecy was indeed fulfilled.

Tyre was besieged by Nebuchadnezzar, but only coastal Tyre (585-573 BC),
and the city on the mainland fell. However, Babylon was unable to
conquer insular Tyre, and so Ezekiel's prophecy was only *partially*
fulfilled. It was Greece under Alexander the Great who finally took
insular Tyre, and the rest of Ezekiel's prophecy was fulfilled through
him. The city was destroyed, and Alexander used the rubble from the city
to create a causeway from coastal Tyre to insular Tyre, effectively
turning it from an island to a peninsula. This part of the prophecy was
*directly* fulfilled:

> They will plunder your riches and loot your merchandise. They will
> break down your walls and destroy your pleasant houses. Your stones
> and timber and soil they will cast into the midst of the waters. \--
> Ezekiel 26:12 ESV

They literally tossed the stones and timber and soil into the water to
make a land bridge.

Tyre never regained its prominence, so God's promise to Tyre came true:
"You will never be rebuilt." This means that Tyre will never regain its
former glory, and this much is indeed true.

As for the prophecy about Egypt, Nebuchadnezzar did indeed take Egypt. A
tremendous number of historical statements from Manetho, Herodotus,
Flavius Josephus, and archaeological data show us that that the
Babylonian Army decimated Egypt in 564 B.C. In 525 B.C. Egypt began to
return, and the Egyptian exile ended.

The rule of pharaohs ended with the Babylonian conquest in 564 B.C. When
pharaohs returned in 525, pharaohs ruled only under the control of
foreign powers. So it is absolutely true that the Egypt which once
existed was indeed destroyed by the King of Babylon.

No one ever said that either Tyre or Egypt would no longer ever exist.
But the Tyre and Egypt which existed before would never exist again, and
in that view, the prophecy was absolutely fulfilled.
