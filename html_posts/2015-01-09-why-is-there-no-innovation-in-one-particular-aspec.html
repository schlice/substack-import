title: "Why is there no innovation in one particular aspect of aviation industry? When a flight goes through aerodynamic stall and is never able to recover when flying over a sea, why is there no design to make it float on the sea or something?"

**Content:** [Let\'s look at an example of a flight where this
happened.\
\
Air France flight 447, 1 Jun 2009. The aircraft crashed primarily
because of a few factors. The stall was the aerodynamic factor that
caused the crash, but it wasn\'t an aerodynamic failure that caused the
stall. In other words, the stall happened because the pilots left the
aircraft in a stall orientation the whole way down, due to a number of
factors:\
]{.rendered_qtext}

- The pilot/co-pilots did not have accurate attitudinal information on
  the aircraft, as there was a pitot tube failure. They did not have
  accurate airspeed information, and they also did not have AOA (angle
  of attack) information either. Because of the faulty information, the
  aircraft was actually in a climb until it reached a maximum altitude
  of 38,000 feet, its AOA was 16 degrees, and its engines were in the
  TOGA position (Take Off/Go Around), which is fully forward. The
  aircrew was in a sleep rotation, the pilot was in the sleep cabin, and
  the two co-pilots were manning the aircraft.
- Because the aircraft was not getting valid speed indications, the
  autopilot switched from \"normal law\" to \"alternate law 2\". This
  means that stall warnings were disabled.\
- By the time the captain had returned, the aircraft was in a 40 degree
  AOA, engines at TOGA, and descending.
- The pilot pushed the nose forward during some points in the 3 minute
  descent, but when the airspeed indications were normal again, the
  stall horn went off. When he pulled the stick back, the stall horn
  stopped because the airspeed indication was abnormal. The stall horn
  sounded several times during the descent, but the pitch of the
  aircraft stayed between 35 and 40 degrees nose-up, and the engines
  stayed at 100% thrust. They were spooled down to 50% twice during the
  descent, and they continued to respond normally.
- The aircraft impacted the water at 280 kph, killing everyone on board
  and disintegrating the aircraft. It never left the stall the entire
  time it descended.\
- The right-stick control was providing rearward input on the stick,
  while the left-stick control was providing other inputs. This lack of
  positive switch-over between sticks was a factor. The fact that two
  sticks were providing flight input was evidence of a failure to
  positively transition flight control between the pilots.\

This wasn\'t an airframe failure, and while the stall was the proximal
cause of the aerodynamic failure, it was the lack of correct attitudinal
information that caused the pilots to keep the aircraft in that flight
attitude.\
\
There should be calls to include AOA in the displays available to
pilots, and the pitot tube system on that aircraft was replaced several
times to improve its anti-icing capability.
