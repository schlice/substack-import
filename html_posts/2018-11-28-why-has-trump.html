**Why is it ok for Trump to marry someone for them to become a us
citizen but he does not want others to?**

I've read some of the criticisms of Trump's policies, but this
particular comparison between Trump and others is simply incorrect.

Why?

Melania became a lawful permanent resident of the United States in 2001.
She married Trump in 2005, and became a citizen in 2006.

The criticisms of Trump's policies come when people who are ***illegal
immigrants***, either by overstaying a visa or entering the country
illegally, subsequently marry a US citizen. Sometimes an illegal will
marry a US citizen out of convenience, and it would take an ICE
investigator months to determine if the marriage was genuine. In some
cases, ICE will allow the newly-married citizen to remain, and even gain
citizenship, but not always.

ICE, under Trump, is far stricter with people like these than Obama's
ICE was. At this point in the process, Obama's ICE would simply "look
the other way" when it came to the previous lawless behavior. Under
Trump, any classification of illegal immigrant can be deported at any
time. A subsequent marriage to a US citizen is not a guarantee that you
won't be adjudicated for your former lawlessness. And marriage to a US
citizen does not *automatically* make you a citizen, nor does it
alleviate any punishment you may receive for your previous lawlessness.

In some cases, newly-married illegals arrived at ICE for their
interviews and were arrested on the spot and deported for their previous
crime.

Thus, the outrage.

I have said it before, and I will say it again: *if your first act upon
entering the new nation you want to call home is to violate its laws, we
are absolutely right to question not only your reason for being here,
but your ability and willingness to uphold the rest of our nation's
laws.*
