**Should throwing water on police be a felony in the US? Why or why
not?**

No. We do not need a new law.

We already have laws which describe assaulting a police officer. The
problem is that city councils do not have the fortitude to tell their
police chiefs to enforce those laws when those participants are clearly
engaging in targeted harassment while a police officer is actively
engaged in enforcing the law (i.e. throwing water on a cop who is making
an arrest). It has to be logical though; an officer can still engage in
good-natured fun with water without it being viewed as a crime. There
will always be plenty of video to show the context in which it happens,
not only the officer's body cams. Time to start using those body cams
which everyone was clamoring for to enforce the law.

It is high time for state, regional and local governments to start
protecting the police officers *they* have commissioned to do the job of
enforcing the laws *they* have written.
