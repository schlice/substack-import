is correct in his answer. Because OC is an oil, it is very difficult to
remove from the skin. Even with copious amounts of water, OC remains on
the skin. None of the treatments actually reduce the amount of pain
caused by the oil. They do help to remove some of the oil from the skin.

Most ambulance crews will carry either Sudecon wipes or baby shampoo to
try to help remove the oil from the skin.

It doesn\'t make it less painful.
