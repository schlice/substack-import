**You are the first police officer to arrive at an active shooter
scenario at a school. As you get out of your car, a civilian teacher
runs up to you and says, "I'm armed, how can I help?" What do you do?**

You advise the civilian to go about a block away from the school and
wait.

As a law enforcement professional, you generally don't recruit civilians
to do your job. Back in the Old West, they used to deputize civilians.
Today, slightly more training is required before you can deputize a
civilian (note that "slightly" is an exaggeration. It's a lot of
training).

While armed teachers are an idea we're kicking around, they are best
served inside the classroom, protecting students or stopping a shooter,
if they are going to be anywhere at all.

If they're already outside, they are to move a safe distance away from
the scene and await further instructions.
