**Content:** [A specific education is not necessary, but is preferred.\
\
Each department does its own hiring and training in each location,
although all training for all peace officers within a state is reviewed
and certified by a state-level agency. Most of them call it a POST board
(Peace Officer Standardization and Training), to ensure that their
officers are trained to an equal minimum standard to enforce the laws
within that state.\
\
The acceptance process, under Federal law, cannot discriminate by age,
race, color or sex. In most jurisdictions, you have to be a US citizen,
you must have graduated high school or hold a GED, and you generally
need to have an excellent driving record.]{.rendered_qtext}
