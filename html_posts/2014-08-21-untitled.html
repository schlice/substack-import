<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: [I\'m sorry, but you define the left in the United States<br>as \"conservative,\" and that just doesn\'t jibe with the actual<br>definition of Conservative as is associated with the political<br>Conservative movement.\<br>\<br>Basically, Conservatism in a nutshell is not about hanging on to old<br>ideas with some misty-eyed nostalgia for the \"good old days.\" You seem<br>to believe that is the definition of \"conservative,\" based on your<br>examples of how the Left wants to retain the Roe v Wade decision and<br>retain the financial regulation that they implemented. This is not<br>conservatism, this is clawing one\'s way out of conservatism, which we<br>call Progressivism. Let\'s take your two examples:\<br>\<br>Roe v Wade{.underline}: This landmark legal decision was notable<br>not for what it decided, but how it decided it. It decided that there<br>was a fundamental right to privacy written into the Constitution, when<br>no such right exists. This was a very progressive action by the court,<br>and is commonly taught as one of the hallmark examples of \"legislating<br>from the bench,\" a key indicator of a Progressive view of the<br>Constitution, not a Conservative one. I would have liked to have seen<br>Roe be argued on an Equal Protection basis rather than a privacy basis,<br>in which case it would have been a much stronger position than the one<br>it is today.\<br>\<br>Financial Regulation{.underline}: There is nothing in the<br>Constitution authorizing the US government to regulate the banking<br>industry. Dodd-Frank was supposed to protect small banks, sort of like<br>deposit insurance; in essence it does exactly the opposite. And the<br>results are exactly what you would expect: big banks get bigger, and<br>small banks get fewer. Again, this is a very progressive view of the<br>Constitution, assigning rights to the government that were never<br>intended for the government to perform. And the big one is that<br>government bureaucrats can take over the day-to-day operation of any<br>bank they deem is failing. This massive expansion of the federal<br>government is a very progressive, not conservative, view.\<br>\<br>As a Conservative, I would want Roe overturned because it is bad law,<br>not because I morally oppose the killing of babies. As a Conservative, I<br>would want Dodd-Frank overturned because it is bad law, not because I<br>think the economy works better with less regulation, not more.<br>Commonsense regulation is one thing, but overreaching expansions of<br>government are completely something else. As a Conservative, I believe<br>that government only has business in things if they are valid for<br>government to have business in, and government has very little business<br>in marriage except for accounting for the welfare of the children that<br>sex between men and women create. Other than that, the government<br>shouldn\'t be in the marriage business at all. Leave it up to the<br>churches to marry people \-- they marry homosexual couples all the<br>time.\<br>\<br>The federal government was necessarily left as a small institution so<br>that it could balance the federal power with the state powers. The<br>Progressive view is one that includes massive expansion of the federal<br>government, massive limits on state power, and far more intrusion into<br>the lives of ordinary citizens. It\'s more of a change from<br>\"self-government under the law\" to a government run by technical<br>experts and unelected bureaucrats reaching farther and farther into the<br>lives of citizens based on centrally-managed plans. This \"progressive\"<br>form of government is exactly what the Framers were fighting against<br>when they built this country, and it is the foundation of what<br>Conservatives want to \"conserve.\"\<br>\<br>You said:\<br>\<br>\"\...neither caste, nor class, nor religious designation shall define a<br>person\'s political and private worth, but such values shall be drawn<br>from a collective intuitive sense, a fundamental truth buried deep down<br>inside of us, that \"all men are created equal\". This surely is one of<br>the most progressive political statements in all of history, and<br>displays a remarkable trust in the inherent goodness and fairness of<br>human beings.\<br>\<br>\"But it is progressive no more. It is now traditional, buried, often<br>deeply, it is true, in the heart of every great democracy. And these<br>great democratic traditions constantly struggle for expression in a<br>complicated, messy reality and have done so before the ink was dry on<br>the constitution.\"\<br>\<br>That statement was never progressive or conservative. It simply \"was.\"<br>The Framers codified it because they wanted everyone to know that\'s<br>what they were basing their system of laws against: the fact that people<br>were *ENDOWED BY THEIR CREATOR* with certain inalienable rights. You<br>can\'t leave that part out. The Framers acknowledged that there is a<br>God, and they did it in the Constitution and the Declaration of<br>Independence. This doesn\'t mean that simply because the Declaration<br>talks about God that religions that have God in them are better than<br>others, or state-sanctioned, or anything else that would violate the<br>First Amendment. As you correctly said, even before the ink was dry on<br>the Constitution, they changed it. There was a group of Framers who<br>still distrusted government so much that it wasn\'t enough to just tell<br>government what it was allowed to do and leave the rest to the people,<br>they wanted it codified that people had these rights in particular, the<br>ones they fought so hard to earn:\<br>\<br>- The ability to practice whatever religion they chose, or no religion<br>at all\<br>- The ability to peaceably assemble\<br>- The ability to speak freely about whatever they chose, even the<br>government\<br>- The ability to petition their government for the redress of<br>grievances\<br>- And the ability to keep their last line of defense against oppressive<br>government, arms.\<br>\<br>It was the rise of the Progressive movement that proved those Framers<br>right. It is only the Bill of Rights that protects many of those rights<br>these days, as Progressivism has taken over the face of the modern<br>Democrat party, and has confused many Republicans as<br>well.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/Why-is-the-USA-as-a-nation-so-conservative-compared-to-Europe/answer/Darren-Greer<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
