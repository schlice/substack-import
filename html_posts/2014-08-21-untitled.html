<h2>Answer Comment</h2>

**Content:** [I\'m sorry, but you define the left in the United States
as \"conservative,\" and that just doesn\'t jibe with the actual
definition of Conservative as is associated with the political
Conservative movement.\
\
Basically, Conservatism in a nutshell is not about hanging on to old
ideas with some misty-eyed nostalgia for the \"good old days.\" You seem
to believe that is the definition of \"conservative,\" based on your
examples of how the Left wants to retain the Roe v Wade decision and
retain the financial regulation that they implemented. This is not
conservatism, this is clawing one\'s way out of conservatism, which we
call Progressivism. Let\'s take your two examples:\
\
**[Roe v Wade]{.underline}**: This landmark legal decision was notable
not for what it decided, but how it decided it. It decided that there
was a fundamental right to privacy written into the Constitution, when
no such right exists. This was a very progressive action by the court,
and is commonly taught as one of the hallmark examples of \"legislating
from the bench,\" a key indicator of a Progressive view of the
Constitution, not a Conservative one. I would have liked to have seen
Roe be argued on an Equal Protection basis rather than a privacy basis,
in which case it would have been a much stronger position than the one
it is today.\
\
**[Financial Regulation]{.underline}**: There is nothing in the
Constitution authorizing the US government to regulate the banking
industry. Dodd-Frank was supposed to protect small banks, sort of like
deposit insurance; in essence it does exactly the opposite. And the
results are exactly what you would expect: big banks get bigger, and
small banks get fewer. Again, this is a very progressive view of the
Constitution, assigning rights to the government that were never
intended for the government to perform. And the big one is that
government bureaucrats can take over the day-to-day operation of any
bank they deem is failing. This massive expansion of the federal
government is a very progressive, not conservative, view.\
\
As a Conservative, I would want Roe overturned because it is bad law,
not because I morally oppose the killing of babies. As a Conservative, I
would want Dodd-Frank overturned because it is bad law, not because I
think the economy works better with less regulation, not more.
Commonsense regulation is one thing, but overreaching expansions of
government are completely something else. As a Conservative, I believe
that government only has business in things if they are valid for
government to have business in, and government has very little business
in marriage except for accounting for the welfare of the children that
sex between men and women create. Other than that, the government
shouldn\'t be in the marriage business at all. Leave it up to the
churches to marry people \-- they marry homosexual couples all the
time.\
\
The federal government was necessarily left as a small institution so
that it could balance the federal power with the state powers. The
Progressive view is one that includes massive expansion of the federal
government, massive limits on state power, and far more intrusion into
the lives of ordinary citizens. It\'s more of a change from
\"self-government under the law\" to a government run by technical
experts and unelected bureaucrats reaching farther and farther into the
lives of citizens based on centrally-managed plans. This \"progressive\"
form of government is exactly what the Framers were fighting against
when they built this country, and it is the foundation of what
Conservatives want to \"conserve.\"\
\
You said:\
\
\"\...neither caste, nor class, nor religious designation shall define a
person\'s political and private worth, but such values shall be drawn
from a collective intuitive sense, a fundamental truth buried deep down
inside of us, that \"all men are created equal\". This surely is one of
the most progressive political statements in all of history, and
displays a remarkable trust in the inherent goodness and fairness of
human beings.\
\
\"But it is progressive no more. It is now traditional, buried, often
deeply, it is true, in the heart of every great democracy. And these
great democratic traditions constantly struggle for expression in a
complicated, messy reality and have done so before the ink was dry on
the constitution.\"\
\
That statement was never progressive or conservative. It simply \"was.\"
The Framers codified it because they wanted everyone to know that\'s
what they were basing their system of laws against: the fact that people
were ***ENDOWED BY THEIR CREATOR*** with certain inalienable rights. You
can\'t leave that part out. The Framers acknowledged that there is a
God, and they did it in the Constitution and the Declaration of
Independence. This doesn\'t mean that simply because the Declaration
talks about God that religions that have God in them are better than
others, or state-sanctioned, or anything else that would violate the
First Amendment. As you correctly said, even before the ink was dry on
the Constitution, they changed it. There was a group of Framers who
still distrusted government so much that it wasn\'t enough to just tell
government what it was allowed to do and leave the rest to the people,
they wanted it codified that people had these rights in particular, the
ones they fought so hard to earn:\
\
- The ability to practice whatever religion they chose, or no religion
at all\
- The ability to peaceably assemble\
- The ability to speak freely about whatever they chose, even the
government\
- The ability to petition their government for the redress of
grievances\
- And the ability to keep their last line of defense against oppressive
government, arms.\
\
It was the rise of the Progressive movement that proved those Framers
right. It is only the Bill of Rights that protects many of those rights
these days, as Progressivism has taken over the face of the modern
Democrat party, and has confused many Republicans as
well.]{.rendered_qtext}
