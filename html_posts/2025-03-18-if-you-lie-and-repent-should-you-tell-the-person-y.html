As most of the people who have answered here have told you, it's a good
idea to tell the person you lied to the truth.

But let's talk about repentance for a second. ***Is it required to
confess to the person you lied to in order for it to be a "valid"
repentance?***

And that answer is **no**.

**Biblical repentance** is between **you** and **God**. You did not sin
against the person you lied to; you sinned against God. It's God's law
you violated, not man's. To that end, It is from God that you seek
repentance, not from man.

That said, it is good to make peace with the person you harmed. It is
right and beneficial to your relationship. In fact, the Bible tells us
that **we cannot continue to worship God if we have not made peace with
the brother we have sinned against:**

> *So if you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember that
> your brother has something against you, leave your gift there before
> the altar and go. First be reconciled to your brother, and then come
> and offer your gift. \-- Matthew 5:23--24 ESV*

So the Bible is saying here that before you can offer your gifts to God,
you need to make your heart right. You need to be in the correct frame
of mind and heart to worship a holy God.

So you'll need to do both: repent to God and reconcile with the person
you lied to.
