**Why do we waste time talking about school mass shootings when it's
impossible for America to stop them anyway?**

Your assumption is incorrect. It is certainly not impossible to stop
school shootings.

However, the political will, and the monetary capital, to make the
appropriate changes to safeguard kids in schools is simply not there.
Plus, the opposition to those changes (yes, people *actively oppose
making the security changes necessary to keep our kids safe*) amounts to
about half of the country, so getting these changes made is something
that only works at the state level, in school districts which are more
politically conservative.

We keep talking about mass shootings because there are things which can
be done to stop them. We just have to have the political will to do so.
And by the way, none of them have anything to do with repealing the
Second Amendment or removing guns from the hands of law-abiding
citizens. Those things won't stop criminals hell-bent on killing people.

1.  **Remove the targets.** Right now, across the United States,
    lawmakers have created "target-rich" zones called "Gun-Free Zones"
    in which law-abiding citizens who possess Concealed Carry Permits
    cannot carry their firearms. These zones are typically in schools.
    You will find that the *vast* majority of shootings occur in
    gun-free zones. Why is that? Criminals are *crazy*, they are not
    *stupid*. Have you ever seen a mass shooter shoot up a police
    station? Or a gun range? No? Why not? Don't they hate cops? Of
    course they do, but clearly they're not going to try to pull off a
    mass shooting in a place where *everyone is armed*. Duh.
2.  **Allow teachers with CCWs to carry**. To follow along with #1,
    allowing teachers who are already certified to carry firearms in
    school simply increases the number of "good guys with guns" who
    could potentially stop a mass shooter. I know, there are plenty of
    arguments about why we shouldn't arm teachers, and how teachers
    shouldn't have to protect kids, but I think we're approaching a
    tipping point where even some of the most ardent critics will say,
    "We have to do something, let's try this."
3.  **Start reinforcing school security.** You'll also notice that there
    are no mass shooters in airports. Why not? You have to go through
    millimeter-wave scanners or magnetometers and X-Ray machines to get
    in, and every other entrance is locked and secured by armed guards.
    The common trope heard is, "It's a school, not a prison." Of course
    it's not. How many "prisons" let the inmates leave whenever they
    want? The guards only keep the bad guys out. School districts need
    to get on board and start securing schools. One entrance and exit
    during school hours. All the other doors become alarmed fire exits
    only. Armed school security guards should be present. Eventually,
    you could sterilize the environment with magnetometers and X-ray
    machines if it's a problem. Create security in layers. It can be
    done, and it can be done unobtrusively. It doesn't have to look like
    a war zone, with barbed wire and smoke grenades. It can be done in a
    way which blends with the environment, to still create an appealing
    but safe location.

These are just some of the basics we can do right now, with little to no
effort (some clearly will need some effort, but most do not) to stop
school shootings.

It's just going to take the political will (and some money) to do it.

So ask yourself this: ***why won't your politician take the necessary
steps to protect children? Why do they enforce the policies that make
children into "soft targets?"***

Now go ask your politician.
