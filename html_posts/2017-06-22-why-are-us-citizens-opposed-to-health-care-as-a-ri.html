Ah, finally someone asking a Constitutional question about healthcare!

Well, sort of.

The 10th Amendment simply says that any powers not specifically given to
the government are given to the states or the people.

So what this basically says is that if we haven't *specifically told*
the Federal government that they can do something, they can't. The
Constitution, remember, is designed to tell the Federal government
*exactly* what it is allowed to do, and anything outside of what it has
been told is a right that is given to *the people.*

So by your *very example*, you have shown exactly *why* the Federal
government cannot provide healthcare as a right. It was *never told that
it can.* The rights in the first 9 Amendments are pretty clear, and
healthcare is not in there. Therefore, under the 10th Amendment you
cited, it's a right for the states respectively, or the people.

Therefore, if a state wanted to tax its people and provide healthcare to
all state citizens, it could do that (remember Romneycare in
Massachusetts?). But can the Federal government? According to a strict
interpretation of the Constitution, no.

So how did they get away with Obamacare?

What they did was to create a *marketplace* for healthcare, not actually
provide it. But what about the penalties for not buying insurance?
According to the Supreme Court, it wasn't a *penalty* so much as a
*tax.* It was collected by the IRS. It was collected on Tax Day. Along
with your taxes. If it walks like a duck... Therefore, since the
government *is* allowed to collect taxes, it is allowed to collect taxes
for anything it wants to, including raising your taxes if you don't have
health insurance. Don't like it? Vote out the Congresscritters who did
it. Which is exactly what happened. Along with voting out the party of
the president who pushed it, and lied to get it passed.
