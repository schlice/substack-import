What is a religion? A religion, at its core, is a specific set of
beliefs and practices. But here's the secret: **just being a part of a
religion is not what saves you.**

You may consider yourself Christian. You may believe you are a
Christian. But does that fact save you?

NO!

Salvation is through belief in Christ and acceptance of His gift of
salvation through His substitutionary death on the cross.

It's funny, because Jesus actually talked about this very question while
He was alive:

> "Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep\'s clothing but
> inwardly are ravenous wolves. You will recognize them by their fruits.
> Are grapes gathered from thornbushes, or figs from thistles? So, every
> healthy tree bears good fruit, but the diseased tree bears bad fruit.
> A healthy tree cannot bear bad fruit, nor can a diseased tree bear
> good fruit. Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and
> thrown into the fire. Thus you will recognize them by their fruits.
>
> "Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of
> heaven, but the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven.
> On that day many will say to me, 'Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in
> your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many mighty works
> in your name?' And then will I declare to them, 'I never knew you;
> depart from me, you workers of lawlessness.'" --- Matthew 7:15--23 ESV

Notice that Jesus contrasts *doing good things* with *having faith in
Christ.* Just doing all the things you mentioned by themselves:

- loves like Jesus
- lives like Jesus
- does works in Jesus' name
- sacrifices in Jesus' name
- adorates Jesus

are not what saves you. ***DOING ALL THOSE THINGS ARE A RESULT OF
RECEIVING GOD'S SALVATION, NOT THE CAUSE OF SALVATION.***

Once you are saved, you will *naturally* do those things, as you will be
a changed person and this is what saved people do. This is why you
recognize the *changed person* from the *fruit*. The fruit, without the
changed person, is useless. Similarly, if you don't see the fruit, you
can doubt whether or not the person is changed. But as Jesus said, a
good tree will not bear bad fruit, and a bad tree cannot bear good
fruit. So you will know them by their fruit, but at the same time, just
doing the good things is not what saves you.

**TL;DR:** Someone who does all these things but who has failed to
accept Christ as his savior will hear Him tell them on the last day,
"Depart from me, I never knew you."
