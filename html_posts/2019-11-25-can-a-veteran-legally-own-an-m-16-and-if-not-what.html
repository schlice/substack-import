**Can a veteran legally own an M-16, and if not, what is the closest
thing they can legally own?**

Since you're asking about a veteran, let's assume you are asking if a
veteran can own a military-version M-16 capable of full auto or 3-round
burst as in the A2 version.

Yes, anyone who is a US citizen and not a convicted felon or an
adjudicated mental defective can own a firearm, including a
fully-automatic M-16. There are certainly more strict licensing and
background checking requirements to own fully automatic firearms, and
there may be some state-level restrictions on their ownership, but it is
possible.

Because the supply to civilians was artificially limited, their price is
very high. A fully-transferrable M-16 will cost you well over \$10,000,
and that doesn't include the cost of the \$200 tax stamp to do the
transfer.
