"C2--3" refers to your spinal cord, and "C2" and "C3â€³ are vertebrae in
your spine, just under your skull in your cervical spine (thus the C).
The vertebrae in your back are in the "thoracic spine" and are indicated
using T# designations. The lower spine is called the "lumbar spine" and
is indicated using L# designations. Using the identifiers helps doctors
quickly understand where the lesions are on your spine.

In general, lesions on your spine cause similar symptoms as lesions in
other areas of your brain and spine: numbness, tingling, weakness, and
balance issues.

In addition, cervical spine lesions can cause loss of sensation in the
shoulders and arms.

Don't forget though, symptoms are unique to each person; not everyone
experiences MS in the same way. Even if you and someone else have
exactly the same lesions, you may still experience different symptoms.
