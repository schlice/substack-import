**Content:** [Cost.\
\
It is much cheaper for an apartment complex to build out all of its
units already appointed with appliances and lights, or in industry
terms, \"move-in ready.\" The complex buys these items in bulk, which
saves money. Installers\' time is not cheap either. Electricians would
have to be hired every time someone moved in or out.\

Some apartments in the US can be rented fully-furnished (with furniture
like couches and beds), but under most normal circumstances, apartments
do not come with furniture.]{.rendered_qtext}
