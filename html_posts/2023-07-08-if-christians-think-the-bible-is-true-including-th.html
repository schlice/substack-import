Ah, an excellent question!

I do find it fascinating that if you were to ask an Evolutionist or a
Darwinist the same question, they would unequivocally tell you that all
humans descended from primates. *So the atheists actually agree with the
theists that humans all came from common ancestors.*

*"So then, how do you explain the different races?"*

As a theist, I'm going to give you the most non-theistic answer:
**evolution**.

***WHAT?????? THEISTS ADMIT THAT EVOLUTION HAPPENED?***

Oh yes. We've said it all along, because *we have seen it with our own
eyes, and in our own lifetimes.*

Specifically, it's called *microevolution*. We also commonly refer to it
as *adaptation*. Small changes wherein a species adapts to its
surroundings. For example, when bacteria are attacked by antibiotics,
some survive because the parent bacteria possessed the genetic capacity
to resist, or a rare biochemical mutation somehow helped it survive (we
say "rare" because mutations are nearly always harmful). It passes that
capacity or mutation on to its offspring. The evolutionist would say,
"Yes, the bacteria *evolved."* We agree, they did. But in what way? The
theist observes that throughout all of these mutations and generations,
*the bacteria always remain bacteria.* They never become frogs or
elephants. So categorizing the evolution (and calling it what it is,
pointing out what it is not), is critical when we discuss evolution.

*"But races are sooooo different! They must have evolved separately!"*

Well actually, they're not. In actuality, there is only one race: the
human race. The differences between the "races" are actually so small as
to be trivial. The variations in DNA between individual humans is
approximately 0.2%. Of this difference, only 6% of that is ethnic
differences.

The similarity between humans, even between humans of different races,
is so great that, in practice, black people are often better tissue
matches for white people than other white people.

That's quite a telling data point. Humans aren't very different from
each other.

*"So back to the differences. How did they happen?"*

So let's discuss our differences. There are four main ethnic groups of
human beings, according to anthropologists:

- Caucasoid (European or "white"),
- Mongoloid (which includes the Chinese, Inuit or Eskimo, and Native
  Americans)
- Negroid (black Africans), and
- Australoid (the Australian Aborigines).

Within those four main groups can exist subgroups. But even between the
ethnic groups, everyone has all the same stuff. No one ethnic group has
*something* that another ethnic group *lacks.* For example, everyone has
melanin in their skin. Negroid people simply routinely express more than
Caucasoid, and this is likely a function of where they primarily lived
for thousands of years. Also, look at eyes. The typical almond-shaped
Asian eye has exactly the same structural makeup as the traditional
Caucasoid eye, but the Asian eye has a different amount of fat around
it. They both have fat, but one has more, and the other has less.

I posit that the differences between ethnic groups is far less than
people think. Calling us different "races" just makes this confusion
even stronger.

Wanna hear the craziest modern-day hot take?

Based on everything I just told you, **transracism is more biologically
conceivable than transgenderism**.

Oof, that's a hot take right there! Yep, it is more biologically correct
for a white person to claim they are black than it is for a man to claim
he is a woman. But ask the average American on the street and they'll
tell you that a man can be a woman but a white man can't be a black man.

Marinate on that one for a while.
