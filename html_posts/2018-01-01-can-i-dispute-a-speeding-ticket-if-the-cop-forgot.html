You can, but a "clerical error" is not likely to change the outcome of
the ticket.

If there is a material error on the ticket, such as the wrong license
plate, or the wrong make and model of the car, you can claim that it was
not actually your car that was stopped, and you may have a claim to get
the ticket tossed.

But clerical errors are not cause to get the ticket thrown. You can try
to dispute it, but don't be surprised if the judge lectures you about
"being a grown up" or some such similar lecture topic.
