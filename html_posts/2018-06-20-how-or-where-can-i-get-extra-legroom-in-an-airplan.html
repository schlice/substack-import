**How or where can I get extra legroom in an airplane, knowing that I am
physically disabled, not in a wheelchair, and not allowed to sit on the
emergency seats, in economy class?**

Use a site like
[[SeatGuru](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=ffce75&url=http://seatguru.com){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="seatguru.com"}]{.qlink_container} to look at the
configuration of your specific airplane to find those "hidden gems" that
exist on every airplane. You'll be able to find one that fits your
requirements.
