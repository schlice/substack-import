**As a white female police officer, what do I do if I find a stranger in
my house? Do I open fire since I fear for my life?**

The first part of the sentence ("As a white female police officer") is
completely irrelevant. Let's just replace that with, "As a citizen of
the United States," because that's the only qualification that matters.

Now as for the rest, it depends on which state you're in. For most
states with a strong "Castle Doctrine," the answer is you confront the
individual with the threat of deadly force. If they don't comply, you
use whatever force you must to stay safe.

Does your state have a strong Castle Doctrine? Here's what I clipped
