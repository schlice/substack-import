Even though [[Peter
Kruger](https://www.quora.com/profile/Peter-Kruger)]{.qlink_container}
shared [[one of the best answers
possible](https://www.quora.com/In-this-age-of-fake-news-and-alternative-facts-how-do-we-know-that-the-so-called-fact-checking-sources-are-accurate-and-honest-arbiters-of-what-is-true-and-what-is-false/answer/Peter-Kruger)]{.qlink_container},
I want to share something I just saw the other day that speaks
specifically to this issue.

I regularly watch a YouTube creator named [[Destin
Sandlin](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=195a53&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Destin_Sandlin){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container} who runs a YouTube
channel called Smarter Every Day. If you haven't watched any of his
stuff, you should. He's a scientist by trade. Destin was, until late
2018, a full-time Missile Flight Test Engineer at Redstone Arsenal. He
is currently a PhD candidate at the University of Alabama Huntsville.

Destin's latest contribution is called "Why your newsfeed SUCKS." It
discusses exactly this: how we determine what news is real and what news
is fake. Watch the video, you'll enjoy it:

rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"}]{.qlink_container}

Destin adds this note to his video:

If you do feel inclined to follow Destin, hit that Subscribe button on
his YouTube channel, or just click
[[here](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=52350d&url=http://bit.ly/Subscribe2SED){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="bit.ly"}]{.qlink_container}. I don't work for Destin or know
him personally (other than what I've learned from his channel), but I
respect him as an engineer and a scientist, and I respect his opinions.
