**If I do a factory reset of my phone could the police get access to any
texts I sent?**

When the police get a warrant for SMS messages, they serve that warrant
to your phone's carrier, not to you. Your carrier prints out a log of
all of your text messages (incoming and outgoing) for the time period
indicated on the warrant. They retain a log of all of your messages for
precisely this purpose.
