**Why is Trump continuing to contradict his own intelligence
community?**

Intelligence is just one piece of evidence that constitutes the *body of
evidence* any leader uses to make decisions.

Intelligence is not infallible. Just ask George W. Bush. So it's not
like he's ignoring known good facts. It's intelligence, and all you know
is that he made a decision that does not align with the recommendation
from the intelligence community. You don't know the *confidence level*
of the intelligence he contradicted., Was it strong or weak? Was it
verified by other intelligence agencies, or are our guys standing alone
in their assessment?

A good leader does not blindly follow the "experts." The leader has more
to consider than the experts do.
