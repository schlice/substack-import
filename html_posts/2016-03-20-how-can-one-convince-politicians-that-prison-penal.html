**Content:** [Your first step would be to convince everyone that prison
is not rehabilitative but punitive. In the United States, we have always
held the belief that prison is supposed to be rehabilitative. Whether or
not it is effective at being rehabilitative is not the question. The
point is prison in the United States is supposed to be rehabilitative.
Sending prisoners outside of the United States would not be considered
rehabilitative, it would be considered punitive.\
\
Once you have completely changed the structure of the penal system in
the United States to a punitive one instead of rehabilitative, then you
can address the cost-benefits and the other benefits of sending
prisoners outside of the United States.\
\
Though, if we change the entire prison system to a punitive one instead
of a rehabilitative one, we could probably achieve greater cost savings
by keeping our prisoners in the United States, but placing them all on a
fenced in island in the middle of the ocean instead of shipping them by
aircraft to a Third World country. Drop them all onto a prison island
and let them fend for themselves. I can\'t remember off the top of my
head what movie that\'s from, but if we\'re making our prison system
punitive (in other words, our prison system is punishment instead of
rehabilitative) then dropping them all onto a deserted island surrounded
by 50 foot walls would be punishment enough. Hey, maybe we could get
Trump to build the walls.]{.rendered_qtext}
