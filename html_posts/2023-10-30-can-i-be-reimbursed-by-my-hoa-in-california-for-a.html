Certainly! But I think you may be unclear on the method by which you
obtain your "reimbursement."

Yeah, that's right, lawsuit. Retain an attorney and "request" that they
refund the money you sunk into removing the cover that they approved,
and when they don't pay (they won't), file a lawsuit.

In other words, there's no statutory way to be "reimbursed." If you were
monetarily damaged by another's incompetence, the remedy is a lawsuit.

Good luck.
