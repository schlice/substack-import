Because of the MS medication I am on, I am what they call
\"immuno-compromised\" so sinus issues are frequent with me. I know a
bit about them, so allow me to pass on a few things that will hopefully
help you out. Make sure you are otherwise healthy, and make sure that if
you take medications, you follow all of the instructions for doing it
properly. If you\'re under 12, you may not be able to take the adult
versions of medications; **always check with your doctor** (or your
parents, depending on how young you truly are) to get the correct dosing
of any over-the-counter medication.

1.  POUND THE FLUIDS. It will be a challenge, but you must drink more
    than you are used to. And no, coffee and soda do not count. Little
    to no caffeine, and minimize the sugar and HFCS (high fructose corn
    syrup). Water and clear juices like apple are your best bet.
    Flavored waters are fine, but flavor and sugar in any form is not
    what you\'re looking for. Look for waters with natural flavoring, or
    fake sugars like Stevia. I personally prefer [[Propel Fitness
    Water](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=be885a&url=http://propelwater.com){.external_link
    rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
    onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
    qt-tooltip="propelwater.com"}]{.qlink_container} when I need to
    pound water. Plus it has extra vitamins and stuff, so bonus.
2.  For medication, you\'re looking for \"guaifenesin\" which is a class
    of medications called an *expectorant*. You may recall that
    \"expectorating\" is a fancy word for \"spitting.\" Well, an
    \"expectorant\" is a chemical that helps to break up mucus, thinning
    it out so that it can be, well, expectorated. However, the part that
    most folks miss when using guaifenesin is that you must follow Step
    1 when you do. You have to have lots of fluid along with it. The
    medicine adds your fluid intake to your own mucus secretions to thin
    them out. Without drinking **at least** an 8 oz glass of water along
    with the pill, it won\'t do you any good whatsoever (although 8 oz
    is a bare minimum; you should already be drinking more than that).
    Anyway, the brand name in the US for straight-up guaifenesen is
    [[Mucinex](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=cc1a02&url=http://www.mucinex.com){.external_link
    rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
    onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
    qt-tooltip="mucinex.com"}]{.qlink_container}.
3.  Limit your dairy intake, as dairy thickens mucus secretions.
4.  Increase your Vitamin C intake. I turn to
    [[Emergen-C](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=20aad4&url=http://www.emergenc.com){.external_link
    rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
    onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
    qt-tooltip="emergenc.com"}]{.qlink_container} when I need to
    increase my Vitamin C, because not only does it up my Vitamin C
    (each packet contains 1000 mg of Vitamin C), but it also contains
    antioxidants, zinc, manganese, seven different B vitamins, and
    electrolytes. Good stuff. The label says no more than two per day.
    My doctor told me to take three per day until I was better. **Always
    do what your doctor tells you to do.** Aside from that, follow the
    label instructions and take the correct dosing of Emergen-C until
    you\'re better.
5.  Get enough rest. Your body heals while you sleep, and if you\'re not
    getting enough sleep, you\'re extending the amount of time it will
    take you to get better.
6.  Did I mention **always do what your doctor tells you to do**?

And finally, if you\'re not getting better running this protocol for at
least one week (but no more than two), if you have persistent cough, if
you have persistent sore throat, body aches, chills, and **especially**
if you are running a fever, ***GO SEE YOUR DOCTOR*** because you need
real medicine, not over-the-counter stuff.

Feel better!
