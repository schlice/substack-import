**How do emergency services get into the airport in an emergency without
going through security?**

In most major airports, they're already there. There is usually a
medical team which has all of its required lifesaving equipment
stationed within the sterile area (the "sterile area" is the area inside
of security). They have ambulances on the "pad" (the level of ground
where the airplanes are, called the "restricted area") and can drive on
the ramps and pads to reach any of the terminals or concourses within
minutes. They can enter and exit, with card access, through the secure
doors which lead directly from the sterile area out to the restricted
area and the pad.

In the event of a medical emergency within the sterile area, the medical
team would respond, stabilize the patient, and transport either to a
waiting team outside the sterile area, or directly to a local medical
facility.
