**Content:** [The technology does not yet exist to be able to scan
multiple image sources real-time, do image recognition to convert the
image of a license plate to a recognizable number, and then parse that
through a database of wanted plates.\
\
That technology is not too far off. If you\'ve not yet heard of \"big
data,\" it\'s okay, that sort of technology is currently only bandied
about in IT circles. It\'s the technology that allows a company like
Gilette to monitor the live Twitter feed and watch for the tweet where a
guy says he\'s on a business trip and he forgot his razor. The system
recognizes this and replies to his tweet with a coupon for a new Gilette
razor. That sort of technology requires massive computing power, and
technology that can take very large quantities of unordered data and
make sense out of it.\
\
Police departments don\'t have the budget for that kind of tech.\
\
They use, as [[Alex
Kutz](https://www.quora.com/profile/Alex-Kutz)]{.qlink_container} said,
the radio. It\'s called a BOLO (which stands for \"Be On the LookOut\")
and they are sometimes distributed during shift change briefings, or
over the radio or the MDT.]{.rendered_qtext}
