**Why does Colorado law allow multiple murder charges for the killing of
one person under different theories?**

It's more than just Colorado.

Most states allow multiple murder charges under different murder
theories, or different mental states which can comprise a murder. These
separate mental states include such charges as intentional murder,
murder through actions that one knows (or should know) will likely
result in death, felony murder where a victim dies during the
defendant\'s commission of a different felony, etc.

The prosecutor will generally charge any mental state which might
potentially apply as a separate count. If the defendant is found guilty
of multiple counts, they will be merged together into one conviction for
judgement and sentencing purposes.
