**I'm wanting to join the Air Force and wondering if anyone knows how
to. When you get your pilot slot, how do you get the B-2 Spirit Bomber
as your aircraft?**

Since I not only joined the Air Force, but I served my time and got out,
I think I qualify as "knowing how to."

First, let's address how to join if you want to be a pilot. In order to
be a pilot, you must be a commissioned officer. Commissioned officers
come from three commissioning sources: the Reserve Officer Training
Corps (ROTC), Officer Training School (OTS), or the US Air Force Academy
(USAFA). ROTC is a program you attend while in college. You gain your
military training while you are pursuing your undergraduate degree. When
you graduate, you get your Bachelor's degree and a commission in the Air
Force. OTS is a program for those who already have their Bachelor's
degrees. It is an intensive three month program which takes people and
trains them to become Air Force officers. Graduates from OTS are
commissioned into the Air Force. The US Air Force Academy in Colorado
Springs, Colorado is one of our nation's service academies. It requires
acceptance into the school as well as a nomination by a Congressman, the
Vice-President, or the President.

By far, the option chosen by most people (simply based on volume) is
ROTC. I would definitely look into ROTC. Here's a great website to get
you started:

Even if you think you want bombers now, thinking about which airframe
you want to fly is putting the cart WAY before the horse. Worry about
becoming a commissioned officer first, and then worry about getting into
pilot training. Lean on your advisers and instructors for guidance on
what you need to do in order to maximize your chances for being
selected.
