**I just bought a used car from a dealership. I came home and realized
that the price on the receipt is higher than the price of the car on the
internet. What should I do? What are my rights?**

While the correct answer is *caveat emptor,* you may have a claim if you
believe the dealership quoted you one price and sold you on another. An
*auto dealer fraud lawyer* can help with unfair business practices such
as failure to disclose damages, price packing or deal packing, and
misleading dealer add-ons and bundled extras. They can also help you
with bait-and-switch scams and misquoted or intentional overcharging.

If you think this is what happened to you, consider contacting an auto
dealer fraud lawyer in your area.

If this didn't happen to you, it may be that the price on the Internet
was only valid if you did certain things (like use their preferred
financing, or buy a certain add-on package). If this is true, then
you're probably out of luck. Check the fine print on the Internet ad. It
would usually state something like the price is only valid if you
finance through the dealer, or something else you have to do to get that
price.
