**How will Americans view President Trump's decision to not fly the
White House flag at half staff in honor of John McCain in apparent
reaction to John McCain's decision that the President should not be
invited to McCain's funeral?**

You know Trump has no filter. His brain-mouth connection has nothing in
between. He speaks exactly what he thinks.

On a positive note, at least you never have to wonder what he's
thinking.

However, cooler heads on his staff ensure that appropriate courtesies
are followed, and the White House is indeed flying the flag at half
staff. As is fully expected.
