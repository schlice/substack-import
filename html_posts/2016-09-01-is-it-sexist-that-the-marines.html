answer explains why more men pass than women.

Your question, though, is assuming that the bar is set where it is
***specifically*** to weed out the physically weaker females. Your
question assumes that the bar is where it is because the desire is to
keep women out, so knowing that women will not meet the bar is the
reason the bar is set so high.

This is not so.

**The bar is set where it is because that's the level of ability the job
requires.**

Jon explained very well why more men meet that bar than women. However,
the bar is there because that's the level of ability we need in that
job. Male or female, you have to be able to perform at that level of
ability. Making an "easier" test for women means that the job only
requires that level of ability, and that's not the case.
