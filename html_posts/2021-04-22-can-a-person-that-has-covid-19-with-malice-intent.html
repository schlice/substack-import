[[Jeanette

has provided the correct answer with respect to the tool a terrorist may
use. This, however, would only make one a *stupid* terrorist, if they
were one.

The problem here is the definition of terrorism. Terrorism does not have
as its end goal to spread terror. Terrorism is the use of terror or fear
to achieve a political goal.

A person with malicious intent towards people's safety commits assault,
but is usually not a bio terrorist.
