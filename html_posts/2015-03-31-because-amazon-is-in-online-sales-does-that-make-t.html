**Content:** [Why should \"how\" a business does business make them
\"immune\" to anti-trust laws?\
\
Amazon doesn\'t manufacture any products. They may OEM some products,
but they don\'t manufacture any unique products, with the exception of
their Kindle e-readers and Fire Phones, and you can buy a Kindle from
Best Buy and Fire Phones from AT&T. They don\'t hold a monopoly on any
one product.\
\
However, let\'s assume that they did. Let\'s assume that they
manufactured a product that you couldn\'t get anywhere else and they
only sold it through their web channels. Would that be a \"monopoly?\"
Only if Amazon was the only company offering their product/service and
they made sure that no one else could offer the same product/service.
Currently, this is not the case. If Amazon tried to buy up all other web
retailers, that might create a monopoly of web retailers, but the simple
fact that anyone can set up a web e-store and sell stuff means that
Amazon can\'t do that. And net neutrality means that ISPs can\'t
prioritize Amazon traffic above Mom&Pop Shop\'s Web Store, so Amazon
can\'t bully their way onto your computer over Mom&Pop Shop.\
\
TL;DR: Being in online sales doesn\'t make you immune to antitrust
legislation. Amazon doesn\'t hold a monopoly in
anything.]{.rendered_qtext}
