**Content:** [First of all, he said *most* people are afraid of cops
because it reminds them that there are consequences when they violate
the law. But we know that not everyone violates the law, right?
Therefore, it should hold true that only people who violate the law
should be afraid of cops. So the question becomes, are you worried
because you do actually violate the law and you worry that a cop will
find out, or are you really worried that over 300,000 law enforcement
officers around the country are, in reality, actually condescending
jerks and have nothing better to do with their time than to jam you up?
If you believe the latter, you watch too much TV. Re-read the section on
media bias. If you believe the former, there\'s still time to clean up
your act before you end up in prison beside the truck owner.\
\
Second, I understand you had a terrible day, but have you even bothered
to look at it from the cop\'s perspective, or do you just judge others
based on your narrow view on life? That cop has had a hundred other
traffic stops *just like yours* where someone has been found driving a
vehicle not registered to them. Guess how many of those times the driver
is actually using the vehicle legally. The correct answer can be counted
on one hand. Couple that with your behavior and your story, which does
seem a little off, and even to Joe Schmuckatelli non-cop, this whole
thing looks fishy. Can you blame him for investigating? I do agree that
he took it too far. [[Christopher

said the same: there are some bad seeds on the force. It simply can\'t
be avoided. You met one and survived relatively unscathed. You should go
buy a lottery ticket; the odds of a truly law-abiding citizen actually
meeting a bad cop are pretty low.\
\
Finally, did you report the officer? The only way bad cops get off the
street is when honest citizens take the time and go through the effort
to report these officers to their supervisors. Even if they never tell
you what they do to that officer, *even if they don\'t actually do
anything this time,* ten reports with no action taken still sends a
message to supervisors, as much of a message as a single actionable
report. ***But nothing gets better until you take action***. My dad used
to tell me, \"if you\'re not part of the solution, you\'re part of the
problem.\" Which are you?]{.rendered_qtext}
