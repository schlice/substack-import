**Can you be charged for aiding and abetting if you live with someone
who has a warrant?**

The exact charge would not generally be aiding and abetting. It's more
likely you'd be charged with "harboring a fugitive."

Aiding and abetting, or in some states, accessory after the fact, may be
charged if you supply money to the fugitive. However, simply giving
money to a fugitive does not meet the standard for harboring a fugitive.

At a federal level, 18 USC ยง 1071 requires proof of four elements:

1.  Proof that a federal warrant had been issued for the fugitive\' s
    arrest,
2.  The accused had knowledge that a warrant had been issued,
3.  The accused actually harbored or concealed the fugitive,
4.  The accused intended to prevent the fugitive\' s discovery or
    arrest.

State laws vary, of course, but they all have some law against harboring
a fugitive.

So just living with a fugitive doesn't rise to the level of harboring.
You have to know the person has a warrant, and you have to intend to
prevent the person's discovery. This means you have to do "something" in
furtherance of concealment of the fugitive (i.e. you go out of the
residence and make financial transactions on their behalf so they don't
have to leave the residence).
