**Is sex good for high blood pressure?**

The answer is a *qualified* **yes**.

In general, any aerobic exercise is good for blood pressure, and sex is
most definitely an aerobic exercise.

Sex is generally safe for heart patients, if you are cleared by your
doctor first. As of 2012, less than 1% of acute heart problems were
directly linked to sexual activity.[\[1\]](#fhGZM){#cite-fhGZM

For women especially, orgasm releases the hormone oxytocin, which lowers
blood pressure.

Sex releases stress, which can also be detrimental to your heart. Stress
causes blood vessels to constrict and causes heart rates to increase,
which indirectly increases blood pressure. Lower levels of stress have
been shown to result in lower blood pressure.

I would caution you, as I would for anyone, to check with your doctor
before you start, stop, or change any of your exercise routines,
especially if you already have heart issues.

But that warning aside, sex is indeed a good (and fun) way to help lower
your blood pressure, maintain overall heart health, and in general, help
maintain your overall health as well.
