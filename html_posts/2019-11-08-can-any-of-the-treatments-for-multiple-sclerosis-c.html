**Can any of the treatments for multiple sclerosis cause cancer? If so,
which ones do so?**

To the best of my knowledge, none of the current MS medications increase
your risk of cancer. However, the drugs have only been on the market for
MS patients since the mid 80s and for others only a few years before. So
we only have about 30 years of runtime on these drugs. Conclusively
tying the drugs to cancer likely takes more runtime than that.

But to date, there is no evidence that the drugs increase cancer risk.
