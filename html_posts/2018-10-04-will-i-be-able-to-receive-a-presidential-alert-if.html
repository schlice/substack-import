**Will I be able to receive a Presidential Alert if I have no service?**

Here are the pre-requisites for being able to receive Wireless Emergency
Alerts:

- Your phone must be powered on.
- Your phone must be connected to a cellular tower to receive Emergency
  Alerts.
- If you are actively using a data connection on your phone when the
  Alert comes in, you may temporarily miss it, but you should receive it
  within 30 minutes of it being sent.

You may not receive the message if:

- Your carrier does not send WEA messages
- You are roaming on a carrier network which does not support WEA
- Your phone is not capable of receiving WEA messages
- Your phone is not in a state in which it can receive a WEA message
  (i.e. an active data connection)
