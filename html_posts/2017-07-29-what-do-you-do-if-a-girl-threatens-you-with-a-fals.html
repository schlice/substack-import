Easy. There is literally only one thing to do. Don\'t do anything else,
don\'t say anything else, until you do this:

GET A LAWYER. NOW.

It\'s really that simple. Everything you say from that point on is what
your lawyer tells you to say. Who you talk to, where you go, etc. will
all be under your lawyer\'s direction.
