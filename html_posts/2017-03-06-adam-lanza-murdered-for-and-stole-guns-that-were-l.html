**What gun laws would have prevented him from doing what he did?**

Lanza's mother legally acquired her firearms, following all gun laws at
the time. What exactly do you suggest we could do that would have
prevented a madman from killing his mother and stealing her guns? What
law would have prevented this?

Let me answer for you: **there is no law that can stop someone from
breaking the law.**

If a law is going to be broken, you cannot stop the criminal by *passing
a new law.*
