**If I tell a cop I have weed on me before I'm Mirandized, can it be
used against me in court?**

Yes.

Miranda's protections are only applicable when the government questions
you. Miranda is not applicable when you simply give up information on
your own, without any coercion or prompting.

So if you choose to voluntarily confess to a crime (if it's a crime
where you live), whether or not you were read your Miranda rights is
irrelevant.
