**Do pro-lifers approve of vasectomies?**

The pro-life movement has no specific views on vasectomies.

Pro-lifers are concerned with humans who are killed after the sperm
joins with the egg, not with what form of birth control anyone may
choose to use.

You're probably confused because you correlate "pro-life people" with
"religious people." Not everyone who is pro-life is religious, nor does
the pro-life position have as a requirement any specific religious
teachings.

The pro-life position, on its own, has nothing to say about vasectomies.
