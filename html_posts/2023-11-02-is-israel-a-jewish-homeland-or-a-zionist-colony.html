In order to answer this question, we must define our terms.

***What is the "Jewish Homeland?"***

**Israel** is the Jewish homeland. The State of Israel was established
on May 14, 1948. Jews support Israel as a Jewish homeland. All Jews
around the world currently have the right to move to Israel and gain
citizenship, enshrined in Israel\'s Law of Return, which was enacted in
1950 (two years after Israel became a state).

***What is "Zionism?"***

Zionism is the movement for the self-determination and statehood for the
Jewish people in their ancestral homeland, the land of Israel. The vast
majority of Jews around the world feel a connection or kinship with
Israel, whether or not they explicitly identify as Zionists, and
regardless of their opinions on the policies of the Israeli government.

While there has been a continuous Jewish presence in the land of Israel
over the millennia, the yearning to return to Zion, the biblical term
for both the land of Israel and Jerusalem, has been a cornerstone of
Jewish communal life since the Romans violently colonized the land,
sending Jews into exile two thousand years ago. An earlier exile by the
Babylonians produced perhaps the most well-known lamentation "By the
rivers of Babylon, there we wept as we remembered Zion." That connection
between Jews and the land, and the hope for repatriation, is deeply
embedded in Jewish prayer, ritual, literature and culture.

What is known as modern Zionism emerged in the mid-19th century in
tandem with the rise of the nation-state and widespread national
liberation movements across Europe. In the case of the Jews, it was also
in response to a long history of intense anti-Jewish hatred,
persecution, and discrimination in countries and societies across the
world where Jews lived, including in Europe, the Middle East, and North
Africa. Its advocates believed that a modern Jewish state would provide
Jews with a safe haven from the bigotry and endangerment they suffered
perennially as a minority culture among non-Jewish majority cultures,
and ensure that Jews have the same right to nationhood and
self-determination as any other people, along with the same protections
that are typically afforded to other nations. Zionism was also a
cultural and national renaissance movement which sought to enable the
Jewish people to revive their language, Hebrew, and reestablish
self-determination over their traditions, culture, religion and
education.

In the late 1800s, the "father" of modern Zionism, Austrian journalist
Theodor Herzl, consolidated various strands of Zionist thought into an
organized political movement, advocating for international recognition
of an independent and sovereign Jewish state in the land of Israel.

Today, with a Jewish sovereign state a reality, Zionists believe in and
support the right of the democratic State of Israel to exist as a Jewish
homeland. Israel is the only Jewish state in the world. Being a Zionist
is distinct from supporting the policies of the government of Israel.

Zionism is a big tent movement that includes those across the spectrum
from progressives, moderates and conservatives and those who are
apolitical. There are Zionists who are critical of Israeli policies,
just as there are Zionists who rarely voice disagreement with the
Israeli government. There are diverse views among Zionists about the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict, about how to promote peace, whether to
support a two-state solution, and about approaches to Israeli
settlements. Being critical of Israeli policies is no more anti-Zionist
than being critical of American policies is anti-American.

So is it a Jewish homeland or a Zionist colony? Probably both.
