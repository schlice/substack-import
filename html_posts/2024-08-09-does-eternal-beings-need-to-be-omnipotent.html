No. There is nothing special about being eternal that requires a being
to be omnipotent (all-powerful). Being eternal simply means that a being
has no beginning and no end. Omnipotence means that the being is
all-powerful; the being has an unlimited motivational force and can
apply that force with unlimited duration and power.

We know that God is omnipotent because the Bible tells us so. For
example, in Genesis 1, God creates the entire universe and everything in
it *by simply speaking it into existence*. For man to create something,
we need tools and effort, and even in that, we are only *transforming*
one thing into another. God *literally* made things *come into
existence* (meaning they weren't there before, and then they were) by
just *speaking*. This hints at God's power.

But in other areas of the Bible, God's omnipotence is discussed:

> "I know that you can do all things,\
> and that no purpose of yours can be thwarted. \-- Job 42:2 ESV
>
> And the LORD said to Moses, "Is the LORD's hand shortened? Now you
> shall see whether my word will come true for you or not." \-- Numbers
> 11:23 ESV

There are many more Bible verses which display God's unlimited power to
do anything in keeping with His nature. Suffice it to say that we're not
guessing about God's omnipotence. It's in the Book.
