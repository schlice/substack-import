**What happens if the entire Supreme Court or most of it recuses itself
from ruling on a case of uttermost importance?**

This happens all the time.

In order for a case to be heard by the Supreme Court, the justices have
to *agree* to hear the case. It is called *certiorari.* It is how the
Supreme Court agrees to hear a case from a lower court.

The Supreme Court gets about 7000 requests to hear cases per year. The
court will generally hear about 80 cases per year, with another 50 that
they will decide without hearing any arguments.

In all of the cases which they refuse to *grant certiorari* (or in other
words, recuses itself from ruling on a case), the decision of the last
court to hear the case stands.
