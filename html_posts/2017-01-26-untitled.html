Driving is a privilege. Gun ownership is a right. You can impose harsher
sanctions, but note you are not restricting *everyone's* driving
privilege, just the person who drives drunk. Have you noticed that when
you pass laws about driving, it doesn't impact the good drivers? Only
the drunks lose their license. Why do you insist on removing guns from
everyone? If we have an increase in drunk drivers, will you take cars
away from everyone? Your stance on guns is illogical, especially when
driving is a privilege and gun ownership is a right.
