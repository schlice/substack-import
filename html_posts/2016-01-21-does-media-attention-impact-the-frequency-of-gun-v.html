Several high-profile mass shooters at high schools and colleges have
said that they wanted to emulate the fame and notoriety of Dylan Klebold
and Eric Harris (from Columbine). When Columbine happened, it was all
over the news. Columbine High School is in Littleton, Colorado, but here
in Colorado Springs, it was 24-hour coverage on all the major news
networks. You can\'t buy that kind of notoriety. And others wanted it.

So should we try to limit how we publicize information about mass
shooters while still not infringing on 1A rights? How would we go about
doing that?
