**Can a paramedic or any emergency officer legally keep a parent from
seeing the body of their deceased child in their own home?**

Paramedics would likely try to keep you from seeing something which
would traumatize you, as this is also part of their charter, although
they cannot legally keep you out of your home. If you insist on
entering, a paramedic does not have the legal authority to stop you.

Police, on the other hand, must preserve a crime scene. They absolutely
can keep you out of your home until that scene has been processed.
