President Trump has not said whether or not he has started following the
Pence/Graham rule of never being alone with a woman who is not his wife,
or if he's going to attend a function in which alcohol is served,
ensuring that his wife is there. I'm pretty sure Trump is rarely alone
as President, and if he is, I'm certain that there is at least one other
person who is aware of it.

practiced by Billy Graham, the Evangelical preacher. In a series of
meetings in 1948 in Modesto, California, Graham and a group of other
Evangelical leaders vowed to \"avoid any situation that would have even
the appearance of compromise or suspicion.\"

Pence, as a public figure, follows the rule to protect himself. It
honestly has nothing to do with protecting women. In fact, critics of
the rule say that it marginalizes women, depriving them of opportunities
to network and share their ideas.

However, Pence knows, in the era of Al Franken and John Conyers, that an
accusation can ruin your career. To avoid the possibility of such a
career-ending accusation, he follows this rule.

It's too bad that society has changed so much that ***the mere
accusation*** of sexual misconduct can cost you your entire life's work.
However, it has. In light of this, smart men will do what they must to
protect themselves.
