**Is William Barr legally allowed to release the full Mueller report to
the public?**

The relevant law around the Special Counsel's report says that it is a
"confidential report" delivered to the Attorney General (64 Fed. Reg.
37,038, 37,040-41 (July 9, 1999)). However, he does know that there is
great public interest in it, so he will release as much of it as he
legally can, since that same law allows the AG to release appropriate
information to both Congress and the public.

**However, he cannot, by law, release the full, unredacted report.** He
is constrained by two major legal roadblocks:

1.  Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 6(e), which imposes restrictions
    on the use and disclosure of information relating to \"matter\[s\]
    occurring before \[a\] grand jury\" (Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(e)(2)(B).
    Rule 6(e)). The report contains material which is or could be part
    of a grand jury proceeding, and that information is required by law
    to remain secret.\
    \
    To that end, the "6(e) material" which, by law, cannot be made
    public, will be redacted.
2.  Information concerning other matters which have been referred to
    other offices, agencies, or courts. For example, some things that
    the Special Counsel found were referred to other agencies to
    prosecute (such as New York for tax evasion). That information must
    also be removed from the report before it can be made public in
    order to protect the sanctity of those investigations.

Once that material has been redacted from the report, Barr will deliver
the remainder of the report to Congress, and then to the people.
