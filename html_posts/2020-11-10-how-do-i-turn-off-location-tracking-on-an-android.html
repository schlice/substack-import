**How do I turn off location tracking on an Android & iPhone?**

On Android (current versions), go to **Settings** and select
**Biometrics and security**. Scroll down to **Location** and turn it
off.

If you want to make changes to individual apps instead, go to
**Settings, Apps**, scroll to the app in question and click it, and
scroll down to App Settings. Click **Permissions** and you can
individually enable or disable each of the permissions for that app.

On iOS, go into the Settings app and click **Privacy**. Then click
**Location Services** and turn it off.

If you want to make changes to individual apps instead, leave Location
Settings on and scroll down to the individual app. Select it and change
Location access to *Always, While Using the App, Ask Next Time,* or
*Never.*
