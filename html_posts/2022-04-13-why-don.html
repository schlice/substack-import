Because that's silly. Just because you don't like a book doesn't mean
you should clog your toilet over it.

If you own a book you're not interested in reading, you should perhaps
donate it. Maybe someone else might enjoy reading it more than you did.

A better option would be to burn it. Just be aware of your
municipality's outdoor burning rules, if you have any in place at the
time. I wouldn't advise burning the book inside the house.

It's just a book. The pages on which the words are printed aren't
sacred, or imbued with any special magic. Feel free to dispose of it in
any way you like.
