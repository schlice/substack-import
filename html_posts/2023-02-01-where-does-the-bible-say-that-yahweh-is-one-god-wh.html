For Jews, the Shema expresses the essence of Judaism, that God must be
loved and obeyed at all times. These words are inscibed on small scrolls
contained in a box called a mezzuzah fastened to the doorpost of Jewish
homes. The wearing of a small mezzuzah (usually a cylinder) around the
neck on a chain is a modern adaptation of the ancient custom.

The Shema is recorded in Deuteronomy 6:4--9.

> Hear, O Israel: **The Lord our God, the Lord is one.** Love the Lord
> your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your
> strength. These commandments that I give you today are to be on your
> hearts. Impress them on your children. Talk about them when you sit at
> home and when you walk along the road, when you lie down and when you
> get up. Tie them as symbols on your hands and bind them on your
> foreheads. Write them on the doorframes of your houses and on your
> gates.

Some more relevant verses:

> You believe that God is one. You do well; the demons also believe, and
> shudder. (James 2:19)
>
> To you it was shown that you might know that the Lord, He is God;
> there is no other besides Him. (Deuteronomy 4:35)
>
> For this reason You are great, O Lord God; for there is none like You,
> and there is no God besides You, according to all that we have heard
> with our ears. (2 Samuel 7:22)
>
> O Lord, there is none like You, nor is there any God besides You,
> according to all that we have heard with our ears. (1 Chronicles
> 17:20)

And that's just the tip of the iceberg. There are many verses which
support the idea that there is only one God.
