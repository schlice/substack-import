**Content:** [For most factory alarm systems which include starter
disablers, the key fob is important as this is how the alarm system is
disabled and the starter interlock is released.\
\
There are thoughts that thieves will use rolling-code broadcasters to
\"brute-force\" attack a vehicle. The idea behind this is that the thief
will approach the vehicle with a laptop and a broadcast module and will
try every code that the manufacturer uses to remotely unlock the doors.
Since the passive key fob is the more attractive option (as opposed to
the active key fob, which can be equipped with rolling-code technology
like your garage door), it is the more attractive target. Find the right
frequency and code, and you can unlock the door. Understand though that
this attack can take several minutes of a thief sitting within 30
centimeters of your car door with a laptop.\
\
Other ideas which have been floated:\
]{.rendered_qtext}

- The thieves are using active jamming, so you think you locked your
  doors but the signal never made it to your car. The thief then enters
  your unlocked car.
- The thieves are using amplification and rebroadcast (again, only
  useful for passive fobs) whereby in a multi-phase attack, they record
  the signal being broadcast by your car, then use a power booster to
  broadcast that signal at your house and listen for a return code from
  your passive key fob), then broadcast that passive code at your car
  and *voila*, it\'s open.

None of these attacks are sophisticated enough to fit into a little
black box that a thief can waltz up to your car and touch the door
handle and the car will magically open. So there\'s really little to
worry about as far as your true safety is concerned. Thieves will use
traditional theft methods (smash-and-grab, slim jims, etc) to get into
your car.\
\
If you\'re concerned about someone blasting your car\'s frequency into
your house and listening for a return signal from your passive key fob,
you can place your keys in the microwave or the freezer. These both act
as Faraday cages and will effectively prevent them from responding to
any signal, as they won\'t get a signal in or out of those boxes. There
are also small bags that block all RF frequencies, normally used for
cell phones when you want to be sure that they are not broadcasting.
Placing your fob in one of these bags will prevent it from broadcasting
when you\'re not using it.\
\
Otherwise, you\'re pretty safe as long as you protect your vehicle
against traditional attacks.
