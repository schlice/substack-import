The existence of God relies on **nothing.** Existence does not rely on
evidence. Existence does not rely on belief. Existence is its own entity
separate from anything else which analyzes or describes the existence.
For example, evidence *points to* the existence; the existence doesn't
rely on evidence in order to exist. Additionally, the truth of God's
existence is discovered, not invented. The truth exists regardless of
anyone's belief in it. Therefore, neither faith nor evidence is required
to create the truth of God's existence.

That said, faith is nothing without evidence, which points to existence.
But what type of evidence is there that points to God's existence? And
will you accept that evidence? God exists outside of the physical realm
He created, so He cannot be measured or seen or examined. So if it's
**only physical, empirical, testable evidence you're looking for, you
will be sorely disappointed.**

*But that's not the only evidence of God's existence.*

There is abundant evidence to show that God exists, but it's not direct
evidence of God Himself. For example, the scientific evidence
overwhelmingly confirms that the universe exploded into being out of
nothing. Either someone created something out of nothing (the theistic
view), or no one created something out of nothing (the atheistic view).
Which view is more reasonable? The theistic view. Which view requires
more faith? The atheistic view.

Also, the simplest life form contains the information-equivalent of
1,000 encyclopedias. Theists believe only an intelligent being can
create a life form containing the equivalent of 1,000 encyclopedias.
Atheists believe non-intelligent natural forces can do it. Theists have
evidence to support their conclusion. Since atheists don't have any such
evidence, their belief requires a lot more faith.

So not only does the belief in the existence of God have evidence, the
belief that God does not exist requires a lot more faith!

I just don't have enough faith to believe that God does not exist.
