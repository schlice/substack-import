**If someone tries to steal my dog from within my fenced yard, can I
legally shoot the attempting thief?**

I get the snark from the other answerers, but I can see a way in which
you could misunderstand when to use deadly force.

There is one circumstance in which you can use deadly force to stop
someone fleeing: ***kidnapping***. In many jurisdictions, you can use
any force, up to and including deadly force, to stop a kidnapping. But
all states are different; be sure you review your state laws before you
shoot at a kidnapper. If you own a gun, you should have already printed
off and practically memorized the laws related to using your gun where
you live.

That said, your dog is not a person. Legally speaking, your dog is
property, not people. Therefore, the person is committing a ***theft***,
not a ***kidnapping***. You cannot use deadly force to stop a theft.
