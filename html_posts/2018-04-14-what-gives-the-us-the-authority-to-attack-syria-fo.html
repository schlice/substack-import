**What gives the US the authority to attack Syria for using chemical
weapons when the US has used chemical weapons in the past?**

Article II, Section 2 of the US Constitution.

This is the "Commander in Chief" clause. It states that \"\[t\]he
President shall be Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United
States." It does not say that you can only strike a nation if you have
never done the same thing in the past.

Current understanding of the relationship between the Commander in Chief
clause and Congress' ability to fund and declare war is that the
President has "first strike" authority, but Congress must authorize
continued military operations. Indeed, the War Powers Act confirms this
understanding.

It sounds like you are probably asking about "moral authority" instead
of "legal authority," however. Morally, the United States has not used
chemical weapons since the Chemical Weapons Convention banned them for
all UN member nations. The US has every right to enforce the Chemical
Weapons Convention.
