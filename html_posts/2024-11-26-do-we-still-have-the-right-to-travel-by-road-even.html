Yes, you still have the right to travel by road. The government simply
limits what you must do in order to **operate a motor vehicle on a
public road**.

You can travel *on a bicycle* by road.

You can travel *using your feet* by road.

You can even travel *as a passenger* in any motor vehicle on any road.

Governments only require you to pass tests, obtain licenses, insurance,
and registration when you are ***operating a motor vehicle*** on a
public road. Wearing safety gear is only applicable when operating a
motorcycle or a bicycle on public roads.

But "traveling" using **any other method besides "driving a car"
(legally known as "operating a motor vehicle") does not require any of
the conditions you listed.**
