<h2>Answer Comment</h2>

**Content:** [Yes, it is not as easy for a gay couple to bind their
lives the same way that married couples do, but I think you are slightly
overstating the consequences for the gay couple. You need a healthcare
durable power of attorney at the hospital (one or two pages). You need
to have survivorship documents when buying a house or getting a mortgage
(no more than 5 pages). And these documents can be maintained online,
already signed and authenticated, and delivered to anyone with an email
address within seconds, using a smartphone.\
\
Since marriage in the state sense (not the religious sense at all) is
only about creating generativity for children, gay couples who desire
the right to marry simply to make paperwork easier are fooling
themselves. First, in order to enter into an institution that makes no
sense for them is to lie about why marriage exists in the first place.
Second, because heterosexual marriage often fails is not a reason to
further erode the institution. And why would a gay couple want to pay
extra taxes and make dissolution of their union a lengthy and costly
proposition? I really think you overstate the \"benefits\" of marriage.\
\
What gays do benefit from is the psychological and psychic ratification
by the government that a gay relationship is on par with a heterosexual
relationship. This perceived psychic benefit comes at great cost to the
whole of society.]{.rendered_qtext}
