I was going to agree, but these two things are completely different.

It's like saying "If Republicans are for forcing a woman to carry a
child under any circumstances, then why would they be against putting
pineapple on a pizza?"

They are two totally separate things. This is a logical fallacy called a
"false equivalence." The reason why logical fallacies are bad is that
they nearly always produce ***incorrect outcomes*** (except in cases
where they accidentally stumble upon the truth).

So let's review the two points you've tried to make in this question:

1.  Republicans are for forcing a woman to carry a child under any
    circumstances
2.  Republicans are against programs to help the poor.

\

I don't know why you are looking at Republicans. There are plenty of
pro-choice Republicans out there. But I suppose the Republican Party
platform does say this:

> *We proudly stand for families and Life. We believe that the 14th
> Amendment to the Constitution of the United States guarantees that no
> person can be denied Life or Liberty without Due Process, and that the
> States are, therefore, free to pass Laws protecting those Rights.
> After 51 years, because of us, that power has been given to the States
> and to a vote of the People. We will oppose Late Term Abortion, while
> supporting mothers and policies that advance Prenatal Care, access to
> Birth Control, and IVF (fertility treatments).*

So Republicans, clearly, support the idea that **states** (and the will
of the people in those states) get to decide **for themselves** whether
they will use state funding to support abortions. **At the same time**,
Republicans support policies that advance prenatal care, access to birth
control, and IVF.

So your contention that Republicans are for forcing women to carry a
child under any circumstance is clearly incorrect. The Republican party
platform says clearly that Republicans are for allowing states to decide
whether they will use state funds to pay for abortions. The rest is up
to you. No one is forcing anyone to do anything they don't willingly
choose to do, least of which is Republicans.

I don't think Republicans are against programs to help the poor. Many
Republican lawmakers argue that their policies aim to **empower the
poor** through j**ob creation** and **economic growth, reduced
government dependency, and work requirements** for benefits like
Medicaid and SNAP.

So it's not necessarily that Republicans are against all programs to
help the poor. Republicans are against wasteful programs which do some
good but also have a great deal of slop and waste which is what got us
in this mess in the first place.

\

It's not always a matter of "care" vs. "neglect." It's often a clash of
**ideologies.** Republicans tend to favor **limited government** and
**personal responsibility** and Democrats emphasize **redistribution**
and **social safety nets,** but both approaches aim to help the poor.
They just go about them in different ways.

So while Republicans may believe their approach helps the poor by
promoting independence, you may see it as **undermining essential
support systems**.

Both want to help, but both have different ideas about what constitutes
help. Republicans want to offer a "hand up" while Democrats want to
offer a "hand out." Both help, but in different ways.
