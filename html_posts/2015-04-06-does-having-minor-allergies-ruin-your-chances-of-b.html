**Content:** [The qualifications state that you must \"have no history
of hay fever, asthma, or allergies after age 12.\" If you had childhood
allergies and you had medical treatment to correct them (i.e. allergy
shots), this is generally waiverable. If you have history of allergies
of any kind since age 12, this is not generally waiverable.\
