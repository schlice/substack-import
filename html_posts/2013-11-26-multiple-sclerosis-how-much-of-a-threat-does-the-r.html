<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [In the MS world specifically, gene therapy would have to<br>provide something more than our current complement of medications do in<br>controlling the disease progression and limiting the duration and<br>severity of exacerbations. In the MS world also, there\'s no medication<br>that has treatment cornered. There are different medication pathways<br>(injection, infusion, oral, etc) and different efficacies for the<br>different formulations. People respond to the treatments differently, so<br>a broad range of medications is useful.\<br>\<br>So the \"something more\" that gene therapy would have to provide would<br>be reversal of disease damage, which we currently do not have, or,<br>ultimately, a cure.\<br>\<br>To answer your question more specifically, it sounds like you are saying<br>that \"Big Pharma\" would be worried that gene therapy would undercut<br>their profits. This assumes that the MS market is a huge moneymaker, a<br>cash cow, for them. I can assure you it is not. The market segment is<br>too small and the drugs themselves cannot be made cheaply (yet). The<br>drugs are very expensive, it\'s true, but a moneymaker would have to<br>have a big profit margin and a huge user base.\<br>\<br>An example of such a drug in the marketplace today would be cholesterol<br>drugs. Interestingly, a physician-initiated study showed that statin<br>drugs like these, in high doses, can shrink MS lesions, which are<br>primarily made of cholesterol. You will never see this become an<br>approved use for statin drugs because the drug companies will not invest<br>in the clinical trials because the payout doesn\'t justify the expense.<br>The MS community is too small a patient base to invest the money in,<br>when the heart disease community is the real cash cow for statins. Big<br>patient base, and a drug that can be made relatively cheaply is what a<br>true cash cow is, one that they would readily defend.\<br>\<br>Gene therapy in particular, and MS drugs in general, do not fit that<br>profile.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
