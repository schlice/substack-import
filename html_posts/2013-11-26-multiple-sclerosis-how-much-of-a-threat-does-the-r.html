**Content:** [In the MS world specifically, gene therapy would have to
provide something more than our current complement of medications do in
controlling the disease progression and limiting the duration and
severity of exacerbations. In the MS world also, there\'s no medication
that has treatment cornered. There are different medication pathways
(injection, infusion, oral, etc) and different efficacies for the
different formulations. People respond to the treatments differently, so
a broad range of medications is useful.\
\
So the \"something more\" that gene therapy would have to provide would
be reversal of disease damage, which we currently do not have, or,
ultimately, a cure.\
\
To answer your question more specifically, it sounds like you are saying
that \"Big Pharma\" would be worried that gene therapy would undercut
their profits. This assumes that the MS market is a huge moneymaker, a
cash cow, for them. I can assure you it is not. The market segment is
too small and the drugs themselves cannot be made cheaply (yet). The
drugs are very expensive, it\'s true, but a moneymaker would have to
have a big profit margin and a huge user base.\
\
An example of such a drug in the marketplace today would be cholesterol
drugs. Interestingly, a physician-initiated study showed that statin
drugs like these, in high doses, can shrink MS lesions, which are
primarily made of cholesterol. You will never see this become an
approved use for statin drugs because the drug companies will not invest
in the clinical trials because the payout doesn\'t justify the expense.
The MS community is too small a patient base to invest the money in,
when the heart disease community is the real cash cow for statins. Big
patient base, and a drug that can be made relatively cheaply is what a
true cash cow is, one that they would readily defend.\
\
Gene therapy in particular, and MS drugs in general, do not fit that
profile.]{.rendered_qtext}
