I am the son and grandson of a police officer. I'm a military veteran.
I'm a sharpshooter. I was actually in the Sheriff's academy for a few
months preparing to be sworn as a Reserve Deputy (until a family tragedy
caused me to drop out and devote the next few years to the work of
rebuilding). The Reserve Deputy corps is essentially the modernization
of the "Sheriff's posse" from 60 years ago. Walking toward the fire
doesn't faze me in the least.

**And there is no way on God's green earth that I would ever volunteer
for something like this, even if we were sworn as deputies before we
walked in.**

Any private gun owner (and especially those who hold concealed carry
permits) knows this very famous warning: "every bullet you fire has a
lawyer attached to it." This phrase means that as a civilian, any time
you discharge a firearm outside of the range, you can virtually bet on
the fact that a lawsuit will follow.

And volunteering to act as a "posse" means that, even if you have the
requisite "swearing in" as a deputy (and you may even have the badge to
prove it), that alone doesn't make you a **qualified** law enforcement
officer. You can bet that any action undertaken by this "posse" would
immediately come under some very intense scrutiny. Lawsuits would
abound, and it's not even guaranteed that the swearing-in authority who
gave you that shiny badge would be able to defend you. The state has
established standards for law enforcement training. **And you haven't
met those standards**. It's highly likely that your "authority" as a law
enforcement officer would be questioned, and quite possibly rejected, by
the very state that you were attempting to help.

Unless you attended all of the training before you began as a "posse"
(which today, we'd call a Reserve officer), you probably wouldn't have
the state backing behind your "authority." For context, the Reserves in
Colorado (where I have experience) would have had to attend over 300
hours of training on all manner of police topics such as firearms
training, driving training, arrest control, and a whole ton of classroom
hours. Incidentally, all of that training happens on nights and
weekends, as Reserve officers already have full time jobs.

Anyway, back to training. People have ignited entire political movements
citing the lack of training of our armed law enforcement officers.
***And your answer to that is to gather a group of half-baked civilians,
and give them badges and guns, and send them packing into the worst of
the worst territories the US has to offer???***

How does that even make *sense*?

The problem we have is not that the police are unwilling to go into
those "most violent areas" in Chicago.

The problem is that those police officers have commanders and civic
leaders in charge of them **who do not possess the political will to
allow them to go in there and do their jobs.**

A legally-tenuous "volunteer posse" is not the answer.

Better leaders is.

Original question:

If Chicago law enforcement called for a volunteer "posse" to help them
secure the most violent areas there, would you step up?
