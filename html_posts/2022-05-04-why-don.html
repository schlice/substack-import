It depends on the payment processor the HOA uses. Not all payment
processors take credit cards. Usually, the credit card company charges a
fee to the payment processor, and that just gets passed back on down the
line to the consumer. Not all payment processors like to offer credit
cards, because they would then have to charge a fee to do so.

However, here's a life hack for you: you can use
[[Plastiq](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=69c1dc&url=https://www.plastiq.com/){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="plastiq.com"}]{.qlink_container} or
[[Melio](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=9ae99a&url=https://www.meliopayments.com/){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="meliopayments.com"}]{.qlink_container} (not sponsors) to
basically pay almost anyone, using a credit card, even if they don't
accept credit cards. But be cautious when doing this. Plastiq, for
example, will charge you 2.85% of your charge in fees, so if you're
paying a \$200 HOA bill, you'll pay an extra \$5.70 in fees. And if you
can't pay your credit card bill in full, you'll pay interest on all of
that, which can add up quickly. Also, while most credit cards will
charge this as a purchase, some may charge this as a "cash advance," so
you won't have the 30 day leeway before interest starts.

You can add a debit card to Plastiq, but why would you pay the 1% fee to
do that when you could just cut your own check or probably pay with
eCheck or ACH or wire transfer?
