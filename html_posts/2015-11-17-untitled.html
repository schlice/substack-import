<h2>Answer Comment</h2>
<div>

**Content:** [The big difference: culture.\
\
The UK has been used to living under some form of \"rule\" for millenia.
Citizens of the Realm are more likely to accede to governmental
authority. They are more likely to \"work in partnership\" with the
government, which the government also finds (unsurprisingly) expedient
and useful in asserting its control over the citizenry.\
\
The US, which has only been around for a few hundred years, has built
its foundation on the likes of Sir William Blackstone\'s Commentaries on
the Laws of England. I\'m certain you are aware that while Blackstone
was penning his Commentaries, he was actually a member of Parliament,
and criticized the colonists for engaging in their treasonous
activities, probably one of the greatest ironies in American history.\
\
Blackstone\'s ideas surrounding the source of law, the morality of
insurrection, \"life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness,\" and the
origin and the nature of rights had such a profound influence on the
early colonists, that they became much of the foundation for the United
States Declaration of Independence, and eventually, the Constitution. In
fact, copies of Blackstone\'s Commentaries were distributed as widely in
America as they were in England. The ideas of no taxation without
representation, unalienable property rights, and most importantly, the
unalienable right to self-defense were a few of the hallmarks of the new
Constitution.\
\
Americans have patterned their lives and their identities around these
ideals. And considering that the right to keep and bear arms to ensure
that unalienable right to self-defense was penned directly into the Bill
of Rights, never to be infringed, means that the American psyche is a
decidedly \"anti-government\" one, which says, \"I am supposed to depend
on ***myself first*** for my defense, not government.\" To that end, the
right to keep and bear arms is so fundamental, that it was written into
the Constitution.\
\
Can you honestly look at this comparison and still tell me that you can
compare the societies in the UK and the US? Besides both having U in
their acronyms (and arguably both speaking the Queen\'s English), they
couldn\'t be more different.]{.rendered_qtext}
