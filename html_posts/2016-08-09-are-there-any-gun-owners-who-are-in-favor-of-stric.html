Absolutely.

One of the old tropes of the gun crowd has been "enforce the laws we
already have." But no one really says what that means. Except me and a
few others, of course, but a paltry few of us.

Primarily, we need to start coming down **hard** on people who use guns
to commit crimes. Oftentimes (too often, in fact), the gun charge is
pled away during plea bargaining to get a guaranteed conviction on the
actual crime. The prosecutor says, "I'll drop the gun charge if you
plead guilty to first-degree robbery." It's used as a bargaining chip,
and the criminals know this. So they use guns with impunity. If you
truly want to stop criminals from using guns, we must get tougher with
criminals who use guns to commit crimes. And if DA's will not do it of
their own volition, we must mandate it through state law:

- If a gun is used in the commission of a crime, it automatically adds
  an aggravating factor to the crime committed.
- Additionally, the crime of "Commission of a Crime With a Gun" should
  also be a charge that must be added to the list of charges. To be
  fair, the gun would have to be part of the crime (the criminal
  threatened someone with the gun, or actually discharged it).
- Neither the aggravating condition nor the crime of commission of a
  crime with a gun can be waived. The DA would be required to charge the
  criminal with these.
- Neither of the two conditions can be lessened in plea bargaining.

I'm kinda up in the air on mandatory sentencing, but there should be
minimum sentences required. For example, a judge couldn't apply a 30-day
sentence fulfilled by time served for committing a crime with a gun. I'd
say a minimum 10 year sentence just for using a gun should be required.
So something like 10--20 just for using a gun, sentences required to run
consecutively, not concurrently.

At the same time, we decriminalize drug possession/use charges. That's
not because I want people to become drug addicts. It's because drug
addicts should not be **prisoners.** They should be **patients**. Get
them the help they need. Don't lock them up. We don't decriminalize drug
sale, or PID (possesion with intent to distribute) charges. This should
reduce the load on the jails, so we can keep the *real* criminals in
jail longer.
