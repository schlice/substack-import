It's so commonly misdiagnosed because it's easy to misdiagnose.

POTS is generally associated with what is called a **pathophysiological
mechanism**. This means an area where pathology and physiology converge.
In other words, POTS is generally associated with disordered
physiological processes that cause, result from, or are otherwise
associated with a disease or injury.

In other words, you must have had one of the associated diseases or
injuries before the physiological disorder begins to emerge. It's not a
straightforward cause, and it's certainly not easy to spot. Its symptoms
look like a thousand other diseases or conditions.

Doctors who are unaware of POTS will really only reach that diagnosis
once they have excluded other causes of reflex tachycardia upon
standing. And since some of the treatments are similar, they may never
properly diagnose the condition.
