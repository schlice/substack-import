title: "What would a gun owner do if I set up a HOA in his neighborhood, and made it a rule that no guns are allowed anymore? I would make him personally deliver all his guns to me, along with a hand-written apology for owning them. Is this legal?"

I love how gun control advocates bend themselves into pretzels to try to
legally force law abiding citizens to be "forced" to give up their
legally owned firearms.

So here's the problems with your "plan":

1.  If I already own my house, you can't set up a HOA that he *must* be
    a part of. You can only set up a *voluntary* HOA, not a *mandatory*
    HOA. Mandatory HOAs can only be created when the builder is
    developing the neighborhood, and the HOA is put in place before any
    homes are purchased. So your gun owner homeowner has no legal
    obligation to join the HOA.
2.  The HOA would not have a valid reason to restrict firearms inside of
    residents' homes. Despite what the screaming trolls on the Internet
    say, the HOA doesn't control your life. The HOA maintains home
    values by controlling the appearance of the outside of your home and
    managing the common areas, not by managing what goes on inside.
3.  Transfers of firearms as you are describing are regulated by law,
    and may be illegal where you live. Universal background checks would
    mean that *you* would have to have a background check performed
    against you before you could receive the firearms. Other states
    require a FFL to perform the transfer (including background checks),
    and that's not free. The HOA would have to pay for that.
4.  And why are *you* a better handler of the firearms than *he*? What
    makes *you* better qualified to handle a firearm than *he*?
5.  Why does someone need to apologize for exercising a Constitutional
    right? This part makes absolutely no sense to me. And why must it be
    hand-written? No one writes letters by hand anymore.
6.  And last (but certainly not least), it's a Constitutional right.
    Your HOA rule would violate the Constitution, so it's pretty much
    DOA anyway. The HOA doesn't have a compelling interest which would
    be greater than the rights granted by the Constitution.

It sounds like you just want to make life difficult for the gun owner,
with no real logic behind why you're doing it. It's almost like you want
to exact some form of revenge against a person who is merely exercising
his Constitutional rights.

In other words, *you don't like guns and you want to find a legal way to
make gun owners suffer.*

I'll just leave that right where it is.
