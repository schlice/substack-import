Do you always do or not do things based on their reputation alone? Sure,
there are indeed some problem HOAs out there. They've been thoroughly
mocked and derided sufficiently in the movies and on TV that people
recognize them and largely have corrected them.

Primarily, people don't like HOAs because 1. they don't like to be told
what to do and not do with their own homes, and 2. the HOA is empowered,
by you, to provide consequences for your actions, and people don't like
consequences for their actions.

Secondarily, the HOA is run by *people*. People are fallible. People
sometimes have different ideas about how to address issues. Some people
are just so weird when it comes to whether or not the HOA should issue a
fine. Some people never want to levy fines, and others are all too quick
to jump right to fines. Having smart leadership, and a good property
manager, are essential, and it is a rare combination when an HOA has
both.

In general, HOAs are beneficial, and help to keep neighborhoods looking
good. They also maintain the common areas that all homeowners in the
neighborhood enjoy.

Some HOAs are, indeed, voluntary, and you only join them if you want the
benefits they are offering (like club membership, etc). Other HOAs are
mandatory, and you automatically join them when you buy a house in a
particular neighborhood, as the HOA is attached to the house.
