Yes they do, and they call the consecrated bread the "Eucharist." It is
central to the Catholic faith. From the CCC:

The process by which the bread and wine turn into Jesus' body and blood
is called **transubstantiation**. The physical form of bread and wine
remain, but the *substance* is Jesus.

They use a few Biblical references to prove this to themselves, but they
use those references *in isolation*. They fail to consider the entirety
of the Bible when they cite their sources.

(Note: This is a rather long exegesis, but understanding where the
Catholics went wrong is important for us).

The seminal passage from the Bible the Catholics use is John 6:52--53:

> *Then the Jews began to argue sharply among themselves, "How can this
> man give us his flesh to eat?" Jesus said to them, "Very truly I tell
> you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood,
> you have no life in you.*

Sounds pretty convincing, doesn't it? Why wouldn't you believe the plain
words in the Bible?

Well, **context is key.** ***Because text, without context, is just
pretext.***

So let's review the **context** of the passage in John 6. We pick up the
story right after Jesus fed the 5000. The crowd follows Jesus to
Capernaum and then this conversation takes place: (for ease of following
along, I will leave the verse numbers in.

> *25 "When they found him on the other side of the lake, they asked
> him, "Rabbi, when did you get here?" 26 Jesus answered, "Very truly I
> tell you, you are looking for me, not because you saw the signs I
> performed but because you ate the loaves and had your fill.*

The people just said, "Rabbi, when did you get here?" Since they didn't
even ask for a repeat of the fish and loaves miracle, it appears to be
an odd response from Jesus. Unless of course He knew their hearts, which
He does. So, He says to them:

> *27 Do not work for food that spoils, but for food that endures to
> eternal life, which the Son of Man will give you. For on him God the
> Father has placed his seal of approval."*

Their true intentions are identified so they come out with it:

> *28 Then they asked him, "What must we do to do the works God
> requires?"*

What they are really asking is what must we do to keep our bellies full.

> *29 Jesus answered, "The work of God is this: to believe in the one he
> has sent."*

Here, Jesus establishes the quintessential "work" that God requires: to
believe in the one He has sent -- Jesus Christ. Jesus is standing in
front of them having just provided a sign, an affirmation that he is the
one God has sent. What does the crowd do?

> *30 So they asked him, "What sign then will you give that we may see
> it and believe you? What will you do? 31 Our ancestors ate the manna
> in the wilderness; as it is written: 'He gave them bread from heaven
> to eat.'"*

He literally just fed 5000 people with 2 fish and 5 loaves, all they
cared to eat, with several baskets full left over. I think He has
already given sufficient signs to validate who He is. But the crowd is
playing a game here -- trying to entice Jesus to miraculously feed them
again. That is all they are interested in. They are not interested in
whom the sign(s) affirm, they just want their bellies filled.

Because they are ignoring the quintessential point -- since they only
care about their physical sustenance (not their spiritual sustenance)
Jesus then takes what they are asking for and uses it to point to
Himself, metaphorically.

> *32 Jesus said to them, "Very truly I tell you, it is not Moses who
> has given you the bread from heaven, but it is my Father who gives you
> the true bread from heaven. 33 For the bread of God is the bread that
> comes down from heaven and gives life to the world."*

The "bread that comes down from heaven" here is Christ Himself. But it
seems that they don't really care. They just want their bellies filled.
They think Jesus is talking about actual physical bread, like the manna
for their ancestors..

> *34 "Sir," they said, "always give us this bread."*

They seem intent to not acknowledge what Jesus is referring to. Perhaps
it's on purpose, or perhaps it's because they just cannot see. Jesus
then declares who He is. He is not simply a sign from God, he is both
the sign and God.

> *35 Then Jesus declared, "I am the bread of life. Whoever comes to me
> will never go hungry, and whoever believes in me will never be
> thirsty."*

Notice the language. Here, there is no correlation with eating or
drinking. Simply, "whoever comes to me, whoever believes in me."
"Eating" his flesh and drinking his blood is a type and a picture of
just that. Eating and drinking is what sustains one physically, like
coming to and believing in Christ will sustain one spiritually. One
simply reflects or reminds us of the other. *One is not the other.*

> *36 But as I told you, you have seen me and still you do not believe.*

Jesus then provides the reason as to why they just can't seem to
understand.

> *37 All those the Father gives me will come to me, and whoever comes
> to me I will never drive away.*

Here scripture is clear (it echoes Ephesians 2:8-9) that it is God who
does the gifting of faith -- He is the one who gives those who will be
saved to Christ.

> *38 For I have come down from heaven not to do my will but to do the
> will of him who sent me. 39 And this is the will of him who sent me,
> that I shall lose none of all those he has given me but raise them up
> at the last day. 40 For my Father's will is that everyone who looks to
> the Son and believes in him shall have eternal life, and I will raise
> them up at the last day."*

The crowd seem to understand what Jesus is saying, just not the
significance of it, because they say, "Is this not Jesus, the son of
Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How can he now say, 'I came
down from heaven'?"

It is because they are not given by the Father that they refuse to
accept what Jesus is telling them -- he is the Messiah.

> *43 "Stop grumbling among yourselves," Jesus answered. 44 "No one can
> come to me unless the Father who sent me draws them, and I will raise
> them up at the last day. 45 It is written in the Prophets: Everyone
> who has heard the Father and learned from him comes to me. 46 No one

> down from heaven, which anyone may eat and not die. 51 I am the living
> bread that came down from heaven. Whoever eats this bread will live
> forever. This bread is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the
> world."*

Jesus is referring to the work he will complete on the cross. So, Jesus
very clearly equates believing in who he is and what he will do, with
"feeding" on him.

Man's flesh is corrupted -- it's sinful. As such man stands in judgment
before God. God (the Son) takes on human flesh to deal with that
corruption. Christ is sinless (in his human flesh) but He takes on the
punishment for all our sins in His flesh on the cross. His body is
broken, and His blood is shed as the perfect sacrifice. But because He
is pure (humanly speaking) and eternal (divinely speaking) He burns up
both our sin and the consequence of our sin -- death. Christ partakes in
human nature and redeems it, so we, being enjoined to Him through belief
and the power of the Holy Spirit become partakers of His divine nature.
As such our sins are dealt with and His righteousness is imputed to us
because of that. This is what **salvation** is all about. And Jesus is
categorical about his work on the cross in doing this.

Given what the crowd asks for, Jesus uses that to point to Himself and
prophesy about His future work on the cross. The whole context is belief
in Him as the Son of God so that we may have life (which John echoes
twice at the end of his gospel without even referring to the Eucharist).
What Jesus doesn't do here is specify transubstantiation, because
transubstantiation is not in view here, neither is it biblical.

Again, since the crowd are not "given" to Christ by the Father, this
just adds to their confusion.

> *52 Then the Jews began to argue sharply among themselves, "How can
> this man give us his flesh to eat?"*

Yes, when not understood to be a type and a picture it really doesn't
make sense. Jesus here has the perfect opportunity to explain how this
will work, but He doesn't. Because they aren't given, He simply
emphasizes what He has already claimed.

> *53 Jesus said to them, "Very truly I tell you, unless you eat the
> flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you have no life in you.
> 54 Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I
> will raise them up at the last day. 55 For my flesh is real food and
> my blood is real drink. 56 Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood
> remains in me, and I in them. 57 Just as the living Father sent me and
> I live because of the Father, so the one who feeds on me will live
> because of me. 58 This is the bread that came down from heaven. Your
> ancestors ate manna and died, but whoever feeds on this bread will
> live forever." 59 He said this while teaching in the synagogue in
> Capernaum.*

His disciples are even confused since they say, "This is a hard
teaching. Who can accept it?" It's interesting to see what Jesus says
here in response:

> *61 Aware that his disciples were grumbling about this, Jesus said to
> them, "Does this offend you? 62 Then what if you see the Son of Man
> ascend to where he was before!"*

He doesn't rephrase the discourse about bread/flesh, wine/blood so the
disciples will gain a better understanding. In fact, He doesn't even
address that at all. What He does speak to is the claim that He is from
the Father. That claim is what offends them, since He then says
essentially, "would you believe that I am from the Father if you saw me
ascend back to the Father, where I was before, as I have been claiming?"
***THAT*** is the key point in this passage. And Jesus is obviously
talking about His ascension after His COMPLETED work on the cross. He
continues:

> *63 The Spirit gives life; the flesh counts for nothing. The words I
> have spoken to you---they are full of the Spirit and life. 64 Yet
> there are some of you who do not believe." For Jesus had known from
> the beginning which of them did not believe and who would betray him.
> 65 He went on to say, "This is why I told you that no one can come to
> me unless the Father has enabled them."*

If the flesh counts for nothing, then why does eating it give you life?
It must not be the flesh that Jesus is talking about eating then, is it.

And once He says this, how do the "given," "called" disciples respond?
Do they say, "Lord, we're still confused, please tell us what it means
to eat your flesh and drink your blood." Not at all:

> *68 \[...\] "Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal
> life. 69 We have come to believe and to know that you are the Holy One
> of God."*

We can talk about the exegesis surrounding the use of the words "eat"
and "drink" in reference to learning and understanding in the Bible
(examples are many, we can discuss if it is still a question) but
"eating" the words is a common understanding of truly, deeply learning
in the Bible.

You can see that Jesus was trying to use the "eating" and "drinking" to
teach about belief in Him, not as a directive to eat His flesh and drink
His blood.
