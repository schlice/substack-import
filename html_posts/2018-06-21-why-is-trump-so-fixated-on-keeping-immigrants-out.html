**Why is Trump so fixated on keeping immigrants out of our country? Why
does he assume that everyone who comes here is a criminal and rapist?
Most of us were immigrants at one point in our history, and this country
was built by being a melting pot.**

This is an important question, and it goes to the heart of what we mean
by intentional conflation.

The people who feed you this information (primarily Democrats and the
news media complex) are intentionally conflating two terms:
*immigration* and *illegal immigration*.

Clearly, you believe that Trump's attacks on *illegal immigration* mean
he is attacking *immigration* in general. In fact, if you were to search
Trump quotes about immigration, you'd only find quotes where he is
discussing *illegal* immigration.

So, let's be sure we understand what we're talking about. *Immigration*
is the process by which a person leaves one country and becomes a
citizen of another. The legal process of immigration is a long one. It
involves agencies of the losing and gaining countries talking to each
other to get information across official channels about you. This is
important for the gaining country. They need to find out if you're a
criminal. Perhaps you're evading capture in your home country. The list
of "perhaps" entries could go on for pages. But the bottom line is that
**the gaining country gets to determine who comes in and who does not.**
Now, before you start to think about how "unfair" that may be, remember
that the gaining country does this because it has to consider the impact
of adding to its population. It has an impact on every public service
that the government offers: roads, utilities, hospitals, fire, police,
etc. The government has official numbers of people it will allow to
emigrate annually.

There are two ways in which you can emigrate to a new country. You can
follow the process above, which is indeed a long one. Or, you can simply
enter the country in a legal manner (like on a tourist visa) and then
**never leave**. In fact, overstaying a visa is one of the number one
ways illegal immigrants end up in this country. You could also
unlawfully cross a border not at a border control entry point (like what
happens across our southern border).

Trump does a good job talking about "illegals" which means "illegal
immigrants." He is **not** talking about "legal immigrants" which means
people who followed the process and entered the country legally and
became naturalized citizens. He is only talking about *illegal*
immigrants. Trump's detractors (including the media) like to conflate
*illegal immigration* with *immigration in general,* which leads you to
believe that Trump hates all immigration, which is simply untrue.

So let's answer your questions:

> **Why is Trump so fixated on keeping immigrants out of our country?**

He is not. He is fixated on keeping ***illegal*** **immigrants** ****
out of our country. Come in through the door, not over the wall.

> **Why does he assume that everyone who comes here is a criminal and
> rapist?**

I know he had some rhetoric in his campaign speeches about Mexico
sending us criminals and rapists, but he doesn't believe that everyone
who comes here is a criminal. That's simply misunderstanding what he's
saying. Again, he's only talking about ***illegal*** **immigrants**.
Many of them are indeed criminals and rapists. Many more are simply
people fleeing poor economic conditions and oppressive regimes in their
home countries, and they can't afford to wait the amount of time it
takes to become a legal citizen. This is a big issue and it does need to
be addressed.

> **Most of us were immigrants at one point in our history, and this
> country was built by being a melting pot.**

Yes, our nation is a nation of immigrants. But we are a nation of
***legal*** **immigrants**, who, granted, came into the country at a
time when immigration was much easier than it is today. We had unlimited
land and resources and we'd take anyone in the early 1900s. Times are
different now. We can't simply take anyone. Our economy is already
feeling the strain of illegal immigrants on our infrastructure, and
fixing it is one of the reasons Trump was elected.

As for your mention of "melting pot," we are most certainly not a
melting pot anymore. It's almost considered *racist* to even mention
"melting pot." The whole idea of being an American has been supplanted
by *multiculturalism*, another winning idea foisted upon us by
Progressives. But I won't get into that here, because that's not what
this question was about. If you want to know my thoughts about how "The
Great American Melting Pot" has been supplanted by *multiculturalism,*
you'll have to ask that question.
