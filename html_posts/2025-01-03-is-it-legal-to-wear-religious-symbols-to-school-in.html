There is no "separation of church and state" in the Constitution.

And ironically, the idea about the separation was to *protect religion
from government interference*, not to keep religion out of government.
Roger Williams, the founder of Rhode Island, was the first to use the
phrase, opining that there should be "a wall or hedge of separation"
between the "wilderness of the world" and "the garden of the church."
Williams believed that any government involvement in the church would
corrupt the church.

Of course, the most famous use of the phrase was by Thomas Jefferson in
his 1802 letter to the Danbury Baptist Association. He said that when
Americans adopted the establishment clause in the First Amendment, they
built a "wall of separation between the church and state." Again, the
idea was to keep *government* out of the *church,* not the other way
round.

So **yes, wearing religious symbols in school is absolutely legal**, and
is protected by the First Amendment's freedom of expression, as well as
the freedom to practice any religion you choose, or no religion at all.

**That said**, state Boards of Education or individual schools are
indeed allowed to adopt dress codes which may include disallowing any
religious symbology at all, and this doesn't violate the First Amendment
*so long as they do it uniformly.* In other words, they can't ban
crosses but allow the Star of David. They would have to uniformly ban
all religious symbology on student clothing as part of a dress code in
order for it to be legal. The ban must be specific to creating an
appropriate learning environment and keeping it free from distractions,
and must be limited in scope so as to only address the singular area of
symbology on clothing.

Schools often run into trouble in this area not in regards to clothing,
but when they permit *some* displays of religion in schools and then
deny others. Schools cannot make permanent displays of religious
symbols, but they can, in limited circumstances, have holiday displays
which include religious symbols. In general, courts have held that
holiday displays in public schools may include religious symbols if the
displays are *temporary*, require *no active participation* in any
religious activity, include *diverse religious, cultural, and ethnic
symbols*, and *support valid educational goals*.
