The first thought that comes to mind is they should pre-order their
divorce attorney while they order their marriage license, because that's
a recipe for marital failure. They should also sign a pre-nup, because
planning for divorce makes a lot of sense in this situation.

I'm not saying that such a couple *can't* make it work, but in today's
society, people do a lot of different things to make marriage about
something that it was never intended to be about. And when you do that,
your chances for success decline rapidly. Society's way is to remove God
from all of the things that God made for us, and at no time in history
has that ever ended well.

And "not wanting to mix faith and marital life" is the same thing. It's
about as illogical as saying "I don't want to mix coffee with water."
Marriage was *ordained* by God. Marriage was around for thousands of
years before government showed up and co-opted it. Marriage *is* faith.
Marriage, in faith, is about children, and raising them together in a
common household. The Bible is clear about this.

But we've made marriage into a process which is more about **the desires
of adults** rather than **the needs of children**.

Just ask Jonah: ignoring God doesn't ever end well.

Original answer:

Some Christians marry non-Christians on the basis that s/he doesn\'t
want to mix faith and marital life, ignoring God\'s warning not to be
yoked with a non-believer. What thoughts come to you?
