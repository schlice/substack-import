To be fair, you've already done your due diligence. Your MRI doesn't
show the signs of someone with MS, so it is highly unlikely you have MS.

Note that I didn't say "impossible." I only said "highly unlikely." Is
it *possible* to have MS and have no visible lesions on an MRI? Yes, it
is possible.

There are other tests that can add to the body of evidence, such as a
lumbar puncture (i.e. a spinal tap), and VEP (visual evoked potential)
which can also add to the body of evidence. You can talk to your
neurologist about these if you are still concerned.

Remember, MS is a diagnosis of exclusion, so before you can diagnose MS,
you must exclude ***everything*** that can possibly cause your symptoms,
because MS doesn't have any symptoms unique to it.

I would not worry about a particular disease. I would focus on trying to
find the cause for the symptoms you are experiencing. There are many
forms of peripheral neuropathy which can cause leg pain and optic
neuritis.
