**Content:** [1. No police department is going to store anything in
Google Cloud. You can just get that idea out of your head right now. If
anything, police departments will build out new [[Enterprise Hybrid
Clouds](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=e8c79a&url=http://www.emc.com/cloud/hybrid-cloud-computing/index.htm){.external_link

to store the video. Storing the video in the cloud is too risky,
legally, for departments. They will need to store the highest-risk data
in-house.\
\
2. While you\'re close with the total number of police officers in the
United States (it\'s closer to 300,000 uniformed officers now), the
United States does not have one nationalized police force for the entire
country. Remember that the United States is a federation of (mostly)
independent states. Police forces are controlled and funded by the
states. Revenue to run the police department comes from the taxes
collected by the state.\
\
3. You\'re also way off on how much data the cameras actually capture.
You were looking at ***streaming*** data over an Internet connection.
The cameras in question will record 640x480 VGA, 30 FPS, medium-quality
recording, it will take 9 hours to fill the camera internal memory of 8
GB (so less than what you assumed). Assume 25 cameras per shift, three
shifts a day, all filling 8GB camera buffers is 600 GB per day. 30 days
is 36 TB of storage in a month, which matches real-world examples
([[Adam
Christensen](https://www.quora.com/profile/Adam-Christensen-13)]{.qlink_container}
said 60 TB in two months, so that matches). Video needs to be saved for,
at a minimum, one year. Felony videos need to be saved for 10 years. So
we\'re talking roughly 4.3 PB to save all of that video for 10 years.
You can probably shave that back to 4 PB, and with some tiered storage
we can save the older video on lower-cost drives while keeping the
higher-cost (faster) drives for serving the newest data that would
likely be referenced within the first three months.\
\
4. All that said, you\'re WAY off on price. It would be tough to
speculate on numbers, but an Enterprise Hybrid Cloud with at least 4 PB
of storage is going to be over \$1M to build out, and that\'s just for
one large town of just over 500,000 residents. The cost to roll this out
in every department across the country is just staggering. Are residents
really ready to shell out that kind of tax money to just one department?
We have multiple police departments in one jurisdiction, we have over
100 departments in the state alone. *That\'s a lot of money*. Taxpayers
just aren\'t ready to spend all that money on storage. Why? There are
things that taxpayers believe are more important than an Enterprise
Hybrid Cloud for the police department. We can\'t fund our departments
well enough to keep patrols on the street; you really think that
governments are going to put that money towards *data storage*? Not
happening.]{.rendered_qtext}
