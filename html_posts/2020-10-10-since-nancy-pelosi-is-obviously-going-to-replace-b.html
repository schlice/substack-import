**Since Nancy Pelosi is obviously going to replace Biden ASAP with
Kamala if Biden wins, why didn\'t they just run her to begin with?**

I assume you're referring to her 25th Amendment play, making a group who
could legally work with the VP to take Acting President status.

While I don't think that it's going to happen "ASAP," I don't believe
Biden would even complete a single term (if he could get himself
elected, which I also doubt).

Why didn't they run Harris as President? SHE DROPPED OUT!!! Remember the
Democratic primaries? Democratic voters *rejected her overwhelmingly*.
She couldn't poll out of single-digits, and she dropped out before the
first state primaries started taking place. She isn't even wanted by
*her own party!*

But the Progressive wing of the party, they know better than *even the
Democratic voters.* They knew that the only way they could get her in
was to firmly attach her to the coattails of someone as milquetoast as
Joe Biden, someone who even the moderate Democrats could get behind.
Clearly, she was rejected by the voters. But if *we* want to make her
President, we can attach her to Biden. He's already showing signs of
failing health. She's a shoo-in. Then she can appoint another Socialist
as VP (Bernie?), and we can fundamentally transform America into the
Democratic Socialist paradise we've always dreamed of.
