An excellent question. A bit of a loaded question, but still an
excellent one. Why is it loaded? Because anyone can go to Google
Translate and translate "the word was a god" from English to Greek and
then delete the "a" and see what happens. The reason the question is
being asked at all is more about Christ's deity than about a Greek
translation.

Allow me to explain. There are no indefinite articles in Greek. The
articles "a" or "an" do not exist in Greek. Therefore, John 1:1 would
look exactly the same if it was translated as "the Word was a God" or
"the Word was God." The indefinite articles are ***added*** by
translators when translating from Greek to English. However, the
addition of the indefinite article "a" makes a ***massive*** difference:
one says that Jesus was a created being, and the other says that Jesus
is God. There are no other choices.

This leads us to the \$64,000 question (yes, I did just date myself):
***which translation is correct?***

So since there are no indefinite articles in Greek, you have to
determine the correct understanding of the sentence from **context**.
Let's do that then.

There's lots of scholarly work discussing why John 1:1 is translated as
"The Word was God," but in order to discuss those intelligently, one
would have to possess a mastery of Koine Greek, which I do not.
Therefore, let's discuss what we do know which is not related to Greek
translation.

The easiest and most compelling statement is John 1:3.

> All things were made through him, and without him was not any thing
> made that was made. (ESV)

This verse is crucial to interpreting John 1:1, because it says very
clearly that if it had a beginning at all, Jesus made it. Therefore, can
Jesus be a created being? No, because He would have to exist before He
existed. If **everything** that was created was created through Him,
then He must have existed before everything which was created. If that's
true, then Jesus was not created; He must be eternal. And if Jesus is
eternal, then Jesus is God. There is literally no other option. Either
Jesus is a created being, or Jesus is God.

John 1:1, read in the context of John 1:3, is therefore properly
translated as "the Word was God."
