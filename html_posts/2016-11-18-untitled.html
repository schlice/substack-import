To be fair, I think the "assaults" are few and far between. And some of
them have been shown to be fake. Remember, the media will spin and
sensationalize every itty-bitty story, because they don't want to report
the news: they want to get your eyeballs on their screen. They sell
airtime, that's their job. Their job isn't fairly reporting the news.
It's selling airtime. You'd do well to keep that little grain of salt
handy while you watch those entertainment programs called "newscasts."
And for every assault on a Muslim, gay, or colored person, there have
been equal or greater assaults on people wearing Trump hats (of all
races and genders, by the way), driving in cars with Trump bumper
stickers, or attending Trump rallies. I'm wondering where that falls in
the philosophy of "love trumps hate"

I think a lot of people **want** there to be tension because of a
controversial figure in the White House. It's the pessimist's dream.
"See?!? I told you this Trump thing would be nothing but trouble. But
did you listen to me? NOOOOOOO! You never listen to me!" You know what
they say, some people just want to watch the world burn. Some people
just want to feel justified in their beliefs. Especially Democrats who
didn't want Trump in the White House in the first place.
"Right-fighting" isn't listening. It's listening to **respond** instead
of listening to **understand**.

If we (on both sides of the aisle) spent more effort in trying to listen
so we can understand, instead of listening so we can respond, perhaps
we'd all spend less time assaulting and hating.
