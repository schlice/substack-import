**Content:** [Since you have indicated that you are in the US, the
predominating law is the Americans with Disabilities Act, which controls
how employers hire and what questions they are allowed to ask you
regarding the work.\
\
Basically, the law says that they are not allowed to discriminate
against you based on your condition. In other words, they cannot say,
\"You have MS, therefore you cannot work for us.\"\
\
What they **can** do is to describe the physical requirements of the job
(required to stand for long periods of time, required to occasionally
lift up to 50 pounds, required to have manual dexterity) and they can
require that you affirm you can perform the physical requirements of the
job. They can also test you to ensure you can perform the physical
requirements of the job. For example, I have MS as well, and when I
applied for the police department, I did inform them I have MS but I can
perform all the requirements of the job. The medical clinic did test me
to ensure I could perform the requirements of the job, and they were
satisfied with this. My supervisor is aware of my MS and he just asks
that I be aware of myself and if something needs to be change to ensure
everyone\'s safety (i.e. I need to return to the A/C in a car instead of
being out in the sun all day) that I let him know and he will make the
appropriate manning adjustments. He has no problem with this, and he
doesn\'t look at me as \"less\" of a deputy because of it. All of this
is perfectly legal and conforms with the requirements specified in the
ADA.\
\
In addition, if you require **reasonable accommodations** to accomplish
the requirements of the job, you are still allowed to affirm that you
can perform the physical requirements of the job. For example, if you
require a special wrist rest in order to use a keyboard, or an ergonomic
chair to sit for lengths of time, you can positively affirm that you can
perform the physical requirements of the job, because the accommodations
you require are reasonable. You also don\'t have to request the
accommodations during the hiring process, but in order to get the
accommodations, you will eventually have to reveal your disability and
your required accommodations. An unreasonable accommodation would be one
that significantly changes the business, or requires such significant
cost that it would be prohibitively costly for the business to
implement. In such a circumstance, I would recommend you reveal this
during the hiring process so that they can ensure that your
accommodations are in place for when you start work and that they are
not too onerous on the business.]{.rendered_qtext}
