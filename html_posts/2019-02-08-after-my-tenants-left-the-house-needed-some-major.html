**After my tenants left, the house needed some major repairs and
painting, was it worth renting if it was left like this?**

I don't mean to come down on you because you probably didn't know.

Next time you rent your house, you should collect a security deposit. A
security deposit is money that you have the option of refunding when
your tenant leaves. The deposit would partially cover the costs to
repair any damages done to the unit. If you do your final walkthrough
with your tenants and you see significant damage, you may keep their
security deposit and use it to offset some of the costs of repairing the
unit.

If they return the unit in the same condition in which you rented it,
you can refund their security deposit to them when they leave.

Additionally, if your rental agreement says that they should have
returned the unit to you in the same condition in which they received
it, you can sue them in small claims court to try to recoup some of the
costs of repair.

A well-written rental agreement, and a substantial security deposit,
would have prevented these kinds of issues. If you're going to rent your
unit out again, you might consider having your rental agreement reviewed
by a real estate attorney who specializes in owner/tenant law.
