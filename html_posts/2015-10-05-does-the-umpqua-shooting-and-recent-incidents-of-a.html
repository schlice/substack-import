**Content:** [You definitely touched on a few key points:\
]{.rendered_qtext}

- One or more perceived injustices
- Feelings of social and societal marginalization and isolation\

As well as a few others you didn\'t touch on\

- Media over-coverage of these incidents
- And one other big reason that we\'ll get to in a minute.\

We need to be cautious in discussing the correlation between these
incidents and particular use of a technology (be it a social media
platform or a gun). We don\'t want the standard conflation between
correlation and causation to hinder our line of thinking. We\'ve spent
too much time already focusing on the fact that these shooters used
guns. Remember that Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold actually wanted
Columbine to be a mass-*bombing*, not a mass shooting. It only turned
into a mass shooting when their bombs failed to detonate and flatten the
school as they envisioned.\
\
The social media platform simply allows them to connect more easily and
more anonymously to like-minded individuals, and in some cases, those
individuals *encouraged* the aggressor toward his eventual end goal. But
the technology did not cause the offender to do what he did. They may
have acted as an echo chamber, but the grievance and the perceived
injustice was already there.\
\
The shooters universally felt aggrieved and had nowhere to turn. They
almost universally felt as if life had no meaning. This is certainly an
issue, as most people feel aggrieved at one time or another in their
lives. Most people do not shoot up college campuses. What\'s the
difference?\
\
**We fail to recognize these shooters for what they really are:
terrorists.**\
\
It\'s easy to miss the correlation. When you think of *terrorist,* you
think of ISIS: some guy in a turban and a long knife about to behead
someone on camera in a desert half a world away. Because he\'s out of
sight/out of mind, he could be *anywhere*, hiding behind every bush,
concealed in every shadow. And so we over-react: we nearly strip at the
airport to get through security. We talk about terrorism incessantly in
public buildings, worried about some phantom in the shadow who is never
really there. And yet we miss that mass shootings are exactly the same
thing: terrorism, albeit non-political, but terrorism nevertheless. *The
terrorist uses fear to advance a goal.* We gloss over the fact that this
is also terrorism because the shooter is our neighbor. He\'s a college
kid. He doesn\'t at all look like the bearded goat herder in the desert.
So we try to explain away his actions: easy access to guns did it. Lack
of appropriate mental health care did it. White privilege did it. The
War on Christianity did it.\
\
**International terror groups use fear to exact political goals. Mass
shooters (non-political terrorists) use fear to promote and glamorize
their grievances.**\
\
And it works. **But it doesn\'t sell newspapers or television ad time.**
Gun control sells newspapers. The War on Christianity sells airtime.
Just having empathy for someone who is hurting is Page 7 news. We don\'t
take the time to physically go check in with the widow down the block
and just see what\'s going on and make sure she\'s okay, because that\'s
intrusive, and people deserve their privacy. But at what cost? We\'ve
lost basic empathy in our society. And because ***WE*** marginalize the
\"weird\" \"loner\" kid who is maybe a bit socially awkward and
introverted, we create the very conditions which cause these types of
incidents.\
\
**So what can stop it?** Basic human kindness is a great place to start.
