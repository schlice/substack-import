**TL;DR: Unless you're flashing a custom ROM onto your phone, you don't
need to do a full backup.**

There's a lot of answers here. Most are mostly correct.

The correct answer is **without rooting, you cannot fully back up and
restore an Android phone.**

The question is *what does "fully" mean?* In this context, "fully" means
backing up the entire "user" space, as well as the entire "system"
partition. This means you're backing up

- The Android operating system and all of its patches
- All of the applications (apks) that run on your phone as well as all
  of their settings
- All of the "user" space, which includes all of your files, your
  pictures, your ringtones, your music files, etc.

You can only back up **all** of this with a rooted phone. Some of these
partitions are not available to the user who does not have root-level
privileges.

But the question remains: *why?* Why would you want to back up all of
these things when you can simply restore the originals from the same
place you got them? If your phone is wiped:

- The Android operating system will be re-installed from your **recovery
  partition**, so it is not necessary to separately back it up
- The applications will be restored from the Google Play store (for the
  APKs) and from your phone manufacturer's backups (for example, Samsung
  Cloud stores all of your apps' settings), so it is not necessary to
  separately back them up

Your user files are the only items you will need to back up yourself.
Any of the tools indicated in the other answers will fully back up the
user partitions. Your phone manufacturer probably also has tools which
will do this for free (for example, Samsung offers **Kies**, a software
package which runs on your computer and allows you to regularly back up
your phone). In addition, Samsung Cloud will back up your user
partition. There are other piecemeal solutions which can offer cloud
backup for portions of your user partition (for example, Google Photos
offers *unlimited* photo storage).

The only reason you would want to take a "full" backup of your phone
(OS, apps, and user space) is if you are applying another operating
system to your phone. For example, if you are flashing CyanogenMod or
AOSP onto your phone, you probably want to take a full backup of your
phone first. If you have no idea what CyanogenMod or AOSP are, then you
really don't need to do a "full" backup of your phone. Oh, and if you
are flashing CM or AOSP, you're already rooted.
