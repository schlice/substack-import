I know this is an absolutely ridiculous troll question, but let's
remember the three requirements for a **legal contract**:

1.  An **offer**
2.  An **acceptance**
3.  A **consideration.**

An **offer** happens when one party makes a promise to enter into a
contract under certain conditions. The offer must be specific, complete,
and made with the intention of being bound by acceptance.

An **acceptance** happens when the other party agrees to be bound by the
offer.

A **consideration** means each party exchanges something of value to
their detriment. This can be payment for goods or services, a promise to
do something, or a promise not to do something. For example, if one
party sells a bicycle to another party for \$100, the bicycle is the
consideration and the \$100 is the consideration.

In this case, if you had a valid contract, you would have approached
your neighbor and you would have told him that you wanted to install
solar panels on his rooftop and connected them to his "generator" (or
whatever that thing is called that takes power in off of the grid...most
people call it a "meter"), and in exchange he would permit you access to
his roof (at your own risk of injury) and he would agree to pay for the
panels.

As it stands in this question, you **trespassed** on your neighbor's
property, you **gave away** expensive solar panels with no written
agreement as to how you were going to be reimbursed for them, you
**unlawfully** connected solar panels to the electrical grid without a
permit, you acted as an electrician **without a license**, and somehow
you expect your *neighbor* to be *legally bound* by your unlawful
actions?

This question would be laughable if it weren't so stupid. Try harder if
you're going to make up troll questions.
