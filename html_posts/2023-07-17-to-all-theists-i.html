You didn't ask a question there, did you...

But if you were hoping for fainting and pearl-clutching from those
uppity church-goers, you're not going to get it.

News flash: **we're all sinners. You're not special.**

We've sinned, just like you. Out of your list of "sins," as a matter of
fact, the only one I haven't done is wipe my ass with pages I ripped out
of a Bible (ouch, but any port in a storm, I guess). And unsurprisingly,
I'm still here, too.

Our sins don't condemn us to an early death. Our righteousness doesn't
guarantee us a good life.

In fact, none of what we do in this life (except for being healthy)
makes for a longer or a shorter life. God doesn't "strike you down"
because you're a sinner.

What He *does* do is hope that you'll reconsider, so that you can be
welcomed into the *next* life.

Now, if you don't care about the next life, if you're only interested in
*this* life, and then when you die, you die permanently, then you can
just stop reading here. If you believe that when you die, there is
nothing left, then that's what will happen to you.

But have you ever asked yourself the question, *is there something
more?* Have you ever been leaving your job, sitting in traffic, looking
at all the cars and wondering *is this it? Is this all there is to
life?* If you have ever thought about this, you may want to consider
what those theists have to say.

But we're not going to bother unless you ask, because you sound a bit
hostile. You sound a bit intentionally defiant. And that's okay. You can
live exactly as you live and have a fine life. *But that'll be the end
of it*.

In other words, if you want an eternity, you have to choose it.
