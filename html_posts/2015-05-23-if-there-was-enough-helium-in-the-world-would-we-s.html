**Content:** [Not likely.\

LTA (lighter-than-air) airships are great at certain things, two of
which are heavy lifting and surveillance. They are less efficient at
things like passenger transport and as weapons platforms. They can\'t
move nearly as fast as a traditional aircraft, and subsequently won\'t
work as well as an airliner for passenger transport.\
\
Airships might see a resurgence if the world\'s helium supply suddenly
blossomed. [[But that is not likely to
happen](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=e797f2&url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/health/a4046/why-is-there-a-helium-shortage-10031229/){.external_link
