**Can you unlock your iPhone 12 with your mask on?**

There's a fair chance that Face ID will fail, even with your mask on.
However, you can set up an *Alternative appearance* in Face ID while
using your mask, in the same way that you can configure Face ID to
recognize you with or without glasses, facial hair, makeup, different
hairstyles, or with other different looks

Try this:

> 1.  Open the Settings app on your iPhone or iPad Pro and tap "Face ID
>     & Passcode". Enter your passcode if prompted.
> 2.  Tap "Set Up an Alternative Appearance".
> 3.  Fold your mask in half and use it to cover one side of your face
>     while following the on-screen instructions.
> 4.  If your device warns that your face is obstructed, move the mask
>     slightly further away from the center of your face.
> 5.  Follow the setup process by moving your head in a circle. You'll
>     be asked to complete the process once more -- continue to hold the
>     mask in the same position and on the same side of your face.
> 6.  Once the two Face ID scans are complete, put your mask on, and try
>     to unlock your device. If it works, great! If not, go through the
>     setup again.[\[1\]](#ajHnn){#cite-ajHnn .citation_link}

If that fails, you can try resetting Face ID and setting it up again.
This time, do the folded mask trick the first time through, then set up
an Alternative appearance **with your folded mask on the other side of
your face.** Some have found success doing this.

If neither of these methods are successful, you're probably not going to
be able to unlock your phone using your face while you wear a mask.
Don't forget to reset Face ID and re-enable it without a mask, and then
just enter your passcode to unlock your phone when your mask is on.
