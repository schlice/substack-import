You can always write a separate text document which describes each
variable, what it is used for, what calls it, and what it calls. That
means that every time you create a variable, you need to simultaneously
add the variable to the document. This avoids the overhead in the code,
but is more time-consuming for the programmer. I would suggest either a
spreadsheet or a table in a word processor document.

If you're programming using the gdb editor, you can type **info
variables** to get a list of all variables in the code. You can use that
as your starting point. You can also type **info locals** to list local
variables of the current stack frame, including static variables in that
function. Finally, you can type **info args** to list arguments of the
current stack frame. So depending on your editor, you may be able to
list out all of the variables in your code, and you can use that to
start your variable document, and perhaps to keep it updated.

For code that may have to be maintained at some point in the future, we
like to add comments directly into the code because it allows for ease
of future maintenance. The problem with a standalone code instruction
document is that it could be lost or misplaced, and then the code
becomes orders-of-magnitude harder to maintain in the future.
