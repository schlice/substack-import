There is no difference in the cables. Period. A cable is a wire which
creates a connection between two points. Cables do not have logic in
them. There is nothing which makes a cable a "fast charging cable"
except for marketing.

The fast charging part comes from a communication between the charging
"brick" or Qi-compatible wireless charger and the device being charged.
The device will ask the charger if it supports fast charging, the
charger will respond that it does, and the amperage delivered by the
charger will change. It's really that simple.

If the cable doesn't allow the communication between the device and the
brick to happen correctly (perhaps because some of the pins in the cable
have broken), it won't fast charge. If the cable is not allowing the
proper amperage to flow between the two devices (again, because of
weakening of the connectors on the cable, or broken connections), the
charging speed will not be maintained.

Use a new cable, keep your cables in good condition, and fast charging
will continue to work.
