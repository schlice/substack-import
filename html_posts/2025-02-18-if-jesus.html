That is certainly one interpretation of Jesus performing miracles.

The answer, then, rests on your definition of "miracles."

Christians define a miracle as something which defies the laws of
physics. You actually defined a miracle as a "supernatural action" which
literally means "above the natural" or "outside of the natural." And if
God exists, and He exists outside of the laws of physics, then He can do
things outside of the laws of physics, such as creating an entire
universe and everything in it out of nothing.

In short, **if God exists, miracles are possible.**

So you now have two possible answers to the problem of Jesus'
supernatural actions:

1.  Jesus' miracles are attributable to the power of God.
2.  Jesus' miracles are attributable to the fact that our senses do not
    perceive reality.

Which one of these is more plausible?

Let's discuss the second one, the one you brought up. Our senses do not
actually perceive reality. Immanuel Kant actually proposed this idea
quite some time ago. He said that the structure of your senses and your
mind forms all sense data, so you never really know the thing in itself.
You only know the thing *to you* after your mind and senses form it.

To get a handle on this, look for a second out the window at a tree.
Kant is saying that the tree you think you are looking at appears the
way it does because your mind is forming the sense data you're getting
from the tree. You really don't know the tree in itself; you only know
the phenomena your mind categorizes about the tree. In short, you can
never know the real tree in itself, only the tree as it appears to you.

This is a pretty incredible statement. We're supposed to believe that
the average Joe Schmuckatelli on the street doesn't doubt what he sees
with his own two eyes, but supposedly brilliant philosophers do?

This slightly tongue-in-cheek question is actually more accurately
phrased as a *self-defeating logical claim*. It is self-defeating
because it violates the Law of Noncontradiction. Kant contradicts his
own premise by saying that no one can know the real world while he
claims to know something about it, namely that the real world is
unknowable! In effect, Kant says the truth about the real world is that
there are no truths about the real world.

Additionally, this is a logical fallacy known as the "nothing but"
fallacy, which implies "more than" knowledge. In essence, in order for
Kant to know that his senses are not actually perceiving the thing that
he's looking at, he has to be able to see *beyond* his senses to the
thing which he claims cannot be perceived by the senses. In other words,
Kant is claiming that we can't see beyond what our senses tell us, but
Kant is claiming to know what exists beyond our senses, without him
being able to sense anything beyond our senses. In other words, in order
for Kant to differentiate the thing in the real world from that which
his mind perceives, he would have to be able to see **both**. But this
is exactly what he says no one can do. He says only the *phenomena* of
the mind can be known, not the *noumena* (his term for the real world).

Clearly, since he is claiming to have knowledge beyond senses (which he
claims is impossible), there is no way we can rely on his information.

\

To that end, it is not even within the realm of possibility that the
physical world is just a concrete representation of our abstract
consciousnesses interacting. It's far more likely that our senses
accurately portray the world around us (otherwise, they'd be pretty poor
at their job), and miracles are exactly that: events which only God can
perform, and function as signs of God.
