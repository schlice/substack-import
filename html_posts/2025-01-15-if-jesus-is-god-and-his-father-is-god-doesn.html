Short answer: **No.** They're both the same God in two different
persons. Add in the Holy Spirit (who is also God) and you have **one God
in three Persons: the Trinity.**

The concept of the Trinity is a very difficult one to wrap your head
around. Honestly, we struggle to do it. Our brains have difficulty
grasping the concept, and anything we do to try to understand falls
woefully short.

But that's to be expected, as God's mind is so much greater than our
mind. We don't have the capacity to understand God's infinite mind or
the plans He has for us. It's arrogance for us to believe we have the
ability to understand the mind of God. It's like you standing over a
pregnant mother's womb and trying to explain what life is like on the
other side, in such a way that the baby in the womb would understand.
That baby simply doesn't yet possess the capacity to understand. Paul
told the believers in Corinth, "Now we see but a poor reflection; then
we shall see face to face. Now, I know in part; then I shall know fully,
even as I am fully known" (1 Cor. 13:12). Paul was basically saying that
we may not ever gain full understanding while we are alive on earth, and
we probably need to learn to accept that.

But we can try. We must be careful, however, to not put too much faith
in our trying. The Bible tells us to not focus on trying to understand,
not to focus on trying to make all the pieces fit together. "Trust in
the Lord, lean not on your own understanding" (Prov. 3:5). We are not
told to not try to understand, just don't "lean on" your understanding,
which means don't make it an ultimatum. "God, you'd better explain
yourself, or I'm outta here!" That would be "leaning" on your own
understanding, and we are admonished against that.

Anyway, here's a really terrible comparison, but it gets the point
across. Let's compare me and Obama. We are alike in *personhood*. We are
both human. But we are most definitely not alike in *role*. I mean, the
man rolls with a posse. So while we are similar in *personhood*, we are
vastly different in *role*.

The three members of the Trinity are exactly the same. They are all the
same in *personhood* (in that they are all God), but they are different
in *role*. God the Son subordinates Himself below God the Father, so He
can say things like "My Father" and "My God" and do so unironically,
even though He too is God.

One God in three Persons.

Just because it's not written like that in the Bible doesn't mean that
there isn't evidence in there to support it. Jesus talks about God the
Father and the Holy Spirit as three separate persons, while at the same
time declaring that all three of them are the same God.

Just because it's hard to comprehend doesn't make it any less Biblical.
