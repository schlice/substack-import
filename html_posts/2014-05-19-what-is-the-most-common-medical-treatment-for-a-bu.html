**Content:** [Burst eardrums usually heal on their own. While it is
healing, keep it dry. Usually a swimmer\'s earplug or a cotton ball
coated with Vaseline (on the outside) will help keep the eardrum
protected. Your doctor can prescribe eardrops to prevent infection, but
don\'t put any drops in your ear if they are not prescribed by your
doctor.\
\
If there are problems healing, it can cause hearing loss as well as
other issues. These should be treated by your doctor. As long as it is
treated promptly and heals correctly, long-term effects should be
minimal.]{.rendered_qtext}
