No, it's actually the opposite. Properly Bible-trained scholars are
*more certain* that the Bible contains no contradictions. It is those
who are *poorly* Bible-trained who believe that genuine contradictions
exist in the Bible.

I suppose it really boils down to what you believe is a *contradiction*.
Yes, there are *differences* in the Bible. There is no way for there to
*not* be, as the Bible was written by forty different authors in three
languages, on three continents, over the span of 1500 years. **But a
difference is not a contradiction.** It is only a contradiction if there
is *no conceivable way* that two "differing" verses can be reconciled.

Even if an answer is not available right now, that does not mean an
answer does not exist. Many have found a supposed error in the Bible in
relation to history or geography only to find out that the Bible is
correct once further archaeological evidence is discovered.

Some things that people bring up as "contradictions" are indeed hard to
reconcile. But it is the Christian belief that every one of those
supposed contradictions can be reconciled in a viable and intellectually
plausible way.

There are entire books written showing "all of the errors in the Bible."
And there are *other* books which refute every one of those supposed
errors. But the truth is that most people who attack the Bible using
those "errors" as their ammunition aren't really interested in finding
an answer. They simply parrot the people showing the "errors" because
they want to attack Christianity, not because they seek genuine answers.

Jesus' warning about not casting pearls before swine is apropos here.
