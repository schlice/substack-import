Specifically, the evidence on Vitamin D is mixed. These two
contradictory studies were just recently released:

I tend to do what my neurologist tells me to do, and he wants me to
maintain a specific level of vitamin D in my blood. We test my vitamin D
level quarterly, and we found that 5000 IU daily maintains that
appropriate level in my blood.

Your results **will vary.**

Talk to your neurologist if you think adding a vitamin D supplement will
help you, but I strongly urge you to advise your friend to ***not***
forego the traditional therapy.

Proper diet, exercise, and treatment with one of the approved MS therapy
drugs gives you the best chance for slowing down the disease progression
and limiting its effects.
