**Content:** [Nationalism is not something we experience much in the
United States. I would say we experience *patriotism* far more than
*nationalism*.\
\
Patriotism is love of country; it is the engine that drives national
independence, and the motivation that keeps people defending it.
Patriotism is the force which keeps a country like the United States a
free country.\
\
Nationalism is patriotism to the extreme. It is the force that is
initially patriotic, but develops ethnocentric overtones, believing that
your country is *better* than other countries, and you should exert your
influence over them.]{.rendered_qtext}
