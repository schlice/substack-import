First of all, atheists don't believe that God exists, so they're not
thinking about salvation at all. But let's assume for a second that
somehow an atheist who did good deeds died, and then discovered that
there was indeed a god, you're asking if this "good person" atheist
would somehow be rewarded with eternal life simply because they were a
good person.

If this were true, then this would mean that *you earn your own
salvation* by your own good deeds, and God is not necessary. I bet even
the atheist sees the flaw in this logic.

If it's God's afterlife, you kinda have to play by God's rules.
