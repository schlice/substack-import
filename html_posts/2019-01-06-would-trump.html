**Would Trump's declaration of a national emergency to allow him to
build his wall without Congressional approval be a step towards
totalitarianism?**

It is a step towards totalitarianism, but it's a step like me standing
in New York City and taking one step west is a step towards California.

We still have a *long, long, long way to go before we become a
totalitarian country.*

Trump's actions would be less "totalitarian" and more "exercising a
loophole."

Title 10 of the USC allows the military to fund border barriers in
certain circumstances, such as during war or national emergency. The
money does not need to be approved by Congress because it is
"un-allocated" funds. Funds which are allocated must be re-approved by
Congress to be used somewhere else, so those funds aren't going
anywhere. But "un-allocated" funds can be used by the DoD without
additional Congressional approval, according to the law.

So while it may be a "totalitarian"-style move insofar as he is doing it
"unilaterally," it's currently completely within the bounds of the law.
It's a loophole: acting completely within the scope of the current law
to achieve a goal which was never envisioned by the writers of that law.

Now, when Trump throws out the Constitution, makes the GOP the only
political party, makes being anything other than Republican illegal and
forces all citizens to swear fealty to him, then we've become a
totalitarian nation.

But this? Not so much.
