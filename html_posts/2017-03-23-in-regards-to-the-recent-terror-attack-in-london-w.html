The short answer is **we cannot say**.

Is it possible that the outcome may have been different were the officer
armed? Yes, it is possible. It's also just as likely that the officer
may not have had the opportunity to draw and fire before being stabbed
anyway. Knives are terribly efficient close-quarter weapons. If you're
not totally on your game, you can get stabbed very easily.

Whatever the case, the UK has chosen to leave most of their officers
unarmed (with armed officers on-call), and they are perfectly fine with
that. So because of the greater belief that the public and the police
should work together to further a more civil society, the police are
mostly unarmed. And it also appears that terrorists did not get the
message that they should also remain unarmed. This terrorist was armed
with a 2,000 lb battering ram (also known as a car), and a knife.

This will be hard to hear, but the truth is the truth. This also means,
by extension, that the UK as a whole (not as individuals) believes the
deaths of PCs at the hands of armed assailants is an **acceptable
loss**, because they *intentionally* did not equip them with the tools
necessary to ensure they had an opportunity to counter the threat
presented to them. Any discussion to the contrary is vapid dialogue.
Either equip them to appropriately counter the threat, or their deaths
in scenarios like these are acceptable losses. There is no middle ground
in that discussion. If you do not give your officers the tools they need
to counter threats presented to them, you proclaim their deaths
acceptable casualties of the job. I hope their job descriptions say
something along the lines of "Gets killed when necessary." I fail to see
how the response of the armed officers was "sufficient," because it cost
an unarmed officer his life. The UK as a whole must come to grips with
this reality: criminals didn't get the message that they should remain
unarmed. Leaving the majority of your officers without the means to
defend themselves essentially condemns them to death.

Note that I did not say that Palmer's death *itself* was acceptable; we
mourn for the loss, and we grieve with you. However, that does not
change the fact that sending officers into the field ill-equipped to
defend against armed assailants is an imbalanced force equation, one in
which the unarmed person loses. Every. Single. Time.\
