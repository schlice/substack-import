I think the other answers here nailed it. If you read the specifics of
the law, it\'s not technically gambling because you get "something\"
every time. If everyone\'s a winner, does that meet the definition of
gambling? The only difference may be how much you paid for that
particular item. So it might be considered a purchase of
\"variable-price\" items, but it doesn\'t really match the definition of
gambling.
