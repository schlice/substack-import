**Why are police officers allowed to watch dashcam, bodycam, and
surveillance video before making a statement and a citizen cannot?**

Who says that you can't? Certainly not the article you quoted.

In fact, the article you mentioned says that Americans are divided on
whether or not police *should be* allowed to look at their video before
they make an official statement. Unsurprisingly, the division is
virtually exactly down political lines.

Most departments allow police to review their bodycam footage while they
are making their reports for the day, as they will normally attach the
relevant footage to their official report. So they need to be able to
see it in order to ensure it's the correct footage, especially in
departments that require cameras be continuously recording.

But the policy is controlled at a state/local/department level, not
nationwide.
