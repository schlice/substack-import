**What time will it take to get a handgun ready for use if it\'s stored
at home accordingly to the rules and regulations?**

As with any legal question, the answer is "it depends."

In this case, it depends on which state you live in. Only Massachusetts
requires that guns be stored with a lock on them. Three states (New
York, California, and Connecticut) have laws which require guns to be
stored with locks on them, but only if the gun is in a residence in
which there resides a prohibited person, and in Connecticut, that's only
true if the gun is loaded.[\[1\]](#pOBwS){#cite-pOBwS .citation_link}
The District of Columbia used to have a safe storage law, but it has now
been scaled back to a "strong, non-binding policy" after their safe
storage law was ruled unconstitutional as part of the landmark decision
*DC v. Heller* on 26 June 2008.

For all other states, there is no legal requirement for a gun to be
stored locked.

Therefore, to answer your question, in Massachusetts, it will probably
take you a few minutes to get your handgun ready for use. You'll have to
get the gun, get the key, unlock the lock, remove the lock, and load the
gun. If you're really fast, you may be able to do this within a minute,
but a few minutes is a good estimate.

In any other state, guns can be stored in whatever condition and
whatever state of lock is appropriate for your situation, meaning that a
gun can be ready instantly.
