Multiple sclerosis can cause bladder dysfunction, including:

- Frequency and/or urgency of urination
- Hesitancy in starting urination
- Frequent nighttime urination (nocturia)
- Incontinence (the inability to hold in urine)
- Inability to empty the bladder completely

Bladder dysfunction occurs in nearly 80% of people with MS.

These symptoms, left untreated, can cause frequent urinary tract
infections (UTIs) or kidney stones.

Since bladder dysfunction occurs in far more cases than just MS, there
are many therapies available for all of the symptoms listed above, from
physical therapy to medications and even surgical interventions.
