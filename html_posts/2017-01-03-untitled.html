iPhones have a feature which will only allow the original account holder
to re-image the phone. They are able to do this because Apple controls
the hardware and the software. With Apple, you buy the hardware and they
supply (bundled) software to run that hardware (iOS)

Android phones do not have this feature, since Google does not control
the hardware on which you load Android. The hardware allows you to
re-load the software without checking. This is a downside to having an
Android operating system which functions on many different hardware
platforms.

If this feature is a concern for you, I suggest getting an iPhone. Once
you have one, you can log in to
[[iCloud.com](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=f30a9e&url=http://iCloud.com){.external_link

remotely lock and wipe it. Stolen iPhones are much harder to re-sell
since you need the original account to wipe the device. Not impossible,
but much harder.

Additionally, there are plenty of software packages which perform a
similar "SIM-change alert" function like what was built in to your
Symbian-based phone. Take a look at Lookout Mobile Security for Android
or iOS, one feature of which is SIM change alerts.
