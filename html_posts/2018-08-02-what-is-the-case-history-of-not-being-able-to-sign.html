**What is the case history of not being able to sign away your
constitutional rights?**

I think what you're referring to is "unalienable rights," which are not
mentioned anywhere in the Constitution. They are listed in the
Declaration of Independence:

> We hold these Truths to be self-evident, that all Men are created
> equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable
> Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of
> Happiness....

This understanding is part of what led to the formation of the Bill of
Rights: a guarantee that the government would never infringe on these
"unalienable rights."

Also part of that understanding is what "unalienable" means vs
"inalienable."

Inalienable means a right which you cannot be compelled to alienate.
It's a right which is "not subject to alienation," but could potentially
be signed away yourself.

Unalienable means *even if you wanted to*, you cannot alienate yourself
of that right.
