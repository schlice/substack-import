**Content:** [Seriously. Listen to these people here. Turn off Quora and
see a doctor. I don\'t care what doctor you see. See your PCP (Primary
Care Physician). See an ER doc. See a psychiatrist if you have direct
access to one.\
\
But please go see someone. Now. If I could reach through this monitor,
I\'d drag you there myself. But all I can do is implore you to go see a
doctor.\
\
Do not wait. Go now.]{.rendered_qtext}
