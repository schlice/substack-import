**Content:** [In general, it is software, not hardware, that prevents
call recording. And it is only carrier overlays that prevent call
recording.\
\
There are a number of hacks that allow you to enable call recording,
check them out as some are easier to implement than others.\
\
Also, you may need to think about where you intend to use your
recordings. Not all call recordings will be admissible as evidence in
court proceedings, if that\'s what you were planning on doing with them.
I can\'t speak for any other uses of those recordings.]{.rendered_qtext}
