Exactly the same thing, and exactly the same criticisms have happened in
the past, and political careers have continued. Democrats are not making
a big deal about this because **they do it too.** When Joe Biden said
"everyone does it," he wasn't kidding.

WGN TV reported that Hillary Clinton's 2008 campaign spokesman Howard
Wolfson said President Obama had "lifted rhetoric" from Massachusetts
Gov. Deval Patrick. "If your whole candidacy is about words, then they
should be your own words," then-Sen. Clinton said about Obama at the
time. "That's what I think."

Obama admitted that he used some of Deval's words at a Jefferson-Jackson
dinner in Wisconsin. "Deval and I do trade ideas all the time, and you
know he's occasionally used lines of mine," Obama said. "**I would add
I've noticed on occasion Sen. Clinton has used words of mine as well**,"
Obama added. "**As I said before, I really don't think this is too big
of a deal**."[\[1\]](#ZHdMq){#cite-ZHdMq .citation_link}

They're letting this blow over because if they make too much of a big
deal about it, then people will start to remember that they do it too.
