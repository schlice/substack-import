I have a book of very real looking "parking tickets" which I keep in my
car for just such occasions.

It literally takes a good few minutes of reading the "ticket" to figure
out that it's fake.

I think the best way to mess with such a person is to get their heart
pumping thinking they got a parking ticket.

If I get a chance, I'll run out to the car and grab one and post a pic
for you.

(EDIT) Here's the front side of the "ticket:"

:::: ui_qtext_image_outer
::: qtext_image_wrapper
![](images/qimg-ecbf034c6b4f2dee13a73e3e053f139d){.landscape
.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed
master_src="images/qimg-ecbf034c6b4f2dee13a73e3e053f139d" master_w="635"
master_h="331"}

And here's the back side:

:::: ui_qtext_image_outer
::: qtext_image_wrapper
![](images/qimg-4b43ddafcf773eb62fc7f76020cacd49){.portrait .qtext_image
.zoomable_in_feed
master_src="images/qimg-4b43ddafcf773eb62fc7f76020cacd49" master_w="329"
master_h="620"}
