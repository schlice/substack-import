Two reasons why this will not happen.

1.  The attempt to retrieve overpayment is not a means to nullify
    anyone's civil rights, which is what Bills of Attainder were
    intended to do (most notably the right to own property and thus pass
    it on to heirs, the right to a title of nobility, and, in at least
    the original usage, the right to life itself). This was simply a
    payment error, the California National Guard attempting to recoup
    losses they suffered when they mistakenly overpaid Guard members by
    paying re-enlistment bonuses when the members were not entitled to
    that money.
2.  Thanks to the kerfuffle that this caused in the Drive-By Media and
    subsequently Congress, California's National Guard has already
    halted any further attempts to recoup their overpayments, so it
    appears now that we won't have any further issues.
