**Would an aircraft with a rotor in the center like this work?**

In that configuration, no.

A helicopter has two rotors, one to provide forward thrust, and one to
counter the torque of spinning the first one.

This aircraft has no second rotor to counter the torque of the first
one.

Secondly, it would be inefficient. It would be subject to the same top
speed of other single-rotor helicopters which tops out at half the speed
of sound due to the issue of [[retreating blade
stall](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=61cd01&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retreating_blade_stall){.external_link

by airplane standards.

Finally, unless you can get that rotor to tilt significantly, it's going
to have a very hard time moving in any direction at all, since it
doesn't seem to have any thrust other than the single blade.
