Of course it's brilliant.

It's unlikely that it is malware because the devices all simultaneously
detonated. A malware bug that overloaded the battery would cause varying
results: some batteries would explode, but some batteries would vent
mostly harmlessly, while some batteries would swell, alerting the user
to an issue.

The fact that the devices so violently experienced exothermic events is
more indicative of a dedicated explosive device than a software bug or
malware causing the hardware to spontaneously self-destruct. You need an
energetic device that would reliably produce an explosion, and frankly,
there is no such device inbuilt into a pager. You would need to include
one in the pager at some point in the supply chain.
