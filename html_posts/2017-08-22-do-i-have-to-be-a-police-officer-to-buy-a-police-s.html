You may absolutely wear a police uniform and dress like a police
officer. You can buy police uniform shirts. There are some items that
are sold online which require your identification as an active police
officer. In that case, you need to provide the company documentation on
department letterhead indicating that you are an active officer in good
standing in their department before you can purchase any of those
restricted items. Basically, if you can't buy it, the company will tell
you. They won't sell you something you're not allowed to buy.

That said, you may not act in a way such as to make people think you are
a police officer, and you may not attempt to exercise any police
authority.

I do like [[Dave

idea of adding a comedy element to your costume, such as a banana in the
holster, a paper badge, or something similar, so as to avoid any
confusion.

That said, in most jurisdictions, it is not required that you
distinguish your uniform appreciably from a police uniform; it is your
actions that determine whether or not you can be charged with
impersonating a peace officer.

As always, check your local laws, YMMV, and I am not a lawyer.

(Interestingly, we're getting a 5.11 retail store in northern Colorado
Springs, and I'm totally stoked)
