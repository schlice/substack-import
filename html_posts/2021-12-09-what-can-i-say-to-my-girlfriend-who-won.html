Nothing. People have a right to set their own boundaries. And that
includes you.

You can't give her an ultimatum (either get the vaccine or I'm gone).
That's not right to do to her. But you can tell her that you're going to
go swimming or go to the bar, and you're going to do it without her if
she won't get the vaccine. That's a natural consequence of her decision.
She should feel the consequences of her decision. But it's not fair for
you to miss out on going swimming or going to the bar just because of
her decision. It's not fair for her to do that to you.

Original question:

What can I say to my girlfriend who won\'t get the covid vaccine? For
her it\'s a violation of her personal freedom. She misses things like
going to the swimming pool or bars, yet won\'t get jabbed. I try to
avoid the topic now, too difficult
