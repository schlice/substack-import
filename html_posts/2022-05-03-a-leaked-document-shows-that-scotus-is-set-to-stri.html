***TRIGGER WARNING:*** *We will be discussing the Constitutional basis
for Roe v. Wade. We are* ***NOT*** *discussing whether or not abortion
is a good idea. Comments which discuss the issue instead of the Court's
ruling will be deleted. We're not discussion abortion. We're discussing
the Court's decision and the Constitutionality of that decision.*

*Abortion is a very emotional topic. We are not discussing abortion in
this answer. This answer is only about the law and the Constitution, not
about the ethics or morality of abortion itself.*

Virtually zero. I can't say actually zero because I'm unaware of the
Court's complete docket, but I have not heard of any cases challenging
the Constitutionality of the *Obergefell* ruling.

So before you flip out over *Roe* triggering some massive overturning of
all of your favorite Court decisions*,* remember that in order for
SCOTUS to reverse a previous ruling, it has to be hearing a case which
makes a valid Constitution argument against a previous ruling.

In this case, there is a very solid Constitutional argument in favor of
overturning *Roe*, namely that the basis for *Roe* was completely
unconstitutional.

*Roe* used a previous ruling in a marital privacy case, *Griswold v.
Connecticut. Griswold* was a case out of Connecticut wherein at the time
in the 1950s, it was illegal to use "any drug, medicinal article, or
instrument for the purpose of preventing conception\...\". Violators
could be \"\... fined not less than fifty dollars or imprisoned not less
than sixty days nor more than one year or be both fined and
imprisoned.\" The Court overturned the Connecticut law by claiming that
the law violated the right to marital privacy, which it claimed existed
in the Constitution.

To be clear, there is no amendment to the Constitution which recognizes
the right of the people to have privacy, in their marriage or anywhere
else. What the Court did was to look at the characteristics of existing
amendments, and decide that what the Framers *intended* was that the
basis of all of the other rights was a right to privacy. The Court
reasoned that the provisions of the Bill of Rights created
\"emanations\" of protection, and these emanations created \"penumbras\"
within which rights could still exist, even if they were not explicitly
enumerated in the Constitution. The Court concluded that the right to
marital privacy fell within this protection.

*Roe* then used this right to privacy (which the decision in *Griswold*
created) to argue that a woman has a right to privacy in her person, and
that abortion is covered by that right to privacy.

So there is good Constitutional basis to reverse *Roe*, because it was a
bad decision based on a nonexistent right.

No such argument exists for *Obergefell*.

Original question:

A leaked document shows that SCOTUS is set to strike down Roe v Wade,
which has been in place for 50 years. What\'s the probability that the
current SCOTUS will next move to strike down same sex marriage within
the year?
