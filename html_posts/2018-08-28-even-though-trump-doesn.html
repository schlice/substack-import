**Even though Trump doesn\'t like to exercise should he be forced to for
the sake of our nation?**

Short answer: **no**.

Longer answer: There is no Constitutional requirement that the president
remain healthy, or alive. In fact, the Constitution specifies that a
plan for succession needs to be in place. It says so in numerous
locations: Article II, Section 1, Clause 6, as well as the 12th
Amendment, 20th Amendment, and 25th Amendment. Congress passed the
Presidential Succession Act in 1947, and last revised it in 2006.

That plan of succession says who becomes president in the event the
president dies or is incapacitated and can no longer perform his duties.
