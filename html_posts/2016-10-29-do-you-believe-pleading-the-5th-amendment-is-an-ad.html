This question really only makes sense when asked about a witness, not
about the defendant. A defendant shouldn't be asked such direct
questions, such that he would have to plead the 5th. The questions for
the defendant should be non-incriminating questions. If a prosecutor
asks a defendant direct incriminating questions, they shouldn't be
surprised if that defendant refuses to answer on the grounds that
through his answer, he may incriminate himself.

When a witness "pleads the 5th," it's a little different. The 5th
Amendment to the Constitution prevents a citizen "from being a witness
against himself." In other words, by answering the question, you would
be admitting guilt in this, or another, crime.

So back to your question: if someone pleads the 5th, would this be an
admission of guilt in the eyes of the jurors?

The answer is yes, but guilt for *what*, we do not know. The witness is
not on trial, the defendant is on trial. If a witness pleads the 5th, he
may be involved in the crime at trial, or he may be involved in a
related (but not yet prosecuted) crime.

So in either case, a witness or the defendant pleading the 5th should
not hold any relevance for the jury. When a defendant pleads the 5th,
the presiding judge will issue instructions to the jury to not regard
such a plea as an admission of guilt. When a witness pleads the 5th,
there is no way to know why, or for what crime, he is doing so. Juries
are instructed to decide the case based on the facts presented. If the
defendant or witness cannot produce such fact through testimony, the
jury cannot use it as a basis to decide the case, so it is irrelevant.
*Why* the person pled the 5th is not relevant. The fact that they did
means that evidence was not presented, and the jury cannot use that
evidence to aid their decision.
