**Can I sue a police phone operator for hanging up on me?**

Can you? Sure you can. In the United States, you can sue anyone for
anything.

The question, as always, is whether or not you have a chance of
prevailing. And in this case, it would be *really challenging* to
prevail.

First off, you would have to show that you were harmed by the hang up.
Then you would have to show that the operator knew you would be harmed
by the hang up (or at least knew that there was a reasonable chance you
could be harmed) and proceeded to do it anyway. That's going to be a
tough one to prove.

But if you can prove those things, go for it. You could make a case for
negligence.
