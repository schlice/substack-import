Well, I can give you the obvious answer of the inverse: people who were
cursed for failing to follow their calling.

**Just read the story of Jonah**.

Jonah was told to go to Nineveh to preach the gospel. Nineveh, at the
time, was like Las Vegas. Sin City. Imagine being told to go to Vegas
and to preach the gospel. Yeah, not fun.

Well, Jonah was having none of it. He decided to try to run from God.

Didn't work out so well.

Eventually, when Jonah finally gave in and went to Nineveh, God took
care of him and it was a great experience. So in the end, I guess you
could say that Jonah was indeed blessed for following God's calling. But
it did not start out that way.
