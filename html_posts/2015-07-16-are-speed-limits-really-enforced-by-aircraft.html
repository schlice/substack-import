**Content:** [As someone who received a ticket by one of these methods
in 1993, I can tell you that they actually do clock cars using propeller
planes. You pass a line of patrol vehicles on the side of the road (not
running radar), and the first one in line peels off and stops you. They
inform you the speed that the aircraft timed you at, and issue you a
ticket.\
\
There are two indicator lines painted at a specific distance (i.e.
1/10th of a mile, or 528 feet) between them, on the side of the highway.
The officer in the airplane watches you cross each line and times you as
you cross. He then calculates your speed and relays it down to the
officer on the road.]{.rendered_qtext}
