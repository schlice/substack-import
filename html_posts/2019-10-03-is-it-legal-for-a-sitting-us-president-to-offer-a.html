**Is it legal for a sitting U.S. President to offer a pardon in exchange
for illegal activity from a subordinate?**

It's illegal for **anyone**, including a sitting US President, to offer
anything of value in exchange for doing something illegal. It is an
**incohate offense**, which means \"conduct deemed criminal without
actual harm being done, provided that the harm that would have occurred
is one the law tries to prevent.\"

Solicitation is a Federal crime in which a person is offered money or
something else of value (a pardon) in exchange for the commission of a
crime, with the specific intent that the person solicited commits the
crime.

However, in order to meet the definition of solicitation, the action
requested must be an actual crime, and the person instigating the
solicitation must be clearly requesting the commission of a crime. For
example, our President was visiting the Southern border and joked with
Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan that he would
pardon him if he blocked illegal immigrants from entering the country.
First, whether or not doing so is an actual crime depends on the
circumstances, and second, it was unclear whether or not the President
was joking. The ICE officials checked, found out that such an action
would be a *prima facie* violation of the law, and the White House
confirmed that the President was indeed joking and that no such order
was given. The Department of Homeland Security stated unequivocally:
\"At no time has the President indicated, asked, directed or pressured
the Acting Secretary to do anything illegal. Nor would the Acting
Secretary take actions that are not in accordance with our
responsibility to enforce the law.\" So would this be solicitation? No,
there was no actual, real request to commit an actual crime.

If a President commits a crime, he would have to be impeached and
removed from office before he could be prosecuted. If he was impeached
but not removed from office, the statute of limitations would only be
tolled if the courts found that the President could not be indicted
while still President, but this would have to be tested in court (i.e.
the Attorney General would have to attempt to indict his own boss, which
would be an interesting Constitutional issue in and of itself).
