**Cars, toys, and aspirin, all have to follow the mandatory safety
standards in order to protect the users of the products. Guns are exempt
from these type of standards. Why shouldn't guns be subject to the same
type of standards?**

Maybe I don't understand.

So you're saying that someone can crush up 500 aspirins and put them in
my dinner and after I die, my family can sue the aspirin company for
failing to protect me from their product?

No?

Or you're saying that if I get hit by a Ford, my family can sue Ford for
failing to protect me?

No?

Or you're saying that someone can take Super Stretch Man and wrap his
arms around my neck, and my family can sue the toy manufacturer for
failing to protect me?

No?

So why are you trying to apply that same lack of standard?

Probably because you (and *The Trace*) have no idea what you're talking
about.

**Guns are** ***most certainly not*** **exempt from any safety
standards.** Their safety record speaks for itself. Gun operators are
very rarely, if ever, injured or killed by a defect of those products.
I'd venture to say that guns are extremely safe for their operators.

Oh wait, you're talking about the person on the *business end* of the
gun?

The problem, in those instances, is that the gun is operating
*correctly.* Product liability would attach if the gun was not operating
correctly (material defect) and it injured or killed its operator or
bystanders.

People try to sue gun manufacturers when their products are used
*illegally*, which is not the fault of the manufacturer. But people try
anyway. In fact, one of the tactics of the anti-gun Left is to sue gun
manufacturers out of business, forcing the passing of laws to protect
arms manufacturers from such frivolous lawsuits. Yes, it's clear that
such a lawsuit would never proceed on the merits, but wasting all the
time and money in defending the suits would have put them out of
business.

Therefore, the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA) was
passed. This law makes it illegal to sue gun manufacturers for product
liability when their products work as designed. This should seem fairly
intuitive, but they had to make a law to prevent it.

Hopefully this helps you to understand.
