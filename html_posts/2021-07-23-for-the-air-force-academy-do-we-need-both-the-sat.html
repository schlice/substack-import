You only need one or the other.

But to [[H. Larry
Elman](https://www.quora.com/profile/H-Larry-Elman-1)]{.qlink_container}'s
point, if you haven't checked out the [[Academy
Admissions](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=60e33c&url=https://www.academyadmissions.com/){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="academyadmissions.com"}]{.qlink_container} website yet, that
is the place to start. It has the answers to all of these questions and
more. They can connect you to liaison officers who can assist you with
the entire process, including nominations, completing your entry packet,
physicals, fitness tests, etc.
