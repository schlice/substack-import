**Does the secret service have a protocol if a president is seditious or
treasonous to the constitution?**

They don't need one. The Constitution has one. It's called
*impeachment*.

They must impeach the president in the House, and then the Senate must
vote to remove the President from office.

But actual sedition and treason are crimes: *seditious conspiracy* and
*treason*. Our friends at FindLaw spell out the difference between the
two this way:

> While seditious conspiracy is generally defined as conduct or language
> inciting rebellion against the authority of a state, treason is the
> more serious offense of actively levying war against the United States
> or giving aid to its enemies.[\[1\]](#zCZFO){#cite-zCZFO

You can think of it this way: seditious conspiracy is the first step on
the road to treason.

They are both very difficult to prove. In order to prove seditious
conspiracy, you would have to prove that the President conspired with at
least one other person to *actually use force* against the government.
Making a speech about overthrowing the government is not enough. But
coordinating troop deployments and handing out bullets is.

Treason is a crime which only happens during *a declared war.* It is
generally known as the crime of giving aid or comfort to the enemy, or
directly waging war against the country. Clearly, in order to have an
enemy, Congress must have declared war.

The constitutionality of charging and convicting a president of a crime
while he's in office is still debatable, since it's never really
happened such that a president might be arrested. Generally, you need to
remove the president from office first, and then charge with a crime.
