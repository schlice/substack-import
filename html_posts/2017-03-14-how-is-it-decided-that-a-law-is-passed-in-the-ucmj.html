Beginning in 1775, the then-Continental Congress passed 69 Articles of
War to govern the conduct of the Continental Army. Once the Constitution
was fully ratified in 1788, Article I, Section 8 gave Congress the
authority to "...make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the
land and naval forces.\" In April of 1806, Congress authorized 101
Articles of War, which remained the rules for the conduct of the US
military for more than 100 years.

The first version of the UCMJ was passed by Congress in 1950, and signed
into law by President Harry S. Truman. It went into effect in 1951, and
has remained largely unchanged since then. Some changes were made as
part of the National Defense Authorization Acts of 2006 and 2007, and
some other changes were made by Executive Order of the President.

So to answer your question, if a new law is proposed to be added to the
UCMJ, the military will bring the proposed changes to Congress through
the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Congress will likely add it as part of the
National Defense Authorization Act, which will then be signed into law
by the President. There will be a built-in delay before the new
provisions go into effect in order to educate everyone on them before
they become law, and military members will take UCMJ refresher and
update training to learn the new provisions.
