**Will God hate me if you choose to believe in him but not be a part of
the church?**

No, God will not hate you. God will never hate you, no matter what you
do.

God is not hateful. But sometimes, God is saddened, because he wants a
much closer relationship with you. He wants you to do more than believe
in him. He wants to be friends. He wants to hear all about your day. He
wants to know your fears.

And then, eventually, he wants you to lean on him. He wants you to put
your *faith* in him to guide your life in the direction that he chooses.
It may not be what you expected, or even wanted, but it will glorify him
and it will be amazing.

So he's certainly not mad at you, and he doesn't hate you. But I bet
he's sad, because he really wants more. He wants more for you than
you're giving him.
