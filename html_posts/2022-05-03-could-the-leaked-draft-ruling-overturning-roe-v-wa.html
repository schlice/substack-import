It could, and most of us suspect that was the reason it was leaked. It
was probably someone who was disappointed with the decision, and wanted
to "get out in front of it" and rile up the public. If they did so,
maybe they could "pressure" the Justices to change their votes. At
least, that's probably what they were thinking.

Remember, this is just a draft. The final opinion hasn't been written
yet, and the Justices have not voted yet. Votes can change. The leaker
was probably hoping to use public opinion to try to get the Justices to
change their minds.

But considering how *sacrosanct* the Justices consider their drafts to
be, they will probably be far more upset at the fact that the leak
occurred than they will by any public outcry over the ruling itself.

(EDIT) I was right.

Chief Justice Roberts released a statement about the breach, which said,
in part:

> To the extent this betrayal of the confidences of the Court was
> intended to undermine the integrity of our operations, it will not

The Chief Justice tasked the Marshal of the Supreme Court with
investigating the leak and finding the leaker. What will happen to the
leaker is still unknown, but I'll bet dollars to donuts that the person
will be fired, disbarred if they're an attorney, and will never work in
law again.
