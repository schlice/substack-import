If you'd like to find out how best prepare for Academy admission, please
take some time and look at the [[Academy Admissions
website](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=d1e87d&url=https://www.academyadmissions.com){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="academyadmissions.com"}]{.qlink_container}.

Specifically, take a look at the [[Extracurricular
Activites](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=b8d301&url=https://www.academyadmissions.com/admissions/the-application-process/extracurricular-activities/){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="academyadmissions.com"}]{.qlink_container} page, which gives
the correct answers to all of your questions. Extracurricular activities
include athletics, non-athletic activity, and even work experience.

The Academy is not looking for participation in a specific club or
organization. What they *are* looking for in a strong candidate is
someone who has "sustained participation and leadership in a few
activities."
