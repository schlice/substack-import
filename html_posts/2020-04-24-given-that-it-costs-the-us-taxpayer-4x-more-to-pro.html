**Given that it costs the US taxpayer 4x more to produce a new officer
through a military academy (USMA, USNA, USAFA) than through ROTC and 8x
more than through OTS/OCS, are the Academy grads indeed 4/8x better
officers so as to be worth the cost?**

I am biased, because I am a USAFA grad. But even acknowledging my
inherent bias, I can't see how a linear, bottom-line cost model is
justified when comparing Academy graduates to college graduates.
Requiring Academy graduates to be 4x better because their education
costs 4x as much is not a comparison we make anywhere else. Do we assume
that a college which costs 4x as much as a community college to produce
a graduate who is 4x better at the same field as one produced by a
community college? The comparison doesn't hold when we compare civilian
colleges against each other. A degree is a degree, regardless of where
you get it. Why, then, do we apply this standard to the service
academies? Is it solely because the education is paid for out of DoD
funding? The comparison hardly seems justified.

However, let's look at the comparison more closely.

Part of the reason why the academies cost taxpayers so much more is
because room and board as well as tuition costs are all borne by the
taxpayer. This amounts to anywhere between \$250,000 and \$300,000 per
cadet. ROTC cadets pay their own way through college. But even this
isn't a fair comparison, because it fails to take into account tuition
assistance at universities, which is quite often Federal dollars as
well. The average needs-based financial aid package among undergraduates
was approximately \$56,000 in 2019. For many, it is significantly
higher.[\[1\]](#PdSIs){#cite-PdSIs .citation_link}

So what do you get for that money? You get a leader who has been tested
in fire. You get a leader who has more than just knowledge about history
and airplanes and how to wear the uniform. You get a leader who has
already spent four years immersed in the military to an extent to which
any other college graduate could only dream of.

Does that produce a "better" officer? Depends on your definition of
"better." Can you objectively define "better?" With the qualities of
character and leadership achieved by Academy graduates, I don't think
you can objectively quantify an Academy grad as "better."
