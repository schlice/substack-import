**Content:** [The country needs a president who can put the Constitution
before his religion.\
\
I don\'t really care what religion the president is. He is a
representative of all the people, and thus is called to place the
Constitution above his own personal religion.\
\
We don\'t need a president that is empowered by his faith. We need a
steadfast supporter of the Constitution, not one who does his level best
to work around it, as if it is some roadblock to his success. Governance
by Executive Order is a dictatorship, not a Constitutional Republic.
Similarly, a president led by his faith is inappropriate, as a president
should be guided by the Constitution, not a religion.]{.rendered_qtext}
