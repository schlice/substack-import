Good question. To make the point, ask the next person who tells you that
a transwoman is a woman to define what a woman is. They'll likely tell
you that "a woman is anyone who says they are a woman."

But you'll be ready, because such an answer is a logical fallacy called
"circular reasoning." It's exactly like saying "The Bible is true
because the Bible says it is true."

If a woman is anyone who says they are a woman, does that same logic
hold true for anything? Is a doctor anyone who says they are a doctor?
Is a black person anyone who says they are a black person? Is a child
anyone who says they are a child?

\

The point is, you do not "define biological sex." Biological sex is
exactly what it is. It is **immutable:** that means it cannot be
changed. It is **real:** that's just the way it is and everyone knows
it, and it is **binary:** there are only two sexes, not three, not four,
and not fifty-seven.

By the way, this is true throughout the plant and animal kingdoms. An
organism's sex is defined by the type of gamete (sperm or ova) it can or
would produce. Males have the function of producing sperm, or small
gametes; and females, ova, or large ones. There is no third gamete type.
There are only two.

Gender activists try to confuse terms by pointing to "intersex" people,
a very small number of people who have genitalia that *appear* ambiguous
or mixed. These gender activists claim the existence of such conditions
renders the categories "male" and "female" meaningless.

But the existence of intersex people doesn't change the sex binary.
Intersex people, those who are physically sexually ambiguous, are not a
"third sex." But gender activists try to confuse you into thinking that
because intersex people exist, transgender people must exist as well.

But there is a ***very massive difference*** between intersex and
transgender people. Intersex people have an extremely rare condition
that results in apparent sex ambiguity. Transgender people, however,
*aren't sexually ambiguous at all* but merely claim to identify as
something other than their biological sex. Their biological sex is
*very* clear.

There is no massive surge in people born with ambiguous genitalia in the
world today. But there is a dramatic surge in people who are
*unambiguously one sex* claiming to "identify" as the opposite sex, or
as something other than male or female altogether.

\

So to answer your question, you identify biological sex in the same way
you always identified biological sex: what gametes you can or would
produce, what internal reproductive structures you are born with (which,
in the vast majority of cases, match the gametes you can or would
produce), and in the vast majority of cases, what external genitalia you
have.

This is how you determine biological sex: through **biology.**
