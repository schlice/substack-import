**Content:** [So you\'re worried about getting into a relationship
because \"most romantic relationships end up going sour\" and his
friends can cause you more grief than, say, a group of MMA fighters? Or
a group of physicists? Or a group of (insert any group other than police
here)?\
\
First of all, I don\'t buy the assertion that \"most relationships end
up going sour.\" They are what you make of them. If you don\'t make
much, then most of your relationships will go sour.\
\
Second, I don\'t buy that police officers, as a group, can cause you
more trouble than others. With the advent of all this video recording, I
think it would be very hard for police, as a group, to target an
individual just to ruin their day. Each cop may want to help his buddy
get back at an old girlfriend who broke his wittle heart (sob), but they
all have to think of their own careers and how damaging it can be to
harass the public, not only for them, but for the department as a
whole.\
\
I don\'t think a relationship with a police officer is any more or less
dangerous than having a relationship with anyone else.]{.rendered_qtext}
