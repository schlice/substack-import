Well, there is one way that you can end up arrested for not paying a
fine.

- You don't pay your fine
- The fines accumulate, along with late fees.
- The HOA turns your account over to the attorney, who keeps trying to
  collect, adding late fees as well as attorney's fees.
- Eventually, when your past due balance reaches the minimim level
  required by state law, the attorney places a lien on your property.
- *Eventually* eventually, when your account goes past due for long
  enough, the HOA and attorney forecloses on the lien, selling your
  house out from under you to pay for your fines and fees.
- But you refuse to leave your home.
- At a certain point, the new owner (the bank) will send you an eviction
  notice.
- You will still refuse to leave your home.
- The judge will order the Sheriff to evict you.
- You still refuse to leave.
- BAM, you're in jail.

So there you go, that's how you can be arrested by not paying a fine.
