**Content:** [Let\'s go through the process for the accused in the US,
and that should clear up the confusion.\
\
First, an individual is arrested for committing a crime. If the DA finds
that there is enough evidence, they will bring charges. During this
time, the suspect is in custody. The 6th Amendment guarantees US
citizens a \"speedy trial\" so \"arraignment\" will take place quickly,
usually within a week, customarily within just a few days. At the
suspect\'s arraignment, he is informed of his charge, is allowed to
enter a \"plea,\" and is then informed (in most jurisdictions and for
most cases) of whether or not he will be released on bond, released on
his own recognizance (ROR), or \"remanded\" to custody until his trial.
Whether or not a suspect is remadned, bailed or ROR\'d at ths point is
determined by the judge based on the severity of the crime, whether or
not he is at risk of \"running,\" and whether or not there is a
possibility that he will not return on his court date. Generally,
someone with strong ties to the community will not run, and can be
released on bail, or even ROR\'d.\
\
If an individual is remanded to custody until his trial, he goes back to
jail until his court date, which can be months away. If a judge remands
the individual to custody until his trial, he is held indefinitely until
his trial date.\
\
If an individual is released on bond or ROR\'d, he goes home, and can
possibly commit another crime at this time. If the individual commits
another crime while out on bond, his bond is immediately forefeit, he
returns to custody, and the District Attorney will likely either amend
the original charge, adding the new charge, or could seek to either
dismiss the original charge, or could also dismiss the new charge, in
lieu of revocation of bond. It depends on what the crime is. Regardless,
if you commit a crime while you are out on bond, you forefeit your bond
and you return to custody until your trial.]{.rendered_qtext}
