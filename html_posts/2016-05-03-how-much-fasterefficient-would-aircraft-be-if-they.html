The aircraft would be faster by the amount of drag which is reduced by
the removal of the wings. This amount would be different for every
aircraft.

Yes, if an aircraft did not need to produce lift in order to fly, they
would likely be large metal tubes, since that is the most aerodynamic
shape available next to the current wing.
