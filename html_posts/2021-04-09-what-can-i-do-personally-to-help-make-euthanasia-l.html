**What can I do personally to help make euthanasia legal in the
future?**

Same thing that anyone who believes in a cause can do to work towards
that goal: **organize** and **work together**.

For you, look for affinity groups which share your beliefs. With 7.6
billion people on the planet, you can't be the only one who believes
euthanasia is good and should be legalized. Search for groups which
share your beliefs. Join them. Work with them. Help to advance their
cause. Donate your time and your resources (money, talents, etc) to do
just that.

Don't resort to illegal tactics to advance your agenda. Don't think that
killing a Senator who consistently votes against legalizing euthanasia
will help your cause at all. If you believe that is a good thing, you've
lost the narrative, and you may be mentally ill.
