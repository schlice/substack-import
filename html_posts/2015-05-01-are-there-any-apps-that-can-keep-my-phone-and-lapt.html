**Content:** [It certainly depends on what you mean by \"keeping my
phone and laptop in sync.\"\
\
If you\'re looking at syncing data files between your phone and your
laptop, check out
[[Syncplicity](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=2ce5d2&url=http://www.syncplicity.com){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="syncplicity.com"}]{.qlink_container}. It is 100%
cross-platform, so it will work anywhere.\
\
If you are looking to sync calendar, contacts, and emails between phone
and laptop, use the Google infrastructure to do it (i.e. Google
Calendar, Google Contacts, Gmail, etc). If you use Google Drive, you can
also then keep files synced too. If you have an Android-based phone,
these sync features with the Google infrastructure are baked into the
operating system. iPhone can certainly sync with Google as well, but
Android has a leg up there since you don\'t have to install anything new
to do it.]{.rendered_qtext}
