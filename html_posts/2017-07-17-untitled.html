**Content:** []{.rendered_qtext}

I would call for help while I took my dog to the vet. Again, I have no
duty to assist the rider, and regardless of who was at fault, the bike
damaged my dog. I am responsible for my dog; I am not responsible for a
motorcycle rider. Accidents do not absolve the rider of responsibility,
it simply lessens the amount for which he is responsible.

Besides, at the scene, it would be irresponsible to withhold treatment
to either the dog or the rider until responsibility could be determined.
Treat or call first, then determine responsibility later.

So I would transport my dog and call 911 while I'm driving.
