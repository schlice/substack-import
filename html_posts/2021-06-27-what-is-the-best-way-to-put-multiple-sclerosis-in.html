This is a really tough question. In truth, there is nothing *proven* to
put MS in reverse, yet. Anecdotally, there are many examples of people
doing just that, either with a combination of drugs and diet, or even
diet alone. Just take a look at [[Dr. Terry
Wahls](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=172475&url=https://terrywahls.com/about/about-terry-wahls/){.external_link

through a very strict diet called [[the Wahls
Protocol](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=d5f415&url=https://terrywahls.com/the-wahls-protocol/){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="terrywahls.com"}]{.qlink_container}. And there are some
therapies which promise to stop or even reverse the disease. One such
promising therapy is called
[[HSCT](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=118598&url=https://www.nationalmssociety.org/Research/Research-News-Progress/Stem-Cells-in-MS/Bone-Marrow-Stem-Cell-Transplant-%25E2%2580%2593-HSCT){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="nationalmssociety.org"}]{.qlink_container}.

Now, I must caution you: **we do not advocate stopping your MS therapy
drugs to go on a diet.** We know that diet and exercise can help you
feel better, have more energy, and generally live a better life with MS,
but **using diet alone to control your MS has not yet been proven to be
effective**. Maybe someday it will be, and Dr. Wahls and others like her
will be vindicated, but today, there is no diet out there (and there are
several specifically targeted for MS) that have been proven to control
the disease process.

And as far as HSCT is concerned, it is still being evaluated for its
benefit in stopping MS, as it is not 100% effective in all cases, and
the protocol comes with *significant* risk. The treatment has already
been approved in the US, but not for MS. There is growing evidence that
HSCT is not for everyone (as I said, it's not 100% effective in stopping
the disease), and research today is focusing on which MS patients might
benefit the most from the treatment. Initially, it appears to be very
effective for a certain subset of patients.

So for now, our advice remains the same today as it did ten years ago:
**eat right, exercise, and take an approved MS therapy drug.** This
gives you the best chance to control the disease, reduce the duration
and severity of relapses, and to live the best life you can with MS.
