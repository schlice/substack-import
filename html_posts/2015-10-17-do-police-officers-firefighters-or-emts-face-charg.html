**Content:** [They do not face \"charges\" as in criminal charges, but
they can face disciplinary actions. Since they are authorized to use
their lights and/or sirens at any time, they cannot face charges for
using them. It is only department policy that dictates when lights
and/or siren are to be used, and those vary widely between departments,
if a policy exists at all.\
\
Police officers are more susceptible to discipline than paramedics, as
police dash cams also record when the siren or the lights are on. A
simple review of the footage will tell whether or not the lights or
siren were on, and a review of the dispatch logs will determine if the
officer was responding to a call. Normal internal department
disciplinary actions will take place if complaints are received and it
is not the first occurrence.\
\
There is nothing in the ambulance that records what a paramedic is doing
and when he is doing it, so it would be far more difficult to accuse,
and then discipline, a paramedic for similar activities. So supervisors
will use volume of complaints to determine who is telling the truth,
basically. If it\'s a one-off, it will be treated as a one-off. If it is
a regular occurrence, the paramedic will be
disciplined.]{.rendered_qtext}
