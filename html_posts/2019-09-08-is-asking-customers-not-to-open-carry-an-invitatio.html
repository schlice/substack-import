**Is asking customers not to open carry an invitation to mass
shooters?**

Let's answer your question by asking another question.

*Why aren't there any mass shootings at police stations or gun ranges?*

The answer: **armed resistance**.

Mass shooters may have lost their grasp on reality, but that does not
make them stupid. They know they want to kill as many people as they
possibly can before they go down in a blaze of glory. This is undisputed
fact. Every mass shooter who remained alive after their shooting has
admitted that this was their goal. This is why police all over the
country have re-tooled their active shooter protocols to get in as
quickly as possible without waiting for backup forces to try to engage
the shooter immediately. History has shown that mass shooters will end
their shooting sprees when confronted with armed resistance.

**Mass shootings, therefore, happen in places where shooters are likely
to find the least armed resistance.**

To that end, does it make more sense to *increase* or *decrease* the
amount of armed resistance a mass shooter might encounter in any
particular location?

Clearly then, this call to end open carry in stores is not something
done out of an abundance of safety. It's done out of *fear,* as a
knee-jerk reaction, and it's also done to *virtue-signal* that you're
one of the "woke" corporations who finds gun violence distasteful, and
to even allow law-abiding citizens to exercise their rights is somehow
similarly distasteful. Never mind that it equates law-abiding citizens
to criminals. Never mind that Home Depot still rented trucks to people
after a madman killed eight and injured 11 more with a rented Home Depot
truck in New York City. But guns? Sure, let's virtue-signal with those.

Let's note that this has nothing whatsoever to do with *concealed
carry*. So their virtue signaling affects me not in the least.
