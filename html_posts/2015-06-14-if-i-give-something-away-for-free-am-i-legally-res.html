**Content:** [Generally, the cost is not relevant to whether or not you
are liable for damages.\

If you give away free calculators and they cause damage, you could be
responsible for the damages they cause. You should include a warranty
with your calculators that releases you from liability, something like
this. This is a modified excerpt from a warranty I used to provide for
items I sold on eBay in the early days before eBay guaranteed items its
sellers sold. Note that IANAL, and I cannot guarantee you that this
warranty will cover you in any partictular situation, but it worked for
me:\
\
\"THIS PRODUCT IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\" WITH NO WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND,
EITHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY. SELLER SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS ANY

PURPOSE AND INFRINGEMENT. THE EXCLUSIVE REMEDY AGAINST SELLER FOR ANY
CAUSE OF ACTION RELATING TO THE HANDLING OR USE OF THE PRODUCTS SOLD BY
SELLER IS A CLAIM FOR DAMAGES AND IN NO EVENT SHALL DAMAGES OR ANY OTHER
RECOVERY OF ANY KIND AGAINST SELLER EXCEED THE PRICE OF THE SPECIFIC
PRODUCTS WHICH CAUSED THE ALLEGED LOSS, DAMAGE, INJURY, OR OTHER CLAIM.
SELLER SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR, AND ANY AND ALL CLAIMS AGAINST SELLER
ARE WAIVED FOR, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES
OR EXPENSES OF ANY NATURE, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO: LOSS OF PROFITS
OR INCOME, AND PROPERTY LOSS OR DAMAGE, WHETHER OR NOT BASED ON SELLER'S
NEGLIGENCE, BREACH OF WARRANTY, STRICT LIABILITY IN TORT OR ANY OTHER
CAUSE OF ACTION. THIS WARRANTY GIVES YOU SPECIFIC LEGAL RIGHTS, AND YOU
MAY HAVE ADDITIONAL RIGHTS WHICH VARY FROM STATE TO STATE.\"\

In general, sites like instructables have clauses that say that you (the
contributor) are not responsible for anything that happens to the
builder if they follow your instructions and build something that
malfunctions. If they don\'t, you should consider including a warranty
statement similar to the one above in the fine print.]{.rendered_qtext}
