*Roe v. Wade* was overturned because it was based on a flawed
Constitutional premise. That flawed premise was that there was an
inherent right to privacy written in the "emanations and penumbras"
Constitution. *Roe* found that there was a Constitutional right to
abortion because there was a right to privacy in the Constitution. The
Court rightly concluded that there is no **actual** right to privacy
written in the Constitution. Therefore, *Roe* was overturned because it
was based on a flawed premise.

*Obergefell v. Hodges* was decided based on an *actually-written*
Constitutional provision. It said that the 14th Amendment requires
states to license same-sex marriage. On **that basis alone**, that
particular ruling is not really in question.

However, the fallout from *Obergefell* opened the door to many different
laws, including transgender surgery on minors, bathroom and shower
facility challenges, and collegiate sport participation by transgender
individuals.

Many of these cases are gaining momentum, and *Obergefell*'s foundation
isn't quite as steady as some think.

Personally, I don't think the Court is ready to overturn *Obergefell,*
despite the fact that some of these cases may move forward. I think the
court will make individual exceptions, but I don't think they are
prepared to overturn *Obergefell*. While the claim of *Obergefell*
threatening religious rights is out there, I think the Court has been
clear that the First Amendment protects the right of religious people to
practice their religion, even if that means they choose to not do
certain business with some same-sex people on religious grounds. and the
Court has upheld that right.

So as long as they are willing to walk that tightrope, I see
*Obergefell* standing for the time being.
