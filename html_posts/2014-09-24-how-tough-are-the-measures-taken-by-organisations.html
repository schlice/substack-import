**Content:** [I\'m not sure what you mean by \"misuse\" but if you\'re
talking about discharging those weapons and not telling anyone, in the
US the military is much tougher on that than the police. I speak from a
US military police standpoint.\
\
The civilian police are required to follow department policy and the law
regarding carrying and use of firearms, both on and off duty.\
\
Military police is a little different. On a random basis, security
forces personnel are asked to \"block\" their ammo at the end of a shift
when they turn their weapons back into the armory. \"Blocking\" ammo is
a process by which personnel empty their magazines and place them
slug-down in a \"peg board\" which has enough room to hold their
standard issue ammunition (personnel with pistols have 30-round blocks,
personnel with rifles have 120-round blocks). This allows the serial
number of all the rounds to be examined by the armorer to ensure that
all rounds are present and all are from the same lot. Once all the ammo
was checked, the personnel had to reload the mags. This was a big pain
especially if you were carrying a rifle, but it is what it is.\
\
That didn\'t stop someone from removing the military ammo and firing
their own ammo through the weapon and then replacing the military ammo,
but that\'s a lot of work, and usually you\'re too busy to have time to
do something like that.]{.rendered_qtext}
