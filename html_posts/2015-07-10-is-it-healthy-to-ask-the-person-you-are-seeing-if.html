**Content:** [I think any relationship, sexual or otherwise, should be
handled with open, honest conversation. Tell her your needs and your
wants. Ask her if you are providing her with everything she wants and/or
needs. Is there something else you can do to make her happier, either in
or out of bed?\
\
Don\'t focus the conversation on sex, focus it on your relationship as a
whole. I think if you can talk openly and honestly about anything, you
will have a more fulfilling relationship.]{.rendered_qtext}
