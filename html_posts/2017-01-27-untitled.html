Actually, there were two crimes.

- First, there was a sexual assault.
- This was immediately followed by a physical assault, which could
  easily be considered "self defense," which is an affirmative defense.

So could the police charge her? Yes, but it would be ridiculous to do
so, since it is extremely likely she'd get off (no innuendo intended)
with a self-defense claim, and the DA complaining, "why are you bringing
me these crap cases? I can't make this case!" Besides, while what she
did was technically a crime, it was in self-defense, and it's generally
bad public policy to charge victims. Local newspapers like that kind of
thing because the incredulousness of the action makes money for them,
but it's not something that could or should rightly be done.

Even without her being criminally charged, he could try to sue her for
assault and battery, and while his payout would most definitely be
limited by his criminal conduct which incited the assault and battery,
he might get enough money out of her to get his dry cleaning paid for.
Emphasis on might, depending on the judge.
