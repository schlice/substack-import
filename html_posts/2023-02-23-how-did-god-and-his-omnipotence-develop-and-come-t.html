You've got a lot of words here, but the basic gist of your question is:
**Where did God come from?**

However, God is ***eternal***. Logically, something that is eternal has
no beginning and no end. Therefore, it is illogical to ask where God
came from, because He did not come from anything. He always existed.

Here's the problem we're running into.

*Time* is a concept which is part of our universe. When God created our
universe, He created everything we know: time, space, and matter. But in
order to *create* these things, He must exist *outside* of these things.
He is not bound to our concept of *time*. There is no "before" or
"after" for God. For God, everything is **now**. The past is now. The
present is now. The future is now. He exists outside of time because He
created time. You can't create something while you are a part of that
thing, or you would have to create yourself, and that is analytically
false.

Therefore, God always existed. He existed before anything else existed,
and He will exist after everything else is gone. His existence is not
relatable to our concept of time. In order for God to have "spawned,"
there would have to be a "before" when God did not exist, and an "after"
when God existed. But God is not bound by concepts like "before" or
"after" as those are only relevant when you are bound by a universe in
which time is a thing.

Tough concept to wrap your brain around, but there it is.
