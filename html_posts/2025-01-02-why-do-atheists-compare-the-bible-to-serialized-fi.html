It's a challenge, but they manage to pull it off.

In order to characterize the Bible as fiction, you have to ignore all of
the fact in it. And there's tons of archaeological and historical fact
in the Bible, that even honest atheists must admit to. There are
accounts of real historical figures and real geological events and real
historical locations which archaeologists have discovered.

When questioned, they certainly wouldn't take issue with these, because
they have been physically discovered. If they can see it, feel it, etc.,
then it's proven.

There's only one problem, then. *God, necessarily, exists outside of the
physical realm, and can't be seen or touched.* You're never going to
find one of God's hairs or see one of God's footprints, because God is
not made of material (if He exists, and if He created the universe, then
He necessarily exists outside of the universe). So you're never going to
be able to find material evidence of an immaterial God.

In order to reject the Bible then, you only need to limit your
definition of *evidence* to that which can be proven by the Scientific
Method, that which can be sensed by the physical senses.

But of course, we know that things exist outside of the physical. We
know that sunsets are beautiful and the Nazis were evil. We are
certainly rational to believe these things, but not because we have
physical evidence to prove them. So we all believe in some things which
can't be physically detected.

Still, it is a challenge to deny the Bible. It actually takes much more
faith to deny the Bible than to believe it.

In other words, it takes a lot more faith to believe that these things
didn't happen than that they did.

So you certainly can deny the truth of the Bible, but it's not easy.
