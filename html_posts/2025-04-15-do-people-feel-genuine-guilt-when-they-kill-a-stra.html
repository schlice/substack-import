Most well-adjusted people would feel genuine guilt for doing something
they know is wrong. However, **there are some people who** ***do not
feel guilty*** **about doing what they** ***know*** **is wrong.**

Clearly, we need to explain this a little more, and this all ties in to
what we know as the Moral Law. We intuitively know that all people are
impressed with a fundamental sense of right and wrong. We call that "the
Moral Law." Everyone knows, for example, that love is better than hate
and that courage is better than cowardice. University of Texas at Austin
professor J. Budziszewski writes, "Everyone knows certain principles.
There is no land where murder is virtue and gratitude vice." C. S. Lewis
wrote, "Think of a country where people were admired for running away in
battle, or where a man felt proud of double-crossing all the people who
had been kindest to him. You might just as well try to imagine a country
where two and two made five."

In other words, **everyone** ***knows*** **there are absolute moral
obligations**. An absolute moral obligation is something that is binding
on all people, at all times, in all places. This is the foundation of
the Moral Law.

This does not mean, however, that every moral issue has easily
recognizable answers or that some people don't deny that absolute
morality exists. There are indeed difficult problems in morality, and
people suppress and deny the Moral Law every day. It just means that
there are basic principles of right and wrong that everyone knows,
whether they will admit it or not. Budziszewski calls this intuitive,
inborn knowledge of right and wrong "what we can't not know," in his
book by that title.

We can't not know, Budziszewski writes, that it is wrong to kill
innocent human beings for no valid reason. Most people would feel guilty
if they were to kill an innocent person in this way. However, some
people may *deny* what they know to be true and commit murder anyway.
But deep in their hearts they *know* murder is wrong. **Even serial
killers** ***know*** **murder is wrong; they just may not feel guilt
about it. They may rationalize it or explain it away, but they**
***know*** **it is wrong.**

Like all absolute moral laws, murder is wrong for everyone, everywhere:
in America, India, China, Japan, the UK, and in every other country.
Murder is wrong whether you have been taught that murder is wrong, or
whether you have lived on an isolated island nation which has no contact
with the outside world. That's what the Moral Law tells every human
heart.

This understanding leads us to the undeniable conclusion that while
everyone knows murder is wrong, some people have the inability to feel
guilt, or have the ability to rationalize what they know is wrong, and
murder anyway.
