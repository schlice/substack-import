This is a really tricky question.

In general, you cannot legally record someone in an area in which there
exists a reasonable expectation of privacy. Bathrooms are one of those
places.

However, you still find schools putting cameras in bathrooms, to protect
students and to reduce vandalism.

In most cases, cameras in school bathrooms is completely illegal. The
school *may* have an out if all of their stalls have floor-to-ceiling
doors within which the camera may not see. However, it's still possible
that a student could use the bathroom, not the stall, for changing
clothes, and the camera would still constitute an invasion of privacy.

It's a very tenuous legal question, and one in which the school would
easily find itself defending against charges of invasion of privacy, and
you just have to wonder if the school is willing to risk such legal
trouble, and if the camera is worth the effort.

Also, state and local laws must be followed, and some states have banned
cameras in bathrooms completely. Check your state and local laws for
more specific rules.

It's far more beneficial to put cameras just outside the bathroom to
catalog who goes in and out, and when.

**TL;DR: There are very few exceptions to the "no cameras in bathrooms"
rule that would overcome a legal challenge to an invasion of privacy
charge. A student using the bathroom or changing in there has a very
strong expectation of privacy, and it's unlikely the school has a
substantial enough need to record students during the course of these
activities to justify it.**
