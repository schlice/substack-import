**Do you agree with John Dingell that the Senate should be abolished?**

We can abolish the Senate at the same time that we abolish all the
states.

If you review the rest of Dingell's comments, you can see that what he
is really advocating for is a national government that is overarching,
and reducing or eliminating the authority of the state.

One of the things he advocates for is "an electoral system based on full
participation." But this ignores the fact that we don't have *one
national election*. We have 51 separate elections, and each state
decides on its own how to conduct those elections, along with how to
divvy up their electoral votes. For example, Dingell and other Democrats
make the argument that the minority in a state are *not heard* because
100% of the electors in that state vote for one Presidential candidate.

That doesn't mean the minority is not heard. It means the minority *lost
the state election.*

What Dingell and other Democrats conveniently ignore is the other part
of the Great Compromise:

**Citizens vote for Representatives. States vote for the President.**

As part of the original plan under the Constitution, the President was
elected by Congress. Opponents of too much centralized power concluded
that the legislature could install whomever they got together and chose
to head the Executive Branch, weakening its check on Congress if that
person was nothing more than a puppet of Congress. This is one of the
reasons that the Electoral College was developed in the way that it was:
to allow for the states to elect the President but to do it in a way
that *mirrored* the structure of Congress.

It also embodies the fact that *the state is a sovereign entity.* It is
only by ignoring this fact that you can lobby for one national election
instead of 51 state and territorial elections, and for abolishing the
Senate (or neutering it by rolling it into the House).

The very purpose of the Great Compromise is to balance the needs of the
*people* and the needs of the *state*. Each one of those entities is
sovereign: the state is sovereign, as is the citizen. The state has as
much right to equal representation as does the citizen. The expansion of
the population of the country does not change that fact.

We already have a solution to counter the imbalance of power in the
Senate: *the House of Representatives*. The House represents the people,
and the Senate represents the state. House representation is based on
state population, so California has much more representation in the
House than Rhode Island or Nebraska.

Of course, people were so confused by the 17th Amendment that they think
that the House is elected by the people and the Senate is elected by the
people so why bother having two?

I say that to get rid of the confusion, **we should repeal the 17th
Amendment** and let states choose their Senators. Then the House would
truly represent the people, and the Senate would truly represent the
state.

I'd say rather than slide further down this socialist rat hole, let's
fix the issues that got us here in the first place and repeal the 17th
Amendment.
