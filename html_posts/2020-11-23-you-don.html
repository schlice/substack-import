**You don't drive a car with the intention of being in a accident so why
do people say you shouldn't have sex if you don't want to get pregnant.?
Accidents happen.**

**TL;DR: because sex is designed to cause pregnancy.**

Longer answer: you do drive a car with the intention of going from one
place to another (or perhaps going somewhere and coming back to the same
place). But always, you drive a car with the intention of going
someplace.

Have you ever known anyone to get out of a car and say, "Hey! I never
consented to traveling in a car! I never consented to going from one
place to another!" Of course not, because getting in a car implies going
from one place to another, ***because that's what cars were designed
for.*** Sure, cars are fun, and sure, the risk of accidents is there,
but you got into a car because you wanted/needed to go somewhere.

Now that we've framed your example correctly, let's apply it to sex.
Physiologically, the purpose of sex is procreation. There are only two
animal species who engage in sex for pleasure: humans and dolphins
(based on scientific observations of dolphins copulating year-round even
though females are only fertile for a few months of the
year).[\[1\]](#uiHgx){#cite-uiHgx .citation_link} This suggests that sex
for pleasure, as far as physiology goes, is a *side-effect* of sex, or
something intended to trigger a *desire* for sex, but ultimately it
serves the same purpose: to encourage the participants to procreate.

Just as you can't voluntarily enter a car and not consent to traveling
from one place to another, you can't voluntarily consent to sex and not
consent to the primary purpose of sex: *procreation*. Actively avoiding
procreation may be one thing, but as we know, no birth control is 100%
effective. Nature is very good at accomplishing its goals, and despite
our best efforts at working around nature's goals, nature always seems
to manage to find a way.

Calling it an "accident" is like saying you drove a car and
"accidentally" ended up in a different place than when you first got in
the car. It's not an accident. It's intentional. So when you call
pregnancy an "accident," you're missing the point because you're not
framing the discussion correctly. It's only an accident because it
wasn't *your* intention. It's always *sex's* intention though: to make
babies. That means that every time you have sex, you consent to making
babies. You may try to not have a baby, but like I said, nature always
manages to find a way. But that's what you signed up for when you
engaged in a behavior designed to make babies. While you can try to not
make a baby, you cannot absolve yourself of the responsibility of your
actions when you engaged in that activity in the first place.
