**Content:** [Let\'s continue with your thought. Let\'s assume for a
second as a hypothetical (even though all the answers on this page show
you that it is not true) that a well-regulated militia is no longer
necessary to the security of a free state. (I shudder just to type it).\
\
Because this prefatory clause no longer applies, does that somehow
weaken or nullify the operative clause?\
\
Again, let\'s look at the Founders and the time the Constitution was
written. The Founders were brought up in the time of the \"common law.\"
The Supreme Court said it in Ex Parte Grossman, 267 U.S. 87 (1924)\

\
Therefore, in defining and writing the new law of the land, they based
their thoughts on common law. We can therefore look to the common law to
determine their intentions.\
\
William Blackstone\'s *Commentaries* which addressed issues of common
law were influential at the time of the formation of the new government,
both in Britain and in America. Blackstone said, \"Self-defense \[\...\]
is justly called the primary law of nature.\" Since self-defense is a
law of nature, it was also considered to be a \"natural right.\"
Therefore, an armed population was necessary to preserve that right. He
went on to say, \"The subjects of England are entitled to the right of
having and using arms for self-preservation and defense.\" When the
Constitution was formed, this was a plainly understood undergirding
idea. Even some of the laws in the colonies reflected that colonists
were required to be armed.\
\
The Founders also knew that the first step in enslaving a population was
to disarm them. During the Virginia Convention, George Mason stated,
\"Forty years ago, when the resolution of enslaving America was formed
in Great Britain, the British Parliament was advised by an artful man
\[\...\] to disarm the people.\"\
\
The Founders, therefore, expected the population to always keep and bear
arms at all times, and not just because they were part of the militia.
They were expected to maintain \"self-preservation and defense\" and to
be able at all times to resist tyranny.
