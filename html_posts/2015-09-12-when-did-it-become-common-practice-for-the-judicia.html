**Content:** [The SCOTUS does not \"create\" law where there was no
existing law.\
\
What they sometimes do is read ideas into the Constitution where they
did not exist before.\
\
For example, *Roe v. Wade* established a \"right to privacy\" which does
not exist word-for-word in the Constitution. Nevertheless, cobbling case
law together and using the existing principles within the Constitution,
the SCOTUS at the time found that there was an assumed right to
privacy.\
\
Case law can sometimes change how an existing law is interpreted, and
while that interpretation may be in line with the Constitution, it may
not be what legislators intended. That said, it does not \"create\" law
when laws did not previously exist.]{.rendered_qtext}
