**Do the same needs exist today that existed when the 2nd Amendment was
written to the extent that it is still necessary?**

I'm going to edit my answer.

I think the first thing you have to do is identify what exactly was the
"need" that drove the creation of the 2nd Amendment.

People who did not study Constitutional Law probably think the
***ONLY*** need is the one that is listed in the prefatory clause

> *A well-regulated militia, necessary to the security of a free State*

That was indeed one of the needs which existed at the time of the
drafting of the 2nd Amendment.

**BUT DON'T BE FOOLED! IT'S NOT THE ONLY ONE!!!**

We need only look to the writings of the Founders to see that. James
Madison postulated that because the American people were armed, they
would be almost impossible to subdue through military force, even if one
assumed that the federal government would try to use an army to do so.
In *Federalist* No. 46, he wrote:

> Besides the advantage of being armed, which the Americans possess over

But most important was the right to self-defense. The framers saw this
right to be preeminent among all the other needs for a Second Amendment.
The Constitution was built on the idea of natural rights and the Natural
Law as espoused by men like Blackstone, and they saw the right to defend
oneself as the premier natural right. From this natural right, you can
infer many other rights, for both the individual and for the group, but
the most closely related to this right is the right to arms. The
Founders saw the rights of individual arms possession and resistance,
and of collective revolution where necessary, as aspects of the right to
self-defense. They also saw that the widespread possession of arms by
the people would be a powerful deterrent to both political and
non-political crime.[\[1\]](#HXGQV){#cite-HXGQV .citation_link} To that
end, the 2nd Amendment was codified, but with what prefatory clause?
There were so many reasons why we needed an individual right to keep and
bear arms, but which one to choose? Records indicate that this
particular prefatory phrase was used because it was the most
understandable by the people of that time (they had just finished a
personal armed insurrection against the British), and so they would most
readily understand that terminology. The prefatory phrase, however, does
not limit the operative phrase, because the one scenario pointed out in
the prefatory phrase is not the only reason the Amendment was written.
The self-defense aspect was seen as nearly universally understood, so
they thought it pointless to include it in the text of the Amendment.

Nevertheless, the point here is that the *right* of self-defense (and
therefore the right to possess arms in furtherance of that self-defense)
is a right which predates the Constitution. That's the thing about
rights. They don't turn on *need*. They exist, whether or not you may
need them at that time. Rights existed before government. Government
doesn't grant or deny rights based on need. Governments are restricted
from infringing on rights for any reason, including whether or not you
may think any one particular person *needs* that right.

However, if enough of the country agrees that the 2nd Amendment is no
longer needed and personal firearms ownership is an antiquity of the
past (i.e. I'm perfectly safe walking down any city street at any time
of the day or night in any city in any state in the US, and I have no
need for personal protection), then they can repeal that amendment. They
simply ratify another one and it says "The Second Amendment is hereby
repealed."

Simple. Except not at all.

The trick is that you have to get two thirds of the Congress and three
quarters of the states to agree that the 2nd Amendment is no longer
necessary. And there is ***nowhere near*** that kind of consensus in the
United States. In fact, the majority of the United States still believes
that the 2nd Amendment is relevant and important, even if we no longer
need a people's militia to defend our homeland.
