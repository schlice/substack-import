Eventually, enough infractions and you'll lose your license. Each
jurisdiction is slightly different on that, but when the court sees
you're a willful violator, they will eventually revoke your license,
first for a period of time (i.e. one year) and then eventually
permanently. When you're caught driving without a license, you go to
jail. Then you can use that copious money to hire a good attorney.
