*Reading intent into the 240 year old words of slaveowners concerning
equality and applying your interpretation of them to governing today is
I don't know, a touch presumptuous?*

Interesting, because this is exactly what the Supreme Court does every
single day: reading intent into the Constitution. That's why we have
them: interpreting the Constitution and applying it to today's laws.

Also interesting is your attempt to defame the character of the framers
by referring to them by the politically-abhorrent moniker of
"slaveowners." Yes, they all owned slaves. Our first President owned
slaves, and few question his virtues or his leadership capabilities. It
was only in later times that owning slaves fell out of fashion, so
during the founding, slave ownership was not as politically incorrect
(or illegal) as it is today. It's interesting because it sets the tone
for your answer. Some of us see it for what it is.

Finally, how do you ensure equality of opportunity? You ensure that
everyone has the same access to educational and vocational opportunities
through as many methods as you possibly can: government grants, industry
partnering, education system improvements, family unit strengthening,
etc. The Declaration of Independence says that people have the right to
*pursue* happiness, which implies that there is no guarantee, from the
government or otherwise. Writings from the founders (and writings they
drew upon to write the Declaration) also display this thought about the
pursuit of happiness.

So how does the Supreme Court do it? Thankfully, we don't have to
presume any of the framers' intentions, because we have a wealth of
volumes of their writings to draw from to understand exactly what they
meant by liberty, and that it actually meant freedom of opportunity, not
equality of outcome. There are far too many of their writings to add
here, so I will leave it to you and your fantastic Google skills to find
them. The Supreme Court does it every day. You can do some, too.

You don't need evidence that people believe all outcomes should be
equal. You can see it in the functioning of the last eight years of
progressive government. Candidate Obama said as much to Joe the Plumber
before he was elected in 2008. He said, not implied, said, we need to
redistribute wealth. That means that people who make too much money need
to give it to others who don't make as much. This implies a fundamental
philosophy of "equality of outcome" which characterizes Progressive
character and thought on governance.
