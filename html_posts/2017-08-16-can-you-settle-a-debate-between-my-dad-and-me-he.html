You are right about double jeopardy. The right against double jeopardy
protects Mr. Simpson from being tried again in a criminal court for the
same crime. Even if a video was discovered which clearly showed him
killing his wife and her friend, he could not be re-tried in the
criminal court.

There are indeed limitations on double jeopardy. It only attaches to
criminal trials, and it does not preclude subsequent civil suits for the
same complaint. Our friend OJ was acquitted of the murder, but he was
subsequently sued in civil court for, and found guilty of, wrongful
death. Also, "double jeopardy" only attaches if you were in "jeopardy"
the first time.

In this specific case, OJ cannot be re-tried for the same murder for
which he has already been acquitted. Jeopardy attached, and the jury's
acquittal terminated jeopardy. Once jeopardy is terminated for that
crime at that location, it cannot be re-attached, including through the
introduction of new evidence, or even through reversible error of the
court.
