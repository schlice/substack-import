*(US answer)*

A student who is over the age of consent can have a relationship with a
high school teacher.

A student who is over the age of consent **SHOULD NOT** have a
relationship with **HIS OWN** high school teacher.

There is nothing magical about being a high school teacher which would
preclude normal relationships. HOWEVER, this changes drastically when
the two people involved are part of the same instructor-student
relationship.

Schools have documented the "why" better than I can, so here's an
excerpt from a University of Iowa manual describing why
instructor-student relationships are not allowed:

> There are also special risks in any sexual or romantic relationship
> between individuals in inherently unequal positions of power (such as
> teacher and student, supervisor and employee). Such relationships may
> undermine the real or perceived integrity of the supervision and
> evaluation provided, and the trust inherent particularly in the
> instructor-student relationship. They may, moreover, be less
> consensual than the individual whose position confers power believes.
> The relationship is likely to be perceived in different ways by each
> of the parties to it, especially in retrospect.
>
> Moreover, such relationships may harm or injure others in the academic
> or work environment. Relationships in which one party is in a position
> to review the work or influence the career of the other may provide
> grounds for complaint when that relationship gives, or creates the
> appearance of, undue access or advantage to the person involved in the
> relationship, or when it restricts opportunities or creates a hostile
> environment for others.

When two people involved in an instructor-student relationship exists,
there is an *asymmetry of power* which is naturally created. This
imbalance leads the participants to *believe* that the relationship is
completely voluntary, but may not be as voluntary as they believe it to
be. Subconsciously, the student may feel compelled to participate, and
the instructor may feel like they are not exploiting an imbalance in
power in the relationship when they actually are.

This is why this particular form of relationship is not *illegal*, but
is usually *prohibited by policy* in schools and universities across the
country.

Original question:

Can a student that is over the age of consent have a relationship with a
high school teacher (romantic and sexual) if the parents allow it?
