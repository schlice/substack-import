**If the president gets impeached, how long does the vice president stay
president? Is it for the remainder of the term or for a whole additional
four years?**

Impeachment is a two-part process.

1.  The House must vote to approve Articles of Impeachment against the
    President. You only need a simple majority of Representatives to
    pass the Articles. With Democrats in control of the House, if they
    all vote in lock-step, you can pass Articles of Impeachment. At that
    point, the President is said to have been "impeached."
2.  The Senate must hold a trial. The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court
    (currently John Roberts) will preside over the trial. The trial will
    determine whether or not the President should be removed from
    office. You will need 67 votes in the Senate (a 2/3 majority) to
    remove the President from office. With Republicans in control of the
    Senate, there's no way in Hades that you'll get 67 people to vote to
    remove the President from office. Yeah, you might get a few RINOs to
    vote to remove, but not nearly enough to reach 67 votes.

But to answer the question I think you were trying to ask, if the
President is impeached ***and removed from office,*** the Vice President
becomes President and then remains President for the remainder of the
current term.
