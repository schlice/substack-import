Actually, *mens rea* (the guilty mind) has been a major component of
criminal liability since English common law. You need the *actus reus*
(the criminal act) and the *mens rea* (the criminal mind).

Under the current law, subsection (f) of the Espionage Act is the only
subsection which does *not* contain an element of intent. And no one in
the history of the Act has ever been prosecuted or charged under
subsection (f). There are lots of examples of others prosecuted under
the remainder of the Espionage Act, none ever under subsection (f).

The premise that you can be guilty of criminal liability without
criminal intent in Federal law is against English common law, something
that Federal law generally follows and has for hundreds of years.

The standard common law test of criminal liability is usually expressed
in the Latin phrase, *actus reus non facit reum nisi mens sit rea*,
which means \"the guilty act is not culpable unless the mind is
guilty\". This means you need the *actus reus*, the guilty act, as well
as the *mens rea*, the guilty mind. The intent has always been a part of
the criminal liability statute.

In other words intent is critical. Every other section of the Espionage
Act requires criminal intent. So when the FBI Director says that no
prosecutor would touch this case, it's because no prosecutor is going to
touch a law like this, especially after 100 years on the books without
case history, in a statute that has a lot of history in front of the
Supreme Court.
