I'm not sure what your particular fixation is, but any reasonable
exegetical reading of the Bible says absolutely nothing of what you have
indicated.

**Luke 1:15**

> *for he will be great before the Lord. And he must not drink wine or
> strong drink, and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit, even from
> his mother's womb. \-- Luke 1:15 ESV*

This chapter of the Bible deals with the prophet Zechariah telling
Elizabeth that she is going to bear a child in her old age. That child,
John the Baptist, will have a very important earthly ministry that
prepares the way for the Messiah. Nothing at all about "entering and
filling up a private organ."

**Job 3:10**

> *because it did not shut the doors of my mother's womb, nor hide
> trouble from my eyes. \-- Job 3:10 ESV*

So let's set the scene here. The book of Job details Job, a man who is
described by God as "blameless and upright; he feared God and shunned
evil" (Job 1:1). Satan accused God of protecting Job, and basically
blaming God's protection as the reason that Job was so blameless. Satan
uses an expression my wife loves to use: he accuses God of "placing a
hedge of protection" around Job, which is why Job never curses God. So
God allows Satan to torment Job as a test, but God limits what Satan is
allowed to do.

So in this scene in Job 3, Satan had just previously in chapter 2
afflicted Job with terrible boils all over his body, but still Job does
not curse God. Job is quite in pain, and in response to his affliction,
he curses the day he was born. This passage (3:10) is part of that
discourse. Not only does it not talk about "buttocks" but it has nothing
to do with a birthing door.

**Job 3:11**

> *"Why did I not die at birth, come out from the womb and expire? \--
> Job 3:11 ESV*

Continuing Job's cursing of his life because of his afflictions, he asks
why he didn't die at birth. He asks why he didn't just come out of the
womb and die. Maybe you were thinking that "expire" meant breathing, but
no, the word here translates to "die" or "expire" and not "breathe."
