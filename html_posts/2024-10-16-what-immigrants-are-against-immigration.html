Your question is not precise enough. Precision in language is critically
important. And it's why you are confused.

Immigrants are indeed against immigration. ***But more precisely***,
***legal*** immigrants are against ***illegal*** immigration.

"Illegal immigration" is a misnomer anyway. You can only be an
"immigrant" if you follow the laws of this country in order to get here.
"Illegal immigrants" is a term made up by politicians to confuse you
into thinking that certain political parties are "anti-immigrant." But
they're not. They are only against criminals. Anyone who breaks the law
is, by definition, a criminal.

"Illegal immigrants" are actually appropriately called "illegal aliens."

Legal immigrants, who went through the proper channels to become
citizens, are rightly upset by those who choose, as their first action
of becoming a US citizen, to violate that nation's laws.
