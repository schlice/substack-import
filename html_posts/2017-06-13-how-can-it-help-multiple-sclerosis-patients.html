This is a fantastic question! I think that IT can help MS patients
immensely, and I think that IT as an industry has largely overlooked the
MS community.

The way to properly address how IT should do anything is to look at the
problem itself, and see if there is an IT solution that can improve it.

So what problems do MS patients face? There are quite a lot of them, but
some of the most common are:

- Fatigue
- Walking issues
- Numbness or tingling
- Spasticity
- Weakness
- Vision issues
- Dizziness or Vertigo
- Bladder/Bowel Problems
- Sexual dysfunction
- Pain
- Cognitive Changes
- Emotional Changes
- Depression

How would you use IT to help combat any of these issues? For example,
fatigue can be addressed using occupational therapy to simplify tasks at
home or at work. IT can most definitely be used in occupational therapy
to assist with simplification of tasks. Plenty of other items on this
list, like vision issues, cognitive changes, and walking (gait) issues
can also be aided through the appropriate use of technology. It's just a
matter of a developer believing that a significant enough market exists
to market a device or an application in order to bring the symptom and
the mitigating tech together.
