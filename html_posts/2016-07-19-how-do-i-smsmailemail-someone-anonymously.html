The only crime here is possession and/or distribution of child
pornography. The girl distributed it, your ex-fiance possesses it. If
you're looking to get them both thrown in jail and placed on the sex
offender registry, that would be the way to do it. Immediately turn your
evidence over to the police if that's what you are planning on doing.
Don't mess with the mother, don't mess with the ex, just call the
police, if that's what you are going for.

If you don't want to see your ex go to jail (if the girl goes for
distribution, your ex goes for possession), I would suggest you drop the
whole ex-fiance thing and move on. Seriously. Get that whole train wreck
out of your life. Move on. You can do better.

But that's not what you asked, and I know I'm providing unsolicited
advice, so let me stick specifically to your question. Here are your
answers:

- SMS: You must use a private SMS service. There are plenty out there.
  Just search "anonymous SMS" in Google and take your pick. You pay a
  nominal fee and send away. I'd also suggest using an anonymous payment
  service at the same time, so that even if the police track the service
  provider of the SMS service, you can't be located. I'd suggest a
  reloadable credit card without an account. At best, they could find
  out where and when you purchased and loaded the credit card, so pick a
  place to buy your card with minimal surveillance cameras.
- Email: You can use any web-based email service to send anonymous
  email. Just sign up for that service with fake information. When you
  access the service, you must use a web anonymizer such as
  [[Tor](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=b40976&url=https://tor.eff.org){.external_link
  rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
  onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
  qt-tooltip="eff.org"}]{.qlink_container}, otherwise they could trace
  your IP address back through the service.
