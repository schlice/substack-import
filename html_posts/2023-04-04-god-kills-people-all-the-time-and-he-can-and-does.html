First, let's answer one question. For any question that begins with "Can
God..." the answer is "Yes, God can." There is nothing that God can't
do. Can God destroy souls? Yes, God can.

Second, when it says in Matthew 10:28 that God destroys *souls*, the
word "soul" doesn't refer to the immortal part of us that remains after
we die. The word \"soul\" is a translation of the Greek word *psuche*
and from the Hebrew word *nephesh*. Both words mean \"a living,
breathing creature,\" referring to man or animal. \"Soul\" never means
something *immortal* inside of man or animal.

To make things more confusing, the word translated \"life\" in Leviticus
17:11 comes from the same Hebrew word translated \"soul.\" So that
passage could just as correctly be translated as, \"For the soul of the
flesh is in the blood.\" In Mark 10:45, it says that Jesus gave His
"life" as a ransom for many, but that word is the same one translated as
"soul." Even more to the point, KJV translates Isaiah 53:12 as
"\[b\]ecause He poured out His soul unto death," while NIV translates it
as, "because he poured out his life unto death\[.\]" Remember that the
blood gives life, so Jesus pouring out His blood is the same as Jesus
pouring out his life. So different translations of the Bible, which
originate from different Hebrew revisions of the Old Testament, will
translate that word differently. But in both cases, "soul" refers to the
physical life of humans.

Only God can destroy the physical body *and* the soul (life). No man can
do this. Any killing that man does is only temporary (sometimes called
the "first death"). Luke 12 relays Jesus' words at another time on this
topic:

> \"I tell you, my friends, do not be afraid of those who kill the body
> and after that can do no more. But I will show you whom you should
> fear: Fear him who, after the killing of the body, has power to throw
> you into hell. Yes, I tell you, fear him." (4--5 NIV)

So Jesus is talking about the "second death" which God can do, which He
says is God "throwing you into hell." ***That*** is the destruction of
the soul (life) which is referred to in the Bible. Jesus says that this
is the death to fear. And it is only Jesus' shed blood which can save us
from that fate.
