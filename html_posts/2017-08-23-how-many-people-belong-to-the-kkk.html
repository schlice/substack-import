The Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), a left-wing think tank,
estimates that there are between 5,000 and 8,000 active KKK members in
the United States, but they are highly fractured, and infighting between
the active groups leaves them with very little actual cohesiveness
across their smaller units. There were approximately 130 disparate
organizations in the United States in 2016 which bore the Klan
name.[\[1\]](#sHewv){#cite-sHewv .citation_link}
