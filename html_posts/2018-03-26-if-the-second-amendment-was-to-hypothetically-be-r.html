**If the Second Amendment was to (hypothetically) be repealed, do you
think it will be because of the Pro-Second Amendment supporters
unwilling to compromise on regulations, or because of the gun-control
supporters gaining more support?**

It's actually very easy to answer this question, and the way to answer
it is to understand how an amendment gets repealed.

To repeal a Constitutional amendment, you must pass another amendment
which declares the target amendment to be null and void.

How do you pass an amendment?

First, you have to **draft an amendment**. Then, the amendment **must be
ratified.**

There are two ways to draft an amendment:

1.  Two-thirds of Congress (that is, two-thirds of the House and
    two-thirds of the Senate) must vote to approve a Bill of Amendment
    detailing the actual Amendment
2.  Two-thirds of the states can call a Convention to draft Amendments
    to the Constitution (often called an Article V Convention).

Note that in the entire history of our country, an Article V Convention
has never been called. It's apparently easier to get two-thirds of
Congress to pass a Bill of Amendment than to get two-thirds of the
states to agree to an Article V Convention.

Once you have the Amendment drafted, it must be **ratified**. This means
that three-fourths of the states must ratify (or vote for) the Amendment
to be added to the Constitution. This means that 38 states must all vote
yes, which means that in 38 separate state elections, the majority of
the people must agree to the amendment becoming part of the
Constitution.

So now to answer your question: *If the Second Amendment was to
(hypothetically) be repealed, do you think it will be because of the
Pro-Second Amendment supporters unwilling to compromise on regulations,
or because of the gun-control supporters gaining more support?*

***The answer is neither. It will be because a majority of the people in
38 different states along with two-thirds of Congress agrees that it
should be repealed.***

Right now, there is ***NOWHERE NEAR THAT LEVEL OF SUPPORT*** for such a
notion.
