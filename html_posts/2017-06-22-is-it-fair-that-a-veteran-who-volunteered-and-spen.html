I didn't have a choice in my non-combat role. I wanted to be a pilot.
But thanks to Desert Storm (and its subsequent drawdown), my class of
over 1000 pilot-qualified cadets was given...ready?....225 pilot slots.
So literally less than 1/4 of the pilot qualified cadets were going to
go into pilot slots, and the rest of us would be sorted into career
fields based on the needs of the Air Force. Sure, we had our dream
sheets, but those weren't guaranteed. I didn't get *any* of the choices
on my dream sheet, and I put in for a few combat-forward positions.

I was given a career field where the Air Force needed me. So that's
where I went.

And I learned everything about it, and I served with distinction. And I
served with honor. And I served to the best of my ability.

You see, the military isn't just about shooting bad guys. Of course
there's that, but it takes *a lot* to support the warfighter.

Also, we are military members *first*, and career fields *second*.

Finally, I need to take personal exception to one statement in your
question:

> *Is it fair that a veteran who volunteered and spent all his or her
> time in a non-combatant role get all the* ***adoration*** *and
> benefits of combat soldiers?*

*Adoration*? Are you kidding me? You mean, like girls are *fawning all
over me* because I was in the military??? Please tell me where this
happens so I can see it for myself.

Adoration. Sheesh. Nobody gives a *rat's ass* that I was in the
military. Well, nowadays, I have seen a return to at least *some*
gratitude for military members. When they ask me about my Academy ring
and I tell them that I'm a disabled veteran, they usually say "thank you
for your service" or some similar platitude, and most mean it.

Oh, there's another good point. I wasn't wounded in combat, but I'm
still a disabled veteran. I am permanently disabled due to my military
service. Should I be simply discarded because I wasn't disabled *in
combat*?

No one owes me anything. But the military promised us that if we were
disabled due to military service, we would be cared for. They have kept
that promise. That's all we ask for. Wounded in combat, or developed a
lifelong incurable disease, because of military service, and you are
cared for. Period.

I think that anyone who has taken the oath and agreed to put their life
on the line for their country, ***whether they had the opportunity to do
so or not***, is owed a debt of gratitude that this nation is
ill-equipped to repay. And that's just fine, we don't mind.

*Because that's not why we put the uniform on in the first place.* ***We
did it because we love this country and what it stands for, and we want
you and your kids to still be able to enjoy the freedoms we had.***
