**Content:** [Why bother with self-driving cars? Why not use satellites?
If we buy the correct time on a satellite, we can use the data real-time
as well. Add in some simple drones over a city (which can loiter for
days) and you have all the makings of an Orwellian police state.\
\
Besides the technical problems in a self-driving automobile, I think the
problem with this is that it would seem too Orwellian at some point. And
what infractions would you catch with this setup? You can\'t catch most
driving infractions because in most cases (except for speed), driving
infractions have to be seen by a law enforcement officer before a ticket
can be issued.\
\
And as [[Jacob
Thompson](https://www.quora.com/profile/Jacob-Thompson-9)]{.qlink_container}
said, part of the process of a police officer stopping you involves
education; learning the proper way to drive to keep everyone safe rather
than issuing a fine for the sake of collecting revenue with no real
lesson learned. It\'s best to catch and stop the illegal activity as
soon as it happens so that you can teach that lesson, provide that
education to the driver, not just issue a fine. If that\'s all we wanted
to do, we\'d have speed cameras and traffic enforcement cameras
everywhere, and you\'d never know you broke a law until you got a bill
in the mail. The \"man-in-the-middle\" should always be
there.]{.rendered_qtext}
