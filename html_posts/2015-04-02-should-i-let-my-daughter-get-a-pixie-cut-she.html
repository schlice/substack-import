**Content:** [As a parent, you have to learn **not** to fight some
battles, even if they are battles you can win.\
\
One thing my parents never did (which ended up costing me at least a
year in therapy) is let me *make mistakes*. They were so protective of
me that I *never broke a single bone in my body* until I was in my late
30\'s.\
\
**This** is the time that your children should be allowed to make
mistakes. If she really wants something and you let her get it and it
turns out badly, she learns that she should not succumb to all her
wants, and this is a lesson that will greatly benefit her once she \...
er \... blossoms into a woman. Lessons that kids teach themselves tend
to stick better than lessons we verbally teach them.\
\
If she gets the pixie cut and it looks bad or is hard to manage, in the
back of your mind, you should be thinking that this is a good lesson to
learn, and that this is a great time in her life to learn it.\
\
And, for crying out loud, it\'s ***hair***. Unless she\'s got a beauty
pageant coming up, let her cut it the way she wants. Let her express her
individuality in a safe, nurturing environment.\
\
And if worse comes to worse, it will grow out and she can try it
again.]{.rendered_qtext}
