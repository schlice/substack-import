You can do whatever the heck you want to do to aid your belief that you
can actually get out of the way of a bullet. Especially a bullet fired
at such a close range, there is nothing you can do to avoid being hit.

As *Mythbusters*
[[discovered](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=4f120a&url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3D2qY0DA7DG9s){.external_link

possible to evade a bullet if you are a great distance away from the gun
(a minimum of 500 yards, or roughly 457 meters), you can see the gun
firing (by the time you hear the report, you\'re dead, so you have to
see the muzzle flash), and you move the correct direction out of the
way, assuming you are prepared to jump out of its way because you are
staring at the shooter and anticipating a shot.

Practically, not everyone is a crack shot. At 5 meters away (\~15 feet),
you\'d really have to be blind or have never fired a gun ever to miss.
But further away, it\'s likely that many shots with a handgun will miss.
If someone starts shooting at you, the best thing you can do is find the
shortest distance to **cover** and run there. Doing silly things like
tucking, rolling, or flipping, will not get you to cover in the fastest
way possible. Therefore, if someone starts shooting, keep low and run
for cover.
