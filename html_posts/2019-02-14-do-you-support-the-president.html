**Do you support the President\'s coming Declaration of a National
Security emergency to build the border wall?**

Whether or not I support his decision is irrelevant. He's been setting
this up for quite a while, and I suspect he's going to do it.

Democrats in the House are going to sue him. The courts will not rule on
it because once the President declares a national emergency, he has the
legal authority to use military funding to assist the military in their
duties.

The military has been spending the last month and change laying
concertina wire, which does not a permanent fence make.

This fulfills the legal obligation needed to support building more
permanent border barriers to assist the military at the southern border,
once a national emergency has been declared (see 10 USC ยง 2808(a) for
the legal justification, or he could use the counterdrug mission in 10
USC ยง 284, but in either case, legal justification is there).

Since this becomes a political question and not a legal question,
Democrats will instead call the move an "abuse of power" and will
impeach him. The Senate still won't remove him from office.

Sorry, did I just reveal the script for the remainder of this year?
Oops, spoiler alert...
