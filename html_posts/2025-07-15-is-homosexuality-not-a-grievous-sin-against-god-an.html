So you've asked about a "grievous" sin, and that's borrowing from the
Catholic tradition where they classify sins into "venial" sins and
"mortal" sins. Catholics believe that mortal sins have three elements:

- Grave matter
- Full knowledge
- Complete consent

Therefore, a "mortal sin" is always a "grave (grievous) sin," but a
"grave sin" is not always a "mortal sin."

Mortal sins can actually cause you to lose your salvation in the
Catholic tradition, because Catholics believe that a mortal sin severs
the sinner's relationship with God and deprives them of sanctifying
grace.

OK, now that we got all that background out of the way, this question
was posted in the **Christians and Christianity** Space, not in the
[[**Catholic
Corner**](https://thecatholiccorner.quora.com/)]{.qlink_container}
space. And in the Christian tradition, sins are treated differently than
in the Catholic tradition.

**Christians do not believe that you can lose your salvation. No sin can
"unsave" you.** There are a number of reasons we believe this:

- If it is true that a Christian is a "new creation"...\
  *\
  Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old has
  passed away; behold, the new has come. \-- 2 Corinthians 5:17 ES\
  \*
  ...then he cannot become an "old creation" again. The old creation is
  gone. In order for a Christian to lose salvation, the new creation
  would have to be destroyed, and there is no evidence in the Bible that
  this takes place.
- If it is true that a Christian is "redeemed"...\
  \
  *knowing that you were ransomed from the futile ways inherited from
  your forefathers, not with perishable things such as silver or gold,
  but with the precious blood of Christ, like that of a lamb without
  blemish or spot. \-- 1 Peter 1:18--19 ESV\*
  \
  ...then you were bought with a price. We were purchased at the cost of
  Christ's death. For a Christian to lose salvation, God Himself would
  have to revoke His purchase of the individual for whom He paid with
  the precious blood of Christ, and there is no Biblical evidence which
  shows this.
- If it is true that a Christian is "justified"...\
  *\
  Therefore, since we have been justified by faith, we have peace with
  God through our Lord Jesus Christ. \-- Romans 5:1 ESV\*
  \
  ...then we have been "made righteous." All those who receive Jesus as
  Savior are "declared righteous" by God. For a Christian to lose
  salvation, God would have to go back on His Word and "un-declare" what
  He had previously declared. There is no Biblical indication that this
  would ever happen.
- If it is true that a Christian is promised "eternal life"...\
  *\
  "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever
  believes in him should not perish but have eternal life. \-- John 3:16
  ESV\*
  \
  ...then we are given the promise of spending **eternity** with God. If
  a Christian can lose his salvation, then we would need to redefine
  what "eternal" means. Does "eternal" really mean "eternal"?
- If it is true that a Christian is marked by God and sealed by the
  Spirit...\
  *\
  In him you also, when you heard the word of truth, the gospel of your
  salvation, and believed in him, were sealed with the promised Holy
  Spirit, who is the guarantee of our inheritance until we acquire
  possession of it, to the praise of his glory. \-- Ephesians 1:13--14
  ESV\*
  \
  ...then at the moment of faith, the new Christian is marked and sealed
  with the Spirit. For a Christian to lose salvation, God would have to
  erase the mark, withdraw the Spirit, revoke the guarantee, keep the
  inheritance, forego the praise, and lessen His glory. And again, there
  is no indication in the Bible that this could happen.
- If it is true that a Christian is guaranteed glorification...\
  *\
  And those whom he predestined he also called, and those whom he called
  he also justified, and those whom he justified he also glorified. \--
  Romans 8:30 ESV\*
  \
  ...then at the moment of faith (Romans 8:1), Christians are justified,
  and glorification comes with justification. If a Christian can lose
  salvation, then Romans 8:30 is in error, because God could not
  guarantee glorification for all those whom He predestines, calls, and
  justifies.

In short, a Christian cannot lose his salvation, if he has truly been
saved. The things the Bible tells us would happen to us when we are
saved would all have to be undone, and there is no indication in the
Bible that any of that would ever happen. Additionally, God
***promises*** that these things will happen in the life of the
believer, and God does not break His promises. Salvation is the gift of
God, and God's gifts are "irrevocable" (Romans 11:29). Christians cannot
be un-regenerated. Those who have been purchased with the blood of
Christ cannot be returned for in-store credit. God promised these things
and He does not lie (Titus 1:2).

In the Christian tradition, all sin causes us to fall short of God's
standards. No one sin is worse than any other sin. ***WE*** may believe
that some sins are worse than others, but there's no indication that God
treats any one sin any differently than any other sin. Is homosexual
activity a sin? Yes. But the Bible does not describe the sin of
homosexual activity as greater than any other sin. *All sin is offensive
to God*. Without Christ, we are lost, regardless of the sin we have
committed.

But most crucially, the Bible tells us that God's forgiveness is
available to ***everyone***, even the homosexual, the adulterer, the
idol worshiper, the murderer, and the thief. God promises that He will
give us the strength to overcome our sin, including homosexuality, if we
believe in Jesus Christ for our salvation (1 Corinthians 6:11; 2
Corinthians 5:17; Philippians 4:13).
