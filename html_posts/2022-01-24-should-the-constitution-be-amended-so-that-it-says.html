The Constitution does not recognize rights as pre-existing. That was the
Declaration of Independence:

> We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created
> equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable
> Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of
> Happiness.--That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted
> among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed

So you'd not only need to completely re-write the Constitution, but
you'd need to re-write the Declaration of Independence too.

Should the Constitution be amended so that it says that the Constitution
is the source of our rights instead of how it currently recognizes
rights as pre-existing since it leads people to say that rights are God
given?
