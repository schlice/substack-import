First of all, this article is two years old. There's nothing "recent"
about it.

Secondly, the only thing this poll shows is that Americans don't know
what they want.

The first question in the poll shows that "more Americans want stricter
gun laws." But when you break it down, the increase came from only one
political party. Any idea which one?

Then, and even more telling, is the second question, which asks whether
or not there should be a law that limits gun possession to only the
police.

So while some people think that laws should be tougher (even while not
saying which laws, or *how* they should be tougher --- "well, I dunno,
they just *should be*"), they also continue to say, in greater numbers
every year, that there should not be restrictions on who should be
allowed to own a handgun.

If anything, such a poll could lead to little more than increased
quantities of lazy data analysis and confusion.
