**Content:** [1. If you live in a neighborhood that is
covenant-protected, go to your HOA. They are the best to handle this
situation, since most covenant-controlled communities have regulations
requiring homeowners to pick up after their dogs.\
\
2. If you do not live in a community with a covenant, your first stop
should be with the homeowner. They may be blissfully unaware of what
their renters are doing, and they don\'t want any trouble. The owner of
the property is on file with the city, so go to the city clerk\'s office
to get that information and then write to the homeowner.\
\
3. If that route fails, there are some legal remedies. Under common law
and in most cities, this would be considered a public nuisance and is
probably a low-level misdemeanor. In most municipalities, the law
requires you to pick up after your dog, both on and off your property,
and dispose of the waste properly. These laws are both for health and
safety, as well as for public nuisance standards.\
\
4. Almost every community I know of has Humane Society branches you can
contact for assistance. They can help you get in touch with the right
agencies to contact should it come to that.]{.rendered_qtext}
