<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [1. If you live in a neighborhood that is<br>covenant-protected, go to your HOA. They are the best to handle this<br>situation, since most covenant-controlled communities have regulations<br>requiring homeowners to pick up after their dogs.\<br>\<br>2. If you do not live in a community with a covenant, your first stop<br>should be with the homeowner. They may be blissfully unaware of what<br>their renters are doing, and they don\'t want any trouble. The owner of<br>the property is on file with the city, so go to the city clerk\'s office<br>to get that information and then write to the homeowner.\<br>\<br>3. If that route fails, there are some legal remedies. Under common law<br>and in most cities, this would be considered a public nuisance and is<br>probably a low-level misdemeanor. In most municipalities, the law<br>requires you to pick up after your dog, both on and off your property,<br>and dispose of the waste properly. These laws are both for health and<br>safety, as well as for public nuisance standards.\<br>\<br>4. Almost every community I know of has Humane Society branches you can<br>contact for assistance. They can help you get in touch with the right<br>agencies to contact should it come to that.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
