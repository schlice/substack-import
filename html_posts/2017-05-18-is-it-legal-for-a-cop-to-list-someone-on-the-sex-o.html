It sounds as if the DA and the cops are performing a little bit of
"scared straight" tactics.

As far as I know, there is no such thing anywhere, let alone Oklahoma,
as a "non-registered sex offender" list. That is simply a fiction
created by the DA. You're either a registered sex offender, or you are
not. There is no legal "in-between."

Perhaps what the DA meant was that **he** would consider the person a
sex offender *even though he wasn't on the list.*

And the other respondents explained how you get on the real list. Since
none of that happened here, this person is not a registered sex
offender, period.

You also stated that "according to a police department in Oklahoma, he
is a sex offender." I would get that in writing and then take it to a
criminal defense attorney specializing in sex crimes. We would write an
official letter to the DA demanding that they correct that police
department or face a libel lawsuit.
