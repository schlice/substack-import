**Don\'t you agree that images of teenage nudity should be regarded as
child pornography in the United States?**

I suppose it really depends on your definition of "teenage." In the
United States, "teenagers" are generally considered to be "under 18."
"Teenagers" who are "over 18" are considered to be adults.

And in the United States, "teenagers" (who are under 18) may not be
photographed nude. This is covered under Federal child pornography laws
(see 18 USC ยง 2252).
