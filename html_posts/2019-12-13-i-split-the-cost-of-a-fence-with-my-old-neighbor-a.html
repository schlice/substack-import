**I split the cost of a fence with my old neighbor. A new neighbor has
moved in and is wanting to remove the fence. The fence is entirely on
their property. Can they legally do this?**

*(US answer only)*

Yes.

Essentially, you volunteered to pay for half of a fence which was
located solely in someone else's property. Based on its location, you
were under no obligation to pay for any of that fence, but you chose to
anyway. The new owner is under no obligation to leave the fence up, or
get your permission before they tear it down, since it is on their
property.

You can try to make a claim in small claims court that you actually own
half of the fence because you paid for half of the fence, and perhaps
you can get some of your money back, but you won't be able to stop them
from removing the fence.

Perhaps the neighbor could give you the materials for the fence, and you
can then re-install it on your property with the nice side facing out
(which the neighbor can't prevent, even if they don't give you the
materials). Maybe you can work with the company de-installing the fence
and just have them move it on to your property instead. You'll clearly
need to pay for their labor in installing the fence on your property,
but the materials are all there already.

And as always, laws differ in every state, and we would always advise
you to seek the advice of a licensed attorney in your area before you
take any actions.
