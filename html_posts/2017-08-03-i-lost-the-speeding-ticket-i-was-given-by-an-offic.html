Contact the department which issued the ticket. Just Google the name of
the department, and their main switchboard number should come up. Tell
the operator that you would like to pay your ticket but you lost it.
They will direct you to the appropriate department to either get you a
copy of the ticket, or give you directions on how to pay.

Since you're usually not paying the department, but the State's
department of revenue, there may even be an online option to pay the
ticket. Regardless, the department that gave you the ticket can help you
to make that payment.
