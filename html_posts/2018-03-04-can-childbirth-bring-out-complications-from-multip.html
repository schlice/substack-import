Thanks for the A2A, but I don't have anything to add to
[[Me](https://www.quora.com/profile/Me-9043)]{.qlink_container}'s
answer.

It is well known that pregnancy will suspend MS symptoms. There are a
number of theories around why this happens, but we know it's most likely
hormonal. We know that prolactin has a property which causes
regeneration of myelin (but it's unsuitable as a treatment for men, as
it also causes male lactation, so there's that). Anyway, we know that
pregnancy will temporarily suspend MS symptoms.

But as Dion mentioned, you're probably going to be off of your MS meds
during your pregnancy, and you should be prepared to experience a
relapse shortly after childbirth. Prepare for it, and you'll be fine.

Pregnancy and childbirth does not *exacerbate* MS. It doesn't make your
disease worse, so far as we can tell. There will be a noticeable pause
during pregnancy, followed by a pretty likely relapse after childbirth.
But that's about it.
