The HOA can certainly drop insurance on common property, even on limited
common property. The CC&R should state somewhere that insurance coverage
must be continued on common property. If it does not, then that
oversight must be corrected immediately.

We know that it is oversight because for the majority of states, an HOA
failing to maintain insurance is usually illegal under that state's HOA
laws. You can immediately retain an attorney and file for an injunction
requiring the HOA to maintain the insurance, or reacquire it if they do
not currently have an active policy.

If they fail to do so, the HOA can be found to be in violation of state
law, and the state can forcefully disband the HOA and replace it with
state agents until state law is fulfilled, ensure that the Governing
Documents match state law, and then return it to residents.
