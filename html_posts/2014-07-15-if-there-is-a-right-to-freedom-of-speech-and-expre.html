**Content:** [Why can\'t you yell \"fire\" in a crowded movie theater if
there is no fire? Just because you have free speech doesn\'t mean you
have an unfettered, unrestricted right to say anything you want at any
time and for any conceivable reason.\
\
We tend to forget that every right we have in this country comes with an
associated responsibility. You have the right to free speech, but you do
not have the right to harass or intimidate with your speech. You have
the responsibility to use your speech responsibly.]{.rendered_qtext}
