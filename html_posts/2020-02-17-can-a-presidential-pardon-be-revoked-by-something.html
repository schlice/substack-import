**Can a presidential pardon be revoked by something that the person
receiving the pardon does or fails to do? My understanding is that a
pardon involves a full allocution and there is no recourse to invoking
the Fifth?**

Once a person is pardoned, the penalty for the crime is vacated. A
pardon does not invoke full allocution. Whether or not accepting a
pardon is an admission of guilt is still a topic being debated by legal
analysts. Presidents sometimes grant pardons to people who are innocent.
If the President thinks someone is innocent and grants a pardon, the
person accepting that pardon wouldn't be declaring their guilt.

**Regardless of allocution, the original conviction, and the record of
it, still remains after a pardon.**[\[1\]](#prNHa){#cite-prNHa
.citation_link} Any declaration required on official forms of whether or
not the person has been convicted remain true. Also, any state actions
against persons convicted remain (such as losing the right to vote or
hold public office). Therefore, we presume that the person is still a
*convicted felon*, still having been convicted of that crime, even
though they have been pardoned. To that end, the person who has been
pardoned **cannot be prosecuted for the same crime again**, because he
is protected under the Double Jeopardy clause.

Therefore, it follows that the person cannot invoke the 5th Amendment
when testifying about that crime (if someone else is indicted), because
he cannot incriminate himself because he cannot be prosecuted for his
testimony. He may not voluntarily testify, but if someone is indeed
indicted for that same crime, the person pardoned can be subpoenaed to
testify, and cannot invoke the 5th Amendment to avoid testimony.

What this effectively means is that if the President pardons someone for
a crime, that person could then be called to testify against someone
else, and could not refuse to answer under the 5th Amendment.
