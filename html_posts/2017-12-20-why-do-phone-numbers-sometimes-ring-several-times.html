**Can a phone be temporarily disconnected, and does it not ring?**

The type of phone will determine how it gets "disconnected." But in all
cases, the disconnected phone will not ring.

**Traditional landline phones**

Traditional landline phones can be disconnected in several ways:

- at the handset
- at the TNI (Telephone Network Interface)
- at the phone company end

The phone can be disconnected manually at the handset, which basically
entails unplugging it. The entire facility can be disconnected at the
TNI, which will disconnect all end units in the facility at one point.
Or you can contact the phone company who can disconnect the wires going
to the facility from their side.

**Mobile phones**

A mobile phone can be disabled in several ways:

- at the handset
- from the carrier

Mobile phones can be disabled at the handset by either removing the SIM
(Subscriber Identity Module) card, or by disabling the cellular radio.
Phones differ as to how this is accomplished, so I won't go into
specifics about disabling phones, but this is in general how it can be
done. The carrier can also temporarily disable a phone from accessing
their network. Carriers do this frequently for "lost" phones to prevent
someone else from using the phone on the network and perhaps racking up
large cellular data or long distance charges. Once the phone is "found,"
it can be re-enabled with another call to the carrier. You can similarly
temporarily disable a phone in this way.

A caveat for mobile phones: many smartphones can also connect to Wi-Fi
networks. There are also applications (think WhatsApp or Google
Hangouts) that will connect through Wi-Fi and can make phone calls.
**This cannot be disabled by any of these means**. The methods I
described only disable cellular phone and data service. You cannot
disable Wi-Fi access to a smartphone, so smartphones will always be able
to make some form of phone calls using some apps.
