**Content:** [EDIT: I am aware I did not answer the question, but watch
the video. The scream from the officer was somewhere between sheer
terror and pain. That touches anyone who has ever been involved in law
enforcement in a special way, so i wanted to talk about that.\
\
In this stop, the officers did not progress beyond attempting verbal
commands. The progression is:\
\
]{.rendered_qtext}

- I **ask** you to do something
- I **tell** you to do something
- I **make** you do something

\
The officer got to the \"telling\" step, but never progressed the force.
When the suspect started the looney dance, they should have been alerted
that this was going to be a high-risk traffic stop and they should have
stopped their original tack and changed the stop.\
\
When the suspect got in the officer\'s face and blatantly failed to
follow verbal orders, he should have been forced to the ground and
cuffed for his own safety, let alone the officer\'s safety, because the
stop should have changed to a high-risk stop. It was clear at that point
he was not going to comply, so there was no need for the officer to
continue yelling. He should have been brought to the ground at that
point. Instead, the officer allowed the suspect to return to his
vehicle, a violation of the high-risk traffic stop protocol. This is
what leads me to believe that they did not properly transition the stop
to a high-risk stop. The second officer in the vehicle should have moved
to assist at this point (the suspect invaded the personal space of the
first officer). He may have even touched the first officer; we couldn\'t
see that from this angle in the video. Either way, this was the point
that some sort of escalation in the use of force was warranted.\
\
Once the suspect went rifling around under his seat grabbing for
something, the incident had progressed past the point of no return, and
someone was going to get shot. When a stop progresses to this point,
someone is probably going to die, and regardless of who it is, it\'s
always sad. In this case, it was two officers.\
\
The officers should have progressed their use of force beyond verbal
commands when it was clear that the suspect was not going to comply.
Batons, pepper spray, and hands-on instruction should have been all in
play well before the man returned to his truck.
