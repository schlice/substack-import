The reason they don't allow medical tourists from the US is because
their healthcare is paid for out of their taxes. Since "medical
tourists" don't pay their taxes, they have no method by which to extract
payment for medical procedures.

We allow medical tourists because our healthcare is not paid by our
taxes, it is paid individually either by the individual directly, or
through medical insurance. Therefore, anyone, even someone without US
medical insurance, can enter a doctor's office and receive treatment,
and be billed for their procedures.

Medical tourism does not create "higher prices."

If medical tourism creates "longer wait times," then the market should
respond by increasing the number of doctors.

Original question:

Should the US stop allowing medical tourists to enter from countries
with universal healthcare that don\'t allow medical tourists from the
US? All we get out of the deal is higher prices and longer wait times.
