**Content:** [You\'re already screwed because you made a verbal contract
with no defined repayment terms. Thankfully you did tell him that you
were actually going to set a date at some time in the future, so with
enough advance notice, I think you can set a date without too much
damage to your friendship.\
\
I don\'t think you\'re ready for court though. First, write a letter
indicating that you are adding the repayment terms to your verbal
contract. Send it certified, give him plenty of time before you require
repayment, but set a start date.\
\
Then, if he still fails to repay you, you can look at court
options.]{.rendered_qtext}
