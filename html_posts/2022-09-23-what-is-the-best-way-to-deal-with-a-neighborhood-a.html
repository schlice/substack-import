There isn't a "best" way. There are ways, and some of them are more
intrusive and adversarial than others. ideally, the best way is for the
Board to respond. But failing that, there are ways to force them to
respond.

The first (and arguably, the most amenable) way to do it is to get a
group of neighbors together to address the Board. Send certified letters
so you know they received them. Remind them that they have a fiduciary
duty to respond to homeowners. The Board should have periodic meetings
that they are required to hold, and those meetings should be open to
homeowners. Find out when those meetings are, and attend those meetings
to get your concerns heard. If those meetings are not being held, the
HOA may be facing some other legal challenges.

If you still don't get any response, you can engage an attorney who can
compel the HOA to respond. As I mentioned, the HOA has a fiduciary
responsibility to respond to homeowners, and failing to respond is an
abrogation of that duty.

Continued failure to respond could result in steps being taken to remove
the Board. The details of those legal operations differ by state, as
well as the rules laid out in the Governing Documents. Your attorney can
help you navigate those operations should you need to implement them.
