Animal cruelty charges can result if you knowingly kill an animal
without cause. Since you had a pretty easily substantiated reason
(defense of a child), you likely won't be charged with animal cruelty.
At worst, you could be charged with criminal mischief, or criminal
destruction of property. Destruction of property ranges from a
misdemeanor to a felony depending on the dollar amount of the property
destroyed. However, again, you have a defense: you were defending the
life of a child.

You *may* be charged with other violations, depending on your
jurisdiction. You may be in an area where discharge of firearms is
prohibited (such as within most city limits), and if you are a person
prohibited from owning a firearm, you would also be charged for those
infractions.

Your defense may be lessened if you knew the dog was aggressive and you
allowed your child to remain in its presence. So first and foremost,
don't allow your child to be near the dog. Don't allow your child to be
in the same house as the dog. If this upsets your mother-in-law, perhaps
she should get rid of the dog, or kennel it while your child is present.

Can you be arrested? Yes. Would you have a fairly solid defense that a
defense attorney should be able to work with? Also yes.

But don't take my word for it. You should talk to an attorney licensed
in your jurisdiction before you take action on any advice.
