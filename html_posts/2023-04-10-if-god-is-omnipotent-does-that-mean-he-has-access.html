100% yes.

This also implies that if this is true, then it implies that **God
permits Satan and his minions to do their work on the earth**.

It's actually not implied. It's written in the Bible. Look at the
interaction at the beginning of the book of Job:

> One day the angels came to present themselves before the Lord, and
> Satan also came with them. The Lord said to Satan, "Where have you
> come from?"
>
> Satan answered the Lord, "From roaming throughout the earth, going
> back and forth on it."
>
> Then the Lord said to Satan, "Have you considered my servant Job?
> There is no one on earth like him; he is blameless and upright, a man
> who fears God and shuns evil."
>
> "Does Job fear God for nothing?" Satan replied. "Have you not put a
> hedge around him and his household and everything he has? You have
> blessed the work of his hands, so that his flocks and herds are spread
> throughout the land. But now stretch out your hand and strike
> everything he has, and he will surely curse you to your face."
>
> The Lord said to Satan, "Very well, then, everything he has is in your
> power, but on the man himself do not lay a finger."
>
> Then Satan went out from the presence of the presence of the Lord. ---
> Job 1:6--12 NIV

Wow. This passage totally blows my mind every time I read it. First of
all, *there's a council of angels?* Yep. But even better, *Satan hangs
out at that council?* Yep. *And Satan continually challenges God?* Yep.

Then, look at what's happening in this discussion. God pokes Satan in
this discussion. He starts by asking Satan where he came from. To be
sure, God is omnipotent; He already knows where Satan has been. But like
a good detective, He doesn't ask questions to which He doesn't already
have an answer. Clearly then, He asks the question for another reason.
Anyway, He asks Satan if he has ever considered the blamelessness and
uprightness of Job. Why ask him about that? God already knows what
Satan's been up to, and yet He asks Satan about Job. *Yet another area
where God is sending a message.*

Continuing on, Satan says "Yeah I've seen your Job guy, but of course
he's blameless and upright; you're protecting him! Wouldn't anyone
behave the same if you were protecting them? Tell ya what. I can make
him denounce you. Remove your protection from him, and I'll get him to
crack."

God says, "Sure, have at it, but you can't kill him." This passage tells
you lots. Besides the different translations which say things like "on
the man himself do not lay a finger" and then others that say "don't
harm him physically," the broader message is that *God limits what Satan
can do.*

The overall theme here is that God is in control, even of what Satan and
his minions do.

But *why*? Why would God allow Satan to torture people?

The only reason that makes any sense is that **God is allowing this to
happen because it's part of His plan. Satan's actions on this earth are
aligned with God's great plan for us.**

But what is that plan? We don't know the answer; we don't know what His
plan is. But we know He has one, and that all things will happen
according to that plan.
