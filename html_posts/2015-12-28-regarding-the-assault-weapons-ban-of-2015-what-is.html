TL;DR: This is an attempt to capitalize on the fact that the
**terrorists** in San Bernardino used rifles to try to get some scary
looking guns off the street.

Short answer: Nope.

Long answer: This is yet another re-hashing of the \"scary-looking\"
assault weapons ban. Basically, something is classified as a
semi-automatic assault weapon if it accepts a magazine and has any one
of the following \"scary-looking\" attachments (with appropriate sarcasm
inserted):

- A pistol grip (which clearly makes you a terrorist)
- A forward grip (you mean like all rifles and shotguns?)
- A folding, telescoping, or detachable stock (because that makes the
  weapon more deadly, that\'s for sure)
- A grenade launcher or rocket launcher (really?)
- A barrel shroud (you mean like all rifles and shotguns).
- A threaded barrel (to accept illegal attachments like those scary
  \"muzzle brakes\")

So because it \"looks scary,\" or was \"once used by terrorists,\" it\'s
an \"assault weapon.\" And because it fires one round with one trigger
pull and then uses the gas to chamber another round (like everything not
a revolver or the vast majority of shotguns), it\'s a \"semi-automatic
assault weapon.\" Those can no longer be sold under this bill. Wow,
that\'s great for the economy. Go free markets, yay.

This means that all the ones we currently have are \"grandfathered.\"
Except that all the grandfathered ones now must be locked. At all times.
No exceptions. Even for using it. Yes, that\'s right, even if you are
using the weapon for a legal purpose (whoa, is there such a thing?), you
can be charged with violating the safe storage clause if it is not right
next to you, within reach, at all times.

It includes only one valid provision: all transfers of \"scary guns\"
has to go through an FFL. \<sarcasm\> That\'s good, because those guys
never act illegally. And when they do, boy howdy, the BATF is all over
them like stink on poo. They totally lose their licenses right away.
\</sarcasm\>

No, only a few Republicans will vote for this (we call them RINOs), and
not enough for it to pass.

The definition of insanity: doing the same things over and over and
expecting different results.

Buyback? Are you kidding? Yes, I see they amended the Edward Byrne
Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program to include compensation for
surrendered \"scary-looking guns.\" But how much will they give? Market
value? They can\'t conceivably give market value (because the whole of
the Federal government doesn\'t have that much money), and when they
don\'t give fair market value for a surrendered gun that is not illegal
(i.e. is grandfathered in the first place), they will be sued.
