In order to do this, we would have to have this mechanism in the
Constitution, and we do not.

Short of impeachment or implementation of the 25th Amendment, the only
way to get a president or VP out of office is to vote them out at the
next election.

If you want one, we'd need a Constitutional amendment to get one. And
I'd argue that we don't want one, but that's not the question that was
asked.

Original question:

20% of Biden Voters now want their votes back. Can we just fire Joe
