**Content:** [I\'ll add my \$.02 at this point.\
\
I am not an FBI agent, and I have never applied to the Bureau. However,
I do hold a Top Secret clearance with the DoD, and have held it for over
20 years. I know what thorough background investigations look like.\
\
I will tell you that the FBI, along with every government agency out
there, realizes that people are people. They know that people make
mistakes. It\'s part of life. But expect them to find out.\
\
So the advice: be up front with the investigators. About everything.
Because they will find out. They will interview everyone and anyone with
whom you have had significant contact over the previous 15 years.\
\
Also, it\'s actually good to not appear squeaky clean. It\'s rare for
anyone to never have made a mistake in their life. Tell them about your
errors, because it\'s okay to have made them.\
\
Understand though that if you have made many, significant mistakes, they
will use those to judge your character. There is a fine line between a
mistake and a lifestyle.]{.rendered_qtext}
