Let's take this a step at a time.

> **Trump has been given immunity by the Supreme Court.**

No he has not. This is the immunity which has existed since the
Constitution was written, and is part of the very nature of presidential
authority. SCOTUS merely recognized and reaffirmed the immunity which
already existed. They did not *grant* **new** immunity.

The ruling held that the very nature of presidential power entitles a
president (or former president) to absolute immunity from criminal
prosecution for actions within his conclusive and preclusive
constitutional authority; he is also entitled to at least presumptive
immunity from prosecution for all his official acts; there is no
immunity for unofficial acts. The ruling made clear that it is the Court
which determines whether an action or duty is "official" or
"unofficial."

When a president fulfills his Constitutionally-mandated duty, what he
does is *de facto* legal, even if a federal or state law makes that
action criminal for anyone else. This is the source of the immunity. It
is not new.

> **Will this create a king**

Most certainly not. He is still bound by the Constitution, and in order
to prosecute a president for an official act which is alleged to be
criminal, the president must be impeached AND removed from office.

But when it comes to the president's *other* official acts, according to
Chief Justice Roberts in the decision, there is on one hand the concern
that allowing criminal charges against a former president for his
official acts would affect his decision-making while in office. "A
President inclined to take one course of action based on the public
interest may instead opt for another, apprehensive that criminal
penalties may befall him upon his departure from office," Roberts
posited. On the other hand, Roberts noted, the public has an interest in
"fair and effective" enforcement of criminal laws. Weighing those two
sets of interests, Roberts concluded, a president should have immunity
from criminal prosecution for his official -- but not his unofficial --
acts unless, at the very least, prosecutors can show that **bringing
such charges would not threaten the power and functioning of the
executive branch.**

But since the impeachment remedy is there, and a president cannot
overcome impeachment and removal from office, the ruling does not create
a king. It does not guarantee that a president can do anything he
chooses without consequence, because he can still be impeached, removed
from office, and criminally charged following that political action.

> **if Trump is elected in his \'official acts\' he can do anything
> including getting rid of his rivals?**

Hopefully, the last section answered this question. If "getting rid of
his rivals" is an action which is part of his Constitutionally-mandated
duties, then the president enjoys absolute immunity. If it is not, then
the president can be impeached, removed from office, and prosecuted.

But the president cannot be criminally charged for performing his duties
in accordance with the Constitution. If a court finds that the actions
were unofficial, even a former president can be indicted and prosecuted.
