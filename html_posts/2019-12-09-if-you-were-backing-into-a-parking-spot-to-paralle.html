**If you were backing into a parking spot to parallel park and someone
pulls in head first and takes the spot, whose spot is it?**

There are no rules as to who gets a spot. General parking spots are
never reserved, and anyone can park in any parking spot, except for
legally reserved spots such as handicapped spots.

There are *etiquette* rules regarding who gets to park in a parking
spot, and it's clear that the other car violated the rules of proper
driving etiquette. If you're making your way into a spot, etiquette says
that you get the spot.

But that's rules of etiquette, not of law. The other driver may be a
complete asshat by not respecting driving etiquette, but it's not
illegal.
