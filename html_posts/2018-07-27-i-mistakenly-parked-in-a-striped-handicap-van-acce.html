**I mistakenly parked in a stripped handicap van access area in a
private apartment complex to drop off a laundry in the evening (11 PM).
Should I challenge the ticket written by the cop if there was no \"no
parking\" sign on the private property?**

If you want to challenge the ticket, you'd have to claim that the
stripes were faded and not easily visible, or that it was raining and
the stripes blended in with the pavement. Basically, you'd have to claim
that you were unable to easily see the stripes. If this is why you were
there, then feel free to challenge the ticket in court.

But if you're just challenging the ticket just because it's your right
to challenge the ticket and not because you didn't see the stripes,
don't bother. Just pay the ticket, take your lumps, and don't park in
striped areas anymore, "even for a minute to drop off laundry." It's not
a space. It's like parking on a median, or on the sidewalk.

That space is left so that people who require ramps to get in and out of
their vehicle have space around it (where cars will not park) to do so.
It's not a parking space.
