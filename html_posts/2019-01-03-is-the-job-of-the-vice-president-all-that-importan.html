**Is the job of the Vice President all that important? It seems to me
like VP\'s don\'t do very much besides take trips around the world.**

As long as you think that it's important that we never have a lapse in
having a warm body in the office of the President, then the Vice
President's role is vital.

The entire purpose of the Office of the Vice President is to be
available to take over as the President as needed.

It's kinda like the understudy in a play. The understudy never performs
the part, so long as the casted actor is available. But if the actor
falls ill or otherwise can't play the part, the understudy must step in
and immediately fill the role.

That's the Vice President.

The Vice President is *President Pro-Tempore* of the Senate. If there is
a tie in the Senate (since there are 100 Senators), the Vice President
casts the tie-breaking vote.

Other than sitting around waiting for the President to die, and serving
as the President Pro-Tempore of the Senate, there are no other
Constitutional roles for the VP.

But that raises the question: *What else does the VP do?*

The answer is that the VP will do *whatever the President tells him to
do.* The President can assign a task to the VP to perform as his
representative. He often assigns several tasks to the VP to perform as
the representative of the office of the President.

The VP is also the President's cheerleader and ambassador. He will
travel to foreign countries and speak on the President's behalf. In this
day and age, the President needs to mobilize and maintain public support
for his priorities. The VP helps the President in that effort.
