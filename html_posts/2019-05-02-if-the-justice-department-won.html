**If the Justice department won\'t indict a sitting President or release
evidence of potential crimes unless there is an indictment- How does
impeachment work if congress isn\'t allowed access to the evidence?**

Congress has its own investigators, plus it has access to the Mueller
report and all of its evidence.

Besides, it doesn't need evidence of a crime in order to impeach.
Impeachment is a political process, not a judicial one.
