Well, as even you just acknowledged, we don't know exactly when Christ
was born, so it's really difficult to have a birthday celebration *on
His exact birthday* if we don't know it, and it wasn't revealed to us by
God.

So I suppose it's a good question: *can you still celebrate someone's
birthday if you don't know the exact date?*

Sure you can. But what are you celebrating? Are you celebrating the
exact date He was born, or are you celebrating the fact that He was
born? When we celebrate the birth of Jesus, we celebrate the fact that
God humbled Himself to step down out of Heaven, "from a throne of
endless glory, to a cradle in the dirt," as the song goes.

But wasn't December 25th a *pagan festival?* Well, that too isn't
certain. The winter solstice never falls on December 25. Likewise,
Saturnalia was never celebrated on December 25. Other Christmas symbols,
such as trees and candles, may have had some pagan connotations, but
those symbols are so commonly used in human history that it doesn't make
any sense to declare that they are exclusively pagan in origin, or that
they were adopted into Christmas as some twisted homage to the pagan.

Also, the meaning of a current thing is determined by its current use,
not its origin. For example, if I were to ask you about the original
meaning of the swastika, you'd undoubtedly tell me all about the Nazis.
But the swastika was the universal symbol for good fortune for thousands
of years. You frequently see swastikas as part of the religious
decorations of Hindu temples from thousands of years prior. It's no
wonder the Nazis adopted the swastika as their symbol. But ask anyone
today about the swastika, and you will only hear about its current use,
not its history. Similarly, if I were to ask you about Nike, you'd tell
me all about an athletic shoe company, not the Greek goddess of victory
upon whom the company's name is based. So too, the meaning of Christmas
comes from our current usage in celebrating the birth of Christ, not the
origins of any celebration around that time in history.

Therefore, to evaluate Christmas, we have to look at what we do
currently, not the history of any celebrations on that day. In fact, if
you were to show a pagan what we do on Christmas day, they would tell
you that it would have no relation to anything that pagans do, and any
self-respecting pagan would be upset by what Christians have done to any
celebrations on that day (if there was a link at all). The modern-day
celebration of Christmas is so far removed from whatever they did
centuries ago, that any relation to paganism can be summarily ignored.
