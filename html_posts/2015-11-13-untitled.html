<h2>Answer Comment</h2>

**Content:** [Joe, you\'re absolutely right. There really is no excuse
for police to hit the wrong address. It\'s just sloppy police work, and
I can\'t abide sloppy work. I won\'t even pretend to make excuses for
it, because it\'s nothing but excuses. It happens far more often than it
should.\
\
As far as I understand it, thankfully, no one has died (yet) from police
hitting the wrong house. There have been some close calls, and there
have been some shots fired, but the intersection of the Castle Doctrine
and the No-Knock Warrant is a dangerous intersection
indeed.]{.rendered_qtext}
