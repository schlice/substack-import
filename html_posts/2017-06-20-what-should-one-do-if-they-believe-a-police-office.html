There are a few problems with trying to determine whether or not a
police officer is real.

You could ask to see his ID card, but what then? How do you know it's a
real ID card? How do you know it's valid? How do you know the officer is
"in good standing" with his department?

Really, the only way to determine if an officer is real or an imposter
is to call 911 and tell the dispatcher what is going on. The dispatcher
will tell you whether or not the officer at the scene is a real officer.
