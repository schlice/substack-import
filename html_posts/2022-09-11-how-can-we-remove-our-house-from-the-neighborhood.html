There are two types of HOAs: *voluntary* and *mandatory*. Voluntary HOAs
(also commonly known as "civic associations") are groups of homeowners
who usually get a benefit or service when they join the Association,
like membership at the clubhouse (while others have to pay usage fees).
Mandatory HOAs are part of the contract you signed when you purchased
your home. They are tied to the property and are on file with the
County. Your deed will state that the property is part of a mandatory
association. The Governing Documents were included by the title company,
and you signed them. agreeing to be bound by them when you bought your
house.

- If you're in a voluntary HOA, you can leave by whatever method they
  have set aside for cancelling your membership.
- If you're in a mandatory HOA, you cannot leave (thus the definition of
  the term *mandatory*). You have a few choices though, the easiest of
  which is to **sell your house and move to a neighborhood which does
  not have a mandatory HOA.** There are other, more difficult ways to
  divest yourself of the terrible burden that is HOA membership: for
  example, you might consider *dissolving the HOA*. You can investigate
  this with a real estate attorney in your local area. This is a
  difficult, time-consuming, and not-free proposition, however, so be
  prepared to be told that you'll make more progress spitting into the
  wind. But others have indeed dissolved HOAs in the past; you may have
  luck as well.

Original question:

How can we remove our house from the neighborhood association if we
didn\'t sign up for it and we don\'t want to pay dues?
