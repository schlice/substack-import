title: '"How broad is the sin of suicide in Christianity? Does knowing of danger but
  willingly continuing a dangerous action count as suicide, like Jesus not fleeing
  the last super or willingly? Or must it be done by your own hands?"'

The motivation is key. *Why* you are sacrificing yourself matters.

Are you sacrificing yourself to save others? *Isn't that what Jesus
did?* Didn't He sacrifice Himself to be the Lamb of God who takes away
the sins of the world?

The Bible also tells us:

> *Greater love has no one than this, that someone lay down his life for
> his friends. \-- John 15:13 ESV*

The writer is describing Jesus, but the idea is the same.

\

Clearly then, taking your own life *selfishly* is a wholly different
story. *Suicide is selfish.*

Let me explain before you rush to the comments.

Now, while it's true that not everyone suicidal thinks this way, some
people believe that *the world will be a better place without them.*
Maybe it's family, who they wrongly think to whom they are a burden.
Maybe it is the world. But believing that the world will be a better
place ***without*** you in it is just as dubious as believing the world
is a better place ***with*** you in it. That's pretty selfish.

Some people have pain in their lives. So much pain that they can't live
with it. So rather than doing the hard work to overcome the pain, they
choose to take the easy way out. Some video game designers, upon the
character blowing themselves up or falling off a cliff, characterize
this as "the coward's way out." I do not personally, but I understand
the thought. Still, rather than doing the hard work, they choose the
easy work. To me, that's also pretty selfish.

Finally, God has plans for you. They are good plans. *But that doesn't
mean that there won't be pain along the way*. The greatest characters
are seared with scars. Churchill said, "If you're going through Hell,
keep going." That's the truth. We have to endure the pain to get to the
paradise. Christ said it:

> *I have said these things to you, that in me you may have peace. In
> the world you will have tribulation. But take heart; I have overcome
> the world." \-- John 16:33 ESV*

Jesus is the model. Go through the pain to get the reward.

So yes, if you end your life yourself, by your own choice, and not to
save others, that is what is considered suicide, and it is indeed a sin.
And it's a bad one because you die before you can repent of your sin.
You take that sin to the grave, which is quite a dangerous thing to do.
