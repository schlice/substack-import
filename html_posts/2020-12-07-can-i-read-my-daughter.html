**Can I read my daughter\'s iPhone texts with an appleid email and phone
number but no password and no device access?**

No. In short, you either need the password, or a court order.

You may even own the account, and your daughter's phone may be a line on
it. You might think that you could just go to your carrier and demand an
output of all of the SMS messages that went to that line, as you own the
account. However, your cell phone provider has an obligation to protect
the privacy of the other participant in the conversation, and you were
not a party to that conversation. Therefore, in order to retrieve text
messages from your cell phone carrier, you must obtain a court order.
