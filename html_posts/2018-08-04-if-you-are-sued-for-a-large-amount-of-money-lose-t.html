**If you are sued for a large amount of money, lose the case, and can't
pay up, can they take your home and cars?**

Depends on your state. In most states, it's up to you to liquidate
whatever assets you need to in order to satisfy the court order. In some
states, they can dispossess you of your property in order to liquidate
it themselves.

In most cases, someone who has been "bankrupted" by a court decision has
literally filed for bankruptcy before the house and the cars are gone.
