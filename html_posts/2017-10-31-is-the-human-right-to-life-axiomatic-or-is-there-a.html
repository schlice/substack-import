In the United States (and this is only applicable to the United States),
our Declaration of Independence actually spells this out fairly clearly
(emphasis mine):

*We hold these truths to be* ***self-evident****: that all Men are
created Equal; that they are* ***endowed by their Creator*** *with
certain* ***unalienable*** *Rights; that among these are the right to
Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness.*

Let's review the words I highlighted:

- self-evident: This word means the same as axiomatic.
- endowed by their Creator: This phrase means that man did not bestow
  these rights on their fellow Man. These rights did not come from Man,
  so they cannot be removed by Man.
- unalienable: This word means that there is no way that anyone can
  remove this right from a person, not even by the person themselves.
  Therefore, you couldn't give up your own right to life, even if you
  willingly chose to.

Therefore, in the United States, the right to life is based on our
belief that such a right was bestowed by our Creator.
