**Can homeowners associations enforce some of their oppressive rules?**

Homeowner's Associations can enforce *all* of their "oppressive" rules.
They can fine homeowners for not following the rules, and if you refuse
to pay, they can place a lien on your home. If you allow the lien to go
too long, or you accumulate too much in unpaid fines, they can foreclose
on your lien to pay off what you owe. That means you lose your house.
