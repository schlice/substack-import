You have not yet received an excellent response to this excellent
question. You have some good answers, but not an excellent answer.

I probably won't give you an excellent answer either, but I'll try to
give you an acceptable Christian answer. And that answer is found in the
following phrase: **the hypostatic union.**

The hypostatic union is the idea that Jesus is both fully human and
fully divine. Along with that idea is the notion that the divine didn't
influence the human, and the human didn't limit the divine, a concept
known as the *Communicatio Idiomatum*. He isn't half-human and
half-divine, like some sort of demi-god or some sort of ultra-human. He
is 100% human, and 100% divine. Yes, I am aware that adds up to 200%.
Nothing is impossible for God.

Before Jesus was born, He existed. His spirit nature did indeed exist.
It's recorded in John 1:1

> In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word
> was God.

This is important because it tells us that the Word (who hasn't been
identified yet) is God. He was present at the beginning, when the world
was created. You see it in verses 2 and 3:

> He was with God in the beginning. Through him all things were made;
> without him nothing was made that has been made.

But at this point, we still don't know who the Word is. We only know the
Word was present at the beginning of the world, and that He was
responsible for the creation of the world (through Him all things were
made). Therefore, we know He is eternal, but that's it, for right now.

But then, we get another piece of evidence, in verse 14:

> The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us. We have seen his
> glory, the glory of the one and only Son, who came from the Father,
> full of grace and truth

The Word became flesh. So the Word (which is eternal) took on flesh
(which is normally not, at least if "normal" is the current human
condition). So Jesus the person did have a beginning, but Jesus God is
eternal.

I know that this is a difficult concept to wrap your brain around; it is
for me as well. Nevertheless, this is the Biblical answer. I hope this
helps.
