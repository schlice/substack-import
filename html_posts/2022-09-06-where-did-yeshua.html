I'm gonna bend your brain a little more.

You said that Jesus' DNA is said to come only from Mary. *Where,
exactly, does it say this? Is it in the Bible?* That's a rhetorical
question. It's not. So ultimately, this discussion is indeed purely
pedantic and hypothetical, as no one will ever know the actual genetic
makeup of Jesus. It's just an interesting thought experiment.

Also, before you all run screaming to the comments, none of this changes
Jesus' *lineage*, as Jesus' lineage came through adoption by Joseph. So
there is no question that the prophesy was still fulfilled in Jesus (He
came from the lineage of David).

There are actually three possibilities for the composition of Jesus'
DNA:

1.  Jesus was 100% Mary's DNA, and the Spirit simply provided the
    requisite Y chromosome to make him male.
2.  Jesus was 50% Mary's DNA and 50% DNA provided by the Spirit.
3.  Jesus was 100% DNA provided by the spirit, and Mary was the
    *surrogate mother*.

Catholics believe in possibility number 2. They claim that Jesus was
sinless because Mary was sinless. This is the doctrine of the Immaculate
Conception, which is often confused with Jesus' conception in Mary's
womb. In order to bypass the controversy caused by Jesus being half
human and Mary contributing that half, but Mary was born of sin herself,
the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception actually states that it was
Mary who was born without sin. Actually, Pope Pius IX declared in the
papal bull called *Ineffabilis Deus* that it was the doctrine of the
Immaculate Conception which made Jesus sinless:

> We declare, pronounce and define that the doctrine which holds that
> the Blessed Virgin Mary, at the first instant of her conception, by a
> singular privilege and grace of the Omnipotent God, in virtue of the
> merits of Jesus Christ, the Saviour of mankind, was preserved
> immaculate from all stain of original sin, has been revealed by God,
> and therefore should firmly and constantly be believed by all the
> faithful. ---â€‰Pope Pius IX, Ineffabilis Deus, December 8, 1854

Protestants do not believe this. Most Protestants (who have actually
studied the issue) believe in possibility number 3.

When Martin Luther initiated the Reformation, he said:

> Mother Mary, like us, was born in sin of sinful parents, but the Holy
> Spirit covered her, sanctified and purified her so that this child was
> born of flesh and blood, but not with sinful flesh and blood. The Holy
> Spirit permitted the Virgin Mary to remain a true, natural human being
> of flesh and blood, just as we. However, he warded off sin from her
> flesh and blood so that she became the mother of a pure child, not
> poisoned by sin as we are. For in that moment when she conceived, she
> was a holy mother filled with the Holy Spirit and her fruit is a holy
> pure fruit, at once God and truly man, in one
> person.[\[1\]](#wJsye){#cite-wJsye .citation_link}

To me, it is more likely that Mary carried, protected and nourished a
fully-formed zygote which was implanted in her by the Spirit. In this
way, it was completely free from the human sin nature. Protestants also
believe that the sin nature is passed through the *male* side of the
parental structure, so the absence of a male in the genetics would
obviate the generativity of the sin.

However, there is still the question of Mary's sin nature. The Bible
supports the understanding that God intervened only once in human
genealogy when Jesus became man. God did not intervene to create Mary
without sin. Instead, God picked Mary as the woman who would birth His
Son because of His grace, not because Mary was sinless. The zygote
implanted in Mary's womb **was already without sin**, because it was not
formed *from* a human.

Some may argue that this doesn't make Jesus human. Yet Adam was formed
without a mother, and he was still considered completely human. And
Jesus is the fulfillment of the story which began with Adam, so it makes
sense that they would be formed the same way.

Other important things to note: Jesus was not only without sin, but he
was without **human genetic defect** which is impossible without the
Spirit also tampering with Mary's side of the DNA. Jesus had no sin
nature, no physical defects, and no genetic mutations. In order to
create Jesus to save all of humanity, He had to create a human without
any of the faults introduced during the normal human reproductive
process, which included genetic defect. This supports even further the
idea that Jesus was 100% a fully-formed zygote, created entirely by God,
and Mary was essentially Jesus' *surrogate* mother.
