I am sorry that your father has MS.

I am even sorrier to report that there currently is no cure for MS.

However, that does not mean your father will not live a long and happy
life. With the current list of drugs for MS, lifespans for people with
the disease nearly match the lifespans of people without MS. We can
control the symptoms of the disease. We can keep relapses at bay, and
when they do happen, we can make them as short as possible, along with
increasing the amount of time between relapses.

While not a cure, the drugs at least provide the ability to live as
normal a life as possible with MS.
