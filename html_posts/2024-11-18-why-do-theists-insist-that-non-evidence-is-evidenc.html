Because they have a different definition of "evidence" than you do.

You likely consider any truth that is not discovered by the scientific
method as "non-evidence," while they do not.

As we've said a million times on this platform, the scientific method is
*one way* to discover truth. Many truths cannot be discovered using the
scientific method. For example, we don't have physical evidence that the
Nazis were evil or that sunsets are beautiful. We believe these things
to be true, but not because we have physical evidence to prove them.

The concept of the existence of God, as an example of something that
theists believe, is not something we can prove through physical or
scientific evidence within space and time. By definition, God is
immaterial and transcendent. He is immaterial because He is not made of
physical matter like us, and He is transcendent because He exists beyond
space and time. Therefore, we cannot expect to find direct scientific
evidence for His existence, nor can we discover physical traces of Him
such as His hairs or footprints. Such evidence is not only currently
unavailable, but it is also impossible in principle.
