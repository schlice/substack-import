<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content:<br>[[User(https://www.quora.com/profile/User-153328)]{.qlink_container}<br>you\'re not telling a rapist anything he doesn\'t already know.<br>Seriously, this type of answer is far more beneficial to the potential<br>victim than to the potential abuser.\<br>\<br>And it\'s not about the mechanics of the rape. Rapists do what they do<br>because they desire *control*. Maybe it\'s mommy issues. Maybe there is<br>some other psychological bent going on. But ultimately, there is some<br>issue that causes the rapist to desire complete and total control<br>over a woman, so much so that he can take her most private, intimate,<br>most closely guarded personal thing (having sex with her) and control<br>that too.\<br>\<br>Can an unarmed man do it? Yes, but there would have to be a lot of rage<br>there to beat that woman into submission, and that\'s not normally done<br>between people that don\'t know each other first. Like [[Name<br>Removed](https://www.quora.com/profile/Name-Removed-1)]{.qlink_container}<br>said, there would have to be considerable grooming there before an<br>unarmed man would be able to rape an unarmed woman, and that\'s<br>something that would take a long time (in the span of months or years).\<br>\<br>That\'s a psychosis you can\'t cure, and that\'s a psychopath who should<br>be locked up for the remainder of his natural days.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
