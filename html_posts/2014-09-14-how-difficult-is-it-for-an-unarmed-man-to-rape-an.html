you\'re not telling a rapist anything he doesn\'t already know.
Seriously, this type of answer is far more beneficial to the potential
victim than to the potential abuser.\
\
And it\'s not about the mechanics of the rape. Rapists do what they do
because they desire *control*. Maybe it\'s mommy issues. Maybe there is
some other psychological bent going on. But ultimately, there is some
issue that causes the rapist to desire **complete and total control**
over a woman, so much so that he can take her most private, intimate,
most closely guarded personal thing (having sex with her) and control
that too.\
\
Can an unarmed man do it? Yes, but there would have to be a lot of rage
there to beat that woman into submission, and that\'s not normally done
between people that don\'t know each other first. Like [[Name

said, there would have to be considerable grooming there before an
unarmed man would be able to rape an unarmed woman, and that\'s
something that would take a long time (in the span of months or years).\
\
That\'s a psychosis you can\'t cure, and that\'s a psychopath who should
be locked up for the remainder of his natural days.]{.rendered_qtext}
