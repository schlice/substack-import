Perhaps I don't understand the question.

Peace officers wear the badges sanctioned by their departments on their
uniforms. Oftentimes, you will see officers in the police equivalent of
"fatigues" or "battle dress uniforms" from the military. They are some
form of "soft" uniform. All of the devices on those uniforms are muted
and usually made of cloth, including the badge. You can only wear the
badge, cloth or otherwise, if you are a sworn peace officer. The
*composition* of the badge is not relevant. It doesn't have to be metal
to be a real badge.

Therefore, NYPD (or any department, for that matter) can't actually wear
"fake" badges. If they are wearing it, it is because their department
has provided it to them. Remember, President Obama urged law enforcement
to "soften" their appearance to try to ease the tensions between them
and the community. You may have seen a move towards a "softer"
appearance in uniform stylings. Perhaps you've seen police officers in
polo shirts with embroidered badges. If the department approved the
uniform, it is not "fake."
