The article is absolute bunk. It's not even worth the server space that
it is hosted on.

Seriously, I want an example of just one person who isn't able to vote
because "they don't have an ID." Do they get food stamps? Medicaid? Do
they get any government program at all? Because **every one of them**
requires an ID. Do they get prescription drugs from a doctor? Needs an
ID. Do they have a bank account? A credit card? They all require some
form of positive identification, and if you have that, you can get a
government-issued ID card, and demonstrably poor people can qualify for
low-cost or no-cost ID cards (depending on the state).

There is an extremely small number of people who don't have some form of
government-issued ID card (or can't get one), and this issue primarily
affects **the elderly**, not the poor. Basically, the argument is that
some people simply have never had, and can't produce, the background
documents needed in order to get an ID card from the state. They don't
have a birth certificate, they don't have a credit card, etc. And even
in these cases, there are procedures for people who can't get the
documents themselves. Do they have children? Do those children have
birth certificates? Do those birth certificates list *parents*? In many
states, having your children present their birth certificates which
indicate the parents (and signing an affidavit) is sufficient to get a
government issued ID card. There are most definitely ways around the
problem. I think the actual number of people who cannot, under any
circumstances, get a government issued ID card (and who don't utilize
any government services which require one) is very small.

The only reason one would want to deny requiring voter ID (as is
required in virtually all of the civilized world today) is to allow for,
and encourage, voter fraud. Period.
