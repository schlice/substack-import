**How are Colorado Springs and Boulder different? How are they
similar?**

I like [[Chuck
Corwin](https://www.quora.com/profile/Chuck-Corwin)]{.qlink_container}'s
answer, but let me give you the *other* answer.

First, let me agree with him: Colorado Springs and Boulder are as
different as cowboys and hippies. And let's be clear: the cowboys live
in Colorado Springs and the hippies live in Boulder.

There's a reason why it's called the "People's Republic of Boulder."
I'll let you figure that one out on your own.

Look, Boulder is a college town. It has a lot of liberals. Colorado
Springs is a military town (it's right in the middle of four military
installations). It hosts the headquarters of *Focus on the Family*. It's
a conservative town.

But beyond the fact that Boulder is smaller and has a small, quaint town
feel, and Colorado Springs is a city of over a million people and has a
large town/small city feel, they're pretty much the same. They both have
direct access to the mountains. They both have the same climate.
Colorado Springs does get the evening shadow of the sun setting behind
the mountains (because it's at the foothills of the Rampart Range) and
Boulder does not (because it's in the mountains).
