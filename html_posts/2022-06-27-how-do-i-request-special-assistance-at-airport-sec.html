That depends on your disability, and what special assistance you may
require.

First thing you should do is to contact the TSA directly through their
**TSA Cares** program:

- 1-855-787-2227 (Federal Relay 711) Weekdays: 8 a.m. to 11 p.m. ET
- [[TSA-ContactCenter@tsa.dhs.gov](mailto:TSA-ContactCenter@tsa.dhs.gov){.external_link
  rel="noopener nofollow"
  onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"}]{.qlink_container}
  Weekends/Holidays: 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. ET

Make sure you contact the TSA no earlier than **72 hours before you
travel** to request the assistance of a **Passenger Support Specialist**
at the checkpoint. That person can assist you with your specific needs.
If available, the airport will direct you to a special TSA Disability
Screening line.

You can also download a [[TSA Disability Notification
Card](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=a533ba&url=https://www.tsa.gov/sites/default/files/disability_notification_card_508.pdf){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="tsa.gov"}]{.qlink_container} which you can present to TSA
agents at the beginning of your screening to help get you the assistance
you need during your screening.
