**Can cyanide help treat multiple sclerosis?**

There is one medication that is thought to work by employing hydrogen
cyanide.
[[Laetrile](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=0f00ca&url=https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/cam/hp/laetrile-pdq){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="cancer.gov"}]{.qlink_container} is another name for the
active ingredient, amygdalin, which is found in the pits of some fruits
and plants. When ingested, it releases hydrogen cyanide, which is
thought to have some anti-cancer properties. Laetrile has shown to have
little effect in animal testing and has shown no effect in human
testing.

Laetrile is not approved for use in the United States, and the action of
the medication is unrelated to the disease course in Multiple Sclerosis.

So the answer to the question is no, cyanide would not help in treating
MS.
