You know the old and overused adage, **guns don't kill people, people
kill people**?

There is some truth to that.

As most other answerers have pointed out, many others have killed many
more people without guns. On 9/11, fewer than 20 people killed over 2990
people and injured more than 6000 more. Not a single gun was used.

Getting control of guns won't stop people from killing people.

Getting rid of guns won't stop people from getting them.

Instead of talking about **gun control,** let's start talking about
**people control.**
