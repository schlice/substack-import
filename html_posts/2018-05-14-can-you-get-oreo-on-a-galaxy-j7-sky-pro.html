**Can you get Oreo on a Galaxy J7 Sky Pro?**

The J7 Sky Pro has a quad core Snapdragon 425 processor and 2 GB of RAM.
That's going to be enough for it to run Android 6.0.1 (Marshmallow). At
launch, this is what it ran.

Officially, it should get one upgrade to Android 7 (Nougat). Nougat
probably runs okay on the J7, but not stellar.

I wouldn't expect to see an official upgrade to Android 8 (Oreo) on the
J7. Generally, you'll get one official code family upgrade, but two is
pushing it a little. The hardware probably isn't robust enough to run
Oreo officially. There are plenty of ways to get Oreo, but none of them
are through official carrier channels, and all of them involve rooting
your phone.
