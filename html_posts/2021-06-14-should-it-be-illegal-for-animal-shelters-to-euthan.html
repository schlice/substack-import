Not necessarily. It's not any more humane to leave an unwanted or
potentially violent pet alive simply because we have no method to
euthanize them. To live out a life devoid of love or human contact is
torture, and that is a far worse fate than euthanasia. What ***should***
be illegal is using a gas chamber to euthanize animals.

While the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) has declared
that euthanasia by injection is the most humane method of euthanasia
currently available, it has failed to condemn the use of gas chambers in
shelters. I'll spare you the details of euthanasia by gas chamber, but
just know that it causes the animal to suffer in pain and fear for
potentially minutes before it finally succumbs. No animal deserves to
die like that.

While we can't eliminate euthanasia for unwanted or potentially
dangerous pets, we can at least make euthanasia as humane as possible.
The number one way to do this is to endorse and promote euthanasia by
injection, and end the use of the gas chamber for euthanasia.

We are making progress. Since 2013, approximately 70 shelters in 13
states have voluntarily removed their gas chambers. But there are only
27 states with full bans in place, and gas chambers are known to still
be in use in at least four states.

The Humane Society of the US is driving to have bans passed in all 50
states so that no pet\'s life ever ends in a gas chamber. They have been
helping shelters voluntarily transition away from the gas chamber to the
more humane euthanasia by injection by providing grants and training and
has assisted states with passing outright chamber bans.
