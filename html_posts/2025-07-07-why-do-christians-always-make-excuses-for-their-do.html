**Do nothing?**

You sure were taking about the same God?

Is He not the same God who literally *spoke the universe and everything
in it into existence?*

Is He not the same God who, not being human, *made Himself human so He
could be the perfect example for us to follow?* He didn't need to do
this, but He did, to make a way for us to be reunited with Him.

For a "do nothing" God, He certainly has done a lot.

Oh wait, I get it now. You think God should show Himself to you, right?
Like, why doesn't He write in the clouds, "I exist, FFS"? Or why doesn't
he float down on a cloud shaped like an old man with a flowing white
beard and zap all of the evil with His laser fingers? Right? Isn't that
what you claim to want?

Let me ask you something. If that happened, would you believe in Him?
Would you literally drop your entire life and pattern your life after
His? **If God revealed Himself to you, and if He answered every question
you have,** ***would you become a Christian?***

If the answer is still no, then the problem isn't whether God appears.
The problem isn't that you don't have enough information to believe.
*The problem is that you don't* ***want*** *to believe.* The problem is
that you don't want anyone in charge of your life but you.

And that's okay. Because God, along with giving you life, gave you *free
will*. And true free will means that you have the freedom to reject Him.

This is why He doesn't make Himself more apparent than you might like.
Free will means that your choice must be free from *coercion*, and His
presence would be way too coercive.

\

Or maybe you think that God should just destroy all evil, right? And if
He doesn't, but He has the power to do so, He must not exist, right?

Let me ask you another question. If you asked for something from your
parents and they didn't give it to you right at that moment, did you
think that they didn't have the power to do it? If they made you wait,
did you think they were bad parents?

I can assure you, God will destroy evil. God will send Satan and the
demons to hell. He just hasn't done it yet. Does that mean He doesn't
exist? Of course not. It just means that He will do it on His timeframe,
not ours.

\

Okay, I'm ready. Tell me why you don't believe in God. Because you can
absolutely choose to ignore Him if you like. You can choose to not
pattern your life after His. But claiming that He doesn't exist is just
illogical.
