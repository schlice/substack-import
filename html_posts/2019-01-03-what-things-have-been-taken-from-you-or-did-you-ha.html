**What things have been taken from you or did you have to leave behind
because of airport security?**

Usually it's pocket knives that I forget to take out of my pocket.
They're usually small, 3--4â€³ foldable pocket knives, and I'll forget I
have them. They're not expensive, and it's usually not worth my time and
they're usually not worth enough to send home, so I tell them to keep
them and throw them away.
