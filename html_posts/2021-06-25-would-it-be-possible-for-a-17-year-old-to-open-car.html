Colorado prohibits open carry of handguns for anyone under 18.

That said, in most cases, there are no penalties for openly carrying a
firearm in Colorado, unless you do one of the following:

- Open carrying when you are legally prohibited from firearm possession
  (i.e. convicted felon, adjudicated mental defective)
- Open carrying in Denver or another city where open carry is banned.
- Open carrying in a location where firearms are prohibited (for
  example, federal property or a school).
- Open carrying a prohibited weapon (for example, a machine gun, short
  shotgun, or short rifle).[\[1\]](#TZPBV){#cite-TZPBV .citation_link}

Original question:

Would it be possible for a 17-year-old to open carry at work in Colorado
if it's a private property and you had permission from the
manager/franchise owner?
