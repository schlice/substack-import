This exchange in the Gospel of Mark happened when Jesus was being
questioned by some particularly disdainful Sadducees, who were trying to
trap Jesus. Just before this exchange, they asked Him if they should pay
taxes, and Jesus said the now-famous line about "rendering unto Caesar
that which is Caesar's." Anyway, here's what happened:

> "Teacher," they said, "Moses wrote for us that if a man's brother dies
> and leaves a wife but no children, the man must marry the widow and
> raise up offspring for his brother. Now there were seven brothers. The
> first one married and died without leaving any children. The second
> one married the widow, but he also died, leaving no child. It was the
> same with the third. In fact, none of the seven left any children.
> Last of all, the woman died too. At the resurrection whose wife will
> she be, since the seven were married to her?"
>
> Jesus replied, "Are you not in error because you do not know the
> Scriptures or the power of God? When the dead rise, they will neither
> marry nor be given in marriage; they will be like the angels in
> heaven. --- Mark 12:19--25 NIV

The answer is that in Heaven, we are all children of God. We are neither
married upon arrival, nor will we marry once we're there.
