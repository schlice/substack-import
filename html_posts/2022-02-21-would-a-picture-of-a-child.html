I think you wanted to ask if it was considered "child porn," not
"nudity."

From the US Department of Justice (**emphasis** mine):

> Images of child pornography are not protected under First Amendment
> rights, and are illegal contraband under federal law. Section 2256 of
> Title 18, United States Code, defines child pornography as **any
> visual depiction of sexually explicit conduct involving a minor**
> (someone under 18 years of age). Visual depictions include
> photographs, videos, digital or computer generated images
> indistinguishable from an actual minor, and images created, adapted,
> or modified, but appear to depict an identifiable, actual minor.
> Undeveloped film, undeveloped videotape, and electronically stored

The definition above says that child porn is about what is "sexually
suggestive."

A simple picture of a naked child may not be considered to be child
porn, assuming it is not sexually suggestive. This also means that a
picture of a *clothed* child *which is sexually suggestive* can also be
considered child porn. In other words, the nudity does not make the
pornography; the sexual suggestiveness of the image *does*.

TL;DR: If the picture is, as you say, not sexually suggestive, it is
unlikely that a simple photo of a naked child would be child porn.

Original question:

Would a picture of a child\'s genitals/buttocks be considered nudity if
it is not portrayed in a sexual way? (Under US law)
