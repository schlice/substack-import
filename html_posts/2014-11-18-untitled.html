<h2>Answer Comment</h2>

**Content:** [Your only other choice is to file a lawsuit against the
company requesting injunction barring them from increasing your premium
and taking your blood simply to prove you are not a smoker. You would
have to prove that the taking of the blood is a privacy violation which
the company is not authorized to make, and the burden of proof should be
on the company to prove that you are a smoker without taking your blood
(i.e. interview your co-workers to see how many \"smoke breaks\" you
take, to see if any of them have ever smelled smoke in your cube or have
seen you smoking, etc). You are innocent until proven guilty, so the
onus should be on the company to determine you are a smoker. Forcing you
to submit to a blood test seems to be a bit invasive,
IMHO.]{.rendered_qtext}
