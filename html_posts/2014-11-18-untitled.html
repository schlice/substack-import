<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: [Your only other choice is to file a lawsuit against the<br>company requesting injunction barring them from increasing your premium<br>and taking your blood simply to prove you are not a smoker. You would<br>have to prove that the taking of the blood is a privacy violation which<br>the company is not authorized to make, and the burden of proof should be<br>on the company to prove that you are a smoker without taking your blood<br>(i.e. interview your co-workers to see how many \"smoke breaks\" you<br>take, to see if any of them have ever smelled smoke in your cube or have<br>seen you smoking, etc). You are innocent until proven guilty, so the<br>onus should be on the company to determine you are a smoker. Forcing you<br>to submit to a blood test seems to be a bit invasive,<br>IMHO.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/My-employer-wants-a-blood-sample-to-determine-my-health-insurance-premium-What-should-I-do/answer/Garrick-Saito<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
