The laws vary by state, but in most states, if you kill your child's
rapist, you will be arrested and charged with murder. Your defense will
be that you were using deadly force in defense of others.

Some states have specific rules specifying the defense you can use when
the felony is so egregious that you are allowed to use deadly force to
stop it. For example, in Virginia, "stopping a serious felony in
progress" is a defense against a murder charge. It is a subset of
"defense of others." It must be a "serious felony," which in Virginia is
murder, arson, rape, robbery, and burglary, and it must be "in
progress," which means interrupting the criminal while in the course of
the act, not catching him before he does it. Note that in Virginia,
there does not need to be a victim within eyesight in order to apply;
you don't have to know that someone is asleep upstairs when you catch
the burglar pouring gasoline in the basement.

States have different rules for defining a "serious felony," but in all
cases, you would be arrested and charged, and the fact that you were
acting in defense of others would be a defense to the murder charge. In
all states, you would have to be able to clearly articulate that you
were in fear of the child's death or serious bodily harm, and you acted
accordingly.

So to answer your question, no it is not "legal" to kill someone trying
to rape your child. You can use the "defense of others" defense to
defend yourself against the murder charge that will result from your
killing the attacker. This doesn't make it "legal," it makes it
"justified."
