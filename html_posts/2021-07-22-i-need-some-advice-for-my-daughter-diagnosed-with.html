First off, you've got a lot of things going on here, and please pass
along to your daughter that we're keeping her in our prayers for healing
and some respite from the pain.

So it sounds like there are three unique things going on (at minimum, we
don't know if any others are occurring):

- gallstones
- ovarian cysts
- MS

While I can't tell you much about gallstones or ovarian cysts, I can
tell you that **MS doesn't cause gallstones or ovarian cysts**.

MS is an autoimmune disease which interferes with nerve signals in the
CNS, which produce its varied symptoms. These are symptoms like the heat
sensation she feels, or numbness or tingling in her hands and feet, or
trouble with balance, or with bladder control, or anything related to
nerve transmission along the CNS.

Gallstones and ovarian cysts are conditions which are unrelated to CNS
function.

My wife had both gallstones and ovarian cysts, and they are indeed
painful. To experience them both at the same time must be brutal.

Please let us know how her treatment progresses.
