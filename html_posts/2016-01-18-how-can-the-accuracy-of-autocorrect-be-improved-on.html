Phones have to do more than substitute words that might be similar to
your misspelled or unrecgonized word.

They need to do grammatical matching (i.e. does the word I\'m about to
substitute make grammatical sense in this sentence). Modern-day word
processors do grammatical checking all the time; there is no reason that
a suitably-powered processor on a phone (which we are rapidly
approaching) could also check grammar as well as spelling. The
convergence of those two is what produces a better spell check, and
therefore, auto-correct.
