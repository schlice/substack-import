Only the district courts and their respective Courts of Appeals have
opined that Trump's Executive Order is "likely unconstitutional." The
Supreme Court today absolutely did not state that the definition of
birthright citizenship proffered by the President in his Executive Order
is "likely unconstitutional." In fact, the Supreme Court today didn't
even address the issue.

The majority opinion, written by Justice Amy Coney Barrett, didn\'t rule
on whether President Trump\'s executive order violates the 14th
Amendment or the Nationality Act. Instead, it focused on **whether
federal courts have the power to issue nationwide injunctions.** Today's
ruling says that **they do not.**

\"Universal injunctions likely exceed the equitable authority that
Congress has given to federal courts,\" the conservative majority said.
\"The Court grants the Government\'s applications for a partial stay of
the injunctions entered below, but only to the extent that the
injunctions are broader than necessary to provide complete relief to
each plaintiff with standing to sue.\"

This means that the only relief which can be granted by the Court of
Appeals is **to the person who sued, not the entire nation**, and can
only be as broad as necessary to provide that person "complete relief."
To that end, these cases go back to their respective Courts of Appeals
to reconsider their broad rulings in light of the Supreme Court\'s
opinion and otherwise \"with principles of equity.\"

However, to the original question of birthright citizenship, the Court's
opinion said the Executive Order can\'t take effect for 30 days from
today's opinion, which allows more time for these legal challenges to be
processed.

Attorney General Pam Bondi noted that the merits of the birthright
citizenship order haven\'t been litigated yet and declined to answer
questions about how it would be implemented and enforced.
