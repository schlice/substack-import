**Does your new driver\'s license have a star on it? Is this harmless or
are they about to start rounding us up for concentration camps?**

Thanks for the chuckle. I literally just about spit my coffee out my
nose.

So instead of coming up with conspiracy theories and comparing state
governments to Nazis, when I saw the yellow star on my license, I looked
it up. You know, like a normal person.

You know what I found? It's actually a federal program. And it's really
important, especially the next time you want to get on an airplane.

It's called REAL ID. From the [[DHS
website](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=cd3897&url=https://www.dhs.gov/real-id){.external_link

If your state is compliant with REAL ID, your driver's license will
sport a little yellow star. No, not because you've been tagged for the
next round of concentration camps, but because federal agencies accept
your state's license as meeting minimum standards for security in
production and issuance.

Why is this important to you? If you don't have a little yellow star,
you may be in for a surprise next year when you try to board an
aircraft. Again, from DHS:

They do keep trying to tell everyone, but I'm certain that on September
30th, 2020, this will be a big surprise to people.
