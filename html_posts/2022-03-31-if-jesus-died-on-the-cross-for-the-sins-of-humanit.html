They already do.

It doesn't cost you anything to gain your salvation. Jesus is literally
standing there, holding a gift in front of you.

***All you have to do is take it***.

Even when someone offers you a gift, *you still have to take it*. There
is some action required on your part to accept the gift Jesus gave you.
But, to your point, it's *free*. It literally costs you nothing.

To accept the gift, you have to do two things: **repent** and
**believe**.

**Repentance** is a "turning away" from our sins. It's recognizing what
you've done, turning away from those actions, and asking Jesus to
forgive you.

Then, you need to **believe** that Jesus is your savior, who died on the
cross to take the punishment for your sins, that you deserve. He did
this *willingly*, no one made him do it.

*But shouldn't everyone just "get" the free pass? Why do they have to do
something?*

God gave us something else when he created us: free will. We have the
freedom to either accept his gift, or reject it. He will never force
you, for love can only be given freely, it cannot be coerced.

He left enough evidence in this world of his existence for anyone
willing to believe in him, but he also left enough ambiguity so as to
not compel the unwilling. Understand that this wasn't a mistake; he did
this intentionally. You must accept him freely. *You must be willing to
reach out and take the gift.* It will not be forced on you; you will not
get the gift without willingly accepting it.

\

To be fair though, there might be a cost to accepting your salvation.
Because once you're saved, your life will change. The old ways of
thinking will fade away. Desires for sinful things will fade. Your
desires will change; your thoughts will change; your actions will
change. Depending on how you lived before, the things you spent your
time on, the friends you spent your time with, and the thoughts you
spent your day thinking, may change. In short, it is possible that *your
entire life* may change. This is the impetus for the phrase: *salvation
is free, but it could cost you your life.*

But considering the eternal consequences, it is literally *the best gift
that anyone has ever given to anyone else in the history of the world,*
and it's yours.

For free.

Original question:

If Jesus died on the cross for the sins of humanity, wouldn\'t everyone
have a free pass into heaven?
