**Content:** [I get where you\'re going. Understand it\'s activism, and
regardless of what you\'re trying to accomplish, you\'re still refusing
to go to jury duty.\
\
You won\'t be excused. You will be cited (which is what you\'re going
for), and you can raise the affirmative defense of substandard
conditions in the courthouse and make the case something not about jury
duty, but more about the conditions in the courthouse.]{.rendered_qtext}
