**How much can I get for my phone at Walmart?**

If the Walmart or Sam's Club location participates in
[[CExchange](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=463cbf&url=https://walmart.cexchange.com/online/home/index.rails){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="cexchange.com"}]{.qlink_container}, you can get anywhere
from \$1 to over \$500 for a working phone, right there in the store. Of
course, the exact amount depends on the model you are trading in and its
condition. Just head to your local Walmart or Sam's Club and ask an
associate in electronics whether or not they are a participating store.

Alternatively, using the link above, you can run the same process even
if your local Walmart doesn't directly participate. You answer some
questions on the website, ship them your device, and after they evaluate
it, you will receive an instant Walmart eGift card which you can put
towards anything in store or at
[[walmart.com](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=60e068&url=http://walmart.com){.external_link
