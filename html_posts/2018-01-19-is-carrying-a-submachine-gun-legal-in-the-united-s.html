Let's look at the issues separately:

- Owning a machine gun
- Carrying a machine gun

**Owning a machine gun.** While automatic weapons are legal to own,
there are some strict rules regarding their purchase.

At the Federal level, no new automatic weapons can be registered to
civilians that have been manufactured since 1986. Only the military and
the police generally can possess new automatic weapons, which means they
are *insanely* expensive. For example, a new full-auto M-16 costs around
\$1100, while a full-auto *transferrable* M-16 costs anywhere from
\$11,000 to \$15,000. All of the automatic weapons which you can have
are already owned by someone. Therefore, in order to buy one, you need
to do a Federal automatic weapons transfer, which requires a full
background check (with fingerprinting), and a \$200 transfer fee. When
this fee is paid, you receive a "tax stamp" which must be affixed to the
Federal transfer paperwork and kept with the automatic weapon at all
times. BATFE rules require safe storage of the automatic weapon, and can
inspect your safe storage setup at any time.

In addition to the Federal transfer rules, every state is different when
it comes to ownership of automatic weapons. Generally, states follow the
Federal purchase rules, since they are already so strict, but states are
all different when it comes to whether or not you can even possess a
weapon that you may be legally allowed to purchase. Some states do not
allow their citizens to possess automatic weapons. Some states strictly
regulate private ownership, with chiefs of police or county sheriffs
being required to sign off on ownership paperwork, and each municipality
can have different ownership, transfer, and use rules. Still other
states leave the entire mess to the Feds (i.e. if you meet all of the
purchase requirements, you can own an automatic weapon).

**Carrying a machine gun** is also strictly regulated, assuming you have
legally acquired your automatic weapon. Most states do not allow open
carry of automatic weapons, especially the ones which strictly regulate
possession. Each state is different; however, so the answer about your
particular municipality is going to be specific to that area.
