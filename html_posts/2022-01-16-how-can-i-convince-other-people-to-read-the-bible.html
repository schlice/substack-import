It's really, really simple.

**Live a life which makes them question you.\
Live a life which makes them question why you always smile.\
Live a life which makes them question why you can look at all of the
evil in this world and still be hopeful for the future.**

And when they do (question you, that is), you can tell them *why* you
are so hopeful. It's because you are saved not by what you have done.
It's because you are saved not by the fact that you've been baptized.
It's because you are saved **by grace, through faith, in Christ, for his
glory alone. By, Through, In, For.** In fact, you can shorten it down to
"ByThruIn4." Don't forget that. In fact, I wear a bracelet with that
phrase on it:

:::: ui_qtext_image_outer
::: qtext_image_wrapper
![](images/qimg-3cf653a17996acac1df2062b2646ce91){.portrait .qtext_image
.zoomable_in_feed
master_src="images/qimg-3cf653a17996acac1df2062b2646ce91"
master_w="3000" master_h="4000"}
:::
::::

*(Please forgive my gross arms and my other bracelet.)*

**By** Grace\
**Through** Faith\
**In** Christ\
**For (4)** His Glory Alone.

*That's* why I'm so hopeful.

Then, after you've convinced them that there *is* something to be
hopeful *about*, then you can tell them that ***literally everything we
believe*** is in that book. No secrets. No "levels of knowledge."
Nothing gets unlocked later on. *Literally everything we believe* is in
there, nothing is hidden. Want to know ***why*** we have faith? Want to
know ***who*** we believe in? It's all in the book.

**TL;DR:** You can't convince someone to read the Bible. You have to
make them *want* to read it *themselves*, so that they can learn "the
secret" of what you already know.
