**Is it possible to use an Android phone without having a Gmail
account?**

Short answer is **yes.**

The easiest way to do this is to **Reset Your Phone**, and when you've
done that, when it asks you to sign in with your Google account, look
for the "Skip" option. You won't be able to download apps from the
Google Play Store, but you can use the Amazon Appstore if you like, and
if you're on a Samsung Android phone, you can use your Samsung account
to back up/restore your phone, as well as download apps from the Samsung
App Store. The selection of apps is not as great as the Google Play
Store, but you can get most apps that way. You can use the phone's
built-in email client to access POP or IMAP email from your favorite
email provider (obviously not Gmail). You can also use Microsoft Outlook
(formerly Hotmail) using their Outlook client, which should be available
in the Samsung App Store, among other places.

Thankfully, Android also lets you download apps from *Unknown Sources*
(i.e. the Internet) and any apps you can't get from the Google Play
Store are usually available online somewhere. Note that you open
yourself up to the possibility of downloading a hacked version of the
same app, but dem's da breaks.

If you really want to go crazy and totally remove all of the Google apps
from your phone, you can use an app called **Package Disabler Pro,**
which you can buy and download directly from [[their
website](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=447716&url=http://www.packagedisabler.com/){.external_link

disable all of the Google applications without having to root your
phone.
