**Is it illegal for a landlord to leave you without heating?**

As with all legal questions, the answer is "it depends."

However, in the vast majority of cases, heat is absolutely required.
It's covered under the *implied warranty of habitability* --- it's
implied that when you rent a home, you can actually safely live in it.
Heat, in areas of the country which get below 55 degrees at night and
stay below 68 during the day, must be provided.

They don't have to pay for your heat, but they must provide you with a
way to heat your home.

So what do you do if you don't have a heater, or your heater breaks and
your landlord won't fix it?

You can call your local code enforcement office. They can inspect and
assist with contacting your landlord.

But that's a slow process. In the meantime, you can probably buy some
space heaters and deduct the cost from your lease payments. This is a
practice known as "repair and deduct," but save all your receipts, and
do advise your landlord before you do this, so they at least have the
opportunity to fix it themselves.

If they *still* don't fix it, you may have grounds to terminate your
lease. At this point, it's high time to contact a lawyer.
