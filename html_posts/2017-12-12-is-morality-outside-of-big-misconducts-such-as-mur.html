The answer is that it depends on the source of your morality.

**Is morality (outside of big misconducts such as murder or stealing
which are obviously wrong) just subjective reasoning?**

You claim that "big misconducts" are "obviously wrong." I would ask you:
by whose standards? From where do you get the "line" that must not be
crossed? You said it's "obviously" wrong, as in any living person should
understand that line. So are you "born" with that line? How do you get
it? Murder is illegal, so do you use the law to draw that line?

To answer your question, morality is always derived from somewhere.
Usually, you get your "moral compass" from your parents. If your parents
were okay with theft, for example, you will usually be, too. Usually.
Many people derive their morals from an *ultimate moral authority*, such
as a religion. The Christian God imparts morals onto all of the humans
he has created. Your morals, therefore, are derived from an ultimate
moral authority.

The problem arises from those who do not have an ultimate moral
authority. From where do their morals originate? Most (as you have
hinted at) believe that humans "just know" what is right and wrong. But
where does this moral compass come from? If the child of a thief
believes that theft is okay, is that not moral to him? If you are a
Darwinist, then "survival of the fittest" is the law of the land, and if
that involves killing you so that I survive, this would also be moral,
would it not? Anyway, this moral "imprinting" that you are apparently
born with must come from somewhere. So where is that source? Nature? The
universe?

The truth is that for those who don't have an ultimate moral authority,
they are simply inferring a moral authority into their own lives. So
basically, you're right, for those who have no ultimate moral authority,
they make it up on their own.
