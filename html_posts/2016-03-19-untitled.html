<h2>Answer Comment</h2>

**Content:** [I\'m sorry you have such a negative view of the police,
that you feel the majority are corrupt abusers of power. I blame the
media. But is it really their fault? I mean, would a story about 300,000
police officers across the US *not* breaking any laws actually sell
newspapers or airtime? Probably not.\
\
Anyway, my thoughts when writing that part of my answer had more to do
with the fact that if you \"assert your rights\" and refuse to cooperate
with police, you make their job that much harder. You won\'t do anything
to alleviate their suspicions, and they will likely be forced to arrest
you so that they can gather the remainder of their information. You may
be innocent. But hey, good for you, you asserted your rights. You wasted
a lot of time and effort that you could have saved had you just assisted
law enforcement on the first place and cooperated. But ultimately, that
choice is yours. The amount of time you choose to waste is totally up to
you. The end result will be the same. How long it takes to get there is
up to you.]{.rendered_qtext}
