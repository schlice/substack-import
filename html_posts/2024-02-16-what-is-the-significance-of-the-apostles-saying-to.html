I have an amazing reference website for you:

If you enter almost any verse in there, it will give you information
about that verse. Entering Mark 1:37 in there reveals the following
information:

> Within the span of half a day, Simon Peter goes from humble fisherman
> to the host of the most famous person in Capernaum. After Jesus healed
> a demon-possessed man and a woman with a fever, \"the whole city\"
> comes to Simon Peter\'s door to see if Jesus can heal them, as well
> (Mark 1:32--33). The next morning, the crowd presumably returns,
> asking for Jesus and disrupting Simon Peter\'s household. His response
> is to gather a small group, probably including his brother, Andrew,
> and Jesus\' other two disciples, James and John, and search for Jesus.
> They are not the only ones curious; \"everyone\" is looking for Jesus
> at this moment.
>
> It\'s unclear what Simon Peter expects, here. He has, at least
> temporarily, left his fishing business to follow and learn from Jesus
> (Mark 1:16--18). Now a crowd grows outside his front door. In Luke
> 11:9, Jesus teaches that those who seek for God\'s blessings will find
> them. James 1:5 says \"If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask God,
> who gives generously to all without reproach, and it will be given
> him.\" Simon Peter realizes, while he does not know what to do next,
> Jesus does, so he searches for Jesus and finds Him. Jesus\' solution
> to the gathering crowd is perhaps not what Peter expected: leave
> Capernaum and spend three years preaching all over Israel, but Peter
> follows.
>
> This event is told from the perspective of Simon Peter, further making
> the case that Mark\'s Gospel is based on his eyewitness account (Mark
> 1:36).[\[1\]](#txWJu){#cite-txWJu .citation_link}

This is a fascinating exchange which marks the beginning of Jesus'
official ministry on earth. In other words, no one really knew the
gravity of that statement, "everyone is looking for you," and how true
it really was, until a few years later.
