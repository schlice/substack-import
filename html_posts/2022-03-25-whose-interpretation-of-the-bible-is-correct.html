I know who can be trusted to correctly interpret the Bible.

***The Holy Spirit***.

That's who interprets the Bible. It was the Spirit who inspired the
original writers to write the words they did, when they did it. And it
is the Spirit which indwells the believer who whispers the truth of the
words into our hearts.

If you've never taken part in an exercise with your Bible called
**SOAP**ing, I recommend you do it. **SOAP** is an acronym, and it
stands for **S**cripture, **O**bservation, **A**pplication, and
**P**rayer. You get a chapter (in my case, it was from a 40-day reading
plan) and you read the chapter. Then you pick out a verse which stands
out to you, write what you observe about that passage, then how you can
apply it to your life, and then author a quick prayer about it. I kept a
SOAP journal while I was actively SOAPing at a previous church. Here's
one of my SOAP pages on John 1:

> **S**cripture\
> There was a man sent from God whose name was John. He came as a
> witness to testify concerning that light, so that through him all
> might believe. He himself was not the light; he came only as a witness
> to the light. (John‬ 1‬:6-8‬ NIV)
>
> **O**bservation\
> I love how God sends \"the Light,\" but He also sends messengers to
> testify about the light. I can only imagine that those messengers
> appeared crazy to the people, especially when John said things like
> "Look, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world! This is
> the one I meant when I said, 'A man who comes after me has surpassed
> me because he was before me.'\" (John‬ 1‬:29-30‬ NIV). What more can He
> do to try to tell us the Good News?
>
> **A**pplication\
> God sends me messages all the time. I need to do a better job at
> receiving them.
>
> **P**rayer\
> God, please help me to \"get it.\" Because I don\'t often get it. You
> keep calling and I don\'t hear. Help me to know Your voice so I may
> better separate You from the noise.

Now, here's the thing. I'm no Bible scholar. But I didn't need to be in
order to read John 1 and find a Scripture passage which resonated with
me that I could think about, make an observation about, apply it to my
life, and then pray about it.

Therefore, ***when it comes to me and my salvation***, the Holy Spirit
helps me to hear God's voice through the reading of the Bible, when I
actively prepare myself for reading, and then read, and then reflect.

Now, ***when it comes to instructing others on the truths of the
Bible***, I don't think myself enough of a Bible scholar to do that. I
would rely on someone who has studied the Bible far more thoroughly.
Perhaps someone who has attended Seminary. Perhaps someone who has
studied under one of the great masters, like my pastoral staff who has
studied under the great [[John
MacArthur](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=d55b4f&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._MacArthur){.external_link

onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container} (you know you're a great
master when you have *authored* several translations of the Bible
itself).

**TL;DR:** Depending on the application, the amount of theological
training required may be different. But to directly answer the question,
the only one who interprets the Bible for any of us is the Holy Spirit.
