**As a renter, if the police come into my home without a warrant and
without my permission, do I have the same rights as the homeowner? Can
my landlord give them permission against my wishes?**

Tenants enjoy the same privacy rights inside their rental units as
homeowners do inside their homes. A landlord can only grant police entry
without your permission if the police have a valid search warrant or if
there is a bona fide police emergency. Otherwise, the landlord is bound
by the normal landlord-tenant rules which state that a landlord must
give written notice before he enters a rented property to perform
maintenance without the tenant being present.

If the landlord unlawfully granted entry to the police into your
apartment without a warrant and evidence was collected, the evidence
would be inadmissible and anything resulting from the evidence would be
similarly inadmissible.
