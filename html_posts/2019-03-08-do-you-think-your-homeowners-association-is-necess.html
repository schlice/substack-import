**Do you think your homeowners association is necessary?**

As a past president of a homeowner's association, I can tell you that no
HOA is absolutely necessary.

If *all* of the homeowners in a particular area would get together on a
regular basis, they could literally do everything that an HOA does, and
probably more efficiently. They could seek group discounts for services
like trash removal. They could work together to control what people do
to the exterior of their homes, knowing that while I am unconcerned with
what you do to your house, I also am aware that what you do affects your
neighbors, and their home values. Each individual homeowner could temper
their own desires for their own homes, and take into consideration what
those actions might mean for their neighbors. You can have volunteers
who can take ownership of common areas on behalf of everyone and
maintain them, sharing the costs equally.

The problem, of course, is that the above scenario *never happens.* No
matter how small your association may be, there are always some
homeowners who *steadfastly refuse to cooperate*. I wish it were not
true, but it is. There is always a percentage of homeowners who either
refuse to cooperate for refusal's sake, or who are actually
participating in illegal activity and don't want anyone else impinging
on their criminal enterprise. They will use the guise of "it's my
property and I'll do what I want on it" to forestall any corrections to
their own bad behavior.

So **while HOAs may not be absolutely necessary in a perfect world, they
are absolutely needed in this one.**

You need a governing body which can act on behalf of all of the
homeowners and pressure the ones who simply refuse to play along, either
because they don't care or they are doing their own illegal stuff and
don't want to be troubled by your "rules." You need a body that can act
on behalf of a large group of homeowners and put pressure on the local
government to enact changes.

It is only an HOA, that everyone signs on to when they purchase their
homes, and that actually has some "skin in the game" to pressure
recalcitrant homeowners, which can do this.
