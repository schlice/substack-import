If by "long" you mean throughout his entire four-year term, I say yes, I
expect that he will remain for four years. If by "long" you mean two
terms, I'm still up in the air about that one.

Since Trump has not committed an impeachable offense, I see no reason
that he will be impeached. Remember the standard for impeachment is
"high crimes and misdemeanors." That said, impeachment is indeed a
political process, not a legal one, and the definition of "high crimes
and misdemeanors" is left to Congress to decide.

However, with a Republican-controlled Congress, I think you'll be
hard-pressed to find many Republicans (except for the dyed-in-the-wool
RINOs) who would vote for impeachment, as doing so for them would be
political suicide.
