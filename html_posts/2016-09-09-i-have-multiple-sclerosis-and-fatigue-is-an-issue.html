Basically, it's up to the individual. There will be some experimentation
(i.e. trial and error) you will have to go through to find the right
balance of exercise which produces minimal fatigue.

The guideline is that if your fatigue lasts longer than **two hours**
following your workout, your workout was probably too intense. Try to
scale back next time, either a shorter time, lower frequency, or a
less-intense workout. Use the Perceived Exertion scale to monitor your
workouts. The PE scale is a 0--10 scale which helps you determine how
hard you are working before, during, and after your workout. Warm-up and
cool-down should be at a 1--2 RPE (Rate of Perceived Exertion), and your
exercise should be at a 3--5 RPE.

Try to avoid exercising during the hottest part of the day. You might
also consider something that automatically battles heat while you
exercise, like aquatics. Aquatics can give you a great cardio workout
while automatically reducing body heat, thus reducing fatigue.

Finally, there are some lower-intensity workouts that people with MS may
find extremely useful, like yoga and tai chi. These exercises can aid
balance and coordination, also extremely beneficial for the MS
patient.[\[1\]](#qwWZv){#cite-qwWZv .citation_link}
