The seawater project was a limited test run. It was deemed a success,
according to *The Times of Israel.*[\[1\]](#LUhlu){#cite-LUhlu

However, it is not without its drawbacks.

1.  Hamas claims the tunnels are designed with potential flooding in
    mind, so the possibility exists that the flooding would only have a
    temporary effect.
2.  Environmental groups have warned that the action could have an
    effect on the groundwater in Gaza, as well as the potential to harm
    the foundations of buildings.
3.  The potential exists that hostages could be in the tunnels, but the
    IDF says that they have intelligence indicating that the hostages
    are not in the tunnels.

Beyond that, we are not going to get further information about tunnel
flooding until it is already happening or completed. IDF has to maintain
*some* OPSEC.
