**Where are iPhone backups stored?**

Depends on how you chose to do them.

If you selected, "Back up to iCloud," your backups are stored in iCloud,
Apple's cloud-based storage. You can retrieve them simply by logging in
to iCloud on your device.

If you selected "Back up to my computer," your backups are stored in
iTunes on your computer. They are only accessible when you plug your
device into your computer with your USB to Lightning cable.
