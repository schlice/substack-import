Yes.

But since we're being sensitive to the trans community, let's make sure
we are similarly sensitive to the "non-trans" community (the word they
invented for it is *cisgendered*, but this word was invented to
categorize and delineate normal human behavior, in order to make it
similar to the categorization and delineation of trans behavior).

When it comes to bathrooms and private spaces, people who practice
normal human behavior, in line with biology, have valid concerns. They
are, rightly, concerned with people who possess opposite genitalia in
their private spaces (locker rooms, showers, bathrooms, etc). These
spaces were set up specifically for biological women to be separated
from *exactly that*: people with opposite genitalia.

So how can we be sensitive to the trans community in not forcing them
into a facility that doesn't align with their perceived gender identity,
while similarly being sensitive to the non-trans community in not
allowing people with opposite genitalia into their private spaces?
Provide separate spaces for everyone. It's not *ideal* for anyone, but
it is *acceptable* for everyone. It's something that the trans community
really doesn't appear to be very interested in: **compromise**.

When it comes to dating services, the trans community must understand
that if they are permitted to have their sexual preferences and it is
not bigoted to have them, then non-trans people are also permitted to
have their sexual preferences and they too are not bigoted by having
them. Non-trans people *actually want people with opposite genitalia*.
Genitalia is fairly important when non-trans people date. A penis does
not become a vagina because you said so. Therefore, when using dating
services, separating people by their genitalia preference in a partner
is both natural and expeditious: it would be a colossal waste of time to
date someone only to find out that they do not possess the genitalia
that their partner thought they did, when they have a preference for a
specific set of genitalia.

TL;DR: If we are going to be sensitive to the desires of the trans
community, we must similarly be sensitive to the needs of the non-trans
community. You cannot *dismiss* the needs of one group to satisfy the
desires of another. You must find a way to "split the baby" and give
everyone a workable solution, not necessarily everything they want.
