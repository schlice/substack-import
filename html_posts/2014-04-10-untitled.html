<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: [A few things.\<br>\<br>1. This is new territory to many officers, and I bet they are not fully<br>aware of the privacy laws in the jurisdictions in which they serve. They<br>need additional training.\<br>\<br>2. Nevertheless, if an officer tells you to do something, do it. If for<br>no other reason than respect for the office, do it. But do it as the<br>anonymous poster below already answered; tell the officer you are<br>recording, and if they tell you to turn it off, tell them you disagree<br>with their understanding of the law around recording public<br>conversations, but then out of respect for their authority, do what they<br>tell you to do. Later, do your research, consult an attorney and file a<br>complaint against the department saying that your legal right to record<br>the conversation was infringed upon by the officer. You\'ll have a<br>better chance of changing the way the officers do business using that<br>strategy than trying to bully your way through the recording, and<br>ultimately getting yourself arrested, ruining your own credibility in<br>the process.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/Depending-on-what-state-youre-in-US-is-it-true-that-youd-need-the-permission-of-a-police-officer-to-tape-your-encounter-with-them/answer/Yoni-Miller<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
