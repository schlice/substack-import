**Content:** [A few things.\
\
1. This is new territory to many officers, and I bet they are not fully
aware of the privacy laws in the jurisdictions in which they serve. They
need additional training.\
\
2. Nevertheless, if an officer tells you to do something, do it. If for
no other reason than respect for the office, do it. But do it as the
anonymous poster below already answered; tell the officer you are
recording, and if they tell you to turn it off, tell them you disagree
with their understanding of the law around recording public
conversations, but then out of respect for their authority, do what they
tell you to do. Later, do your research, consult an attorney and file a
complaint against the department saying that your legal right to record
the conversation was infringed upon by the officer. You\'ll have a
better chance of changing the way the officers do business using that
strategy than trying to bully your way through the recording, and
ultimately getting yourself arrested, ruining your own credibility in
the process.]{.rendered_qtext}
