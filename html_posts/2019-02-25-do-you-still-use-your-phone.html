**Do you still use your phone\'s mobile data even when you are in a
public place with Wi-Fi and you have an unlimited data plan?**

Yes. Absolutely. 100%.

Why, you ask?

**Wi-Fi, unless you're using a VPN along with it, is too insecure.**

If you have no idea what I just said, then you should not be using a
public Wi-Fi hotspot.

To translate my bolded sentence: if you want to use public Wi-Fi
hotspots, please, please, invest in VPN software. If you trust CNET for
your technology news (they're relatively fair), then please check out
this article:

I actually endorse NordVPN myself (and coincidentally, it's number one
on the list). A YouTuber I watch, Company Man, has a 75% off of a 3 year
subscription if you use his affiliate link. If you're interested: [[Grab
The Exclusive NordVPN 3-Year Deal! (75%

It's actually very cheap, there are discount codes all over the Internet
(YouTubers advertise discount codes all the time, and you'll get several
years' worth of service at a substantial discount), and it will
literally save you from becoming the next victim.
