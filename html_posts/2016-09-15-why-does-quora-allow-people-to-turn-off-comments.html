You, questioner, are under the mistaken belief that Quora is a *debate
site*.

It is not.

Quora is a **question and answer** site.

Someone asks a question, people provide answers. If I answer you, my
answer is my own. So too are any comments to my answer. I am under no
obligation to debate with you. If you feel your viewpoint is correct and
you absolutely want to refute my answer, you are more than welcome to
write your own answer from your own viewpoint.

If you want a site where people engage in debate, feel free to make
**[[MyLincolnDouglasDebateSite.com](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=70059c&url=http://MyLincolnDouglasDebateSite.com){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="mylincolndouglasdebatesite.com"}]{.qlink_container}**
(assuming it's not already taken because that would be downright *cool*)
and allow people to engage in Lincoln-Douglas style debates from all
over the internet. Then let your users judge the debate in exactly the
same way as in the NFL. Yes, I was in the NFL. Okay, it's the National
Forensic League. Which they have had to change, because there's some
other organization in America that also uses NFL. Whatever. Now they're
called the NSDA (National Speech and Debate Association).

*But in any case, that's not Quora.*

I block much more frequently, and with much less regret, now that I've
been on the site for some time. I don't have a problem with it. The
problem is not mine. There are some people who just *insist* on arguing
with me. Like I'm going to have some great revelation or something.
Yeah, I don't think so. Again, as I mentioned, if you really believe so
wholeheartedly in your point of view, write your own answer. Quora would
prefer it, since answers generate site traffic. Comments, not so much.

People tend to argue for removing the ability to disable comments
because of the altruistic. If every user on Quora shared the same noble
goals, fine. But not all users have the greater good in mind. Some do,
and I have altered my answers, or even gone back and revisited things I
thought I knew. I once deleted an answer completely because my belief
(from college onward) was actually wrong. Oh well, nobody's perfect.
However, if our answers truly belong to us, then we should be able to
selectively maintain our answers and all comments on our answers.

(EDIT) People still are not understanding the correct way to handle
answers which are wrong. They still think the best way to handle wrong
answers are to shout them down in the comments to that answer, as if
you'll change the mind of the answerer.

**This approach literally helps no one.**

So let me, once again, share how we deal with wrong answers.

Let's say someone writes an answer to a question that sounds legit, but
is totally wrong. They've disabled comments. What do you do?

Here's what you do:

- Downvote the answer. The more downvotes an answer gets, the further
  down in the list of answers it will move, and will eventually be
  collapsed from view due to downvotes.
- Report the answer as "Factually Incorrect." State your reasons why it
  is Factually Incorrect in the Comments section of the Report, and let
  Quora handle it. Don't worry, when you Report an answer, Quora
  automatically downvotes the answer.
- Alternatively, you can write your own answer that is Factually
  Correctâ„¢. Since your answer is right, it should get more upvotes,
  correct? Remember, don't call out the answerer in your answer, but
  feel free to call out the answer by saying, "Other answers are telling
  you to do X, but that is totally wrong, and I'm an expert so here's
  why that's wrong." And off you go, you're on your way to 1K upvotes!

We don't discredit wrong answers by forcefully removing them or starting
arguments with the answerer (which gets you nowhere but a BNBR strike).
We discredit wrong answers by writing ***better*** answers.

(*Incidentally, this is exactly how we should handle hate speech, and
other speech we don't like. We don't argue with them, or shout them
down, or get them cancelled. We stand up to* ***bad*** *speech with*
***more*** *speech, not* ***less.***)

Think about this: when someone Googles the question, which answer comes
up? The one with the most upvotes. Clearly, the *correct* answer should
get all the upvotes, and the wrong answer should get all the downvotes.
Rely on the community to help you; make sure that the correct answer is
written, and you explain (politely, not personally attacking) why the
other answer is factually incorrect. **This is why it's so crucial that
the correct answer is its own answer and not a comment to someone else's
answer.**

And this helps Quora as a whole: answers get site clicks, whereas
comments do not. Quora has no interest in forcing comments to stay on
since they don't generate site traffic. It is only answers which
generate site traffic.
