It was time to no longer keep my disease a secret because I had come to
terms with my disease personally.

We don\'t know what causes it. We can\'t really control it. We can\'t
cure it. Why on earth would I cause myself additional anxiety by trying
to ***hide*** it?

I remember the first time I was presented with the opportunity to tell
someone outside my family. I was running a baseball practice not long
after my diagnosis. My optic neuritis was still in full flare, so the
sun was bad enough. There was no way I could focus on a fast-moving
baseball. I couldn\'t help pitch because I couldn\'t see well enough to
catch the ball. I remember telling one of the other dads to pitch (he
was a jerk). He rudely said, \"Why can\'t you do it?\" And I remember
stopping, and kinda being frozen in time. I was about to tell someone
besides my family that I had a degenerative disease that caused me to
leave the military and change my entire life, for the first time.

So I chickened out.

I said, \"I have an eye problem, I can\'t see well enough to catch the
ball.\"

He just said, \"Oh.\"

I hadn\'t yet come to terms with my own disease.

Ultimately, the first person outside of my family and friends that I
told was my boss. He\'s a great guy and we\'ve been working together for
many years, so I felt comfortable enough going to him and telling him
that I was diagnosed with MS. I was likely going to miss a few days due
to appointments throughout the year, so telling the boss was important
to get him on board. Thankfully, he and the company have been great to
me all these years. If I needed time due to doctor\'s appointments, as
long as I let them know in advance, they were okay with that. While they
didn\'t quite understand it fully, they did learn over time. I
appreciated their acceptance and understanding, so much so that I went
on to serve (and still do to this day) on the board for the company\'s
newly-formed Affinity Circle for disabled employees. Our Disability
Employee Resource Group has won numerous industry awards in the D&I
(Diversity and Inclusion) space, and I couldn\'t be prouder of the
spirit of inclusion we have fostered at my company. I\'m glad that
opening up about my disease could be a part of that.

Because my neurologist is also a professor at the University of Colorado
in Denver, I get the benefit of his considerable knowledge. It\'s for
that reason he\'s also the co-director of the Rocky Mountain MS Center.
It\'s also that knowledge about the disease, the medications, the
symptoms, and all of the related \"stuff\" that goes along with it that
he and others have imparted to me. I started helping others, both online
and in the real world, to come to grips with, and understand, their
disease. This is why I now function as a Patient Advocate, trying to
help the newly-diagnosed understand the disease and what it means for
their lives. MS is not a death sentence, but it is a life sentence.
Coming to grips with that fact is important in the transition towards a
healthy and full life managing the disease. If I hadn\'t decided to come
forward about my disease, I\'d be in no position to help anyone else.

Hope this helps!
