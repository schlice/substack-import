In the United States, there is no duty to assist unless you are engaged
in the particular profession of providing assistance (i.e. a doctor, a
police officer, etc). Only then, in some states, there may be a duty to
assist. Otherwise, Good Samaritan laws merely serve to protect the
person who *does* choose to assist from lawsuits alleging that the Good
Samaritan actually *harmed* the victim, or made the situation worse.

Can you believe that? You stop to help someone, and they sue you. That's
gratitude for you.

But there are no states which *require* the average citizen to render
aid.
