I can't speak for California directly, but I can speak for HOAs
generally.

As most normal HOA laws go, an association can require you to do nearly
anything they choose, so long as it's reasonable and it is applied
fairly to all residents.

So can they require you to recycle? Sure they can. What does that mean
for the Association? It means they have to search your trash for
recyclables and fine you when you fail to do so.

They would likely be doing this if they got a discount from the trash
company by limiting the recyclables in residents' trash, and the trash
company would be deducting from that discount if they found recyclables
in there. In turn, the HOA would fine the resident throwing away
recyclables (assuming they could identify the perpetrator).

Remember, your covenants are essentially a "contract" you signed with
the HOA at the time you bought your house or condo in the association.
The covenants requires you to comply with the Rules and Regulations as
written and/or amended following the standard business practices listed
in the Policies and Procedures. If the Rules are amended properly, the
association can hold you to them, so long as they do it fairly.

We try to be reasonable and we try to take the opinions of the majority
of homeowners into consideration when we make Rule changes, but we do
sometimes make decisions as a Board.
