**How is it legal for Trump to have his name put on the Federal
Government Coronavirus stimulus check? Surely this is illegal
campaigning?**

How is it illegal? What law does it violate? It may be Trump tooting his
own horn, but it's definitely not illegal. And campaigning is not
illegal, so there is no such thing as "illegal campaigning." You may be
thinking of campaign finance laws which control how much money can be
spent on political campaigns, from where, and when, but this move is not
covered by campaign finance laws.

Trump has every right to re-design the text on the check. The Economic
Impact Payment check will be coming from the US Department of the
Treasury. The Treasury is an Executive branch, and Trump is the head of
the Executive branch. It's not his signature on the checks, just his
name, right under where it says "Economic Impact Payment".

That said, I, like many others, am reasonably sure that the move is
meant to signal to the low-information voter that the checks are coming
courtesy of the president. It's an old political trick that both parties
have used for many years --- pandering to the low-information voter and
taking the quick victory when it doesn't cost anything.

Let's be honest, most people are going to get their Economic Impact
Payments via direct deposit, but some people will still get theirs by
check, particularly if you had to pay taxes last year instead of getting
a refund, or if you don't pay taxes at all. See how the math works out?
Checks are going to the poor and to those who paid taxes instead of
getting refunds --- the hardest hit segments of society. If he puts his
name on the check, it signals to the people getting the check that he
had a hand in getting them that check. It's a pretty powerful signal.
And it doesn't cost voters anything.

It also didn't delay the checks; that's Fake Newsâ„¢. It's buried in the
story, but it's definitely there. Unsurprisingly, it was the Washington
Post which erroneously reported the information without fact-checking
(wow, they would do that?), saying that the addition of the text on the
checks would delay their mailing by days. This is untrue. Even NBC is
reporting that it is untrue:

Trump took an opportunity when it didn't cost anyone anything, and I'm
okay with that. He has the right to do that.

I don't agree with him on everything; I'm not keen on the fact that he
defunded the WHO *right now*. I fully agree with him that the WHO needs
to not receive our money, but *today*? Maybe in a month when we turn the
corner on this virus. But *today*? I don't like it. The optics don't
seem to work in his favor on this one, so I'm surprised he made that
move. We'll have to see how it shakes out. He may be more willing to
take risky political moves because the centerpiece of his re-election
bid was a strong economy --- before the coronavirus hit. Now, he'll be
lucky to get positive movement in the economy before November, and maybe
he's more willing to take calculated political risks in this climate.
