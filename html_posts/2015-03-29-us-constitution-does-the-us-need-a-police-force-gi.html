You are presuming that the police are there to protect you, and this is
a common misconception that causes much confusion.

There is a phrase we often quote when people assume that the police are
there to protect them: \"When seconds count, the police are only minutes
away.\"

There simply aren\'t enough police officers to be able to effectively
***defend you*** against crime. It\'s not their charter, and they are
not required to defend you from crime. For example, if you fall victim
to a crime, can you sue the police for failing to defend you? People
have tried, and the Supreme Court, on numerous occasions, has determined
that the police do not have a specific duty to defend you from crime.
They have a general duty to keep the public at large safe, but they have
no special duty to defend any one person (with some limited exceptions).

The police perform a function that is separate from your right to
self-defense, since the police are not charged with protecting you or
keeping you safe. They certainly can, and will, if they are there, but
that\'s not their actual job. The police apprehend and prosecute
perpetrators of crime. This is a consequent function; this occurs after
the crime has taken place. Your right to self-defense occurs during the
commission of the crime. They are two totally separate functions.

The police have (supposedly) been vetted and are given special training
and privilege (thus wearing a \"badge of office\" or just \"a badge\")
allowing them to act as agents of the state to apprehend people and
charge them with violating the law. It is the exclusive function of the
Executive branch of government as afforded in the Constitution. This
authority has been given to the Executive branch by the people. The
people appoint the police to act as agents of the state to apprehend
criminals. While police departments use pithy catch-phrases like \"to
protect and serve,\" that\'s not their actual job function.

So yes, if we re-write the Constitution, we can remove the police as the
law enforcement branch of the government and appoint all citizens to
police themselves.

But I bet that wouldn\'t go too well. What if someone chose **not** to
police himself/herself? What if someone chose to **not** follow the law,
but instead to use their gun to **break** the law? It happens all the
time; whether or not all people are charged with the duty to enforce the
laws to which they are bound. How would you feel if every one of your
neighbors was constantly watching you, making sure you didn\'t break the
law? Doesn\'t sound like a very fun place to live. This is why people
are wary of cops. Cops are watching you to make sure you are following
the law, and if you\'re not, you can be **very** inconvenienced by them.
And since ignorance of the law is no excuse, if you were violating a law
that you didn\'t know was a law, you\'re still just as screwed as if you
were knowingly violating the law. So it\'s understandable that people
would be wary of the police. So the police willingly wear that stigma
(everyone is wary and suspicious of them) to keep their communities as
safe as they can and do get the bad guys.

How safe you are and whether or not police exist are two totally
different things. Your safety is your responsibility; the police cannot
keep you safe. Even from the very beginnings of government, we recognize
that people have a \"natural right\" to self defense. The framers
codified this in the Bill of Rights by stating that your right to keep
and bear arms shall not be infringed. Whether or not you choose to keep
and bear arms is your business, but that doesn\'t change the fact that
your defense is up to you. Defending those who cannot defend themselves
(i.e. children) is also part of your obligation when living in a civil
society.

Creating \"gun-free zones\" (i.e. in schools) simply creates \"unarmed
victim zones\" where criminals (who generally fail to follow the law
anyway) can run rampant and kill as many people as they choose without
fear of immediate, high-velocity reprisals.
