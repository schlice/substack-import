correct answer, even if the pathogen in question is bacterial, the
antibiotic you are taking for the unrelated illness may not be effective
against the pathogen to which you are exposed. Antibiotics have classes
of pathogens against which they are most effective. The converse is also
true; there are some pathogens against which the antibiotics in question
are less effective, if not ineffective altogether.\
\
And if that\'s the case, you also know that antibiotics kill ***all***
bacteria, not just the bad ones. Killing all the bacteria in your gut
does a number on your immune system, which is already busy trying to
fight a bacterial infection, so you may actually be *more* susceptible
to the particular pathogen to which you were exposed.]{.rendered_qtext}
