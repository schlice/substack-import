**Can impeachment proceed if a sudden national emergency happens?**

Yes, there is no clause in the Constitution which requires impeachment
proceedings to stop during national emergencies.

Besides the fact that such a clause could be abused by an unscrupulous
president who chose to declare a national emergency which miraculously
didn't end throughout his term, Congress probably isn't greatly impacted
by national emergencies, and so there is, for all practical purposes, no
need to stop proceedings during a national emergency.
