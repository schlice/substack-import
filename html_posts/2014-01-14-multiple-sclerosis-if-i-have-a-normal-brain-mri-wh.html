**Content:** [Anywhere from 50-75% of MS patients will get lesions on
their spinal cord at one time during the cours of their disease. In
about 20% of already-diagnosed MS patients, lesions occur on the spinal
cord only, and not on the brain. This is what is commonly referred to as
\"spinal MS.\" It simply means that lesions occur, either alone or along
with others, on the spinal cord.\
\
The lesions on the spinal cord are more likely than any others to cause
some sort of acute physical symptom, according to [[a
report](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=6a355c&url=http://www.urmc.rochester.edu/smd/Rad/neurocases/Neurocase108.htm){.external_link

Rochester Medical Center. Spinal cord lesions [[may be more difficult to
see](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=720fcd&url=http://www.healthcentral.com/multiple-sclerosis/c/6639/25072/cord-ms){.external_link

brain lesions, so unless there are physical indications of spinal
involvement through neurological exam, spinal cord lesions are easy to
miss.]{.rendered_qtext}
