Always remember the core principle of the pro-life movement:

*The pro-life group prioritizes the protection of human life at all
phases of its development.*

With that in mind, the number one difference between abortion and
capital punishment:

**Due process.**

The criminal who has committed such heinous crimes that he would be
eligible for the death penalty has been judged by a jury of his peers
and sentenced to death. He has *intentionally* forfeited his own life.

*Has the infant in the womb been afforded the same due process?*

Who is the advocate who represents that infant? Has that infant been
afforded a rigorous defense? Who is the judge who signs off on the
verdict sheet for the infant?

Pro-lifers prioritize the protection of human life, but when the
individual does not, no one can help him.

What is the right to life\'s stance on capital punishment?
