**Content:** [Um, because it\'s not.\
\
We tried to ban things before in the United States. Surprisingly, people
still got those things. For example, drugs are illegal in the United
States. No one can possess them. Yet somehow, millions are addicted to
drugs and we incarcerate over a million people a year for drugs and
drug-related offenses.\
\
**Those drugs were 100% illegal. And people still managed to get
them.**\
\
We also tried to ban alcohol in the United States in a period of time we
call \"Prohibition.\" Yet people still had alcohol. Illegal bars called
\"speakeasies\" opened up underground. Moonshiners distilled and
trafficked their own grain alcohol (incidentally, the cars they souped
up to outrun law enforcement would sometimes participate in races,
leading to the creation of NASCAR).\
\
**Alcohol was 100% illegal. And people still managed to get it.**\
\
So what\'s the point here?\
\
***Making something illegal will not stop people from getting it.***\
\
If you make guns illegal, you will simultaneously increase the black
market for it and enable all crime, both organized and individual. It
happened every time we tried to ban something. The black market for it
skyrocketed, and all types of crime was increased.\
\
Also, the gun is a tool. It is the most efficient tool to use with which
to kill individuals. Does that mean the gun should be banned? If there
is never an authorized, valid reason to kill, then yes, guns should not
be allowed, because no one has a valid reason to kill. However, the
entire history of the United States, going back to the Common Law
traditions on which our system of government was founded, includes
\"universal\" rights which are endowed on all people. One of those
rights is the right to self-defense, and another is defense against
tyranny. I\'d not like to debate whether or not either of these rights
exists or whether or not you believe they are valid. The simple fact is
that our Constitution was built with them in mind, It\'s why we have a
Second Amendment. To wit:\
\
***The only way to remove guns from the United States is to repeal the
Second Amendment.***\
\
There is no popular support for such a measure. Playing on emotion and
trying to use tragic shootings as an impetus for Second Amendment repeal
might work in Australia, but there is simply no support for such a
measure here in the United States.\
\
Finally, statistics show that there is no practical benefit to such
laws, as reviewing statistics from Australia and the UK, two locations
often bandied about in the hunt for ways to impose gun control, reveals
that their respective gun bans did not affect the trends in those
nations of either homicides, or suicides, with or without guns. Zero
effect. The overall trend in homicides was unaffected by the gun ban,
and the overall trend in suicides was similarly unaffected by the gun
ban.]{.rendered_qtext}
