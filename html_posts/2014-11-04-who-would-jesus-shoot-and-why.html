**Content:** [The most violent that Jesus is ever recorded to have been
was when he threw the moneychangers out of the temple:\

\
Even this display of anger on Jesus\' part did not rise to the level of
anger needed to fire a weapon. An analogy would be Jesus using a sword
or spear, which he never did.\
\
So who would Jesus have shot in biblical times? No one.\
\
I think the analogy is to today\'s times, implying that Jesus would
never shoot anyone. I think that\'s a pretty poor analogy, as times are
different. Jesus would shoot whoever needed to be shot, with an utter
sadness in His heart for having to do it.
