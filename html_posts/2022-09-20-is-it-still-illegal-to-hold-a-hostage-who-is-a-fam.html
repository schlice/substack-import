Let me re-write your question:

> *(Explanation: who is a family member of a criminal and force the

> hostage)*

You can explain *why* you are taking a hostage until the day you stand
before your maker, but those are all *excuses*. Nothing makes taking a
hostage legal. I checked the statute, and there is nothing in there
which says "It is a crime to take a hostage **except when it's a family
member of a criminal....**"

Taking a hostage is *multiple* crimes, regardless of why you do it. **AT
BEST**, you can use your excuse to try to limit your punishment after
you are convicted for, at a minimum, false arrest and extortion.
Hopefully the court will have mercy on you because of your explanation.
But none of that makes it legal.

Sometimes, the hypothetical questions on this site go off the rails.

And for everyone reading, if you ever encounter a situation where a
criminal is holding your family hostage, call the police.
