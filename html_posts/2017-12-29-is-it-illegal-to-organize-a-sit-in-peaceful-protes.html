You have a 1st Amendment right to peaceably assemble. That said, and as
with all Constitutional rights, that right is not unlimited, and there
are some ways you can run into legal trouble.

Think about where you are going to perform your sit-in. If you are
inside a private facility (even one which is open to the public), you
are at the mercy of the administrators and owners of that facility. They
can revoke your "right" to be inside that facility at any time, and as
soon as they do, you are immediately trespassing and are subject to
arrest. Similarly, you do not have an unlimited right to "loiter" (i.e.
be present without any business) within a government building, and you
can be similarly arrested and removed.

Your best bet? **Get permission before your sit-in.** Work with the
management of the facility and help them understand the social benefits
of your demonstration. In most cases, they should be accommodating, but
you must be accommodating as well. If they tell you that you cannot
block hallways and fire escapes, then don't do it, and expect to be
removed if you do. Also, if you are school-age students, the
administration may tolerate a time-limited protest, but not an all=day
or all-week affair, and at some point your protest will be deemed a
disruption to the academic environment and you'll be ordered back to
class. In general, the more accommodating you are, the more
accommodating they will be, and you'll be permitted to hold your
protest.

If you're going to be outside, you don't need a permit to have a protest
in public parks or sidewalks, but you might want to get one anyway so
that you can ensure that not only you have permission, but that
counter-protests cannot occupy the same space as you.

Despite what you may have seen in social media making you think that
blocking streets is legal, it is most definitely not. You cannot march
in the street without a permit. It is not Constitutionally-protected
free speech when you impede traffic flow.

Good luck!
