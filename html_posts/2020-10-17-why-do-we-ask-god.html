**Why do we ask God \"why\"?**

Because we don't fully understand.

If you've ever been a parent, or if you've ever been a child who had a
parent, you've probably experienced that phase in life where that child
asks "why" to everything you say. It might be cute. Initially. It might
get annoying. Eventually. But it is borne out of the same need to
understand.

We want to know.

And in the case of God, in most cases, we simply can't. Our brains are
just incapable of comprehending the majesty of God.

And on top of that, our God is a secretive God.

- \"It is the glory of God to conceal a matter\...\" (Proverbs 25:2)
- \"Truly you are a God who hides Himself.\" (Isaiah 45:15)
- \"No one knows the thought of God except the Spirit of God.\" (1 Cor
  2:11)
- \"The secret things belong to the Lord our God\" (Deuteronomy 29:29)
- \"As you do not know the path of the wind, or how the body is formed
  in the mother\'s womb, so you cannot understand the work of God, the
  Maker of all things.\" (Ecclesiastes 11:5)
- \"\'For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways My
  ways,\' declares the Lord. \'As the heavens are higher than the earth,
  so are My ways higher than your ways and My thoughts than your
  thoughts.\" (Isaiah 55:8-9)

Clearly, Scripture tells us that we don\'t have the capacity to
understand God\'s mind or how He intervenes in our lives. Romans 11:33
says that God\'s judgments are \"unsearchable\" and His ways are \"past
finding out.\" 1 Cor 2:16 says, \"Who has known the mind of the Lord
that he may instruct Him?\" Unless God chooses to reveal His plan to us
(which rarely happens), his motivations and purposes will probably
remain out of reach.

This means that for all practical purposes, we will likely never know
\"why\" until we see Him face-to-face. 1 Cor 13:12 says, \"Now we see
but a poor reflection; then we shall see face to face. Now I know in
part; then I shall know fully, even as I am fully known.\"

God has a wonderful plan for you. Fine print: you won\'t always be able
to comprehend this plan, and even if you do, you may not approve of it.
It may mean living with an incurable disease. Or living in a wheelchair.
Or dying.

But tough times are nothing new. All the biblical writers, even the
giants of the faith, went through tough times. Look at Joseph. Hated by
his brothers, sold into slavery, imprisoned, falsely accused of
attempted rape, threatened with execution. There was no indication that
God had explained to Joseph all of the reasons why he had to go through
all of that, or what would eventually be done with his life. He was
expected, as you and I are, to live out his life one day at a time in
something less than complete understanding. **What pleased God was
Joseph\'s faithfulness** ***when nothing made sense.***

We know that life won\'t be smooth sailing. Where did we ever get the
idea that it would be? Christians (and non-Christians alike) have this
belief that God will skip along in front of us with his giant cosmic
broom, sweeping away all of our troubles and concerns, and when that
doesn't happen, we are sad and disillusioned. Where did anyone ever
learn that it would be like that? Certainly not from the Bible. Jesus
told His followers to anticipate suffering. \"I have told you these
things, so that in me you may have peace. In this world, you will have
trouble. But take heart! I have overcome the world.\" (John 16:33). Paul
wrote, \"In all our troubles my joy knows no bounds. For when we came
into Macedonia, this body of ours had no rest, but we were harassed at
every turn\--conflicts on the outside, fears within\" (2 Cor 7:4-5).
Peter said, \"Dear friends, do not be surprised at the painful trial you
are suffering, as though something strange were happening to you. But
rejoice that you participate in the suffering of Christ, so that you may
be overjoyed when His glory is revealed\" (1 Peter 4:12-13).

Does this mean we\'re always going to suffer? Paul said we are \"more
than conquerors.\" He wrote in Philippians 4:4-7, \"Rejoice in the Lord
always. I will say it again: Rejoice! Let your gentleness be evident to
all. The Lord is near. Do not be anxious about anything,but in every
situation, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your
requests to God. And the peace of God, which transcends all
understanding,will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.\"

There appears to exist this great paradox where we are told to expect
suffering and hardship, but we are encouraged to be joyful, thankful,
and \"of good cheer.\" How can we be joyful in the face of hardship? How
can we be secure when we are surrounded by insecurity? How can we be
happy when we don't know why?

**Trust God.**

Scripture tells us to \"\[t\]rust in the Lord; lean not on your own
understanding.\" (Prov 3:5) Dr. James Dobson says that \"leaning\" is
that demand for answers \-- \"throwing faith to the wind if a
satisfactory response cannot be produced. It is pressing God to explain
Himself \-- or else! That is where everything starts to unravel.

\"If we can comprehend even a tiny portion of the Lord\'s majesty and
the depth of His love for us, we can deal with those times when He
defies human logic and sensibilities. Indeed, that is what we must do.
Expect confusing experiences to occur along the way, and don\'t be
dismayed when they arrive. Welcome them as friends\--as opportunities
for your faith to grow. Hold fast to your faith, without which it is
impossible to please Him. \'Lean into the pain\' when your time to
suffer comes around. Never yield to feelings of self-pity of
victimization, which are Satan\'s most effective tools against us.
Instead, store away your questions for a lengthy conversation in
eternity, and then press toward the mark.\" ‡
