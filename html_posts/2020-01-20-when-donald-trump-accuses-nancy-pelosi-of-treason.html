**When Donald Trump accuses Nancy Pelosi of treason, does he have
proof?**

This is what is called "political speech." And it is especially
protected by the 1st Amendment.

In other words, politicians say all sorts of things, but they have no
teeth.

If you have credible evidence that someone has actually committed
treason, you go to the authorities (or in Trump's case, you engage the
authorities who work for you), you don't go on television and accuse
someone of treason.

As you may or may not know, treason is a very specific crime. The
elements of treason are the same under state and federal law:

- the defendant owes allegiance to the government, and
- the defendant intentionally betrays that allegiance by either levying
  war against the government, or giving aid or comfort to the
  government's enemies.

So there are two elements that can constitute treason: levying war, or
giving aid and comfort to the government's enemies.

Now, it's unlikely that Pelosi is "providing aid or comfort to the
enemy," because ***we don't currently have an enemy***. The definition
of "enemy" can only be fulfilled during actual, formal declared war.

So is Pelosi "levying war" against the US government? Hardly. By
espousing a political position that is contrary to the President does
not constitute "levying war" against the government. It generally
requires some "forcible opposition to the execution of public law" and
mere political rhetoric doesn't rise to the level of "levying war."

**TL;DR:** everyone is engaging in political rhetoric. No one is
claiming that chargeable offenses have been committed.
