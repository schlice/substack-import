Keep in mind the bounds of this question. You have to be able to stop
the police officer **without being killed** or **without being arrested
yourself.**

*The answer is:* ***there is no situation in the law which allows you to
interfere with a police officer who is carrying out his duty.***

None.

And whether or not he is actually carrying out his duty is a matter of
law to be determined by a judge and a matter of fact to be determined by
a jury, well after the incident is concluded. You are not qualified, nor
permitted by law, to make that determination on your own, at the scene.

As heartbreaking as it may seem to you, *you must let the officer
proceed.*

Remember that the OP asked how you can save her **without being killed
or arrested.** The answer is that ***you cannot stop the officer from
doing what he is doing without, at a minimum, being arrested, or at
worst, being killed yourself.*** *What's more, you must understand that
if the officer kills her, there was nothing you could have done without
being arrested or killed yourself.*

If you intervene, you will be arrested and charged with assault on a
police officer, interfering with the duties of a police officer, aiding
and abetting, and a myriad of other charges.

**I CANNOT STRESS THIS ENOUGH. ANY INTERVENTION YOU TAKE FOR WHATEVER
REASON YOU CHOOSE TO TAKE IT WILL DEFINITELY GET YOU ARRESTED AND MAY
GET YOU KILLED.**

**Your sense of chivalry (if that concept still exists any more) may
make you willing to take that risk of arrest, but that's not what this
question asked.**

Your best bet is to get out your cell phone and record as much as you
can. The problem is that you won't have video of what happened *before*
you started recording, and if there is no video of that, we're down to
testimony, in which case it will be his word over yours.

You also have to understand that there are police arrest control holds
which "look like" choking, but are not. Look up the Carotid Control Hold
if you're interested. It looks, to an outsider, like the officer is
"choking out" the suspect, but in fact there is little to no pressure on
the windpipe at all.

There are two types of neck restraints: vascular and respiratory.
Respiratory neck restraints use direct pressure to constrict the
anterior (front) portion of the neck, which causes asphyxiation. The
police *never* intentionally, deliberately use this as it can cause
significant injury and death (note that we're not excluding accidents,
where an officer attempts a neck restraint and does it wrong). The
second type of hold is a vascular hold. This applies no pressure to the
anterior portion of the neck (the crook of the elbow is in front), while
the pressure is applied bilaterally (on the *sides*) to the neck. This
restricts blood flow to the brain, causing the suspect to briefly lose
consciousness. If you're a WWE fan, it's what the "sleeper hold" is
supposed to mimic. The Carotid Control Hold is very useful on a large
and uncooperative suspect. It gives the officer enough time to calm the
suspect down and safely apply handcuffs. If it is done correctly, it
minimizes injury to the suspect and to the officer.

If a strong police officer is using excessive force and choking out your
100 pound girlfriend, how can you save her without being killed or
arrested?
