**Can the GOP officially exclude Trump from the party and deny him the
party affiliation for future purposes, so that he would have to run as
an independent or for another party in the future?**

They can\'t declare that Trump is not allowed to run again as a
Republican.

They *can* refuse to nominate him as the party\'s nominee for president.

Anyone can run, and seek the party\'s nomination. The party can choose
who they are going to nominate. There is no mandatory process which any
one party must follow in order to nominate a candidate. The parties are
private entities, they are not governmental agencies. They can decide,
on their own, what their process is by which they will select a
candidate.

Usually, the parties do this using primary elections. But not all states
hold primary elections.

Regardless, anyone who meets the qualifications can seek the party\'s
nomination. The party can simply choose to nominate somebody else.

So long as there is someone else with a pulse who is running in the
Republican primary, I suspect that the party will nominate someone else.

And to be fair, there are a few Republicans who have presented
themselves as pretty decent candidates to replace Trump. And as I\'ve
said before numerous times, if Nikki Haley runs, I would vote for that
woman in a heartbeat. There are a few other Republicans who have
positioned themselves as potential candidates for 2024.

So I\'m not worried at all about the fact that Trump may want to run
again in 2024. Let him run. There\'s no way he\'ll get the nomination.

And if the GOP actually does nominate him? They get exactly what they
deserve. Maybe what that results in is conservatives leaving the party
and creating a new Conservative Party. But as many people have already
noted, splitting the GOP will essentially result in no Republican or
conservative ever winning any major office ever again.
