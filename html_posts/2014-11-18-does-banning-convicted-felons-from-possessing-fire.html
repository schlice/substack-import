**Content:** [I think in the event of armed uprising, convicted felons
will \"conveniently forget\" that they are convicted felons, and will go
visit Big Joe in the alley and buy a MAC-10 for \$100 (no background
check, no worries) out of his trunk and participate in the uprising.\
\
So ultimately I don\'t think that\'s going to be the \"long pole in the
tent\" that prevents an armed overthrow of the government. I think we\'d
have much bigger problems than the fact that the law doesn\'t allow Joe
Felon to buy a gun from the gun store.]{.rendered_qtext}
