We already do. States cover prenatal costs for women who qualify, until
Medicaid kicks in. Here in Florida, [[Presumptive Eligibility for
Pregnant Women
(PEPW)](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=5a274a&url=https://www.myflfamilies.com/admin/publications/cfops/CFOP%2520165-xx%2520Economic%2520Self-Sufficiency%2520Services/CFOP%2520165-09,%2520Presumptive%2520Medicaid%2520Eligibility%2520for%2520Pregnant%2520Women.pdf){.external_link

Medicaid coverage begins, and most states have very similar programs.

States fund these programs because they have a vested interest in
keeping mothers healthy through their pregnancy, as healthy mothers
produce healthier children, and those mothers are far less susceptible
to pregnancy-related injury and illness.

Original question:

Why don't "pro-life" people support having child support payments prior
to birth to help with expenses associated with pregnancy and getting
ready for a baby's arrival?
