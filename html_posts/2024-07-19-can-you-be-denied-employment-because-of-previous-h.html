Technically, you can't be denied because you have a previous health
condition. Technically, you would be denied because you have a health
condition which prevents you from performing the essential functions of
the job.

What employers are allowed to do is list the essential functions of the
job, and then send you (at their expense) to a doctor to evaluate you.
If the doctor finds that you have a condition which would prevent you
from performing the essential functions of the job, they can pass on
hiring you.

That said, the ADA makes it illegal to simply deny employment because of
a pre-existing condition. For example, you could rightly deny employment
as a mine worker if you have mine dust lung diseases. But you probably
could not deny employment as a file clerk with the same disease.

So in general, you cannot be denied employment because of a pre-existing
condition, unless the job requirements state that your ability to be
able to perform a task cannot be limited by a pre-existing condition.

\

If you are ever denied a position simply because you have a pre-existing
condition, and that condition does not impede your ability to perform
the essential functions of the job, you will need to seek out an
employment attorney in your area who can help you.
