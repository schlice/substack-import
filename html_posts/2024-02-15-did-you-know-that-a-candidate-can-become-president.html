Yep.

Did you know that in baseball, the team which gets the most hits is not
the team that wins? That's because *hits* is not what is counted for
winning the game. It's the number of players who end up safe at home
plate.

Did you know that in hockey, the team with the most O-Zone time is not
the team that wins? That's because O Zone time is not what is counted
for winning the game. It's the number of times the puck completely
crosses the goal line that is countred.

See where I'm going with this?

It's not the popular vote that is counted. If that were the case, the
Presidential election would be nothing more than a popularity contest
rather than picking the best leader for the country. Presidents would
campaign only in the states with the largest populations, and most of
the country would be summarily ignored.

The founders wanted *all* of the country to be represented, and
population is only one part of that. Is it fair that states with smaller
populations would be underrepresented if we had a popular vote system?
The founders didn't think so.

So they devised a system whereby the size of the state has a role in
deciding how much influence the state has, along with its population.
The system they devised assigns a certain number of *electoral votes* to
a state based on **both** its population, and its size. Thus, large
states with small populations have a somewhat equal representation with
small states and large populations.

It's the same system which is used to determine how many representatives
a state gets in Congress. The House of Representatives uses the same
formula to determine how many Representatives represent that state.
Thus, the House is the representative of the *people.*

The Senate, on the other hand, treats all states as sovereign equals,
and all states send two Senators to Congress. The Senate, therefore, is
the representative of the *state*.

In this way, the *state* and the *people* are equally represented.¹

Similarly, for Presidential elections, the number of electoral votes
given to a state equals the number of Representatives plus the number of
Senators.

But to appease the likes of you, who want to be able to popularly vote
for President², states went to a "winner takes all" system whereby the
winner of the state's popular election gets all of the state's electoral
votes.

So you do have a popular election for President, but it's confined to
each state.

And that brings up the final point: there is no "national" election.
There are 51 separate popular elections for President. Each state holds
its own election and divvies up its electoral votes as it sees fit. This
is why we have a few states which divide their electoral votes, but we
have most states use the "winner take all" method.

¹ This system, though, was basically removed by the 17th Amendment in
1913, when Senators were converted to direct popular election, rather
than being appointed by the state. Why did this happen?From the Senate
website:

> Following the Civil War, disputes among state legislators over Senate
> elections resulted in numerous deadlocks, leaving some Senate seats
> vacant for long periods of time. The Delaware legislature reached a
> stalemate in 1895, taking 217 ballots over a period of 114 days.
> Delaware remained without representation in the U.S. Senate for two
> years. In light of such problems, reformers in many states began

This change to the Constitution weakened the power of the state by
removing the balance between the voice of the people and the voice of
the state. We essentially have "two Houses of Representatives" with
unclear terms but similar missions.

² "Winner take all" wasn't just to have popular elections for President.
States wanted their elections to hold more weight versus other states,
so they started awarding all of the electoral votes to the one candidate
who won the popular vote in their state. But in order to not water down
the vote of their own state, other states quickly joined in, and today,
48 states use a winner-takes-all method to award their electoral votes.
