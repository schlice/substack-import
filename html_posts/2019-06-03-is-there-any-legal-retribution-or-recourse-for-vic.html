**Is there any legal retribution or recourse for victims of over-zealous
prosecutorial misconduct such as perjury traps, threats against family
members and entrapment?**

These things are not "prosecutorial misconduct." *Webster\'s New World
Law Dictionary* defines prosecutorial misconduct as \"an illegal act or
failing to act, on the part of a prosecutor, especially an attempt to
sway the jury to wrongly convict a defendant or to impose a harsher than
appropriate punishment.\"[\[1\]](#YXUpF){#cite-YXUpF .citation_link}

Let's start with "perjury traps," the phenomenon where an unscrupulous
lawyer tricks you into committing perjury. Here's an example of a
perjury trap: Let's say a lawyer knows you committed a crime, but the
statute of limitations expired on that crime, so you can't be
prosecuted. Let's say the lawyer asks you under oath about that crime.
If you lie about it, that's a new crime (perjury). Tricking someone into
lying is still someone lying. No US federal court has ever dismissed a
case because someone claimed a perjury trap. You weren't tricked into
lying; you lied. Period. If the prosecutor told you that you can still
be prosecuted for that crime when he knew that you cannot, that may be
considered *entrapment by estoppel,* which we'll get into a little bit
later in this answer.

Threats against family members are exactly that: threats. If someone
threatens your life or your safety, that's a threat. Call the police.

It's also unlikely that a prosecutor can get someone to commit
entrapment, which is enticing someone to commit a crime who would not
otherwise have committed a crime.

The *only* charge you may be able to make is *entrapment by estoppel*,
which is a defense which \"applies when, acting with actual or apparent
authority, a government official affirmatively assures the defendant
that certain conduct is legal and the defendant reasonably believes that
official\"[\[2\]](#VXJKK){#cite-VXJKK .citation_link}. This was first
asserted in *Raley v. Ohio*, where a defendant was told they could
reasonably plead the 5th. However, in Ohio, because they were already
provided immunity deals, the 5th didn't apply. When they pleaded the
5th, they were then prosecuted for failing to answer questions. The
convictions were overturned on appeal under the grounds of entrapment by
estoppel.

If you think you have a case for entrapment by estoppel, you must appeal
your conviction. Prosecutors who engage in this sort of misconduct can
be disbarred.
