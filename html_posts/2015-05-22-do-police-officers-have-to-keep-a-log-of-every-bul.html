**Content:** [I\'ll add the Military Police perspective.\
\
As Tim and Chris mentioned for police officers, military police must
also write pages of reports if a bullet is fired outside of the range.\
\
However, military police are issued weapons, magazines and bullets at
the beginning of each shift. Each bullet is stamped with a lot number.
These bullets ***cannot*** be fired unless you are shooting at someone,
on duty, for an authorized reason. These bullets are delivered to the
range at the end of their useful life, to be fired during normal range
operations. They are then replaced with new, stamped, bullets, and the
lot numbers issued are recorded when a military police officer checks a
weapon out of the armory.\
\
Accordingly, at random intervals, military police will be required to
**block** their ammo when they turn in their weapons at the end of a
shift. You are presented with an appropriatelly-sized 1x6 piece of wood
(colloquially known as *the block*) with either 30 holes or 120 holes,
depending on what weapon you were carrying (a military police officer
carrying an M9 carried two 15-round magazines holding a total of 30
rounds or an officer carrying an M-16 carried four 30-round magazines
for a total of 120 rounds). You must remove every round from your
magazines and place them nose-down in the block. The block of ammo is
then inspected by the armorer, and you will be held accountable for any
rounds that are not part of the same lot number that you were issued at
the beginning of your shift. Once your lot numbers were confirmed, you
had to re-load your mags. I was a SRT (Security Response Team) team
leader, and routinely carried an M-16. *Huge pain in the butt.*\
\
Of course, that didn\'t prevent you from buying your own ammo, emptying
your mag into your pocket, loading the mag with your own ammo and firing
them off, re-loading the government ammo in the mag and going on about
your day. Of course, this was illegal according to regulation, and
anyone found doing this would face severe penalties under
