**How can I get Amazon Prime photos to automatically back up photos from
my iPhone (it does that for my Samsung Phone)?**

Install the [[Prime Photos
app](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=161b64&url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/prime-photos-from-amazon/id621574163?mt%3D8){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="apple.com"}]{.qlink_container} from the App Store. You can
then configure the app to automatically back up all photos from your
iPhone. Once they are stored in Prime Photos, you can delete them from
your iPhone to free up space.

Remember that Prime members get unlimited photo storage.
