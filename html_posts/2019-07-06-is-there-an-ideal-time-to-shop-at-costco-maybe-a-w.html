**Is there an ideal time to shop at Costco? Maybe a window of time where
off-duty police officers are not shopping?**

See, what you've done here is equating [[a single
act](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=d8b30c&url=https://www.apnews.com/be7a195170a04aaf94e793a512ffd2bc){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="apnews.com"}]{.qlink_container} by a "bad actor" (in your
opinion; we don't know all the facts yet) and have posited that the
entire group behaves in a similar way. This is the logical fallacy of
the **composition fallacy**: where you use an erroneous characteristic
of a part and equate it to the whole.

But you did it in an attempt (and a pathetic, pandering one at that) to
shame all police officers.

Smart people aren't buying it.

Even worse, if you go look at what actually happened, we know that there
was a fight, and an off-duty police officer defended himself. Of course,
the devil is in the details, but we'll find out eventually what
happened. What we do know is that this was a fight which escalated.

To answer your question, there is no time at all where off duty police
officers are never around you while you're out in public. They are
always there. And you just don't know it.

Wanna know what's worse? There are *concealed carry holders who are not
police officers* who are also all around you, too. And again, you'll
never know it.

Here's an idea: don't start fights. Then you won't have to worry about
getting shot.
