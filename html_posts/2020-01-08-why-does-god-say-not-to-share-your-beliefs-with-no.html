**Why does God say not to share your beliefs with non-believers?**

The Bible does reference non-believers, but it doesn't say to not share
your beliefs with them.

The Bible actually talks about "being yolked to" non-believers, or
receiving them into your house (which is accepted to mean that you
welcome them into your life and the life of your family).

> *Do not be deceived: "Bad company ruins good morals." --- 1 Cor 15:33
> ESV*
>
> *Do not be unequally yoked with unbelievers. For what partnership has
> righteousness with lawlessness? Or what fellowship has light with
> darkness? --- 2 Cor 6:14 ESV*

Paul does make an exception for marriage, stating that marriage between
a non-believer and a believer can benefit both:

> *If any woman has a husband who is an unbeliever, and he consents to
> live with her, she should not divorce him. For the unbelieving husband
> is made holy because of his wife, and the unbelieving wife is made
> holy because of her husband. Otherwise your children would be unclean,
> but as it is, they are holy. --- 1 Cor 7:13--14 ESV*

But it does indeed say that you should share your beliefs with everyone.
In fact, it's exactly what Jesus instructed His disciples to do just
before He left the Earth. It's what Christians call the Great
Commission:

> *Then the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain where
> Jesus had told them to go. When they saw him, they worshiped him; but
> some doubted. Then Jesus came to them and said, "All authority in
> heaven and on earth has been given to me. Therefore go and make
> disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and
> of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey
> everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to
> the very end of the age." --- Matthew 28:16--20 NIV*

TL;DR: While we should indeed be wary of being swayed by the
non-believers, we should indeed make every effort to bring them the
Gospel message:

> *For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that
> whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. ---
> John 3:16 NIV*
