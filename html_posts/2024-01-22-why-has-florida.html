Because the measure has inadequately defined what "viability" means.

Florida Attorney General Ashley Moody had this to say about the proposed
state constitutional amendment:

It becomes very difficult to enforce a law for which the definitions of
the terms you use are unclear. Without a clear end to when this
particular right to abortion would end, there is no way it could be
enforced.
