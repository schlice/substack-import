Probably none. The drafts are not classified like information at the
DoD, and previous leakers have been prosecuted for leaking classified
information.

If the leaker was an employee in one of the Justice's offices, the
person *could potentially* be charged with theft of government property
if they weren't authorized to have it. If the leaker was a clerk
(themselves credentialed lawyers), they would probably be disbarred.
Regardless, whoever the person was (a clerk or another employee in one
of the Justice's offices), they will lose their jobs and will likely
never work in law again. Breaching trust is not looked upon kindly by
the profession.

Interestingly, if the leaker was actually one of the Justices, there
really is no "crime" other than breach of SCOTUS protocol. The only real
punishment they could face would be impeachment and removal from the
Court. The last time a SCOTUS Justice was impeached was 1805 (Justice
Samuel Chase), and he was acquitted by the Senate, so he was not removed
from the Court.
