You're on the right track, but not for the right reasons.

First, getaway drivers are "slammed" with murder because of what's known
as the "[[Felony
Murder](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=455f4f&url=https://www.justia.com/criminal/offenses/homicide/felony-murder/){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="justia.com"}]{.qlink_container} rule." If, while a group is
in the commission of a felony, a murder occurs, then everyone involved
in the felony is equally eligible for the murder. It's a part of
"transferred intent."

But aside from felony murder, mandatory charges are a great idea for
anyone who commits a crime involving a firearm. For example, a mandatory
gun charge **which is not subject to plea bargain or parole**. Add to
that a mandatory sentence (say 5 years to run consecutively to any other
sentence), and anyone committing any crime in which a gun is involved is
*automatically* going away for a minimum of 5 years, and it can't be
plea bargained away, and you have to do the whole five, no parole.

Take the ability to remove the gun charge out of the hands of the
prosecutors and the judges and see how many criminals are willing to do
the mandatory time.
