**Content:** [Ultimately, the two most important things we should impart
to our children was said by Denis Waitley, motivational speaker and
author: \"The greatest gifts we can give our children are \'roots and
wings\': the roots of responsibility and the wings of independence.\"\

He also said that we need to motivate them to empower themselves:
"[[There are two primary choices in life: to accept conditions as they
exist, or accept the responsibility for changing
them.](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=ac529c&url=http://thinkexist.com/quotation/there_are_two_primary_choices_in_life-to_accept/260626.html){.external_link

feel like they can take that responsibility and make positive changes
when they see injustice or wrongs. With]{.rendered_qtext}
