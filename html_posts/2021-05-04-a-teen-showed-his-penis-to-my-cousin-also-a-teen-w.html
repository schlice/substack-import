As with all legal questions, the answer is "it depends."

The juveniles, if anything at all, will be handled by the juvenile
justice system. This system does not involve criminal charges and does
not involve lawsuits. It seeks to educate juveniles and parents so that
juveniles can have positive transitions into adulthood. This may involve
individual and group counseling. It could potentially involve some time
in a juvenile detention facility, but not always.

This, however, is all dependent on the state. In a small handful of
states, juveniles (especially ones close to becoming legal adults) may
be charged as adults if the act is particularly heinous.
