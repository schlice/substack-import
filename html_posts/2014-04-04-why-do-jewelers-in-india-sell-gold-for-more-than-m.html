<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [If I sell you my bracelet (worth about 1200 INR) for 2000<br>INR, this is not illegal. Unless I misrepresented the quality, the<br>heritage, or the actual cost of the bracelet, making a profit is not<br>illegal in a free-market society.\<br>\<br>Additionally, the value of an item does not track directly with the<br>market price for the raw commodity. If that particular style of gold<br>item is in high demand, they can make more profit simply because the<br>demand is higher. Other gold items which are not in as high demand could<br>potentially sell for less than market value.\<br>\<br>The lesson here is *caveat emptor*. It is your responsibility as the<br>consumer to tell the jeweler the current market rate for gold and demand<br>they sell you the bracelet for market price plus a reasonable amount for<br>profit. If they do not, move on to the next vendor. This is how<br>free-market capitalism works. The vendor who sells at the most<br>competitive price will get the most business. Other vendors will have to<br>match that price in order to stay competitive.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
