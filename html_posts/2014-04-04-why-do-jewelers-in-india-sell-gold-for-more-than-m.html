**Content:** [If I sell you my bracelet (worth about 1200 INR) for 2000
INR, this is not illegal. Unless I misrepresented the quality, the
heritage, or the actual cost of the bracelet, making a profit is not
illegal in a free-market society.\
\
Additionally, the value of an item does not track directly with the
market price for the raw commodity. If that particular style of gold
item is in high demand, they can make more profit simply because the
demand is higher. Other gold items which are not in as high demand could
potentially sell for less than market value.\
\
The lesson here is ***caveat emptor***. It is your responsibility as the
consumer to tell the jeweler the current market rate for gold and demand
they sell you the bracelet for market price plus a reasonable amount for
profit. If they do not, move on to the next vendor. This is how
free-market capitalism works. The vendor who sells at the most
competitive price will get the most business. Other vendors will have to
match that price in order to stay competitive.]{.rendered_qtext}
