In some states, rape is a crime that only a man can perpetrate against a
woman. In others, rape can be perpetrated by members of either sex.

Can women *physically* rape men? I mean, a man has to be erect in order
to have sex, right? Doesn\'t that mean that he must *want* to have sex,
and therefore it is consensual?

The law almost universally says that male arousal is a physical
reaction, not necessarily one that is controlled by conscious effort,
either in the affirmative or in the negative. Additionally, injectable
and oral drugs called *vasodialators* (i.e. Viagra) can induce erection,
potentially against the will of the male victim.

The legal hurdle which must be overcome to determine whether or not a
rape has occurred is ***consent***. A male can have sex without consent,
so in states that permit females to be charged with it, rape can be
committed by females.
