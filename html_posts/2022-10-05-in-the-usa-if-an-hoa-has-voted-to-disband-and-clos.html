When an HOA dissolves, it is gone.

In order to create a new *mandatory* HOA (one in which everyone is
automatically a part of), there must be 100% approval from all
homeowners. If there is even one homeowner who does not approve, the
neighborhood cannot create a mandatory HOA.

Some states do allow this to happen, and we have seen examples of
neighborhoods which have done this --- created mandatory HOAs which
excluded a house or two, because they refused to join. This is a recipe
for disaster. It does nothing but create enmity between those who are a
part of the HOA and those who are not, because those who are not
*passively benefit* from those who are.

But to your question, when an HOA dissolves, it is gone. The "old rules"
are gone. The HOA cannot be "restarted" in the future and insist that
homeowners are still covered under the "old rules." Once the HOA
dissolves, everyone's deeds are rewritten, excluding the HOA. Therefore,
you can't "restart" the HOA and assert that the "old rules" still apply,
because the deeds for the individual homes no longer have the HOA as an
entity with property interests.

The HOA can indeed restart, but it has to follow the rules for "starting
an HOA in an already-sold community."

Original question:

In the USA if an HOA has voted to disband and close up, can if restart,
for example 2 years later, insisting the previous members are part of it
or does it have to solicit them to join the new HOA?
