As with all legal questions, the answer is "it depends."

Also be aware that there are two presidential actions: **pardon** and
**commutation**. Pardon means that the conviction is wiped out as if it
never happened. Commutation only happens after the person is convicted.
Commutation "completes the sentence" as if the person completely served
the sentence. The conviction remains, but any sentence which remains is
commuted.

In order to answer the question, you would have to refer to the pardon.
Regardless of whether the pardon was preemptive, or whether it pardoned
an actual conviction, the pardon wipes out the conviction or it wipes
out the ability to bring a charge for that time period or that crime,
depending on what the pardon says.

However, that only applies to *that time period* for a preemptive
pardon, or to *that* *specific crime* for a conviction pardon. If the
charge falls outside of that window, the person can still be charged.

There are also situations where a person can still be charged *in
relation to* that crime, but not *for* that crime. For example, let's
take Hunter Biden, who was pardoned for any crimes he may have committed
during a specified period of time. If Hunter is called before a House
subcommittee to testify *about* what has happened, he would have to
testify. He cannot claim a Fifth Amendment exemption from testimony
since he cannot be charged. And if he lies about the information under
oath, he can be charged with lying to Congress. So while he can't be
charged with whatever crime he may have committed, if he commits a *new*
crime related to the original crime, *that* crime is chargeable.
