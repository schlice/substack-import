> How on Earth was Roe v. Wade overturned?

Because it was a horrible decision legally. You may have liked its
outcome, but the way it got there was unsustainable and
unconstitutional. It caused *continuous* legal trouble because the
decision was really unsustainable.

It doesn't make legal sense to keep a bad ruling in force just because
you like the outcome. If you want the outcome, get it the right way: get
Congress to pass a nationwide law permitting abortion. Or (as we have
today), get your state to permit it.

> How are rape victims going to be treated as a result?

With compassion, first and foremost. And referring to the point above,
most states have some provision which allows abortion in the case of
reported rape. We can talk about whether or not that makes moral sense,
but legally, it's up to the states to determine that.

But even if the state does not allow abortion in the case of rape, the
rape victim is treated with respect and compassion. We clearly
understand that she is not interested in being in the position in which
she is in. She never asked for it. She never wanted it. So compassion is
the word of the day.
