**Content:** [Absolutely, positively, **[NOT]{.underline}**.\
\
Officer Wilson was personally threatened with physical harm. Other
members of the Ferguson Police Department were threatened with physical
harm. There is no way that Officer Wilson can continue to act as a law
enforcement officer and still be expected to command respect, after the
massive smear campaign perpetrated by the media.\
\
Even Sir Charles Barkley said today that the media misled the public,
because they \"\...love this stuff \[race issues\], and lead people to
jump to conclusions. The media shouldn\'t do that. They never do that
when black people kill each other.\"\
\
So, in order to protect his fellow officers, and to protect himself and
his family, he resigned.]{.rendered_qtext}
