**Should I demand to be let out of my Brooklyn, NY lease because my
roommate is getting a gun without my consent?**

Sure. But remember, as soon as you let the landlord know that you want
out because your roommate brought a gun into Brooklyn from out of state,
get out of the way because your roommate is about to be arrested. That
landlord won't want that kind of trouble in his building, and you can be
sure he's going to call the police so he stays on the right side of the
law himself.

New York gun laws are some of the strictest in the country. You need
individual licenses to purchase and licenses to carry, and they are "may
issue" licenses, which means that whether or not they are actually
issued is up to the issuing officer.

New York doesn't recognize permits from anywhere else, so if you don't
have a New York gun permit, you can't bring a gun into New
York.[\[1\]](#tpSnJ){#cite-tpSnJ .citation_link}

So in my opinion, trying to get your landlord to let you out of your
lease because your roommate illegally brought a gun into the city is a
good way to get your roommate arrested. I'm not sure if it's a good way
to get out of your lease, but it will do something.
