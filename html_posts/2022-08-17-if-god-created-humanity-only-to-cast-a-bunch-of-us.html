Ah yes, the old "God is bad because he created us to go to hell when we
don't follow his stupid rules" question. We've answered this a bzillion
times on Quora (yes, that's a real number, *Toy Story* said so), and I
know the Quora search bar is.......lacking, but you should still try it
sometime.

Anyway, for old time's sake, I'll answer it one more time.

**God didn't create us evil.** God created us with the *capacity to
choose evil, because he* ***intentionally*** *gave us free will.* The
free will thing was his choice. Take it up with him when you stand
before him at the end of days.

Anyway, sure enough, we chose evil. In order for our free will to be
truly free, we must have the capacity to choose evil, and we did.

But that's okay, because he gave us an escape plan from that, too. It's
in the form of another choice: we have to choose to accept him and his
gift of salvation.

See, God isn't *sending* us to hell. **We're already on the way there**.
God offers us the way out, if we choose it.

Think of it this way: on this earth, we're literally all on the Titanic.
We've hit the iceberg, we're all going down. But God's right over there,
with a lifeboat. He's standing on the edge of the lifeboat, with an
outstretched hand, waiting to take you on board. All you have to do is
choose to get on. Some will choose to ignore the lifeboat because the
shrimp scampi on this ship is *just too delicious*. Some will ignore the
lifeboat because *how could God create us with free will and allow us to
choose to die? How sadistic is that?* Or whatever reason they decide to
ignore the lifeboat. But many will accept God's outstretched hand and
get on the lifeboat.

God is waiting for you, with his hand outstretched. No matter what you
do, no matter how bad you think you are, he will still be there, waiting
for you, with his hand outstretched.

Will you take it?
