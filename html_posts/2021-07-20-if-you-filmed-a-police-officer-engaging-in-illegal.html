By "appropriate," I assume you mean the one that will get visible
results.

The actual "appropriate\" organization would be the department itself.
It would be the departments Internal Affairs office, or if you can find
the officer\'s supervisor or sergeant, that person.

But they will take the information, do their own audit, do interviews,
review training, and take internal action. That action could be anything
ranging from disciplinary action, retraining, or perhaps possibly
reassignment of the officer. If criminal charges were to be filed
against the officer, it would not be done in the open, because the
department would not want a black eye over the incident, especially if
they have to file charges themselves. Change will happen, but there\'s a
very good chance that you will not see the change.

Therefore, if you want visible results, the best organization to give
the footage to would be your local television station. Go to their
website, and find the information regarding their investigation team.
Local TV stations usually have some sort of consumer investigation
group. They do investigations on behalf of viewers, and then turn the
results into a story. Contact them, and give them the footage. Let them
turn it into a story for the local news, and the department will be
forced to publicly respond in a way that\'s appropriate to people who
saw the original footage.
