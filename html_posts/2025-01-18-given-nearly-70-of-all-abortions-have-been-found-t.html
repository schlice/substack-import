First of all, it's because pro-choice people are not concerned about
whether or not societal coercion exists. They just want to have the
ability to kill an unborn baby, full stop. They never talk about the
fact that some women (maybe a majority of women) feel pressured to abort
their babies *because* pro-choice people have ensured that some states
have unfettered access to abortion.

Is this pressure **always** from the baby's father? No, not always, but
that pressure indeed is there. But there are other pressures.

- Deceptive or even coercive counseling
- Employment discrimination against pregnant women
- Housing discrimination against pregnant women
- Pregnancy or abortion related violence

And none of that is to mention the issues *after* abortion (which
pro-choice people love to discount, but they do exist), such as women
who have aborted showing symptoms of trauma, are four times more likely
to die after an abortion, and suicide rates are six times higher for
women in their first year following an abortion.

But let's focus on the pre-abortion coercion for just one moment. Here's
the sad statistics:

- 64% of women reported feeling pressured to abort.
- Most felt rushed or uncertain, yet 67% weren't counseled.
- 79% weren't told of available resources.
- 84% weren't sufficiently informed before abortion.
- Pressure to abort can escalate to violence.
- Homicide is the leading killer of pregnant women.
- Clinics fail to screen for coercion.
- Women nearly 4 times more likely to die after abortion.
- Suicide rates 6 times higher after abortion.
- 65% of women suffer trauma symptoms after
  abortion.[\[1\]](#uxaDF){#cite-uxaDF .citation_link}

Cue the pro-choicers to tell me why these statistics are wrong in
