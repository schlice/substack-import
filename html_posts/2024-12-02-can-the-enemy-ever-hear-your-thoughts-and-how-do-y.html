Satan cannot hear your thoughts. The demons cannot hear your thoughts.
If you examine the Bible, you see that any interaction between Satan or
demons and people is out loud.

You will also find in Daniel 2 the story where King Nebuchadnezzar had
some dreams. The king then demanded that his magicians tell him what the
dreams meant, but crucially, *the king did not tell them the dreams*.
The sorcerers could not do it because their normal source of power and
information were demons, and the demons were clearly unable to read the
king's mind. Not only did Daniel relay the king's dream back to him (as
was told to him by God), but he also explained what it meant.

Therefore, the Bible tells us clearly that Satan and the demons cannot
read your mind and they cannot hear your thoughts.

Satan and his demons can also not see the future. They are not
omniscient like God is.

But, and this is important, **Satan and his demons can put thoughts into
your mind.** The Bible clearly teaches that Satan and the demons can put
thoughts into your mind. For example, let's look at 1 Timothy 4:1 which
says:

> *Now the Spirit expressly says that in later times some will depart
> from the faith by devoting themselves to deceitful spirits and
> teachings of demons, \-- 1 Tim 4:1 ESV*

Also, we can be affected by the promptings of Satan *and not even be
aware of it*:

> *Then Satan stood against Israel and incited David to number Israel.
> \-- 1 Chronicles 21:1 ESV*

If David knew that it was Satan inciting him to take a census of Israel,
would he have done it? No, of course he wouldn't have. But since *David
thought the idea came from himself, he did it.* This passage teaches us
that Satan can plant ideas in our mind *and make us believe that they
are our own.*

If Satan plants an evil thought in our mind, it doesn't come through
with a Darth Vader voice. Not at all. We hear Satan's thoughts in our
minds *as our own*. If you hear thoughts like "I'm dirty" or "I'm
useless" or "I'm ugly," they may sound like you telling yourself that,
but *not all thoughts which come into your mind are your own.*

\

So how do you stop them?

**1. Understand your position in Christ**. Ephesians 1:19--22 tells us
that Jesus is seated at God's right hand, "far above all rule and
authority, power and dominion." God has placed *everything* at Jesus'
feet, and we are told that He is now head **over everything.**

Ephesians 2:6 then tells us:

> *and raised us up with him and seated us with him in the heavenly
> places in Christ Jesus, \-- Ephesians 2:6 ESV*

Let that sink in. *We are seated with Jesus! We are seated* ***far above
Satan and the demons!*** This means **you have authority over the
demons!**

**2. Use that power!** James 4:7 is the most often quoted, and most
often *misquoted and misunderstood*, passage describing how to stop
Satan.

> *Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will
> flee from you. \-- James 4:7 ESV*

Let's dig into that a little. People tend to forget about the first
part, and you'll often hear them say, "Resist the devil and he will flee
from you," but that's incomplete. It's missing a crucial part. *As long
as you are submitting to God while you resist the devil*, he ***will***
flee. Not he *might* flee if he feels like it, not he'll flee but then
come back in just a second. He ***will*** flee from you. This applies to
every Christian, no matter how weak or how strong your faith is, or how
long or how short a time you have been a Christian. Every believer has
the same power and authority over Satan in the spiritual world.

**3. Do not be afraid!** There is nothing big about a demon except its
mouth. They are like dogs with no teeth: all bark and no bite. Demons
are scared to death of Christians who understand the absolute magnitude
of power and authority they have in Christ.

In short, **Satan and the demons have no power over us** ***except what
we give them.***

Fix your eyes on Jesus and live a righteous life by faith in the power
of the Holy Spirit.

> *We know that everyone who has been born of God does not keep on
> sinning, but he who was born of God protects him, and the evil one
> does not touch him. \-- 1 John 5:18 ESV*

**4. Guard your mind!** Take every thought captive. Have you ever heard
that before?

> *We destroy arguments and every lofty opinion raised against the
> knowledge of God, and take every thought captive to obey Christ, \-- 2
> Cor 10:5 ESV*

Take every thought captive. Whether it comes from your own memory, a
movie, the Internet or a deceiving spirit, test every thought and see if
it is true. If that thought isn't true, don't believe it!

But does this mean we have to relentlessly check every thought to see if
it is true? Or search for demons to rebuke every five minutes? If you're
in a dark room and you want to see, do you shoo the darkness away? No,
you turn on a light! **Don't focus on the enemy. Focus on the**
***truth.***

> *Finally, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever
> is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is
> commendable, if there is any excellence, if there is anything worthy
> of praise, think about these things. \-- Phil 4:8 ESV*

Take heart brothers and sisters. You *can* defeat the devil!
