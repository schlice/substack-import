You can sue anyone for anything in this country. The question, of
course, is how likely you will be to prevail.

There are four key elements to a defamation claim that must be met:

- The actual defamatory statement which claims that it is factual
- Publication (libel) or communication (slander) of that statement to a
  third party
- Fault amounting to at least negligence, and
- Damages, or some harm caused to the reputation of the person against
  whom the statement was made.

Fault amounting to at least negligence must be shown; in other words,
you have to prove that the speaker or author was at least negligent in
not properly determining the truth before making the defamatory
statement.

As always, truth is considered to be an absolute defense to defamation
charges.
