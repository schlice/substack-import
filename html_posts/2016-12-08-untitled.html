We don't have a national ID because it's not useful for anything. You're
a *citizen* of the United States, but you are a *resident* of a state.
States generally use driver's licenses as ID cards. You can also get a
state ID card if you don't drive. Even in a national election, you vote
as part of your state. Especially for president, where the states decide
the outcome, not the people.

So why don't they just use your driver's license as voter ID? Some
states do, but not all. I mean, it seems simple enough. Why can't you
just get a driver's license or a state ID? What about this scenario:
what if you're elderly and you haven't seen your birth certificate for
the last 40 years? You don't have a car, you live on a fixed income,
etc. So you can't get your state ID card to vote because you don't have
enough documentation to do it and it's cumbersome to get around. You'd
have to take the bus to city hall to get a copy of your birth
certificate so that you can take another bus to go to DMV to get a state
ID card so you can *vote*? *That's* disenfranchisement. The arguments
about racism and illegals voting are red herrings.

Don't get me wrong, I'm all for voter registration. I don't see a
problem with showing some acceptable form of ID. You show ID to get your
Social Security benefits. You show ID when you go to the doctor's office
to get a checkup. You seriously can't show ID to vote? But there are
some scenarios where I could see obtaining a state ID card is cumbersome
or prohibitive for some.
