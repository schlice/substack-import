Well, I don't use *religion* to talk to them, since they dismiss it out
of hand. I have to use reason and logic. The atheist thinks that I can't
use reason and logic, because they think it's a "reason vs religion"
thing, but they are quite mistaken. Religion happens specifically
*because of* good logic and good reason, not in spite of it. But that's
a discussion for another day. And that's not the question which was
asked.

You asked what you say to an atheist who tells you that God doesn't
exist. Remember, "atheist" means "no god." So a true atheist believes
that God doesn't exist at all. To them I say, "How do you know? How do
you **absolutely** know that God doesn't exist?"

The truth is, it's impossible to know that God does not exist. As
philosopher and legal scholar Mortimer Adler put it, "An affirmative
existential proposition can be proved. But a negative existential
proposition---one that denies the existence of something---cannot be
proved." For example, I could tell you that purple squids exist, and you
could tell me that purple squids do not exist. I only need to show you
one example of a purple squid to prove my assertion. But you need to
examine all squids that have ever existed, across all time, to prove
that purple squids do not exist, and have never existed. It's
impossible. This is why *intellectually honest* atheists will admit that
they cannot prove that God does not exist. **At best**, an atheist could
say that it's unlikely that God exists, since the theist says that it's
likely beyond a reasonable doubt that God does exist.

From there, we can talk about the reasons why we believe that God
exists, and why it's more rational to believe that God does exist than
that he doesn't. And for a committed atheist, that's a very long and
detailed discussion.

Finally, we would need to discuss the seriousness of the truth claims
that atheists make, and the amount of evidence which should be required
to make such serious claims. For example, I could sit two glasses of
lemonade in front of you and tell you to choose one, but one of them is
more tart than the other. You probably wouldn't need to have too much
evidence to make a choice, since the consequences of drinking a more
tart glass of lemonade aren't all that serious. But if instead, I told
you that one was sweetened with sugar and the other was sweetened with
rat poison, you'd need weighty and incontrovertible evidence before you
made a choice.

This is where the atheists sit when they claim that God does not exist
and there are no eternal consequences for our actions in this life. In
order to make such a claim, which could have serious and eternal
consequences, they should be required to produce voluminous and
overwhelming evidence which proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that God
does not exist, and they cannot. **Atheism simply cannot meet the test
for evidence to support the seriousness of the charge that it makes.**
Instead the atheist, and those who they convince of their position,
slide into eternity with their fingers crossed, and hope that they don't
find the unpleasant truth that eternity does exist, and that such a
place is an awfully long time to be wrong. Quoting Mortimer Adler once
more: "**More consequences for life and action follow from the
affirmation or denial of God than from any other basic question.**"

If you\'re a Christian, how do you respond to atheists telling you God
doesn\'t exist?
