Yes. Lucifer is a created being.ยน He was created as an angel. He has the
most beautiful singing voice which has ever existed. But instead of
using that voice to praise God, *he wanted the praise for himself*.
Lucifer wanted to be worshipped like God. He was also very jealous of
God's penultimate creation: man. He wanted to be God's ultimate
creation.

So he, and about a third of the angels with him, rebelled against God.
There was a great battle, and Lucifer and the angels who followed him,
were cast out of heaven. Jesus said, "I saw Satan fall like lightning"
describing the time that he was cast out of heaven (Luke 10:18).

Today, Lucifer and his followers (who are now known as "demons") roam
the earth causing chaos and sowing dissent, all with the goal of
*separating man from God*.

But Lucifer isn't omniscient. He's not omnipresent, either. He can't
hear your thoughts or your prayers. But he can influence you. He can
whisper in your ear, in words which sound *exactly like you* in your own
mind. He can make you believe something so strongly that you're certain
that it must be your own desire that you came up with yourself. All with
the goal of leading you into *sin*, which separates you from God.

ยน The story of Lucifer's fall can be found in Isaiah 14:12-15 and
Ezekiel 28:12-19
