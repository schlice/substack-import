**Can God forgive Trump\'s adulteries even if Trump does not repent?**

[[Toby

has the right idea; that's not the way forgiveness works.

However, for any question ever which begins with the question "Can God,"
the answer is **yes, God can**.

I think the question you wanted to ask probably should have started with
**Will God**, and in this case, there is no Biblical evidence that God
forgives without some participation by the person.

In other words, if you're not actually seeking forgiveness, there's not
much chance that you'll find it.
