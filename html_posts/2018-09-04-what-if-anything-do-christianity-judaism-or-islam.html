**What, if anything, do Christianity, Judaism or Islam teach about the
origin of God? In other words, if God created the heavens and the earth,
where (if anywhere) do these religions explain God to have come from?**

God, by definition, doesn't come from anywhere. He is *eternal*,
necessarily so.

Why is it necessary that God is eternal? Because anything that is not
eternal has a cause, which means it has a beginning, which means that
there would have to be something that existed before God that caused God
to exist.

Christian writings teach that God caused everything to be created.

> *Through him all things were made; without him nothing was made that
> has been made. (John 1:3)*

Therefore, God must be timeless. He must have existed before anything
existed, which means He is, necessarily, eternal.

To answer your question: where did God come from? **He didn't come from
anywhere. He always was.**
