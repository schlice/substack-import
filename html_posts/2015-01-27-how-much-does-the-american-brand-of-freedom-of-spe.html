**Content:** [I\'m having a hard time seeing how freedom of speech
contributes to GDP.\
\
However, the tenor of your question implies that the lack of the
Amendment\'s impact on GDP somehow devalues it. It has immense value in
the culture of the country, allowing people to freely speak about any
topic which they choose without license or censure, and to freely and
openly redress grievances with the government. Try that in North Korea
and see what happens.]{.rendered_qtext}
