**If someone purposefully tries to kill themselves by running into
traffic, is the driver who hits them still charged with a crime?**

Whether or not a crime is charged is up to the District Attorney in the
city in which the incident occurs. If the evidence is clear that the
"victim" was actually attempting to commit suicide (i.e. suicide note
found online, other evidence of suicidal intent, etc), then it's likely
that the DA wouldn't even file charges against the driver, unless the
driver was also acting recklessly. Speeding to such a degree that you
couldn't have stopped anyway could be charged as simple reckless
driving. However, as to the death, the DA probably wouldn't charge the
driver in relation to the death if clear evidence existed that this was
a "suicide by car."
