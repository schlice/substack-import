If there is an appeals process (and there does not need to be one), it
will be outlined in your Governing Documents.

Unfortunately, if the HOA says you can't install a fence, you can't
install a fence. There really isn't anyone to whom you can appeal.

Now, if the HOA isn't following their own rules, or they denied your
fence application unfairly (i.e. they allowed your neighbor's fence that
is exactly the same, and disallowed yours), you'll have to get a lawyer
and file a lawsuit against the HOA (in the case of my example, for
selective enforcement).

But as far as the things that the HOA has control over go, the HOA has
the last word.
