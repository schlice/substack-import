**What would happen if the US government began sending the army into
states with legal pot and declaring martial law?**

The court would immediately stop the process because it would violate
the Posse Comitatus Act. The military cannot enforce state law.

Additionally, martial law only involves the suspension of habeas corpus,
which is the process by which someone arrested by the police be brought
before a judge to determine if the arrest is legal and valid. Martial
law suspends habeas corpus, and you can be arrested and detained
indefinitely by the local police.
