**How can you slow down cognitive changes in multiple sclerosis
patients? Are nootropics an option to consider?**

The best way to slow down cognitive changes in MS patients is cognitive
rehabilitation. This rehabilitation includes a combination of
**restorative techniques** and **compensatory techniques**. A
neuropsychologist or SLP (Speech/Language Professional) can assist with
the implementation of these techniques.

> **Restorative techniques** can include learning and memory exercises:
>
> - **Combine modes of learning:** You will be more likely to remember
>   something if you "see it, say it, hear it, write it, do it." It's
>   okay to give yourself extra time.
> - **Repeat & verify:** Repeat what you hear and verify that it is
>   correct to improve your attention and memory.
> - **Spaced rehearsal**: Repeat and practice information at intervals
>   spread out over time to improve your ability to store information.
> - **Build associations:** Use memory aids! For example, to remember
>   the name of someone you just met, associate her/his name with a
>   friend or family member of the same name, or with a place, color or
>   event that sounds like the new name.
>
> **Compensatory techniques** --- to make up for functions that are
> weakened --- include:
>
> - **Consolidate and centralize!** Designate one place in your home as
>   the "Grand Central" information center. Include your master
>   calendar, mail, bills, phone messages, to-do lists, keys, wallet,
>   shopping lists and more.
> - **Plan:** Post a calendar large enough to display everyone's
>   appointments, activities and social engagements, and reminders! Keep
>   pens or markers hanging right beside it. Or use a computer program
>   set up with reminders for routine tasks (synchronize it with your
>   mobile devices so you have your appointments with you while on the
>   go).
> - **Record:** Dictate your to-do list, notes or other things to
>   remember on a digital voice recorder (available on many phones).
> - **Remind:** Use checklists, the alarm on your watch or phone, your
>   kitchen timer, and more.
> - **Eliminate or remove yourself from distractions.** Turn off the TV,
>   music and whatever else is "on" when speaking with someone in person
>   or on the phone. Background visual and noise distractions can make
>   learning or remembering more difficult. If you can't eliminate the
>   distraction (for example, people talking at a party) then ask, "Can
>   we talk in a quieter place?"
> - **Take a break.** If you are having difficulty concentrating, take a
>   breath and refresh.
> - **Do one thing at a time.** Avoid switching back and forth from one
>   topic or task to another. Finish or find an appropriate stopping
>   place in what you're working on before you switch to something
>   else.[\[1\]](#GXFqR){#cite-GXFqR .citation_link}

Nootropics have not been shown to improve overall cognitive ability
other than providing some short-term symptom relief. The only drug which
has been shown to provide any benefit to cognitive ability for MS
patients is Aricept (donepezil hydrochloride), which produces some
moderate benefit to verbal memory. However, studies continue into these
drugs.
