The Bible is not one book, but is a collection of 66 different books
written over the course of 1500 years in three different languages:
Hebrew (the Old Testament), Greek (the New Testament), and Aramaic
(portions of the books of Daniel and Ezra, as well as portions of both
the Old and New Testaments).
