**The majority of mass shooters bought their weapons legally. However,
most had criminal or mental histories, precluding the purchase of those
weapons. How can different agencies share that information so current
firearms laws can be enforced properly?**

The reason you're having trouble with this is because you have one
inaccurate statement, and I'll bold it for you:

> However, most had criminal or mental histories, **precluding the
> purchase of those weapons.**

While it is true that most of the mass shooters we've had so far have
had criminal or mental histories, **most of those did not preclude the
purchase of weapons.**

In order to be precluded from purchasing firearms, you have to be a
convicted felon, or have been adjudicated a mental defective in court.
There are two incidents that I know of where a prohibited person may
have been inadvertently allowed to purchase a weapon:

1.  Sutherland Springs: The Air Force may have been responsible to pass
    information on to NICS, but it's still unclear based on the
    disposition of his discharge as to whether or not that information
    exchange was mandatory.
2.  Charleston. Dylan Roof was indeed prohibited because of a
    prescription drug charge, and should have been denied. However, a
    clerical error led to the investigation not being done within the
    requisite time frame, and a "default allow" being issued.

All of the other shooters did, or would have, passed their background
checks and would have been allowed to purchase firearms.

Also important to note: the two situations I know of were convicted
felons, not mental defectives, even though most of them had mental
issues which should have, in some way, told someone that they should
probably stay away from firearms. But the system isn't set up that way.
