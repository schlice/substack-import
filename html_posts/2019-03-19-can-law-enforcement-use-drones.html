**Can the police use drone for surveillance?**

Yes.

If a civilian can fly a drone in a particular area, then the police can,
too. The police are not under additional restrictions when the public is
not.

That said, the police cannot violate existing laws when it comes to
surveillance, and that is true for any form of surveillance, be it
visual, audible, wiretapping, or drones. Police cannot surveil any area
in which there is a reasonable expectation of privacy without a warrant.

Defense attorneys will very carefully observe how police use drones in
surveillance, and will ensure that any violations of law render that
evidence gained inadmissible.
