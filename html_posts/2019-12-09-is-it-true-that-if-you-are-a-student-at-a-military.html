**Is it true that if you are a student at a military academy but
discovered that you would rather be commissioned to a different branch
(e.g. you are at USNA but you want to go to the USAF), you can simply
choose to switch? Don\'t you need approval**?

There is indeed a program by which cadets at one military academy can
"cross-commission" to another military branch. Each service has its own
process by which cadets can be commissioned in another military branch,
but there is usually a one-for-one swap between the services, and it
must be approved by both services (the gaining and losing service).
