**Does Donald Trump feel betrayed by Judge Kelly, Trump\'s appointee,
who just ruled that Jim Acosta\'s White House press pass be
reinstated?**

**He probably does, but he shouldn't.**

If Trump did his job, he should have appointed judges who follow the law
and the Constitution.

Apparently, there is at least a question of whether Acosta's 5th
Amendment due process rights were violated, and a temporary restraining
order was issued to, at least temporarily, preserve that right.

This is a decision which, while I find curious how the courts intend to
override White House security protocol with a Constitutional amendment,
I can get behind.

Again, I don't have to like it or agree with it, but I do have to at
least support it temporarily, as it is only a temporary restraining
order.
