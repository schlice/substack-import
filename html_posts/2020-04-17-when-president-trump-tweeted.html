[[Sedition](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=e3d9b6&url=https://criminal.findlaw.com/criminal-charges/sedition.html){.external_link

onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"

"two or more people within the jurisdiction of the United States:

- To conspire to overthrow or destroy by force the government of the
  United States or to level war against them;
- To oppose by force the authority of the United States government; to
  prevent, hinder, or delay by force the execution of any law of the
  United States; or
- To take, seize, or possess by force any property of the United States
  contrary to the authority thereof."

Clearly, there's a lot of conflict between sedition and the 1st
Amendment, right? So how do you prove sedition? In order to get a
conviction for seditious conspiracy, the government must prove that the
defendant in fact **conspired to use force.** Simply **advocating for
the use of force is not the same thing** and in most cases is protected
as free speech under the First Amendment.

So no, it's highly unlikely that Trump's tweets could be considered
felony sedition. Relax,

here.
