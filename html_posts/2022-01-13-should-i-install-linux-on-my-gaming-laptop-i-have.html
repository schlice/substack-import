You *can*, but it's just not as easy to game on a Linux system as it is
to game on a Windows system.

Steam works, and any game that is Linux compatible in Steam will work on
a Linux system.\*

\* with effort. They don't always work right out of the box. They often
take a little bit of effort, and sometimes quite a lot of effort, to
work.

Take a look at Linus Sebastian trying to master gaming on Linux.
Admittedly, he's a bit of a Linux n00b, and he makes some really
predictably bad Linux mistakes, but even he is able to get a system
together and make it playable.

It's a three-part series. Enjoy it.

Original question:

Should I install Linux my gaming laptop? I have a ASUS RoG which I
bought thinking I would play some games, but I really didn\'t get into
it. Instead I became more interested about learning Linux/Computer
networking/Coding.
