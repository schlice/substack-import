I like the way you think. But there are a few notable problems with your
idea.

1.  Military base locations are picked to assist the **military** with
    its core function. Military base locations are not picked based on
    helping the **local community**.
2.  It is not the military's job to "secure the border." That's the job
    of the Department of Homeland Security, not the Department of
    Defense. I know it sounds like splitting hairs, but the federal
    government has already taken states to court over this issue (and
    won), claiming that it is solely within their purview to determine
    how best to secure (or not) the border. The federal government has
    designated the authority to secure the border to DHS, not to DOD.
3.  If it were a task assigned to the Department of Defense by the
    President and the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the military can absolutely
    go teach border security. But the construction of a base is not
    necessary to accomplish that task.

Ultimately, the problem here is that the military is the political arm
of the government, it is not an entity of its own. Clausewitz said,
"Politics is war without bloodshed. War is politics with bloodshed."
He's right. War is politics. The military is just a physical
manifestation of US foreign policy. It's the global "teeth" behind US
foreign policy.

Even though they can do it, and it might be a good idea, it's never
going to happen. The government would rather continue using the southern
border as a wedge issue in elections rather than doing what's best for
the country and its people.
