<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [He could say that he doesn\'t have the power to defer<br>removal of undocumented people if the \"deferral\" he\'s referring to is<br>deferral of the entire population of undocumented people. This would be<br>known as \"failing to follow the law\" and would be unconstitutional,<br>which is why he could legally say that he didn\'t have the power to do<br>it. He does legally have the power to defer removal of certain smaller<br>groups of undocumented illegals, like the refugees from Afghanistan,<br>while their country was embroiled in civil war. This was a small<br>(comparative) number of illegals (\~20,000).\<br>\<br>Then, he could go ahead and do it and claim that he\'s simply changing<br>the way the current law is being executed, because if it was done once,<br>it can be done again.\<br>\<br>These are all legal positions that will be argued over the course of the<br>next few years.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
