**Content:** [He could say that he doesn\'t have the power to defer
removal of undocumented people if the \"deferral\" he\'s referring to is
deferral of the entire population of undocumented people. This would be
known as \"failing to follow the law\" and would be unconstitutional,
which is why he could legally say that he didn\'t have the power to do
it. He does legally have the power to defer removal of certain smaller
groups of undocumented illegals, like the refugees from Afghanistan,
while their country was embroiled in civil war. This was a small
(comparative) number of illegals (\~20,000).\
\
Then, he could go ahead and do it and claim that he\'s simply changing
the way the current law is being executed, because if it was done once,
it can be done again.\
\
These are all legal positions that will be argued over the course of the
next few years.]{.rendered_qtext}
