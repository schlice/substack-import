Let's see if we can help you find the problem.

I highlighted the most significant part of your question:

*Today I have checked my bf\'s phone by chance and saw he liked some
girl\'s video on TikTok. He asked sorry many times and deleted the app,
he promised not to see these type of videos.* ***But I have trust
issues.*** *What should I do?*

So have you found the issue yet? **You** have trust issues.

The issue is you.

Usually, "liking a video" does not automatically equate to "I want to
leave you for another woman." You are being overly sensitive. You're
dating, you're not married. I could see him needing to be more sensitive
to his timeline once he's married (as that type of behavior could be
really disrespectful to his wife), but again, you're *dating*. He's
looking at TikTok, not Bumble. He's watching videos; he's likely not
searching for another girlfriend.

And even if he *was*, what would the appropriate response be? Would it
be to scan his phone for all signs of that sort of activity and to make
him delete the apps? That seems a bit extreme, don't you think? Perhaps
you should *talk* to him about what in your relationship he finds so
distasteful that he should be hunting for a new girlfriend. You could
achieve the same thing by doing it your way, but not without generating
even more distrust between the two of you.

Talk it out with him. Communication is one of the most important things
you can have in a relationship. Start building the foundation of trust
and mutual respect *now*.

Because doing what you are doing now only encourages distrust, which is
exactly what you are afraid of. *You are actually encouraging the very
behavior you are trying to avoid.*

Don't do that.
