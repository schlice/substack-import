**Sure! But they should be careful in** ***how*** **they do so.**

Dressing up as a ghost has absolutely no effect other than to limit your
field of vision. Man, it was hard to see in those costumes.

The truth is that ***holidays only have the meaning that we give
them.***

That said, pretty much every holiday once derived from some sort of
pagan ritual. Even Christmas. According to some evidence, Pope Julius I
chose December 25, 336 AD as the date when Christmas was first
celebrated. This date was chosen in an effort to adopt and absorb the
traditions of the pagan Saturnalia festival. Saturnalia was an
adaptation of the Ancient Greek festival known as Kronia. Kronia was
celebrated in midsummer rather than midwinter. It is thought to signify
the end of the harvest season to honor Saturn, a god associated with
agriculture.

These days, really the only thing remaining of the old pagan rituals is
the date. We have so modified and commercialized the holiday that its
original meaning is pretty much gone. Churches focus on literally
nothing but the birth of Jesus, and ultimately that's all that matters.

Halloween, though, is a different story. There is still quite a lot of
less-than-savory stuff going on there. You should be careful of
Halloween. There is a "celebration of death" which is sometimes
associated with Halloween. Christians do not celebrate death, but we
celebrate life with Jesus. We don't *fear* death, but we also don't
*celebrate* it. Be cautious about this with Halloween festivals.

Is there anything spiritually wrong with dressing up in costumes of
superheroes and knocking on doors for candy? No, not really. We only
need to be cautious of celebrating the wrong things.

Plenty of churches remove all of the unsavory aspects of Halloween
(including the random door knocking) and instead hold *Trunk or Treat*,
where volunteers bring their cars to the church parking lot and decorate
the trunks with all manner of games and decorations and pass out candy.
In fact, in one church I attended when I lived in Colorado, our annual
Trunk or Treat was our largest outreach program, reaching literally
hundreds of new families, who just came for a safer alternative to
roaming the neighborhoods. We gave out free food and free candy to the
kids, they played games, and maybe learned a little bit about a person
who was named Jesus. We'd get more new members following Trunk or Treat
than at any other time of the year. So even Halloween can be used for
good.
