**How can a pornographer ask for tolerance for himself when rape victims
are not allowed to vote for a policy of gassing pornographers? Isn't it
the same form of hatred, that leads to death?**

Your question is flawed from the outset, because you are comparing two
things which cannot be compared.

In the United States, pornography (and production of pornography) is not
a crime. Rape is a crime. Rape causes demonstrably more harm than
pornography.

A pornographer (someone who produces pornography) has no need to ask for
tolerance because what he does violates no laws.

Are you trying to say that *consumption of pornography leads to rape?*

If that's what you're trying to say, then you are making an argument
with no proof. Your justification is probably littered with logical
fallacies and unproven accusations as well.
