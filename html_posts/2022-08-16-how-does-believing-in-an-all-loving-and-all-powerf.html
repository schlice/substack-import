*Where did you get the idea that believing in God will make your life
easier?*

Seriously, where did this idea come from? Because it's not the Bible,
that's for sure. Have you ever seen how those people lived? Even the
giants of the faith suffered tremendously during their lives and either
died in isolation or captivity, or were killed horrifically.

Jesus even told his followers to *expect* suffering.

> "I have told you these things, so that in me you may have peace. In
> this world you will have trouble. But take heart! I have overcome the
> world." --- John 16:33 NIV

So if the Bible tells us to expect suffering, where do we get this idea
that God will take away all of our pain? Frankly, as Christians go, we
don't advertise well that there are going to be times in your life when
things don't make sense, when circumstances just don't add up. For
example, Campus Crusade for Christ distributes a pamphlet entitled, "The
Four Spiritual Laws." The first of these laws is, "God loves you and has
a wonderful plan for your life." This is true, but it implies that the
believer will always understand and approve of that plan, which is not
always true.

Because sometimes, that "wonderful plan" includes childhood cancer. And
while it may be part of God's plan, I don't understand why he allows it,
and if I had my way, I'd not have that child get cancer.

But even in the most horrible of circumstances, God's plan is
"wonderful" because anything that is in accordance with his will
ultimately "works for the good of those who love him, who have been
called according to his purpose." (Romans 8:28 NIV).

So God *does* have a plan, even if we can't comprehend it. And we can't.

> \"For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my
> ways,\" declares the LORD. \"As the heavens are higher than the earth,
> so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your
> thoughts." --- Isaiah 55:8--9

So what are we to do with this? How are we supposed to proceed? The
Bible tells us, and it's through the story of Joseph. Hated by his
siblings, Joseph was sold into slavery (which was a shade better than
their first plan, which was to kill him). While in Egypt, he was
arrested, and falsely accused of rape by Potiphar's wife, and threatened
with execution. There is no indication in the Bible that God revealed
his plan to Joseph. He was just expected (as you and I are) to live out
his life, one day at a time, in something less than complete
understanding. **However, what pleased God was Joseph's faithfulness**
***even when nothing made sense.***

So what does all this tell us?

1.  God has a plan.
2.  We're not always going to understand that plan.
3.  But that plan is wonderful, as it works for his will.
4.  We are expected to be faithful *even when circumstances don't make
    sense,* because he loves us and he keeps his promises.
