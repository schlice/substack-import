If you're asking whether or not the US government will ever change gun
laws in such a way that guns will effectively be unavailable to the
public, the answer is no. The reason is because ***they can't***.

The Second Amendment prevents them from banning guns. In order to ban
guns, they must first repeal the Second Amendment.
