**As voters in a democratic system do we all share responsibility for
the actions of those in office? To a degree would you say
representatives even a president can only do what the people will
allow?**

No, voters do not share responsibility for what an elected official does
while they are in office. Even elected officials are responsible for
their own actions, and voters are only responsible for giving the
elected official the opportunity to perform actions in office.

Legally, campaign promises are not enforceable. Therefore, a candidate
can say one thing and do another thing once in office. In fact, it
happens all the time.

Voters *should* recognize that they do have a responsibility for using
the tools given to them by the nation's founders: when the next election
comes up, if the elected official did not perform in the way that you
expected/wanted/thought they would/whatever, you take the responsibility
you were given and vote for someone else.

Additionally, you worded your question oddly. We do not have a
democratic system. Democracy means that everyone votes on everything. We
have a representative government, not a democracy. Representative
government means that we vote for *representatives*, people who will
represent us, and they vote on everything. If you don't like how your
representative is representing you, vote for someone else.
