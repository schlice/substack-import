The implications are very simple. And this decision was a no-brainer for
the High Court, which is why it went unanimously (9--0).

The case, *Catholic Charities Bureau Inc. v. Wisconsin Labor and
Industry Review Commission*, questioned whether faith-based nonprofits
that provide public services are \"religious enough\" to receive the
same benefits as churches or houses of worship. Catholic Charities
Bureau (CCB), affiliated with the Diocese of Superior, Wisconsin,
provides critical care services for people with disabilities and mental
health needs. Wisconsin argued those acts were not \"primarily
religious.\"

Basically, Wisconsin was judging "how religious" CCB was. And Wisconsin
decided that CCB was not a religious institution because they did not
proselytize or serve people of their own faith. Basically, Wisconsin was
deciding if CCB was "Catholic enough" to be considered a religious
organization for tax purposes.

The Supreme Court said clearly that states have no authority to assess
or rank the religious nature of charitable work.

This is a big win for religious groups, because it's not just happening
in Wisconsin. All over the country, religious groups are being judged
based on their primary work and are being told that it's not "religious"
enough. For example, a religious group which runs a homeless shelter in
Ohio was told that their primary function is not "religious." Other
groups in Colorado and Arizona have faced similar arguments from local
governments, which question whether providing food, clothing or shelter
to those in need is inherently religious.

This is a huge win, which affirms that the government cannot tell a
religious non-profit what activities they can and can't do in order to
receive a government benefit. It's a big win for the First Amendment,
but hopefully it spurs more religious groups into charitable work, and
that has a twofold benefit: it directly impacts the people receiving
those services, and it tangentially spreads the Gospel message to those
who most desperately need to hear it.
