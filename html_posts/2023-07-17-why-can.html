***Because that's not their job.***

Their job is to interpret what those fallible people wrote in the
Constitution, and compare laws to that document. That's it. Their job is
not to determine that the people who wrote the rules in the Constitution
were *wrong* when they did it. And it's **certainly** not their job to
decide cases accordingly.

The Court decides cases based on how the Constitution is written, based
on what the people who wrote it believed at the time they wrote it.

If there is anyone who must accept the fallibility of the Founding
Fathers, it is the American people. When they find that fallibility, it
is up to the American people to amend the Constitution to correct any
failings that they find.
