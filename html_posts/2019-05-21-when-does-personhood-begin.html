**What do you say is the beginning of personhood?**

Personhood begins at conception.

The logic follows this way:

1.  Embryos and fetuses are **human** beings from conception. "Human
    being" is nothing more than the philosophical term for an individual
    member of the species *homo sapiens*.
2.  A baby is a living human organism. It grows, its cells divide, its
    cells respirate, and it is a unique life form separate from its
    mother (its DNA is unique from every other organism in existence).
    In other words, it is **alive**.
3.  **Personhood** is defined as being **human** and being **alive**.
4.  Since embryos are both alive and human from the moment of
    conception, they are, by definition, **persons**.
5.  Therefore, unborn children are persons from conception.
