Let's check the whole passage so we have context:

> *The Jews answered him, "Are we not right in saying that you are a
> Samaritan and have a demon?" Jesus answered, "I do not have a demon,
> but I honor my Father, and you dishonor me. Yet I do not seek my own
> glory; there is One who seeks it, and he is the judge. Truly, truly, I
> say to you, if anyone keeps my word, he will never see death." The
> Jews said to him, "Now we know that you have a demon! Abraham died, as
> did the prophets, yet you say, 'If anyone keeps my word, he will never
> taste death.' Are you greater than our father Abraham, who died? And
> the prophets died! Who do you make yourself out to be?" Jesus
> answered, "If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing. It is my Father
> who glorifies me, of whom you say, 'He is our God.' But you have not
> known him. I know him. If I were to say that I do not know him, I
> would be a liar like you, but I do know him and I keep his word. Your
> father Abraham rejoiced that he would see my day. He saw it and was
> glad." So the Jews said to him, "You are not yet fifty years old, and
> have you seen Abraham?" Jesus said to them, "Truly, truly, I say to
> you, before Abraham was, I am." So they picked up stones to throw at
> him, but Jesus hid himself and went out of the temple. \-- John
> 8:48--59 ESV*

When Jesus said this, He knew exactly who He was talking to. These were
Pharisees who were well-versed in the Jewish Holy Scriptures.

Jesus knew that when He said, "I AM," they would know that He was
referring to the time when Moses was talking to God before visiting
Pharaoh. Moses asked God what He should be called when Pharaoh asks who
sent him:

> *God said to Moses, "I AM WHO I AM." And he said, "Say this to the
> people of Israel: 'I AM has sent me to you.'" \-- Exodus 3:14 ESV*

The Pharisees knew this well. Jesus was literally telling them that He
is God. Before Abraham was born? That was hundreds of years before Jesus
lived. So saying "Before Abraham was born, I AM" means very
specifically, "I am God."

How can we sure that Jesus meant to tell them that He is God? *Their
reaction.* Immediately, they picked up stones to stone Him. Why?
Because, in their mind, He had just committed the sin of *blasphemy* for
claiming that He is God.
