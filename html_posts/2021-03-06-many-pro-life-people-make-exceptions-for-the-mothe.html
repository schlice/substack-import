**Many pro-life people make exceptions for the mother's life but what
about medical procedures or medication that the mother needs but could
harm the fetus? Ie. chemotherapy for a cancer that isn't guaranteed to
be but could be fatal.**

We seem to be missing what *is* and *is not* a choice between the life
of the baby and the life of the mother.

It sounds like the medical procedures the mother needs can probably be
delayed until the baby is born. If they can, then it *is not* a choice
between the life of the mother and the life of the baby. If they cannot,
then it *is*.

Doctors take the Hippocratic Oath which begins "First, do no harm." That
means no harm to anyone, including the baby. They would only risk the
health of the baby if the mother's life was at stake. Otherwise, they
would delay those treatments until the baby is born.

*For the time being, I have re-enabled comments on selected answers.
Some people like to comment. Some people like to engage with me in a
civil manner, and I did kinda miss that\...a little. But do not
misunderstand, I take this step very cautiously, and I have no tolerance
for harassing or inane behavior. If you don\'t like what I wrote, tough
shit. If my answer is grammatically low-quality or is un-cited opinion
masquerading as fact, downvote it. If you think I\'m wrong, write your
own answer. But Quora is a question-and-answer site, not a debate site.
If you are simply commenting to tell me \"ackshually, you\'re wrong,\"
don\'t be surprised if I quietly delete your comment. Put anything
vaguely harassing in there, and your deletion will be followed by a
block/mute, and a BNBR report. I will do this immediately and with no
compunction. You have been warned. Be nice.*
