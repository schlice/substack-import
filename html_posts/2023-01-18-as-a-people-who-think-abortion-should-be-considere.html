I'm just going to assume you're talking about the October 2021
conviction of one Brittney Poolaw in Oklahoma, who was indeed convicted
of 1st degree manslaughter because she miscarried her baby.

[[https://www.cbsnews.com/news/bri\...](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=eec06e&url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/brittany-poolaw-manslaughter-miscarriage-pregnancy/){.external_link

Prosecutors say that she violated the manslaughter statute of the state,
because she was taking methamphetamines during her pregnancy. Oklahoma
manslaughter law says that a homicide is manslaughter in the first
degree when the offender is \"engaged in the commission of a
misdemeanor; in a heat of passion, but in a cruel and unusual manner, or
by means of a dangerous weapon; or when perpetrating unnecessarily
either while resisting an attempt by the person killed to commit a
crime, or after such attempt shall have failed.\" Because she was
committing a misdemeanor (use of a controlled substance), the homicide
of the baby becomes manslaughter.

Critics of the prosecution say that the state\'s murder and manslaughter
laws don\'t apply to those who have miscarriages. In a statement
released shortly after Poolaw was convicted and sentenced to four years
in prison, National Advocates for Pregnant Women (NAPW) spoke out in her
defense, arguing prosecutors had blamed Poolaw for her miscarriage
"contrary to all medical science." "Ms. Poolaw's case is a tragedy,"
NAPW said in its statement. "She has suffered the trauma of pregnancy
loss, has been jailed for a year and half during a pandemic, and was
charged and convicted of a crime without basis in law or science."

Oklahoma has, starting in at least 2020, been cracking down on women who
abuse their unborn children through their own voluntary actions.

No one questions that she did what she is accused of doing. But the
questions surrounding the ethics of using the law to prosecute women who
have miscarriages are varied and not questions we can definitively
answer. Of course, the elephant in the room is this: should we even
consider prosecuting a woman who didn't definitively cause the death of
her baby? Note that in this case, there were several birth defects which
could have led to the miscarriage; the drug use was not conclusively
ruled to be the cause. However, the drug use could have caused the birth
defects, so the state can definitely make the case that she was
intentionally engaging in behavior that could harm her child, and if
harm came to that child, it is likely that the state would "connect the
dots" and claim that the drug use was a contributing factor to the death
of the baby. This is what they did in this case, and the jury was
persuaded by that argument.

We can have our own personal opinions, but the overturn of *Roe* means
that each state is allowed to decide for itself, and ultimately it's the
majority of the people in that state who will make that decision.
