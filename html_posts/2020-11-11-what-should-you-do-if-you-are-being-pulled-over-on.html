**What should you do if you are being pulled over on a dark stretch of
road, you haven't been speeding or driving recklessly, and it doesn't
appear safe? Can you call the emergency line or non-emergency number to
verify there's an officer in that area?**

Slow down, turn on your flashers, and call 911. Tell the dispatcher that
there is a "police car" behind you and ask them if there is an officer
in this area pulling a car over.

- If they say yes, **you must stop, even if you feel unsafe**.
- If they say no, **keep driving.** Drive to the nearest police station
  and go inside.

Most jurisdictions do not have any exceptions to their vehicle and
traffic law which allow you to do this, but most jurisdictions also
understand the environment in which we live today, and will understand
if a motorist chooses to verify the authenticity of the officer before
stopping.
