**Content:** []{.rendered_qtext}

In the United States, firearms are designated as \"lethal weapons.\"
Since pepper spray and Tasers are \"less-than-lethal,\" they are not
covered under federal firearms regulations.

That said, states can choose to regulate them as they wish, and some do
not allow citizens to carry Tasers unless they are registered in the
same way that firearms are.
