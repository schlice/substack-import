**No**.

The simple answer is that guns exist, and they are Constitutionally
protected. Over 300 million of them exist in the United States.

The **truth** is that ***no amount of legislation or wishful thinking or
celebrity endorsements or "buyback programs" will ever make them go
away. Ever.***

Even the "successful" buyback program in Australia only took *at most*
1/3 of the nation's guns out of circulation. In the United States, that
would still leave over 200 million guns in the country.

If you read that bold sentence and said, "But we have to do *something*,
and something is better than nothing," well that's good. It's good to
want to do something.

*But blaming the car when a drunk driver runs down a family is simply
illogical.*

Additionally, we've tried to legislate things out of existence before.
Remember Prohibition? Did it get rid of alcohol? Also, in case you're
unaware, drugs are illegal. We have completely legislated drugs away, in
just the same way you'd like to legislate guns away. And yet, kids in
American high schools can buy drugs easier than they can buy lunch. So
you can see just how effective it is when you try to legislate your
problems away.

We need to focus on ***why*** people wish to take up guns in the first
place. Gun massacres occur because people are so upset about something
that they are prepared to kill over it, *and* they have mental issues
which lead them to believe that killing is not only morally justified,
but it will make their problem better rather than worse.

But that is much harder to accomplish, because it is a *societal*
problem. It's not something you can legislate away. It's much easier to
focus on the gun rather than the shooter.
