What you are referring to are weapons which are heavily controlled under
the National Firearms Act of 1934 and the Firearms Owners Protection Act
of 1986. These are colloquially called "NFA Weapons."

Most states do not provide additional restrictions on top of Federal
requirements to own automatic weapons. It's actually shorter to list the
states which restrict NFA weapons:

CA, DE, DC, HI, IL, MA, MN, NJ, RI, WA, WI

Most of these states restrict all automatic weapons, some have some
other restrictions. New Jersey, for example, allows automatic weapons:
"Possession of a machine gun requires a state license, which is granted
on a 'may issue' basis by a county superior court judge. Machine gun
licenses are extremely difficult to obtain."[\[1\]](#QRAKF){#cite-QRAKF

If you do live in a state which allows automatic weapons, you must
possess a Type 1 Federal Firearms License as well as a type 3 (Often
confused with class 3) SOT (Special Occupation Tax) to sell if you're a
gun dealer (private sellers do not need a FFL to sell an individual item
that they legally own), and an ATF Form 4 with \$200 tax stamp to
purchase. This makes it ***expensive*** to qualify a person to purchase
an automatic weapon.

In addition, no new automatic weapons can be registered for private
ownership that have been manufactured since 19 May 1986, so fully
automatic weapons are ***very expensive,*** upwards of \$10,000 and
more.

But to answer the question, only that list of states above prohibits
automatic weapons, but most states allow them when their owners are in
compliance with Federal regulations.
