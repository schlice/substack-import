Have you ever thought about what it takes to join a gang? You gotta do
some pretty bad stuff to become a gang member. And if you *break* *the
rules* of the gang, you don't get a "stern talking-to." You get beaten,
usually within inches of your life.

So why would anyone in their right mind join a gang?

Because people want **rules**. They want **stability**. They want that
sense of **belonging.** They want **purpose** in life beyond eat, sleep,
and make babies.

Can you get that without a gang? If you're self-motivated. Not everyone
is. Some people simply require extrinsic motivation.

So why bring all this up?

Without religion, there are no rules, because **religion provides
morality.** Humans cannot have morality without religion. Even atheists
must borrow from religion in order to feign morality, because without
religion, there is no authority higher than humans which can be the
arbiter of moral standards. No one man is better than any other, and so
moral standards are individualized. In other words, without religion,
humanity is *self-referential.* Everything becomes "I do exactly what I
feel like doing, and I do it because I feel like doing it because it
helps me to eat, sleep, and make babies. It's all about me."

And predictably, right about now, the atheists are scrambling to hit the
"Comment" button because they can absolutely be moral without religion.
To which I say: *Poppycock*. *Bollocks*. *Mularkey.* If you say you can
have morals without religion, *whose* morals will you listen to? And
why? Will it be the moral standards of the person you *elect?* What
happens when you elect a new person with a new set of morals? Who says
you don't end up with *The Purge* in real life? If you can make the
rules, you can change the rules. Ultimately, every little society will
have its own set of morals because, lest I repeat myself, society
without religion is self-referential. Anyone claiming you can have moral
standards which apply to all people must borrow from religion (which
actually has a higher moral authority than humans) in order to do so,
full stop.

So would the world be a better place without religion? Decidedly not.
People need a moral standard outside of and greater than themselves upon
which to pattern their lives.
