**If a national emergency lets the President take funds from other
government programs for something, can he take funds from investigations
into him?**

The National Emergencies Act allows the President to activate any one of
about 130 specific provisions of Federal law by declaring a national
emergency.

Stopping investigations is not one of those provisions.
