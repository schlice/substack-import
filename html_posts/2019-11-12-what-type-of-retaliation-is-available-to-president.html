**What type of retaliation is available to President Donald Trump
against the U. S. House of Representatives if it passes Articles of
Impeachment against him?**

The best retaliation of all:

- Being found not guilty in the Senate trial, allowing him to stay in
  office
- Winning re-election in 2020

This effectively makes the impeachment pointless, other than to add
another footnote to history.

But already, based on the partisan nature of this investigation, the
Democrats have already tarnished impeachment, turning it into a
political weapon instead of a tool reserved only for the most egregious
presidential conduct. For lack of a better term, they have sullied the
good name of impeachment.
