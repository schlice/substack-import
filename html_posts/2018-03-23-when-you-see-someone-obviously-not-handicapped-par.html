The issue is not someone who is "obviously not handicapped" because it's
not your place to judge. Period.

The issue is someone parking in a handicapped space without a permit.
You notify the store that there are cars parked in handicapped spots
without a tag. And you let the store handle it.

Then you go on with your life and you don't worry about things that do
not concern you.

Just repeat to yourself over and over, "Not my monkey, not my circus."
