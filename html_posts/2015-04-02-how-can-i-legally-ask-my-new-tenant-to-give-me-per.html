**Content:** [You can ask your tenant anything.\
\
If this will be really convenient for you and save you money, you might
consider *incentivizing* such a transaction for the tenant (if you
switch to automatic withdrawals, I\'ll knock \$10/month off your rent).\
\
There are a bazillion tools on the internet to do this. Heck, even
PayPal allows you to set up automatic recurring
payments.]{.rendered_qtext}
