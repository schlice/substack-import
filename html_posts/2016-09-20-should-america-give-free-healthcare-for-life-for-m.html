Our military does a job that few understand, and even fewer would
volunteer to do. We owe more to our veterans than we could ever repay.
And let's understand something else: their healthcare is not free. They
paid for it in sweat equity for 20 years. Should they do it? Absolutely.
For more reasons than you can count.

That said, the process they have in place currently is exactly what they
should have, no more, no less.

The actual post-retirement benefits programs are maintained by the
Veteran's Administration, not by the military service. The service only
runs healthcare while the member is active.

If you served honorably for 20 years, you and your dependents can remain
in the military healthcare system for the remainder of your life. This
is a **benefit** afforded to military members, and an incentive to
complete a career as a military member.

If you served for fewer than 20 years, you do not get healthcare for
life, unless you were disabled during military service with a disability
rating of at least 30%, with a condition directly related to your
military service (also known as a *service-connected disability*). If
this is the case, any healthcare needed to manage your disability is
covered by the veteran's healthcare system so long as you maintain that
rating (some conditions can improve, particularly mental health).

All gave some, some gave all.
