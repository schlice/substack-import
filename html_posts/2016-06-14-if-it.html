Under federal law, it is illegal to possess, receive, distribute, or
access with the intent to view, child pornography. The thought on the
viewing clause is that by viewing the content, you are becoming the
consumer, which fuels the demand for the creation of content, and they
want to stop the creation of content. By cutting off the consumer, you
reduce the demand.

It is true that both acts being videoed are illegal. Sex with a child is
illegal. Killing people is illegal. Again, the thought behind the
viewing clause is to try to stem the flow of child porn by making it
illegal to consume it.

Since the ISIS videos are not created for the purpose of selling videos,
preventing people from watching them would not reduce the desire for
ISIS to create them. They will continue creating the videos, or if the
videos become wildly unpopular, they will just continue beheadings
without distributing the recordings. For them, the beheadings are the
goal; the videos spread the propaganda. For the producer of child porn,
if his market dries up, he's out of business. You can't stem the flow of
ISIS by making their videos illegal.
