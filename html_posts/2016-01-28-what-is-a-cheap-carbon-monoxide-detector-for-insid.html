They may exist, but ***you don\'t need one.***

Unlike your home, your car is never completely sealed (well technically,
your home is not completely sealed either, but it\'s sealed better than
your car). Have you noticed that when a car hits the water, it
immediately starts to fill up on the inside? If the passenger
compartment was completely sealed, you\'d stay in an airtight bubble
until you either ran out of air, or you opened the bubble. However, this
never happens. This is because passenger compartments in cars are not
airtight. There is always airflow through your car.

Besides, the entire volume of air in the passenger compartment can be
completely replaced in a matter of seconds by merely opening the window.

So, with that said, two suggestions:

1.  The climate control system has an \"off\" position. *I suggest you*
    ***never*** *use it*, ever. Even if you are cold and the car hasn\'t
    warmed up yet, leave the fan on its lowest position. Put it on the
    floor vents, or the defroster, but don\'t turn it off. This will
    help to keep air circulating through the car, and if you do this one
    thing, I can guarantee you will never suffer any ill effects of
    carbon monoxide in your car\'s cabin. You would literally have to
    run the exhaust directly into the cabin to suffer any ill effects
    with the fan on.
2.  Crack the window every once in a while. Have a sunroof? Open it! If
    it\'s a nice day, I\'d suggest you do that too. Even when I have the
    windows open, I still always have the fan on, at least at its lowest
    setting.
