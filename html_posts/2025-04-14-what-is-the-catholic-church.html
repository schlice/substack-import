The Catholic Church encourages believers to confess sins of thought.
Impure thoughts are a common category of sin heard in confessionals.

Catholics believe that we sin "in our thoughts and in our words, in what
we have done, and what we have failed to do." They are not wrong in
this; our minds are indeed sinful, and we sin in our thoughts. In fact,
they ask for forgiveness from those sins of the mind at the beginning of
every mass.

So yes, the Catholic Church does encourage their adherents to confess
sins in the mind.
