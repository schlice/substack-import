Look, I get where you're going.

You are arguing that the best way to prevent COVID is to give it to
everyone. They either gain natural immunity, or they die. It's just
natural selection! The people with the comorbidities will all die at sea
(since while there are medical facilities on the ships, there are not
nearly enough, and they are not nearly advanced enough, to provide ICUs
for any significant population of the ship), and all the healthy people
will catch COVID and recover.

So you're left with a ship on which you kill 1/3 of your shipboard
population, and the rest come back immune!

Of course, in order to do this, you must be a terrible person to begin
with. Because you have to begin from a position of ***moral
superiority*** because you are vaccinated and they are not.

This, by the way, is not your fault. The government taught this to you.
The government politicized the virus. The government politicized the
vaccine. And for the trifecta of abuse, the government disingenuously
pushes the vaccine over all other therapeutics, treatments, or natural
immunity.

So you can't really be blamed for listening to the President and doing
what he says. it's really his fault, not yours. You are simply too
weak-willed to recognize that you've been lied to all this time.

It's just sad that you have to come on to a platform like this and
display your moral ambiguity for everyone.

**TL;DR: When you admit, on an open social media platform, that you're
willing to kill people because they're not vaccinated, you're a bad
person.**

Original question:

In a theoretical world could we offer a free three week cruise to all
the unvaccinated and end the pandemic? The sick ones wouldn\'t clog our
ERs, they would all get Covid, natural immunity, or die. They get a
trip, NO rights abused, no complaints.
