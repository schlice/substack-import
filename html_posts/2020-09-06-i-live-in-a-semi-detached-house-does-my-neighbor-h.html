**I live in a semi-detached house. Does my neighbor have rights to
replace part of my roof without my permission?**

The answer is dependent on who owns the house.

If you are co-owners with your neighbor, then the roofer will have to
determine which repairs belong to you, which repairs belong to your
neighbors, and which repairs are common. Then you pay for your repairs
and part of the common repairs, and your neighbor pays the same.

If you are not the owner, then it is the owner who determines what gets
repaired and when, and you have no say in the matter.
