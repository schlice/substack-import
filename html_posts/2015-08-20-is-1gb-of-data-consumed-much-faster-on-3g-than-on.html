**Content:** [There are so many varieties of 3G service around the
world, but in general, you\'re talking about data rates on the order of
400 Kbps to 4 Mbps, on average. Your mileage may vary, as this is
variable by carrier, handset manufacturer, signal strength, etc. 4G
signals (LTE) come a little closer, with some cellular networks getting
40Mbps down and around 19Mbps up.\
\
WiFi connections also vary depending on signal strength, handset
manufacturer, access point manufacturer, etc. But in general, WiFi data
rates are as follows:\
\
802.11b: 11Mbps\
802.11g: 54Mbps\
802.11n: 300-450Mbps\
\
Most phones today connect comfortably to G networks. Not as many connect
to N networks, and even those that do only have a single receiving
antenna (so they\'re stuck at the lower number).\
\
So the answer is no, you would absolutely consume data faster on WiFi
than on 3G.\
\
The good news is that most US-based cellular carriers do not count your
data usage when you use your own WiFi connection. They only count your
data usage when you use the cellular (3G or 4G) network. So not only is
WiFi faster, it\'s free (usually - check with your carrier on
this).]{.rendered_qtext}
