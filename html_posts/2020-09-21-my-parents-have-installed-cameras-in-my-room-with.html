**My parents have installed cameras in my room with video and 2-way
audio, WiFi controlled, specifically Night Owl brand that can be viewed
remotely. How can I stop them from watching me?**

Cover the camera. Place a picture in front of it. Disconnect it from
power. Buy yourself a Wi-Fi jammer. There are any number of ways to stop
them from watching you.

But those ways of stopping them will have to come with a discussion,
because they will insist on turning that camera back on. If they insist
on this kind of behavior, you can tell them that on your 18th birthday,
your present to them will be to move out of their house and never ever
speak to them again. If they can't trust you in your room, they clearly
are disinterested in any ongoing relationship with you.

Now, maybe you have lost their trust. Maybe you did something that
caused them to question your trustworthiness, and it probably had
something to do with what you were doing in your room. Maybe their
reaction is on par with your trust-breaking, maybe it wasn't. This is
only something that they can answer.

However, you can still present the same ultimatum: you resent living
like this, and you will get out of that situation at the very first
second you are able, and you will vanish from ther lives. Maybe they're
okay with that, maybe they're not. So make sure as soon as you legally
can, get a job and start saving money so that you can move out when you
turn 18. Then finish high school and get on with your life.

Or, if they don't want to lose you when you turn 18, sit down and have a
conversation with them about how you can establish some privacy in your
house while you still allow them to make sure you aren't doing the bad
things you did to break their trust in the first place. It's called
communication, and it's not easy. But you'll have to do it.
