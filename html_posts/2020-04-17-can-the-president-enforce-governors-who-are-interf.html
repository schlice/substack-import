**Can the President enforce governors who are interfering in the
Interstate Commerce Clause of the Constitution to reopen certain
industries in their state?**

The Commerce Clause does not force states to do business with other
states. The Commerce Clause does not force anyone to do business with
any other state.

The President does not enforce the Commerce Clause.

The President has no authority over governors.

The Commerce Clause simply says that Congress has the power to regulate
commerce between the states.

I know that many Supreme Court rulings over the years sorta blurred the
lines on the Commerce Clause, even going so far as to give Congress the
authority to force people to engage in commerce or face fines (see the
Affordable Care Act).

But even so, none of this gives any powers to the President to either
regulate interstate commerce, or force anyone (business or otherwise) to
engage in commerce.

The only exception to this is the Defense Production Act, which allows
the president to "require businesses to accept and prioritize contracts
for materials deemed necessary for national defense, regardless of a
loss incurred on business (it is unclear what would occur if business
refuses or is unable to complete request on
time)."[\[1\]](#hPbli){#cite-hPbli .citation_link}
