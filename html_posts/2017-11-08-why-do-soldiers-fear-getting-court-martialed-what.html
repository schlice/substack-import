Court martial is just like trial in civilian courts. Some of the
punishments available to the judge in a court martial:

- Demotion. This is loss of rank, which equates to loss of pay. You are
  paid based on your rank.
- Confinement. That means jail, but you get sent to a lovely facility in
  Leavenworth, Kansas, where they still spend their days turning big
  rocks into little rocks. If the crime is severe enough, you can be
  sentenced to death.
- Garnishment. While you're in confinement, you're still in the
  military, earning a paycheck. Your wages will be garnished during that
  time, which means you'll be paid, but the military will keep much of
  your paycheck.
- Discharge. Once your prison sentence is over (if you got one), you can
  be discharged from the military. The characterizations of military
  discharges are
  - Honorable
  - General (under honorable conditions)
  - Under Other than Honorable Conditions (UOTHC)
  - Bad Conduct
  - Dishonorable

The first three are given during non-judicial proceedings (i.e. not in a
court-martial). The last two are given as the result of a court-martial.

Dishonorable discharges from the military are extremely rare. It's like
being a convicted felon from the U.S. court system. Dishonorable
discharges must be reported to the US legal system for inclusion in the
National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) and you won't
be able to purchase a firearm again. You'll also have a difficult time
buying anything of value (house, car, etc), getting a loan, leasing an
apartment, getting a job, etc.

Interestingly, Bad Conduct Discharges (BCDs) do not have to be reported
into the US legal system for inclusion in NICS. This is why the Texas
church shooter was able to legally buy a gun: he received a BCD from the
military, not a dishonorable discharge. This has to do with the
differences between the standards of proof and the presumption of
innocence between the two systems (the military and civilian legal
systems).
