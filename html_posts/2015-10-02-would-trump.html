**Content:** [Trump says, \"Mexico continues to make billions on not
only our bad trade deals but also relies heavily on the billions of
dollars in remittances sent from illegal immigrants in the United States
back to Mexico (\$22 billion in [[2013
alone](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=ed5ebd&url=http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/news/2014/08/02/remittances-to-mexico-up-73-pct-in-1st-half-2014/){.external_link

wall and, until they do, the United States will, among other things:
impound all remittance payments derived from illegal wages.\"\
\
The \"among other things\" part will become very important, because
impounding remittance payments from illegal wages continues to get
harder and harder as more illegal payments are sent via untraceable
Bitcoin payments. There are even services that allow payments via
Bitcoin to be paid out at Mexican ATMs, and the recipient is paid in
pesos. \[1\]\
\
I only find the plan dubious because while Trump claims that \$22
billion is the amount of remittances back to Mexico from illegal
immigrants, that figure is incorrect. \$22 billion is *all* remittances
from the US to Mexico, not just from illegal workers.\
\
And it is *pittance* when compared to the reported \$64 billion that
Mexico\'s drug cartels make in the drug trade to the US alone.\[2\]\
\
If the wall stops that money, there\'s no way Mexico would contribute
anything to help cut off their own money. Fine, lose the portion of the
\$22 billion that comes from illegals (even if it\'s fully 2/3 of that,
which it\'s not, but estimate \$15 billion), as long as their drug trade
routes remain open, go for it.\
