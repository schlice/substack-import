**How will the Supreme Court rule on releasing President Trump\'s tax
returns after having ten days to review the cases?**

The short answer is that we still don't know.

What we do know: as of today (18 Nov), SCOTUS has issued a temporary
stay order which prevents the lower court ruling from going into effect
until the high court has the opportunity to decide whether or not they
will hear the case. The justices are scheduled to have a meeting Friday
regarding the case.
