**Content:** [It depends a lot on jurisdiction, but most states have
some form of [[castle
doctrine](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=577621&url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castle_doctrine){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}. The \"castle doctrine\"
is termed from the old saying, \"a man\'s home is his castle,\" meaning
that a resident should feel ultimately safe and secure within the
confines of his home. And he should feel utterly justified in defending
his home with force against those who wish to do him harm, up to and
including deadly force.\
\
You will need to research the laws in your particular jurisdiction
concerning whether or not your home is in an area where a castle
doctrine is enforced.\
\
There have been occasions where the police have entered the wrong house.
The intersection of \"no-knock warrants\" and the \"castle doctrine\" is
a very violent intersection, to be sure. Assuming it\'s not a \"no-knock
warrant,\" the police will be very vocal in announcing who they are and
the fact that they have a search warrant, as they bash through your
front door.]{.rendered_qtext}
