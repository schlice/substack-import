> *Why do police officers and firefighters need to do fund-raising*

Short answer: they don't.

You asked why the need to do fundraising. They don't **need** to do
fundraising. They **want** to do fundraising.

The money they raise does not go to their operating budget. It doesn't
buy trucks, hoses, boots, air tanks, cars, uniforms, or ballistic vests.
The fundraising that police and firefighters do go to projects that are
important to them.

Famously, firefighters do a [[**Fill The
Boot**](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=afbe49&url=https://www.mda.org/get-involved/fill-the-boot){.external_link

qt-tooltip="mda.org"}]{.qlink_container} campaign to raise money for the
Muscular Dystrophy Association (MDA).

The most common fundraiser conducted by police agencies are fundraisers
designed to provide money to families of officers killed in the line of
duty. These are not as spirited or as widespread as the Fill The Boot
campaign, but again, they do not go into the operating budgets of the
departments. Tax dollars fund their operations.
