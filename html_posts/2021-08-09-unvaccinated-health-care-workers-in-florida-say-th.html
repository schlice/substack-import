Of course they do. And unvaccinated health care workers should not be
required to be vaccinated.

**However, the hospital does not have to keep unvaccinated health care
workers in direct contact with patients.**

The hospital can reassign unvaccinated personnel to desk jobs in
offices, away from patients.

And if the hospital does not have a suitable position to relocate the
unvaccinated, they may be forced to terminate them.

Alternatively, the hospital can divide their ER and their ICU into
locations for "vaccinated" and "unvaccinated" patients, if they have the
capacity to do so. Then they can leave all the unvaccinated health care
workers to deal only with vaccinated patients. But most hospitals don't
have the capacity to split their ER and ICU like this; it's just not
practical.

Original question:

Unvaccinated health care workers in Florida say that mandating the
COVID-19 vaccine violates their rights. But don\'t patients, many of
whom already have serious underlying health issues, have the right to
receive care in a safe environment?
