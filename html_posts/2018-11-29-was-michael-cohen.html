**Is Michael Cohen\'s guilty plea about lying to Congress concerning
Trump\'s Russia involvements in 2016 a game changer?**

By itself, it is not.

Remember, this is a crime which happened because the Special Prosecutor
was established. It's not a crime that occurred *before* the creation of
the Special Prosecutor.

But Mueller is not really directly going after Cohen because he lied to
Congress. Of course, he's prosecuting that crime, but that's not what
he's after.

He's trying to build a case.

He's trying to establish that very tenuous link between Trump and the
Russians in the run-up to the election.

Trump did have a plan to build a Trump Tower in Moscow in 2016. Those
plans were scuttled before the Iowa caucus. Michael Cohen lied to
Congress about his involvement with those plans.

We can see that Mueller is beginning to create a narrative through his
investigation and through the ancillary charges he is filing.

But was this particular charge a *game-changer?*

Most definitely not.
