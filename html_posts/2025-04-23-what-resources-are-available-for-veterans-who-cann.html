I'm glad you asked, [[Quora Prompt
Generator](https://www.quora.com/profile/Quora-Prompt-Generator)]{.qlink_container}!
Normally, I strenuously object to answering questions from the QPG
because its questions violate Quora's own Terms of Service, but that's a
topic for another discussion.

Being a veteran myself (and a 100% disabled veteran at that), I am
intimately interested in this topic, so in just this one instance, I
will make an exception.

Several programs can help veterans afford homes, primarily through loans
and grants. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) offers various loan
programs with favorable terms, including no down payment requirements
and potentially lower interest rates. In fact, I have used my VA loan
benefit each time I have purchased a home, and it is a great benefit. In
most cases, VA loans get more favorable rates, and while you technically
*can* buy a house with 0% down, I've only done that once, for my very
first home purchase. Grants and down payment assistance from
organizations like Soldier Next Door can also help with homeownership.

Additionally, programs like the HUD-VASH program provide rental
assistance and supportive services for homeless veterans.

Let's just list out a few of the programs available for veterans to help
them buy a home:

1\. VA Loans:
