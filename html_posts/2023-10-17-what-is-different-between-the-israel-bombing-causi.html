Intended targets.

Israel's actions were against ***legitimate military targets*** but they
caused *collateral damage.* This is **perfectly legal under the Geneva
Convention**. We certainly do everything in our power to minimize
collateral damage, but we cannot entirely prevent it.

Hamas' actions were against ***illegitimate non-military targets.***
This is specifically outlawed by the Geneva Convention.

"Human shields" are a misnomer. When the enemy conducts military
operations from a non-military location, that non-military location
**becomes a lawful military target,** along with everyone inside of it.
This is the enemy's concern, not ours. If the enemy does not want us to
target their civilians, they should not turn their civilians into lawful
military targets.

While our enemy may not follow the internationally accepted practices of
war, we still do. Thus, we can say that we were waging legitimate war
while our enemy was acting as a terrorist, provoking retaliatory action.

The difference becomes how our actions are perceived on the world stage.
When we act in accordance with the accepted practices in war, our
actions are considered to be *legitimate* to the world. When we violate
the accepted practices of waging war, our actions are considered to be
*illegitimate* and we are considered to be the aggressor and not the
victim.
