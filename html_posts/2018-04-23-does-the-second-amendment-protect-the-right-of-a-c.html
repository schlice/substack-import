**Does the Second Amendment protect the right of a convicted criminal
after they are released, or are they considered to have surrendered that
right?**

The Second Amendment doesn't say anything about convicted criminals.
Therefore, the Constitution leaves the details to the law and to the
courts.

Federal law says that convicted felons who lose certain civil rights
(such as the right to vote and the right to hold public office) also
lose the right to purchase and own a gun.

State law is where the whole thing gets turned on its head. And all
states are different. Some states allow non-violent felons to keep
firearms. Some only follow federal law. And some states allow rights to
be restored after a felon has served time.

In the states that allow rights to be restored, if the state restores
all rights (i.e. voting rights, serve on juries, gun rights, etc), then
the federal ban is no longer applicable. However, if the state only
restores gun rights but not other civil rights, then the federal ban
remains in effect, and possession of a gun is still a federal offense.
