**Content:** [Certainly, any graphic video could cause persons to
experience emotional trauma.\
\
However, these videos should not be *blocked;* they should be
*flagged*.\
\
YouTube should put a disclaimer on the video which states that the
following video is graphic and may contain scenes which might be
disturbing to some viewers; viewer discretion is advised.\
\
There is way too much content for YouTube to review before it is
released to the public, so it is up to us to assist. If you find a
graphic video which is not flagged, then flag it.\
