**Do homeowner associations make us trust our neighbors more or less
these days?**

I don't think they have much effect on whether or not we trust our
neighbors.

HOAs do acknowledge the fact that everyone has the right to do with
their homes whatever they choose, but the choices that they make could
have adverse effects on their neighbors (particularly, their home
values), and their neighbors may not like that.

HOAs give homeowners the comfort of knowing that if their neighbors do
something stupid like paint their houses bright pink, they have some
recourse to salvage their home values.
