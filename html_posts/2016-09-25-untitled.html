"we"

There is no "we." In that voting booth, there is only "you." And to me,
it sounds like "you" hold him to a higher standard than "I" do. I accept
that he is a good person, with flaws. I also accept that Hillary can't
open her mouth without a lie coming out, and she is far more dangerous
to the future of this nation than Trump.

But that's just me. "You" likely have different standards.

There is no "we."
