**Is it illegal for an HOA to peek through your garage windows?**

You need to review your Governing Documents, as despite what others have
said, the rules apply equally to renters and homeowners. Who is
responsible for paying for repairs may vary between renters and
homeowners, but renters are bound by the same rules of conduct as
homeowners. Additionally, HOAs can address both tenants and homeowners
separately; there is no requirement for HOAs to only address homeowners
and not tenants. If your HOA does not have a website where your
governing docs are posted, you will probably need to contact the
Managing Agent of your HOA in order to get copies.

The HOA may have a rule which allows them to inspect parking spaces
(i.e. garages) to ensure you can park a car in them. Typically, HOA
rules will stipulate that garages are for cars, especially if they have
rules about outdoor parking (in a driveway or on a street). Accordingly,
if you are using your garage for not-cars, and your driveway for cars,
the HOA can consider that a violation.

In most cases, HOAs have broad authority over everything within the
areas where they have purview. However, rules for HOAs vary wildly
between states, and even between cities in a state. Additionally, while
cities write ordinances granting broad authority to HOAs, this is
generally balanced by courts and judges who limit HOAs to the most
narrow interpretation of city ordinances imaginable. Also, judges know
the difference between rules (which are written and approved by the HOA
Board of Directors) and covenants (which are voted on by a plurality of
homeowners), and they hold covenants to a much higher regard than rules.

If there is no rule stipulating what can and cannot be done inside of a
garage, I would suggest talking to a real estate attorney in your area
who specializes in HOA law. You may have a case.
