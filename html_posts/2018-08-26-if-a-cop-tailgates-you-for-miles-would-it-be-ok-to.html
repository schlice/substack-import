**If a cop tailgates you for miles, would it be OK to slam on your
brakes?**

Better idea: *do the speed limit, or even five to ten miles an hour
below the speed limit.*

You probably know that when most people drive, they drive five to ten
miles an hours above the posted speed limit. For various reasons, you
probably won't be stopped if you do five over, so most people do.

The proper procedure in the US when someone is tailgating you is to put
additional space between you and the car in front of you. This allows
you extra reaction time to slow down gradually.

However, what if, instead of just leaving more space in front of you,
you instead drove the speed limit? Or drove five to ten miles an hour
below the speed limit? The person behind you would be so annoyed that
they'd probably go around you. They'd probably get so pissed that they'd
find any way they could to go around you.
