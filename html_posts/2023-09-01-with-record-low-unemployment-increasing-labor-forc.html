This is one of those times where the Mark Twain quote is absolutely
true: "There are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies, and
statistics."

**"Record low unemployment"**

We don't have "record low unemployment." We have a "record low
unemployment **rate.**" There is indeed a difference.

The unemployment rate is the percentage of people in the labor force who
are not working but are actively looking for work. The current
unemployment rate in the United States is 3.5%, which is not much
different from the rate in 2022. This is the lowest rate in the last 50
years. The number of unemployed people in July was 5.8 million.

The rate has varied from as low as 1% during World War I to as high as
25% during the Great Depression. The highest rate was 24.7% in 1933. The
rate reached 10.8% in November 1982 and 14.7% in April 2020. The current
rate is not dramatically different from the rates in 2022.

But "having a low unemployment rate" does not mean that all those people
who are not looking for jobs have found them or are employed. It means
that many people have stopped looking for work, for one reason or
another. It does not mean that they are working.

**"Increasing labor force participation"**

This is not only a misunderstanding (like the first one), but it's also
wrong. The labor force participation rate is the percentage of the
population that is either working or actively looking for work, and it
goes hand in hand with the unemployment rate. It is calculated by
dividing the number of people ages 16 and older who are employed or
actively seeking employment by the total non-institutionalized, civilian
working-age population.

The US labor force participation rate is currently 62.60%, which is
lower than the long term average of 62.84%. The rate increased to 63.1%
in July 2023, compared to 62.9% in the previous month. So *at best,* if
we are going to be generous, we'd say that the labor force participation
rate is roughly holding steady, but in actual analysis, we see that the
rate is declining.

The decline in the labor force participation rate is primarily due to
the aging population and other structural factors. It could also signify
that fewer people of working age are looking for employment, **which we
mentioned when we discussed the unemployment rate.** The matching
statistic lends credence to the fact that the numbers are the way they
are because **fewer working age people are actively looking for work.**
Remember that none of this tells us why fewer people are actively
looking for work. It could be that they have found jobs, and it could be
because they have given up on finding gainful employment. It could also
be that they are satisfied receiving government subsidies, but that's a
discussion for another day. Also telling that the labor force
participation rate for the subset of people ages 25 to 54 (the largest
group of employed persons) has returned to its pre-pandemic level. So
*at best*, it's no better than it was in 2020, and the numbers before
then were all Trump.

**"Sustained wage growth"**

From the Bureau of Labor Statistics:

> Compensation costs for private industry workers increased 4.5 percent
> over the year. In June 2022, the increase was 5.5 percent. Wages and
> salaries increased 4.6 percent for the 12-month period ending in June
> 2023 and increased 5.7 percent in June 2022. The cost of benefits
> increased 3.9 percent for the 12-month period ending in June 2023 and
> increased 5.3 percent in June 2022. Inflation-adjusted (constant
> dollar) compensation costs for private industry increased 1.5 percent
> for the 12- month period ending in June 2023. Inflation-adjusted wages
> and salaries increased 1.7 percent for the 12 months ending June 2023.
> Inflation-adjusted benefit costs in the private sector increased 0.9
> percent over that same period. [\[1\]](#AxUTW){#cite-AxUTW

If the increase last year was 5.5%, but the increase this year is only
4.5%, then wages are not growing as fast as they were last year. They
are growing (so saying "sustained wage growth" is not technically a
lie), but certainly not at the same rate. In fact, wage growth has
significantly cooled since last year:

More importantly, if we have an increasing rate of inflation, we should
have an increasing compensation rate to match. But while the rate of
inflation is increasing, the rate of wage and salary increase is
decreasing. In other words, salaries are not increasing at the same rate
or close to what day to day costs are.

So with all of our numbers disambiguated, you answer the question. Does
Biden need to fulfill his campaign promise that he's going to give
everyone who signed up for a student loan a free pass to renege on their
obligation?

You bet he does.

Because if he can't do that, if he can't rely on those three numbers,
the only other numbers he really has to face are:

- a stagnating economy (GDP growth of less than 2--3% is considered
  stagnating, currently at 2.1%, the U.S. GDP growth rate for 2021 was
  5.95%),
- rising interest rates and even faster rising inflation (APR increased
  from 2.96% in 2021 to 5.34% in 2022, currently 7.55%)
- real prices for real goods and services skyrocketing, affecting
  everyday citizens (read: voters) daily, coupled with wages that are
  not growing as fast as prices, and
- post-pandemic paused student loan payments restarting,

all while he's trying to run a presidential re-election campaign.

He needs something to hang his campaign on, and bashing Republicans only
goes so far when the buck stops with you.
