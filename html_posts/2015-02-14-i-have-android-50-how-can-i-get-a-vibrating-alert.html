**Content:** [You would like your phone to automatically switch profiles
based on time.\
\
I would absolutely wholeheartedly endorse [[Sound
Profile.](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=75def8&url=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id%3DOrion.Soft){.external_link

qt-tooltip="google.com"}]{.qlink_container} It is a fantastic app that
allows you to customize your sound profiles and then kick them off by
time. The Pro version extends the number of profiles you can have and
adds some neat other features, like using location services to kick off
profiles (i.e. mute your phone when you arrive at work, unmute when you
leave, etc).\
\
I have gone so far as to schedule my church time and my other regularly
scheduled meeting times so I never have to set my phone to vibrate at
those times; the scheduler does it for me.]{.rendered_qtext}
