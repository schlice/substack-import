is, sadly, spot on.

It\'s not the fact that it\'s a misdemeanor. It is what the offense says
about your character. And despite what the media would lead you to
believe, police departments look for candidates of exceptional character
and candidates who possess a moral compass.

I would think such an offense would be a serious impediment to getting
hired as a police officer.

That said, candidates are in short supply these days (courtesy of the
good folks over at Black Lives Matter), so who knows, maybe your
department might overlook such a transgression if you could show you had
a stellar record since then.

It will likely be an uphill climb, the odds are definitely not in your
favor, but there is still a chance. You should definitely apply until
you are told no by the department. Don\'t conceal it. Be up front about
it, show how you have changed since then, and maybe you\'ll have a shot.
No guarantees, but a shot nonetheless.
