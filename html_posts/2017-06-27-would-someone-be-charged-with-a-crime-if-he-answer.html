Most definitely. In every jurisdiction I know of, *where you are* makes
very little difference. If you expose yourself, intentionally or
otherwise, you have committed the offense of *indecent exposure*, or
whatever it may be called in your jurisdiction. You get arrested and
charged, and you are placed on the sex offender registry. If a child is
involved (like the Girl Scout in your example), you are also charged
with *corrupting a minor* or *contributing to the delinquency of a
minor,* again depending on jurisdiction, and you are labeled as an adult
sex offender who offended against a child, and you'll be lucky to make
it out of prison alive, or in one piece. Prisoners don't like
pedophiles.

The only difference would be if you are in a location in which nudity is
*expected* and *forewarned*, like in a locker room, or at a nude beach.
