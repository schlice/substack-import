**Can you sue the city for damage to your vehicle caused by a pothole in
the road?**

Indeed, you can sue the city, but there are some relatively steep legal
challenges you must overcome before you will get any money.

First, you'll have to prove that the city was negligent. Just because a
pothole exists doesn't mean that the city was negligent in its duty to
fill it. Was the pothole reported to the city? How long have they known
about the hole? What are their standard timeframes for filling holes
after someone notifies them of its presence? If a pothole has been
reported to the city and was known about for months, and then it damages
a car, I think it's fairly clear that the city might be negligent. But
if a pothole is reported at noon and a car hits that pothole at 1 pm, it
would be much tougher to claim that the city was negligent.

Second is the set of rules that each city has for filing lawsuits.
Generally, you have a very short period of time to notify the state
agency, and another short period of time to file a lawsuit. If you
exceed those timeframes (sometimes in some states and cities as short as
30 days), you cannot bring an action against the city.

Finally, you have to think about comparative negligence. In a negligence
lawsuit, under comparative negligence laws in most states, the defendant
will also try to show that the plaintiff was negligent. Could you have
avoided the pothole? If you knew of its existence, did you report it to
the city yourself, or did you assume that "someone else" would take care
of it? Could you have taken another route? Was the pothole large enough
that you should have been able to see it and should have been able to
easily avoid it? If you as the plaintiff are also found to be negligent,
any amount you receive will be reduced by the percentage of your own
negligence. For example, if you were found to be 30% at fault in the
accident, your award would be reduced by the 30% which was your fault.
