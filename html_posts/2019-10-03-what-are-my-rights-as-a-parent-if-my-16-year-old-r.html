**What are my rights as a parent if my 16 year old refuses to take their
prescribed anti-seizure medication? They do not like the way it makes
them feel, but could do harm to themselves by not taking it.**

You rights as a parent are that you are responsible for your child's
healthcare until they turn 18. That means you have the responsibility to
do what is best for them, even if they refuse.

You may want to talk to the doctor about the side effects and see if
there are some interventions you can add to assist with "how it makes
them feel," but ultimately it will do them more harm to not take the
meds than to take them.

I fully understand how these medications make people feel (as I have
felt it myself), but it's important to understand that these medicines
are the lesser of two evils, and it's definitely something that you as a
parent must do.
