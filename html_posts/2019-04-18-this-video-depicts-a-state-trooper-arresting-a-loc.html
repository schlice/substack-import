**This video depicts a state trooper arresting a local cop after
stopping him for doing 120 mph. How often does something like this
happen?**

Not very often

Florida statutes, as most state statutes, provide that emergency
vehicles are exempt from traffic regulations.

But they add two very unique provisions that allowed for this encounter
to be legal (emphasis mine):

> (b) The driver of a vehicle specified in paragraph (a), except when
> otherwise directed by a police officer, may:
>
> 1. Park or stand, irrespective of the provisions of this chapter;
>
> 2. Proceed past a red or stop signal or stop sign, but only after
> slowing down as may be necessary for safe operation;
>
> 3. Exceed the maximum speed limits **so long as the driver does not
> endanger life or property;**
>
> 4. Disregard regulations governing direction or movement or turning in
> specified directions, so long as the driver does not endanger life or
> property.
>
> (c) T**he foregoing provisions shall not relieve the driver of a
> vehicle specified in paragraph (a) from the duty to drive with due
> regard for the safety of all persons,** nor shall such provisions
> protect the driver from the consequences of his or her reckless
> disregard for the safety of others.[\[1\]](#ovgnJ){#cite-ovgnJ

Note that the vehicle specified in paragraph (a) of the statute is an
authorized emergency vehicle.

Therefore, she wasn't stopping him because he was speeding. She stopped
him because his driving endangered life or property, and he was not
driving with due regard for the safety of all persons.

The fact that she arrested him for this was indeed unusual. Normally,
her dashcam video would have been submitted to her chain of command and
reported back to his department for disciplinary action. The arrest was
a bit much. Professional courtesy clearly does not exist in Florida.
