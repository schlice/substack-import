Refugees are indeed not "illegal aliens."

Refugees are also humans. I almost feel like you're including "human"
because you think that "illegal alien" means "unlawful little green men
from space." Yes, they are human. They're people, just like you and me.

However, I, and so many others like me, understand the harsh reality.
That reality is that many people sneak into this country illegally. When
they are captured, they repeat the one word they know in English:
***asylum***. They claim that they are political refugees, fleeing the
bad conditions where they came from.

Here is where we find the problem. And it's not an immigrant problem,
but a government problem.

***The definition of asylum has changed over the years.***

Nowadays, you can claim asylum for virtually any reason, including
fleeing deplorable living conditions where you came from. News flash:
**that's what every immigrant is doing**. At this point, there is zero
difference between a *legal immigrant* and a person seeking *asylum*.
They just go through different processes to get here. Oh, and because
the person seeking asylum is **already here**, they get to stay. They
get released into the country to await their asylum hearing.

Can you see the injustice with that?

On top of that, many seeking asylum never return for their hearings.
They just disappear into the country. And we support them through our
tax dollars.

We have not only done a tremendous disservice to actual refugees, but
we've made the problem of illegal immigration that much worse.
