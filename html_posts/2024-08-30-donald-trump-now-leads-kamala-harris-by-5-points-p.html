Tracking the speed of the decline of the convention bump shows just how
much staying power she actually has.

And people are realizing that not only does she *not* have any new
policies, but she had **four years already in the White House to fix
them!** She's apparently running a campaign against herself, claiming
that she was not really part of the administration that got us where we
are right now. She's not offering anything unique. She's offering
Bidenomics 2.0, or *Bidenomics On Steroids*.

In other words, if you like how the economy has been doing over the last
four years, if you like paying more at the supermarket, if you like
paying more at the gas pump, if you like your paycheck not going as far
as it did four years ago, if you like the state of the southern border,
if you think the state of San Francisco is "pretty good," if you think
that the Democrat-led protests have been "mostly peaceful," then vote
for Harris, because she's going to *double down* on all of those
policies, and go even further.
