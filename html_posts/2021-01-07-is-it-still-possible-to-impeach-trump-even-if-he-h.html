**Is it still possible to impeach Trump even if he had a couple of weeks
left?**

It is possible, but it is highly unlikely.

The House has lost the bulk of its majority. It is a much narrower
majority that they hold now, much like the razor-thin Senate majority.
You only need one Independent in the Senate who believes that the
president should be censured instead of impeached and your whole plan
goes out the window.

But it would still send quite the message if Trump ends up as the only
twice-impeached president in history.

That, and his speech yesterday, will be his legacy.

Everyone knew Trump was reckless, and those who liked him liked him for
it. But sometimes, recklessness can be, you know, reckless. Sometimes,
that recklessness can get you into trouble.
