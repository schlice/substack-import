The biggest sign is that you\'re still alive.

God is well within his rights to strike any of us down at any time. We
are all sinners. We have all fallen short of God\'s grace.

But He has not done this.

The only reason can be that He\'s not done with you yet. He has more for
you to do.

He calls you, you repent, He saves you, and then He equips you to do the
works He has prepared for you. The Bible is very clear on this.

If you have been saved, then be ready, because He will be calling you to
serve. We don\'t know when or how, but we know He will. And it will be
amazing and it will enrich the Kingdom.

Praise God for that!
