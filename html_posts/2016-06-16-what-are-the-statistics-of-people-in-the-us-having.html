**Content:** [A2A\
\
It is *estimated* that there are between 1 and 2 million defensive gun
uses in the US each year.\
\
Why is it only *estimated*?\
\
Most of these defensive gun uses are **never reported**, because many of
them occur ***without a single shot being fired***. The mere
**presence** of a firearm turns a victim into an opponent, and many
criminals want to encounter victims, not opponents, so they turn tail
and run away.\
\
And even if they did report the incident to the police, how would *they*
track it? Departments track statistics differently, and some do not even
track \"non-crime\" incidents. For those that do, categorization is all
over the board. Statistics become unreliable.\
\
For that reason, it is nearly impossible to come up with useful,
reliable statistics about defensive gun uses in the United
States.]{.rendered_qtext}
