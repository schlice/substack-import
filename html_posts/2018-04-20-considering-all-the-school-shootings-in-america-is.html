**Considering all the school shootings in America, is the American
government fully bribed by the greedy NRA, incompetent, or both?**

In order for this comparison to be valid:

- School Shootings in America
- A fully bribed government, paid for by the "greedy NRA"

or

- School Shootings in America
- An incompetent government

you would have to show that there is a *relation* between the things you
are comparing. One must *relate* to the other in some meaningful way.
For example, an incompetent government would have to be the cause of
school shootings in America, or a government which was bribed by the
"greedy NRA" (your words) to look the other way on doing what's
necessary to stop school shootings (because we all know exactly what
needs to be done to stop school shootings; we're just not doing it).

Unfortunately in this case, there is no direct comparison to school
shootings and either action, or inaction, by the government.

So what we have here is a ***false comparison***. To wit, your question
cannot be answered.
