Indirectly.

They cannot just step in and cancel a sale, but in order to sell the
house, the HOA's balance sheet must be clean. If there are any
outstanding fines or fees that have been unpaid, those must be paid
before the deed can transfer. You need a certificate from the HOA that
the account is in good standing before the house can be sold.

And if the HOA has a *lien* on the house, the house can absolutely not
be sold until the lien is cleared and the HOA is paid what they are due.
And if there is a lien, then there are multiple fees, fines, late fees,
and attorney's fees which must be paid.
