Current CPR guidelines emphasize the chest compressions (OMG, you might
have to touch her BOOBIES!) over the breathing. Keeping the blood flow
through the brain is far more important.

Speaking of current procedures, anyone trained on the use of AEDs
(automated external defibrillator) knows that they include a pair of
forceps (big scissors). Any idea what that\'s for? Yep, you have to cut
her shirt and her bra off (well, specifically, cut them in half, up the
middle) to apply the contact electrodes. To answer your next question, a
woman died when a man was trying to maneuver the electrode under the
female victim\'s bra because he was afraid she would be embarrassed that
he had to cut it open. She\'s not embarassed, she\'s dead. Ask any woman
if she\'d rather be embarassed or dead and then decide if you will do
what needs to be done to save a life.
