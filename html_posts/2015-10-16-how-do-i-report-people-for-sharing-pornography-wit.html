You have to provide the usernames of these individuals to Kik Support.

To send a report about someone in Kik, you can do it from within the
chat itself:

- Open the chat with the user you want to report
- Tap their profile picture
- Tap your Menu button (usually three vertical dots)
- Tap Report.

If you don\'t have a chat with a person you wish to report, use this
form to [[submit a request for
assistance.](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=018ba2&url=https://kikinteractive.zendesk.com/anonymous_requests/new){.external_link
