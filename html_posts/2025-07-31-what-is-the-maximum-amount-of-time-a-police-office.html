The answer is **eternity** and a qualified **never**.

A police officer can stand in front of your house (on public property,
like the sidewalk) for as long as they please.

The amount of time they stand there has absolutely zero bearing on
whether they have the right to enter your property. They **never** have
the right to enter your property without your permission or against your
will **without one of two conditions¹** being met:

1.  They are holding a warrant giving them the right to enter your
    property.
2.  Exigent circumstances exist.

What are *exigent circumstances?* The legal definition of *exigent
circumstances* is "emergency situations where immediate action is needed
to prevent harm, destruction of evidence, or escape, justifying a
warrantless search or seizure. There are three conditions which can
trigger exigency:

- Someone is being harmed and cries out for help.
- Officers are aware of evidence of a crime which, if they needed to
  wait for a warrant before they enter, has a reasonable likelihood of
  being destroyed.
- Officers are aware of the presence of a wanted person in the property
  who, if they needed to wait for a warrant before they enter, has a
  reasonable likelihood of escape.

It is at least conceivable that an officer may be standing on the
sidewalk outside of your home waiting for a wanted person to exit, or
waiting to see if exigency will develop. Or maybe he submitted the
details to get an emergency warrant and he's just waiting for the judge
to approve the warrant before he enters.

¹ Anyone can reasonably enter the boundaries of your property and
approach your door and ring your doorbell to inquire about a matter that
they may be legally entitled to inquire about. This is called the
**implied invitation to do business at your front door.** For example,
UPS can enter your property to drop off a package. The Jehovah's
Witnesses can ring your doorbell to inquire about your relationship with
Jehovah. The fact that you have a clear path to your front door and a
doorbell is an "implied license" to enter your property. You can turn
them away, at which point they must vacate your property or they would
be considered trespassing. You have tacitly permitted this minor
incursion onto your property by having a front door and a doorbell.

This implied invitation is limited in scope. It generally permits a
visitor to approach the home via the front path, knock promptly, wait
briefly to be received, and then leave if not invited to stay longer.

You can revoke this implied invitation by posting "No Soliciting" signs
or "No Trespassing" signs (or by simply telling them to leave), and
failure to do so immediately may be considered trespassing and reported
to police.
