Oh, without a doubt, yes.

Jesus would have easily been maligned because he urged people to not
live the way they're living. He would have been labeled as a woman-hater
and desiring to turn women into "baby factories" because He would have
unequivocally said to not kill babies in the womb.

This would have offended many people, especially the entire LGBTQ+
crowd, the pro-choice crowd, the progressives, you know, the standard
faire for the Democratic Party of 2024. They would have said the same
thing to Jesus as they say to us: we're homophobic, we're bigoted, we
hate women, we want to keep women barefoot and pregnant in the kitchen,
etc.
