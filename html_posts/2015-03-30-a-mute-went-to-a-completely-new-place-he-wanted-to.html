**Content:** [Braille computer display.\
\
The mute will type a message on the computer using the keyboard, which
then displays on the braille reader below the keyboard. The blind person
will read the \"display\" and get the water.\
\
It\'s the same technology that blind people use today to read computer
screens.\

I do like [[Dusan
Ondris](https://www.quora.com/profile/Dusan-Ondris)]{.qlink_container}\'s
suggestion of text-to-voice. It should be simple enough on a mobile
phone to use such an app, and it\'s likely that a mute person may have
that app handy for day-to-day use.]{.rendered_qtext}
