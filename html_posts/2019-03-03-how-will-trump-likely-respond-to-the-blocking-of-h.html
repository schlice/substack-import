**How will Trump likely respond to the national emergency veto?**

I don\'t understand what a national emergency veto is. They\'re isn\'t
actually any such thing.

The process works like this:

1.  The President declares a national emergency.
2.  If Congress chooses to end the national emergency, they must issue a
    **joint resolution** to do so. That means that both the House and
    the Senate must pass the same resolution.
3.  The resolution goes to the President\'s desk for signature. The
    President can veto the resolution. If a joint resolution actually
    made it to his desk (which is highly unlikely), he would likely veto
    it.
4.  Congress would need a 2/3 majority in both Houses in order to
    override the veto.

So in this case, there isn\'t much that can stop a national emergency.
