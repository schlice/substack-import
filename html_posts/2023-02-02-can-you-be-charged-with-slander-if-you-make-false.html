Slander (like its printed cousin libel) is part of a family of offenses
called *defamation*.

There are four elements which are required to exist in order to prove
*prima facie* defamation:

1.  **a false statement** purporting to be fact
2.  **publication** (libel) or **communication** (slander) of that
    statement to a third person
3.  **fault** amounting to at least negligence, and
4.  **damages**, or some harm caused to the reputation of the person or
    entity who is the subject of the statement.

Some other notes about defamation:

- Fault is shown when, at least, negligence in not taking reasonable
  care to prove or disprove the truth of the statement before it was
  communicated occurred.
- Public officials are held to a higher standard when claiming
  defamation. Public officials must show that the false, defaming
  statements were said with \"actual malice.\" This was outlined in the
  famous defamation case *New York Times v. Sullivan* (376 US 254,
  1964). The reason why public officials are held to a higher standard
  is because of the threat relaxed defamatory statements could pose to
  first amendment freedom of speech. The *Sullivan* court stated that
  \"actual malice\" means that the defendant said the defamatory
  statement \"with knowledge that it was false or with reckless
  disregard of whether it was false or not.\" The plaintiff must prove
  actual malice by \"clear and convincing\" evidence, rather than the
  preponderance of the evidence standard normally required in a civil
  case.
- Truth is considered to be an *absolute defense* to defamation. In
  other words, if you make a statement which harms someone's reputation,
  but the statement is actually true, a defamation claim will fail.
