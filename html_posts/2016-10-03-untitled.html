This is actually not true. In fact, if you as a private citizen were
threatened with death or grave bodily harm, you too have the right to
defend yourself with force. There are two differences:

- As a citizen, you can only **match** the force presented to you. The
  police are allowed to use higher levels of force to compel compliance.
- The police have an additional duty to safeguard the general public;
  the private citizen has no such duty.

But if that attacker is engaging you, you have the same right to defend
yourself as any police officer does.
