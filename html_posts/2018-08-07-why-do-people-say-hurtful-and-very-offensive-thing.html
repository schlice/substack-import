**Why do people say hurtful and very offensive things whilst inciting
hate and try to justify it as \"freedom of speech\"?**

Because "hate speech" *is* free speech.

**The First Amendment is in place specifically to protect the speech
that you don't like.** You don't need to protect speech that you agree
with, right? You'd never need a First Amendment in the first place if
everyone said nice things all the time. No speech would ever need to be
protected.

The First Amendment specifically allows people to say things with which
we disagree. And yes, sometimes those things are offensive and hurtful
and filled with hate. But they are, indeed, allowed to say them. That's
what the First Amendment is all about.

However, and we can't put too fine a point on this, the First Amendment
does not protect you from the *consequences* of your words. For example,
if your employer hears you or finds out you used those words, you could
be looking for a new job. If you are a business owner, people could
choose to do business elsewhere, or people in business may choose not to
do business with you. People do not have to agree with you. People do
not have to listen to you, either.

You can say what you like, but you will still have to face the
consequences of your words.
