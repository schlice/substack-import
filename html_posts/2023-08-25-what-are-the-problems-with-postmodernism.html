This doesn't need a complex answer.

As a philosophy, postmodernism rejects concepts of rationality,
objectivity, and universal truth. In other words, postmodernism says
"there is no universal (absolute) truth."

Except that the postmodernist makes one absolute truth statement:
**postmodernism is true**.

So if postmodernists, who believe that there is no absolute truth, must
resort to an absolute truth statement (postmodernism is true), then they
are hypocrites. But if you are skeptical about postmodernism, you are
self-defeating: **the more skeptical you are about the skepticism of
postmodernism, the more certain you become that absolute truth exists,
and postmodernism is false.**

So by both examples, either postmodernism is fatally flawed out the
gate, or postmodernists actually do believe in absolute truth. Either
way, the postmodernist idea that there is no universal truth is
analytically false.
