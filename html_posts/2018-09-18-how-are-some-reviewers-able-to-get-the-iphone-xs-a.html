**How are some reviewers able to get the iPhone XS and XS Max before its
released to the general public and do unboxing and review videos?**

Some reviewers are directly contacted by manufacturers, and demo units
are offered to them specifically to do unboxing and review videos. Who
gets demo units is generally based on viewership and subscription
numbers.

It's a double-edged sword, however: pre-production units are still in
beta, they're not full-fledged production units, so not all the features
will be fully implemented in them

For that reason, manufacturers often don't allow the unboxers to do full
feature reviews. In some cases, they allow reviews of only certain
features, not all of them.
