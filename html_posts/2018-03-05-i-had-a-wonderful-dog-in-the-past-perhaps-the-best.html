**I had a wonderful dog in the past, perhaps the best dog. What if I get
a new dog and I\'m always comparing her to the old dog?**

I had a dog in the past. She was the best dog. She still is, even though
she's been dead a few years now.

I got a new dog (by the way, it took me a good four years to get over
the first dog because she was, as previously noted, the best dog).

I do compare my new dog to my old dog, but not in the way you think.

I say, "Wow, look at what she's doing! Jessie never did that. I really
wish Jessie would have done that."

Or I say, "Grr, that really annoys me when she does that. Jessie never
acted like that. I'll have to work on that."

Both of my dogs were/are Golden Retrievers. Jessie would never actually
"retrieve" anything. Her whole life, she never brought anything back.
Sadie (my current pup) will retrieve until she passes out. I got one of
those ball throwing handles because literally my arm gets tired before
she stops bringing the ball back.

So yeah, that's how you compare the two. You will never stop loving your
first dog. You will also love your new dog. Comparing them doesn't mean,
"Boy, I wish you were as good as *\<dog_1\>.*" It also doesn't mean
you'll love your new dog conditionally, as in "I'll only love you if you
are exactly like *\<dog_1\>*." It just means that there will be
similarities and differences between the two, and you'll notice them.
But that's it. You'll be able to separate the two.
