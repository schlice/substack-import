<h2>Answer Comment</h2>

**Content:** [I think you meant that most gun owners are opposed to
background checks that maintain a list of the weapons purchased and
serial numbers.\
\
Colorado shows that a person is authorized to purchase a gun or
authorized to sell a particular type of gun (handgun/rifle, etc). It
does not create a record of gun sales. The FFL provides a certificate
showing that the NICS checks were done and passed. That\'s all. It\'s up
to the seller to maintain that information.]{.rendered_qtext}
