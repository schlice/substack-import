**If a criminal is guilty of a minor offense but cooperates in the
investigation and go without incident, does a police officer have to
handcuff someone when arresting them, or can they drive a cooperative
person to the station locked in the back seat?**

This is usually dictated by policy. Most police departments do not allow
anyone under arrest to ride without that shiny pair of silver bracelets.
Many departments don't allow officers to cuff you in front, either. Some
departments allow the officer to decide to cuff in front with the
addition of a lap belt and buckle, pinning your wrists to the front of
your body. Generally, this is only allowed in the case of medical
necessity (i.e. the arrestee's arm physically cannot move in the
direction a traditional behind-the-back handcuffing would require).
