> How did a person like Geroge Santos ever be elected to congress?

He lied. Flat-out padded his résumé with complete fabrications. He has
admitted \"embellishing\" his résumé before winning a seat on Long
Island last November, but has repeatedly denied any criminal wrongdoing.
Santos lied to voters about his education and his career, invented a
fictional Jewish heritage for his family and claimed falsely that
employees working for him died in the 2016 Pulse night club shooting.

The reason that nothing has yet been done: **The Constitution.**

I know it may be hard to believe, but the Constitution says you can't
recall a Congressman. A vacancy in the office of U.S. senator or
representative can be created only by the incumbent\'s death or
resignation, the expiration of his term, or some direct action of the
body (the Senate or the House of Representatives) which is empowered to
expel members (*Burton v. U.S.* 202 US 344, at 369).

And currently, the House Ethics Committee is reviewing Rep. Santos,
alleging that there was an *unrelated* issue to his lying: possible
sexual misconduct. On March 2, 2023, the House Ethics Committee
announced it has opened a formal investigation into Santos. A statement
released by the panel stated an investigative subcommittee will examine
whether Santos \"engaged in unlawful activity\" during his 2022
campaign. In other words, they're going to see if anything he did to get
elected was illegal.

The probe will also determine whether Santos violated federal conflict
of interest laws and whether he \"engaged in sexual misconduct\" toward
an individual who was seeking a job in the freshman congressman\'s House
office. Santos has denied that allegation.

And since everyone has the right to **due process** (there's that pesky
Constitution again), and since everyone is innocent until proven guilty,
Santos remains a member in good standing until the Ethics Committee
finds something and the House votes to expel him. In its statement, the
Ethics Committee noted that opening an investigation \"does not itself
indicate that any violation has occurred.\" If the panel finds that
Santos committed ethics violations, punishments could range from a
reprimand to expulsion from the House of Representatives, depending on
the severity of the conduct.

So even if they do find something, they still may not remove him. That's
up to the House.

And if the House does not remove him, the correct method of removing him
is *at the ballot box*. In other words, when he's up for re-election,
*you don't re-elect him.* I'm looking at you, New York.
