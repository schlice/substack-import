Oh watch out there, you're using intelligence again!

Politicians try to make money complicated, but it really isn't. Since
government doesn't *generate wealth*, it only gets money by collecting
it from its citizens, and then giving it to other citizens by funding
programs.

Property taxes are part of the way that government collects money from
citizens. There are many ways: sales tax, income tax, etc. Some states
are so buoyed by taxes generated from tourism, that they don't even need
income taxes (looking at you, Florida). But in general, those are the
kinds of things that generate revenue for government.

When you eliminate one source of revenue, you can make up for the
shortfall in one of two ways: increase the amount of revenue you derive
from other sources, or decrease the amount you spend on programs. You
can do one, or both, but you must do at least one of those. Eliminating
one type of tax will either result in higher taxes in other areas, or
reduced government spending. Maybe that's what they're going for. But if
you don't reduce spending, you'll have to increase other taxes to make
up the difference.

Ultimately, it's just a shuffle game. Shuffling money from this area to
cover this other area. You don't get something for nothing.

Original question:

Texas Governor candidate Huffines says that he will do away with
property taxes if elected. Wouldn't that possibly just make taxes more
expensive in other areas though?
