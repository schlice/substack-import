**Will Democrats be successful in receiving an unredacted copy of the
full Mueller report now that The House Judiciary Committee approved
their subpoena?**

Nope.

AG Barr has shown that he follows the law as it is written. Even a
subpoena cannot authorize someone to break the law, so it's unlikely
that this AG will break the law because he got a subpoena for material
which is patently illegal for him to release.

But doesn't this just drip of irony? Congress writes the law which AG
Barr is following, and now Congress is attempting to subpoena the
report, which Barr cannot legally release, under the laws that they
wrote?

If Congress wants the full, unredacted report so badly, they can amend
the law which is preventing him from releasing the full, unredacted
report.

They will fail spectacularly in that effort. Which is why they are
resorting to this particular tack.

It's nothing more than a ploy to energize their base, who similarly
doesn't believe in the rule of law. just the rule of Orange Man Badâ„¢ and
we do whatever we have to in order to get him.
