**Is it true that the average American taxpayer is paying \$1,260 more
in taxes on average after Trump\'s presidency?**

No. It's actually *exactly the opposite*.

The nonpartisan non-profit Tax Policy Center
[[found](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=7528a0&url=https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/publications/effect-tcja-individual-income-tax-provisions-across-income-groups-and-across-states/full){.external_link

cuts will actually *lower* the average American's taxes by \$1,260, or
slightly less than 2 percent of income.
