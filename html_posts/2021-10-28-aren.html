Better than what, exactly?

And how, precisely, do you define "good" when it comes to "serving God
and humanity" and "spreading the gospel?"

If your mission does that (i.e. "serving God and humanity" and
"spreading the gospel"), I fail to see how a medical mission would be
"better" than any other type of mission. They all serve God's purpose.
Serving man in a different way does not make one mission trip type
better or worse than any other.

Original question:

Aren\'t medical missions a better way to serve God and humanity and
spread the gospel?
