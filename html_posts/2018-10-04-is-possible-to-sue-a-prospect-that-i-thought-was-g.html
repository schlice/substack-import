**Is possible to sue a prospect that I thought was going to be a client?
We\'d converse with email or phone they\'d ask questions and red lines
to my contract, stringing me along. The client took my free advice and
pursued the negotiations on their own.**

Unless you have a written contract with the prospect, there is no
expectation that they are going to become a client, and there's no
requirement that they keep any advice to themselves.

Maybe you should give out less free advice, and wait until they become a
client.
