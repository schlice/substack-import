**What's the difference between an executive order and a national
emergency?**

They are overlapping insofar as a national emergency is declared by
using an Executive Order.

An Executive Order (EO) is an order written by the President directing
operations of a Federal agency. He can change policy, create new
policies, rescind policies, and direct other activities of Federal
agencies, as long as those changes are consistent with Federal law and
the limits imposed on the President by the Constitution. Basically, the
President is the CEO of the Executive Branch Company, and he can make
new rules for his departments to follow whenever he chooses.

A "national emergency" is a function spelled out by the [[National
Emergencies
Act](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=eaf2df&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Emergencies_Act){.external_link

]{.qlink_container}which was passed by Congress in 1976. It clearly
defines the powers the President is allowed to invoke by declaring a
national emergency, provides structure and procedure around what he has
to do when doing so, and provides a framework for Federal law to define
what those powers are. To date, there are approximately 470 different
provisions of Federal law that a President may invoke by declaring a
national emergency. It is declared through an Executive Order.

There are currently 28 national emergencies which are ongoing. The
longest was declared by President Carter in 1978 and is still ongoing
today.
