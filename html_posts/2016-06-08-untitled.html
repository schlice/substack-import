If it was an active investigation, and there were subpoenas or warrants
already involved, the investigation would likely be handed off to the
detectives, among whom there is at least one (if not more) with some
fairly high-level computer skills.

The case would never be abandoned without investigating simply because a
particular officer or deputy did not have the requisite skill to
continue with that portion of the investigation; they would simply find
the right resource.
