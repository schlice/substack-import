**What is the appropriate course of action to take after legally
shooting someone in self defense?**

First of all, this is a tragic, but **incredibly rare** case of a
perfect storm of problems.

- The homeowner did not disarm himself
- The homeowner was deaf and could not hear police verbal commands
- The person who called 911 (the homeowner's wife) failed to inform them
  that the homeowner was deaf. She also failed to inform the dispatcher
  that the situation was resolved and that there was no further
  shooting.

So while terribly tragic, it's unlikely that something like this could
happen to you if you defend yourself.

When police arrive, they have **no idea** what they're walking into.
They only know that there was a B&E (breaking and entering) with shots
fired. Are they walking into an active shooter scenario? Is there still
an active shooter present? Without context, they could be walking into
either the aftermath of a shooting, or an active shooting itself. So
since they don't know, they go in on high alert. They find an armed man
refusing to disarm (they, of course, don't know he's deaf). The man
refuses to follow verbal commands (of course he does, he can't hear
them), and apparently at one point makes a move which the officer
perceives to be threatening. The tragedies keep on coming.

So how do you make sure that you stay alive after you shoot someone in
self-defense? Well first of all, if you're deaf, try to have someone
hearing intercede on your behalf with the police. When lives are on the
line, it's probably your best option.

For everyone else:

*(and before we start, let's also narrow the scope down to a similar
scenario to the one asked: shooting an intruder in your own home)*

- If you are still holding a conscious suspect at gunpoint, **be
  prepared to put that gun down as soon as the police arrive.** If the
  suspect is unconscious, take this time to **unload and lock open**
  your firearm. You want the magazine out and the slide locked back. For
  revolvers, you want all the bullets out and the cylinder open. For
  shotguns, you want all ammunition out and the slide open. Lay the
  weapon down, out of everyone's reach. Ideally, the officers entering
  the home should reach your firearm first before they reach you.
- Have someone call 911. Answer all the dispatcher's questions, and
  **stay on the phone with the dispatcher until police arrive and the
  dispatcher tells you you can hang up.** Ensure the dispatcher knows
  that you are either holding someone at gunpoint or that the intruder
  has been disabled and the gun has been unloaded.
- When police arrive, **face away from the officers, raise your empty
  hands high, get down on your knees and interlock your fingers on top
  of your head.** Do this without being told. Don't worry, you'll be
  told anyway, but this is literally the only move you should be making.
  You will be detained, and you may quite possibly be placed in
  handcuffs. Remember that this is for everyone's safety, so don't freak
  out too badly. Believe me, even being in handcuffs *in training* is
  still scary, so I know that being in handcuffs will be incredibly
  frightening. You have to use logic to overcome the emotional response
  that you will no doubt have.
- Explain you are the homeowner/shooter, you were in fear for your life
  (or for someone else's life) and you fired on an intruder.

And that's it. Try not to say too much more. Identifying information
would be helpful (driver's license), but again, that's about all you
should be saying. They shouldn't be asking you much more other than
questions about securing the scene, as in "are there any more guns
around." If they start asking you more about what happened, simply say,
"I think it's best that I leave the rest of the details out until I've
had a chance to talk to my lawyer." This does not mean you are guilty of
any crimes. It just means that you know that in order to protect all of
your rights, you need an attorney, and the police are not there to set
you free. They are there to enforce the law.
