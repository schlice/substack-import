There are two Constitutionally-approved methods to modify the
Constitution (as detailed in Article V of the Constitution):

1.  Congress can propose a new amendment with a two-thirds vote in both
    the House and the Senate. Any provision of the Constitution,
    including existing amendments, can be modified, or rendered null and
    void by a new amendment. The amendment must be ratified by
    three-fourths of the states to become part of the Constitution.
2.  Two-thirds of the states can call a convention to propose amendments
    to the Constitution, often called an "Article V Convention" or an
    "Amendments Convention." Once the Amendments are drafted, they are
    sent to the states, and must still be ratified by three-fourths of
    the states in order to become part of the Constitution.

To date, 33 amendments have been drafted and sent to the states. 27 of
these amendments were ratified and are now part of the Constitution. An
Article V Convention has yet to take place.
