It's probably because you associate racist people from the early to
mid-20th century as Christians. But it wasn't their Christianity which
influenced their belief, it was their racism.

In fact, if they had been better/closer followers of Christ in
everything they did, they would have seen that their position was
particularly unbiblical.

Alas, "*there\'s none so blind as they that won\'t see*" (Jonathan
Swift).
