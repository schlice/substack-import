**I read that not everyone needs a license to buy a gun, say
hypothetically, a license was required, then who would benefit the
most?**

No one needs a license to buy a gun.

Last time I checked, it was unconstitutional to force someone to get a
license to exercise a constitutional right.

Do you need a license to post on Quora (i.e. exercise your 1st Amendment
rights)?

Do you need a license to prevent you from having the police execute
unlawful searches of your home?

Do you need a license to exercise your Miranda rights?

Similarly, you don't need a license to buy a gun. You need to pass a
background check. Everyone who buys a gun from a licensed dealer needs
to pass a background check. In most states, you can buy a gun from a
private seller, and you don't need a background check.

The article talks about the states in which you can buy a gun from a
private seller and not need a background check (thanks goes out to
HuffPo for giving criminals a ready resource for that).

Now, in some alternate universe, if a license was required to buy a gun,
who would benefit the most? The entity selling the licenses.
