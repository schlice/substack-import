Whether it's a top general or a Second Lieutenant, an officer refusing
to follow an order is a serious charge. You'd better have a damn good
reason for refusing to follow an order from your commander, and the only
good reason would be that the order violates a law. It may violate rules
of engagement, it may even go so far as to violate the Law of Armed
Combat for the engagement in which you are currently operating. But
regardless, you never see active refusal to follow orders unless there
is a violation of law in the order.

Generally, what would happen is that the senior officer would find
someone else to carry out the order (if they can) and then will file
Article 15 proceedings against the officer for failure to follow a
direct order. The order will be reviewed, and if the order is found to
be compliant with law, the officer will be court-martialed and likely
dishonorably discharged.

So if you're going to refuse to follow an order, you better be right.

Specifically for the President and his service chiefs, he would probably
fire them (i.e. reassign or retire) and get someone else who would
follow orders.
