Thanks for the A2A.

Personhood is a legal term which some states use to determine to what
human beings the Constitution is supposed to apply. This is because in
some states, the right to life does not apply to unborn human beings,
while in other states, the right to life does apply to unborn human
beings.

Some states have established "personhood" in their state Constitutions,
implying that the right to life applies to everyone to whom "personhood"
has been granted. And yes, "personhood" is a legal definition which is
only granted by law, whereas "human being" is not a legal definition but
a biological one, determined solely by science and the inclusion of an
organism in the species *Homo Sapiens*.

"Humans" have "human rights" because they are human, but human rights
can be violated if doing so is not illegal. "Persons" are protected by
the Constitution because it guarantees a right to life. Violating the
right to life is unconstitutional, and laws already protect people from
having their life unlawfully taken from them.
