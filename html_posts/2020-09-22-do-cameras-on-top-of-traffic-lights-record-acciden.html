**Do cameras on top of traffic lights record accidents?**

No, for a variety of reasons, not the least of which is that there is no
infrastructure to do so. The camera (a low-resolution inexpensive
camera) replaces the old ground loop sensor to tell the traffic light
system that a car is waiting at the light. That's all it does: presence
of car, absence of car. It's not powerful enough to provide any useful
information, and it is focused on the lane or lanes it is monitoring,
it's not a wide-angle security camera.

Its feed is connected to the light controller.

Some cities have broadband feeds to the light controllers and can watch
live the information from the cameras, but again, the feed is low-res
and mostly useless for much else besides sensing the presence of a car.
