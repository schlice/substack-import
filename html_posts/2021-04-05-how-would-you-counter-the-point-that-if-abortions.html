**How would you counter the point that if abortions are illegal, women
will perform them dangerously and could die?**

There are a few basic counterpoints to this argument.

1.  There is no sound logic which says that we *shouldn't* make
    something illegal because someone may break the law, and harm
    themselves in the process. Whether or not someone chooses to break
    the law is not a factor in whether or not we make laws, or repeal
    laws. You could literally say this about any law. *We shouldn't make
    bank robberies illegal, because people will still rob banks and they
    could die in the process.* If a law is worth having, it's worth
    having *despite* the people who may choose to violate it.
2.  Technology has advanced significantly since *Roe* was decided.
    Vacuum aspiration using suction curettage has made abortions much
    safer for the woman than they were just a few decades ago. We also
    have chemical abortifactents which can induce contractions in the
    uterus, expelling the fetus "naturally." Even unlicensed medical
    practitioners who know how to operate the suction curette can do so
    with much more safety than before.
3.  But even with safer forms of abortion, the images of "back-alley
    abortions" using coat hangers and the like are mostly fiction. There
    were anecdotal examples of it, but they were strikingly rare. What
    would likely happen if *Roe* were overturned and a state made
    abortion illegal is that there would be some doctors who chose to
    violate the law anyway. By the way, the same thing happens with
    guns. When someone is a prohibited purchaser, one of the largest
    sources of illegal guns is through properly licensed FFL dealers who
    simply "look the other way" and fail to file the appropriate
    background check. They "lose the paperwork" on that purchaser.
    Similarly for abortion, a doctor may tell a woman that he won't do
    it himself, but he will refer the patient to a doctor who will.
    Either that, or he will simply give the woman

    will do it herself.
