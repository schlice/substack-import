Evidence? I assume with something as important as your eternal destiny,
you would have weighty and overwhelming evidence that there is no god.
Please present your evidence. And as you would do to me if you asked me
to prove that God exists, make sure it is fully empirical, testable and
repeatable evidence which proves beyond a reasonable doubt that no god
exists.

The gravity of the decision to believe or not believe that God exists is
important. If you're making an inconsequential choice, it's not a really
big deal. But when you're *determining your eternal destiny*, I would
think you would require a tremendous amount of evidence to prove that
God does not exist.

Think of it this way. If I set two glasses of lemonade down in front of
you and I tell you that one is more tart than the other, you wouldn't
need a whole lot of evidence to choose one. But if I set two glasses of
lemonade down in front of you and I tell you one is sweetened with sugar
and the other is sweetened with rat poison, you would require weighty
and overwhelming evidence before you chose one.

This is where you sit when you claim that there is no god. Because the
decision to believe or not to believe in God could have eternal
consequences, the atheist should have weighty and overwhelming evidence
to prove their position, but they do not. They simply slide into
eternity with their fingers crossed, hoping that they do not discover
the unpleasant truth that God is real and eternity exists, and it's an
awfully long time to be wrong.
