Because Trump drops that much ***everywhere he goes***.

Estimates circulating online placed the cost of Secret Service
protection alone at \$7 to \$10 million, with air travel and motorcade
expenses ranging from \$4 to \$5 million. Additional costs included
stadium security enhancements and local law enforcement support,
bringing the total up to \$20 million.

Basically, anywhere Trump goes, it's going to cost upwards of \$10 to
\$15 million, because as the President of the United States, he is
entitled to full-time Secret Service protection. Air Force One must be
paid for, as well as his travel entourage, which includes his
communications and logistics teams he needs to stay in constant
communications.

How can taxpayers avoid these "ridiculously high" expenses?

1.  Don't let Trump travel anywhere.
2.  Don't let Trump pick where he goes and where he does not.
3.  Make Trump pay for his own security.
4.  Remove some of the requirements he has to stay in constant
    communications.

Since none of these options are really viable, these are just the costs
necessary to protect the President. And in case we've forgotten, these
security measures are

Our President needs to be visible. He needs to be out there, supporting
the things that we support, doing the things that we do. He is ***OUR***
President. He needs to be out there with ***US***. So there will
necessarily be a cost to that.

But for everyone clutching their pearls about \$20 million in travel
costs, DOGE has already saved the country **\$65 billion**. With *just
the savings Trump's team has found in his first month in office,* Trump
can pay for **3,250** Super Bowl trips.

Time to stop missing the forest for the trees.
