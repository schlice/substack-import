You can publish a "human-readable" license as long as your artists agree
to the wording of the actual license. Your human-readable version will
have to start with something like "This is a condensed version of the
license agreement. By agreeing to these terms, you are agreeing to the
terms of the actual license which you can read \<here\>."

The problem is the interpretation between the actual license text and
the "human-readable" version.

If you produce a human-readable version of your license, your attorney
will have to approve it to ensure that it captures the major facets of
the actual agreement.
