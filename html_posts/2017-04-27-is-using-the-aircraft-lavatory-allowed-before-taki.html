The question is not one of using or not using the lavatory. The lav is
completely functional and can be used at any time before, during, or
after the flight.

The question is whether or not you are obeying lighted signs, placards,
and crewmember instructions. I'm sure you've heard it a million times
during the briefing: US federal law requires compliance with lighted
signs (i.e. the seat belt sign), placards (i.e. non-lighted permanent
signs), and crewmember instructions.

If the seat belt sign is off and there is time, passengers may use the
lavatory before take-off.

However, once the seat belt sign is on, passengers are required to
remain in their seats with their seat belts securely fastened low and
tight across their laps. This is a critical portion of the flight,
during taxi and take off. The most jarring forces are sent into the
aircraft both during landing and during take-off.

Flight crews are not "flying stewards" or "flying stewardesses." They
are primarily there for your safety. The laws in place back them up.
It's critical that all passengers follow the instructions of the crew as
well as obeying the lighted signs. If you are up when the light comes
on, you are required to return to your seat. If you're in your seat when
the light comes on, you're required to stay there. Failing to do so is a
violation of federal law.
