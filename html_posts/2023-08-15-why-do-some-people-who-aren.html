Because some people who aren't even conservative in America recognize
that at some point (which they are still undecided about, which is why
you get a range between 12 and 30 weeks), that "clump of cells" becomes
"a baby" and makes the magical leap from "something which can be excised
like a tumor" to "a living human being with a right to exist in just the
same way that you and I do."

So at a certain point, it's not about the woman's body *exclusively* any
more to these people. It's about the woman's body *and* the baby's body,
and after that point, they believe that the baby has as much right to
live as the mother does.

\

**WARNING: I'm getting on my soapbox.**

So it's important to note that I'm not one of those people who aren't
even conservative. I am a religious conservative. I am one of those
"forced birthers," as I'm derisively called (among other things which I
shall not repeat in polite company). I believe the baby has equal rights
to every other living human being, because I believe the baby is indeed
a human being (albeit at a very early stage of development) and deserves
the same equal right to life as all of us do.

At this point, the pro-choicers will often trot out the same old tired
arguments, most of them pointing to the extreme to justify the middle,
things like problem pregnancies, or rape, or "it's my body," or the
latest bit of logical gymnastics, "I can consent to sex without
consenting to pregnancy."

*None of that matters.*

Let's discuss what does matter, and how we move the discussion forward.

Pro-lifers like myself need to recognize that **pregnancy is hard**.
Pregnancy is probably one of the hardest things a woman will ever have
to go through, physically, in her entire life. And it is only 40 weeks
out of the \~4030 weeks that an average woman lives in the United
States. We need to respect and be sensitive to that fact, as we think
about legally restricting the ability of a woman to terminate a
pregnancy.

Pro-choicers need to recognize that biologically, the thing growing in
the mother's uterus (the place designed precisely for this activity) is
absolutely a human being, a member of *Homo Sapiens.* Pro-choicers need
to admit that **abortion kills a human being**. Not a clump of cells,
not a fetus (which is just Latin for "baby"), but a human being. And it
is alive. And you are killing it.

**This can actually be appropriate**, if the people decide that we are
not going to respect the baby's right to life before a certain time
period. **But we need to be honest about what we're doing**. If you
can't even admit to yourself what you're doing, then you really need to
stop and reflect on what it is that you are actually advocating for. You
are indeed advocating for the destruction of a human life, full stop.
*We may, as a society, permit this destruction*, as we do with convicted
murderers on Death Row. We may, as a society, decide that the baby
(before 12--30 weeks, as above) does not have the right to life. That's
something we can decide.

Today, we decide that at a state level. Some states have that line
somewhere in that range. Some have it earlier. Some have it *way*
earlier (I'm looking at you, Florida), and some have *no line at all*
(I'm looking at you, Texas and California). This is as it should be, as
it is up to the people in each state to decide **for themselves** what
their laws should be.

**But it is not up to anyone to decide for** ***anyone else in any other
state*** **what their laws** ***must*** **be.**

In the vast majority of cases, you can travel to another state to kill
your baby (remember, we have to admit to ourselves that this is what we
are doing), because the majority of the people in your state do not
approve of this action. Again, this is as it should be. You have the
freedom to relocate to another state if you don't like the policies in
your state. You may not have the financial means to do so, but you
always have the *freedom* to do so. And there are support organizations
on both sides of the issue which can help you carry out your wishes.

Cue nasty comments in 3...2...1...

*NOTE: My delete button works very well. Any unhelpful comments about me
will be deleted. Anything that violates BNBR will be deleted, and you
will be blocked and reported.*

*If you want to discuss, let's have a civil, polite discussion. Do your
best to leave your emotion at the door (as difficult as it may be with
this topic).*

*Thank you.*
