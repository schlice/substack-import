**I know an attorney who works for Arizona Family Court / DCFS. The
attorney talks freely about her client's including names and various
detailed information. Is this a HIPAA violation?**

No, HIPAA is a law which protects healthcare information.

What you're referring to is what is known as **attorney-client
privilege**. However, not all conversations between an attorney and a
client are covered by attorney-client privilege.
