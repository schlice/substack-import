In a free nation, people should have the right to do with themselves as
they choose, as long as what they do doesn\'t impact others.

Laws which do nothing but protect you from you are generally not in
keeping with the ideals of the nation. Examples would be adult
motorcycle helmet laws and adult seat belt laws, or laws which restrict
the size fountain drink you can buy to protect you from the bad effects
of sugar.

Those who say that such laws keep health costs low are attempting to
confuddle the issue. Everyone knows that for the most part, it\'s the
patient who pays his own healthcare costs unless the patient is unable
to pay, in which case it\'s not likely the patient would have a car or a
motorcycle. If the patient has insurance, then the people who pay for
that insurance (usually the patient\'s employer) should be the ones
taking issue with your lifestyle, since they are the ones who have to
pay the bulk of your medical costs. These would be issues for healthcare
payors to handle, not the government through law. Indeed, many
healthcare payors (employers) are offering incentives to their employees
for making healthy lifestyle choices, and offering discounts on things
like health club memberships and promoting weight loss and monitoring
your \"numbers\" (i.e. frequent biometric screenings).

Many things can be legislated, but there are similarly many things that
**shouldn\'t** be legislated.
