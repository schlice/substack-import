**Content:** [It makes for compelling movies, but it makes for bad
portrayal of reality.\
\
The heart of hostage negotiation is patience and the simplification of
logic. When the guy says \"drop your gun or I\'ll shoot this hostage,\"
I\'d remind him that he\'d have little chance of pulling the trigger,
swinging his gun towards me and firing before I can get at least one
shot off, so he\'d be dead anyway. He may as well shoot himself and save
me the trouble. And if he kills the hostage, I don\'t have to worry
about hitting them. It\'s open-season, basically.\
\
Basically, ask the terrorist how killing that person is going to get him
what he wants. It removes the only thing keeping him alive, his only
leverage. Without that leverage, he\'s dead.\
\
(EDIT) I\'d also ask him where the logic is in killing his own human
shield. \"Drop your gun or I will kill the only thing keeping me alive,
and I\'ll give you the legal authority and the motivation to kill me on
the spot.\" Huh?]{.rendered_qtext}
