**When will it be safe to resume our daily lives regarding work, school
and other activities in light of the current U.S. national emergency?**

Unless you live on or near the southern US border, your life should not
be impacted in the slightest by the latest national emergency.

Your life may have been impacted by one of the other 28 national
emergencies that are currently active.

Oh, you didn't know that there are now 29 national emergencies currently
active? You should probably learn more than the media tells you.
