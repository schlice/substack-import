**Can a non-US citizen with a valid driver\'s license use it as proof of
identity to fly domestic flights?**

From TSA, here is the list of valid forms of identification you can use
at an airport security checkpoint. These are the **only** forms of
identification which are accepted at airport checkpoints:

> Adult passengers 18 and over must show valid identification at the
> airport checkpoint in order to travel.
>
> - Driver\'s licenses or other state photo identity cards issued by
>   Department of Motor Vehicles (or equivalent)
> - U.S. passport
> - U.S. passport card
> - DHS trusted traveler cards (Global Entry, NEXUS, SENTRI, FAST)
> - U.S. Department of Defense ID, including IDs issued to dependents
> - Permanent resident card
> - Border crossing card
> - DHS-designated enhanced driver\'s license
> - Federally recognized, tribal-issued photo ID
> - HSPD-12 PIV card
> - Foreign government-issued passport
> - Canadian provincial driver\'s license or Indian and Northern Affairs
>   Canada card
> - Transportation worker identification credential
> - U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Employment Authorization
>   Card (I-766)
> - U.S. Merchant Mariner Credential
>
> Beginning Oct. 1, 2020, if you plan to use your state-issued ID or
> license to fly within the U.S., make sure it is REAL ID compliant. If

If you have one of these, TSA is wholly unconcerned with your
citizenship status. If you have a license issued by a state, and it is
valid, you can use it to fly domestic. You could even use a non-US
passport, so long as the name matches the name on the ticket, and the
picture matches the person standing in front of them.

The question asked if a "**non-US citizen with a valid driver's
license"** can fly domestically. But the OP failed to mention where that
license was issued. If that driver's license is issued by a US state,
then yes. If it is issued by a foreign country, then unless it is a
license issued by Canada (which is in the list above), then no. That
non-US citizen will have to provide one of the forms of ID listed above
to fly on a domestic US airline.
