The same way I "deal" with everyone: **I love them.**

Because that's what we're commanded to do. We're not commanded to reject
them. We're not commanded to berate them. We're not commanded to
browbeat them.

We're commanded to love them, as we love ourselves.

If we can, we may gently show them how their behaviors might not be
biblical, but we do so *because* we first love them, and in the same way
you want to correct the behavior of a child because you love them, you'd
want to gently speak the truth in love.

God does this with us, how can we do less with anyone else?
