Short answer: **no.**

Reason: **they were not obligated to do so.**

In actuality, he got a Bad Conduct Discharge, and the military is not
mandated to report those. It's *optional*, so they did nothing wrong.
They are only *required* to report Dishonorable Discharges into NICS.

It's optional because the two legal systems have different burdens of
proof and different standards of evidence (i.e. in the military system,
you are guilty until proven innocent in a court-martial). Therefore, not
all discharges are reported to the civilian judicial system, and only
Dishonorable Discharges *must* be reported and entered into NICS.

If you want change, you would have to re-try every person who gets
court-martialed and gets a Bad Conduct Discharge in the civilian legal
system after they get out of military prison. It's not double jeopardy
to do so, but since the standards of evidence and burden of proof are
different between the two systems, they must be re-tried in a civilian
court before you can hold them to the same domestic violence punishments
as you would a non-military defendant.
