How "most people" answer that question is dependent on the dictates of
their religion. But on this one account, *Christianity stands alone
among world religions.*

And on that account, let's be abundantly clear here. Christianity
believes that **NO ONE IS QUALIFIED FOR HEAVEN.**

> *as it is written: "None is righteous, no, not one; \-- Romans 3:10
> ESV*

No one is worthy. We are all sinners. We sin in our thoughts, and in our
words, in what we have done, and what we have failed to do. We sin
(acts) because we are sinners (by birth). We are born into sinful
bodies, and born into a broken, sinful world.

And without God's grace, it is there we would stay.

I highlighted "But God." One of the best thoughts in the Bible.

We were **dead** in our trespasses and sins. Can dead men save
themselves? NO!

**BUT GOD**

But God intervened. He saved us, through His grace alone. We can do
nothing to earn salvation. We can do nothing to qualify us for
salvation. It is **only** through God's grace that we are saved.

You are saved by the grace of God, through faith in Christ. That is a
**gift** which we did nothing to earn.
