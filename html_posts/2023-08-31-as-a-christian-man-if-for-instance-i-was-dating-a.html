The Bible is not an Ann Landers column. It does not give dating advice.

What it does do is give God's Word.

And God's Word is very clear about some things. The Bible is replete
with admonitions against homosexual behavior (all quotes from NIV):

> Do not have sexual relations with a man as one does with a woman; that
> is detestable. --- Leviticus 18:22
>
> If a man has sexual relations with a man as one does with a woman,
> both of them have done what is detestable. They are to be put to
> death; their blood will be on their own heads. --- Leviticus 20:13
>
> Or do you not know that wrongdoers will not inherit the kingdom of
> God? Do not be deceived: Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters
> nor adulterers nor men who have sex with men nor thieves nor the
> greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the
> kingdom of God. --- 1 Corinthians 6:9-10
>
> We also know that the law is made not for the righteous but for
> lawbreakers and rebels, the ungodly and sinful, the unholy and
> irreligious, for those who kill their fathers or mothers, for
> murderers, for the sexually immoral, for those practicing
> homosexuality, for slave traders and liars and perjurers---and for
> whatever else is contrary to the sound doctrine --- 1 Timothy 1:9-10

And lest you think that only gay men are implicated in the Bible,
lesbians are also specifically called out:

> Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their
> women exchanged natural sexual relations for unnatural ones. In the
> same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were
> inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed shameful acts with
> other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their error.
> --- Romans 1:26--27

So while you can date¹ anyone you like, with whom you have sex is
another story entirely.

\

¹ I have become aware that I am old. And apparently, the word *date* has
taken on new meanings. Way back when in the late 80s and early 90s when
I was dating, dating did not involve sex. Apparently nowadays, when you
say that you're dating someone, it means that you're having sex *as a
matter of course*. So therefore, I must clarify that when I say "date,"
I do not mean "have sex."
