No, the HOA does not set minimum standards to purchase homes.

However, considering the fact that HOA dues must be paid in addition to
whatever mortgage the new owner will be taking on when they buy in the
neighborhood, there will be a *de facto* income requirement to afford
both the cost of the home and the HOA dues.
