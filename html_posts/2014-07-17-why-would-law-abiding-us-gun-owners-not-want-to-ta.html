**Content:** [Thank you for your question, and I see that you\'re at
least trying to take positive steps in the right direction. However,
you\'re a little confused about some of the points you made.\
\
1. **Registration is the first step towards confiscation**. This is not
hysteria talking, we are only learning from history. It happened in
England, it happened in Australia, and it will happen here too if we
allow guns to be registered by the government.\
\
What exactly would be the purpose of registering a gun? There is no
other purchase in America that you have to register. You have to
register cars, but you don\'t register the \*purchase\* of a car with
the government. Registering your car tells the government that you paid
the road use tax to use the roads (that\'s why \"license plates\" is a
misnomer; in the UK, they are called \"tax tags\"). What good does gun
registration further? All it does is allow the government to know who
has guns and how many. What purpose, exactly, does that serve? Weapons
would be registered by the government so the government can control
them. If only to identify to the public, in another 20 years following
the passing of such legislation, that the weapons used to commit crimes
are either stolen from law-abiding citizens, or were never registered in
the first place (i.e. sold on the black market). But we already know
that. So why register such a purchase? When would weapons be
confiscated? When crimes are committed with them, in which case they are
confiscated anyway. You suggest going door to door to search for
unregistered weapons? Law-abiding citizens certainly won\'t have
unregistered weapons, only criminals will, and their guns get
confiscated anyway. The only reason, based on history, to register guns,
is so that there is a national registry of which houses to go to to
confiscate the same purchased items when the government decides to
repeal the Second Amendment and take guns away from people.\
\
2. **You can\'t require a \"license to own.\"** That clearly violates
the Second Amendment, and licensure to keep an bear arms would be
Congress passing a law that restricts people from keeping and bearing
arms. Again, until the Second Amendment is repealed, this will not
happen. Yes, essentially Illinois has this, but the people in that state
clearly have no desire to stand up to the government and tell them that
it\'s a Second Amendment violation, so they get what they deserve.
That\'s why I only lived in Illinois when I was assigned there, not by
choice.\
\
3. **Taking a health test to validate that you are sane isn\'t a
workable solution**, and also could be seen as a violation of the Second
Amendment. While I do agree that we have to do something to prevent guns
from falling into the hands of the mentally ill, forcing everyone to
take tests to determine their mental capacity is not a workable
solution, and again focuses on the legal owners instead of focusing on
the people we want to keep away from the guns. Requiring that tests be
passed and other hoops be jumped through before purchasing a gun is also
a \"restriction\" on lawful firearms ownership, which is a 2A violation.
We have to do a better job at determining whether or not people are
mentally ill, and then flag them so that they cannot purchase firearms
from the white market. We don\'t \"test\" people for mental capacity
when making any other purchase, and cars would be a far better choice
for testing people before making purchases, since a person with
diminished mental capacity can kill lots of people in a really short
amount of time with a car, even more so than with a gun. I can kill
twice as many people as James Holmes did in a matter of seconds by
driving my car down the middle of an open-air mall. Yet I don\'t have to
take a mental health test before getting behind the wheel of a car. The
logic doesn\'t pass muster.\
\
4. **The focus is wrongly on the weapon, when it should be on the
person.** We\'ve answered this question many times on Quora, but we\'ve
proven that it is not the gun that kills the person. We tend to focus on
guns because they\'re an easy target; they are the only device
purpose-built to kill. But killing is justified in certain
circumstances, so how I kill in those circumstances should be with the
tool that provides me the maximum benefit with the minimum possibility
of collateral damage (to myself or others) and when I have to kill
someone, a gun is the best way to do it. It\'s the best tool for the
job, but people are concerned because its job is to kill. We should
focus on the persons who should not be allowed to possess a gun. We also
have answered this question many times, but improving the mental health
system in this country would be a great place to
start.]{.rendered_qtext}
