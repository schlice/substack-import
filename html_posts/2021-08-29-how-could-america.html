The military was not wrong about the Afghanistan exit. In fact, the
military had been advising the last *two* administrations that an exit
from Afghanistan would be a hard one.

Even the legacy media has admitted as much.

[[https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/\...](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=d90106&url=https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/17/us/politics/afghanistan-biden-administration.html){.external_link

However, the legacy media is soft-pedaling this news, trying to provide
as much top-cover to Biden as they can while still appearing to report
the news. The truth about what has been briefed to both administrations
is much harder to hear:

This quote says it all:

This was a political calculation, one which went horribly and tragically
wrong.

And the politicians who made that calculation should suffer politically
for their mistake.

Original question:

How could America's 'best and brightest' military and intelligence
people have been so wrong on the Afghanistan exit?
