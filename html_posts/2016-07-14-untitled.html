They were trying what we call "pain compliance" when you're dealing with
an uncooperative suspect.

However, they did it wrong.

Pain compliance is useful in an actively struggling individual. Pain
compliance isn't very effective in a docile, but simply non-compliant
individual. Physical manipulation of a docile, non-struggling
non-compliant person is most likely better than pain compliance. Pain
compliance works better on an aggressive person as it may induce them to
be less aggressive or face more pain. It simply doesn't work as well on
the non-aggressive person.

Regardless, it sounds like that department needs a refresher on pain
compliance.
