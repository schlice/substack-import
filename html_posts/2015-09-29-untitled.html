**Content:** [Let me AGAIN clarify, as I did earlier in this discussion.
I\'ll add emphasis to help the clarification.\
\
In a state **where it was compulsory that you register your guns**,
law-abiding citizens would only have registered guns.\
\
If Texas does not require you to register your guns, failing to register
them does not make you any less law-abiding than anyone else. If you
lived in New York or Connecticut, you might be running afoul of the law
if you fail to register your guns, regardless of your reason. And in
that circumstance, yes, you would be breaking the law. You can call
yourself a law-abiding citizen while simultaneously picking and choosing
which laws you choose to follow, but that won\'t actually make you a
law-abiding citizen. I can call myself a purple elephant despite the
fact that I am not a purple elephant, and no amount of cognitive
dissonance will make me a purple elephant.]{.rendered_qtext}
