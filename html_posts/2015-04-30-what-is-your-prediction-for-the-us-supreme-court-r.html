**Content:** [Looking at it from a purely Constitutional view (which is
what the Supreme Court should be doing) shows that the Constitution is
silent on whether or not the nation should recognize marriages of any
kind. Justice Alito wrote in his dissent of the DOMA ruling in 2013,
\"Same-sex marriage presents a highly emotional and important question
of public policy \-- but not a difficult question of Constitutional
law.\" The Constitution is neutral on whether or not recognizing
same-sex marriage will help or hurt the institution.\
\
The Constitution does not require states legalize same-sex marriage, nor
does it prevent them from doing so. But last year\'s DOMA ruling (where
SCOTUS declined to review the decision that states need not recognize
same-sex marriages from other states) is an indication that the court
could make sweeping changes to marriage law when the time is right.\
\
I think Justice Kennedy\'s key word \-- \"millenia\" \-- shows that the
Court is unlikely to overturn an institution which has existed for that
amount of time, and spans the globe, as one man and one woman. It won\'t
prohibit states from making their own laws, but I don\'t think that a
nationwide directive that \"same-sex marriage is now Constitutionally
protected\" is forthcoming.\
\
But the court has come up with justification for laws supposedly derived
from the Constitution that are really, really difficult to find in
there, in the past. So who knows.]{.rendered_qtext}
