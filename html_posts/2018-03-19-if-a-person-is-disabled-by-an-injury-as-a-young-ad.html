**If a person is disabled by an injury as a young adult, and is on
Medicaid for many years, and then receives life insurance from a parent,
is that person legally bound to give some of it back to the state? The
state in question is Washington.**

No. Medicaid is not a loan. It is a program which is purchased with
deductions from your paycheck. In other words, you've already paid for
it. Even if you get more out of it than you put in, the system was
originally designed for this. It's an insurance program (but a really
bad one at that), it's not a loan that must be repaid.

Additionally, life insurance is a disbursement that is not under state
control. It's between the life insurance company and the beneficiary.
The money received from life insurance does not come with any
responsibilities to pay anyone.
