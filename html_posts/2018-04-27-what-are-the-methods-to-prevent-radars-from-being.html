**What are the methods to prevent radars from being jammed spoofed,
etc?**

I'll assume you're talking about police radar. The methods by which you
could jam or spoof radar are all either illegal or ineffective.

The only *effective* radar jammer would be an active, broadcasting
jammer, and they are illegal. You need a license to transmit on that
frequency, and radar jammers are not licensed. It's also painfully
obvious to the police officer that someone is using an illegal jammer,
as his radar display shows zero when his signal is being jammed. Only a
jammer would cause his display to read zero.

Every other method which has been proposed has been debunked. Or, [[the
