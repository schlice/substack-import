**Content:** [GM would have filed Chapter 11, their debt would have been
renegotiated, the portions of the business not directly related to
making cars would have been spun off and sold, and the company would
have emerged leaner and able to support itself.\
\
Or the company would have shuttered, the portions of the company not
directly related to building cars (i.e. OEM parts) would have been sold
and opened as new, independent businesses, the economy of Detroit would
be in shambles, and the rest of the auto industry would be taking over
the holes in the auto industry by GM\'s departure.\
\
Should the government have done what it did? That\'s a matter of debate.
Libertarians believe the government should not have bailed GM out, and
should have allowed market forces to run as they normally do. The
economic impact felt by Detroit would have been a major wake-up call to
the fact that they have put all their eggs in one
basket.]{.rendered_qtext}
