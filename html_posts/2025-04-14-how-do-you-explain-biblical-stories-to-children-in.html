Get yourself a good Children's Story Bible.

I like the "read to me" Bibles that present the chapters of the Bible in
very kid-friendly readable ways. I used Bibles like these as bedtime
stories. I think I read through it more than once with each of my boys.

But there are indeed other types of children's Bibles that they can use
to study from themselves. They have varying amounts of pictures and "did
you know" boxes to keep kids engaged.
