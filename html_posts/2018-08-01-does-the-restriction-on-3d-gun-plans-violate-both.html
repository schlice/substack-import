**What justification are these state AGs using to block Defense
Distributed from publishing information in opposition to the 1st and 2nd
Amendment combined with the Supremacy clause via the settlement with the
Federal Government?**

The State AGs filed injunctions against the settlement that allowed
Defense Distributed to publish its plans for 3-D renderings of guns
online because they claim it violates their 10th Amendment rights to
make their own laws, specifically laws which allow them to regulate
certain firearms for which Defense Distributed is providing plans.

This doesn't stop the plans that are already out there for which anyone
with basic metalworking knowledge can use, but presumably this is more
of an existential threat because "anyone with a 3-D printer and an
Internet connection" can now print their own guns. Apparently, the fear
here is that anyone can buy a cheap (?) 3-D printer and start pumping
out untraceable guns, and "the streets will be awash in blood."

As you can imagine, that statement is only slightly hyperbolic.

**You can't 3-D print an AR-15.**

You might be able to 3-D print the AR-15 *lower* out of sufficiently
strong plastic, but there's no guarantee that it will be able to handle
the stress of firing a bullet for more than a few shots. And only the
lower is regulated. The rest of the parts can be ordered online because
they're not considered *guns*. Only the lower is regulated and
serialized.

You can legally buy an "80% lower," which is basically a big block of
metal that requires millwork before it becomes an AR-15 lower, and that
has existed forever.

Plans for plastic 3-D printed guns have been around for ages, and even
older plans for fashioning homemade guns are still in print today. In
those ancient things called *books*, I'm told.

You can make a zip gun that fires 12 gauge rounds for about \$7 in parts
from the hardware store (by the way, if the zombie apocalypse ever
comes, I'll make you a zip gun in exchange for whatever the new currency
becomes after world governments are eaten by zombies).

But anyway, I'm pretty sure that this injunction against the
distribution of the plans by this company will fall on the 1st Amendment
side, since there is ample evidence that plans for plastic guns have
existed on the Internet for ages, and the streets are not similarly
awash in blood.
