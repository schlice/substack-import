First of all, while I will answer the question, the real answer is "it
depends." The process for filling vacancies on an active Board is part
of your individual Governing Documents.

But in general, the remaining Board members can appoint a replacement
Board member who will serve until the next election.

Remember, your mileage may vary, as every set of Governing Documents is
different and they can all define how Board members are replaced during
a service cycle, and both state law as well as Governing Documents may
be controlling in any one HOA.
