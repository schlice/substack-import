**As a libertarian, do you support laws banning non-medical circumcision
of male babies?**

Libertarians believe that parents have the right to raise their children
in the way they see fit, "according to their own standards and beliefs,
provided that the rights of children to be free from abuse and neglect
are also protected."[\[1\]](#dxFbh){#cite-dxFbh .citation_link}

Therefore, in order to support such a law, you have to make the case
that circumcision is abuse or neglect.

While it may be unnecessary cosmetic surgery, it is not harmful and
causes no long term damage. No bodily functions are harmed by the
surgery. Therefore, it cannot be classified as "abuse" or "neglect."

Since we have determined that circumcision is cosmetic surgery, in order
to support such a law, you have to make the case that parents do not
have the right to consent to cosmetic surgery on behalf of the children
for whom they are responsible.

A Libertarian would not make that case.

Therefore, a Libertarian would not support a law banning non-medical
circumcision of male babies.

Some people like to comment. Some people like to engage with me in a
civil manner, and I did kinda miss that\...a little. But do not
misunderstand, I take this step very cautiously, and I have no tolerance
for harassing or inane behavior. If you don\'t like what I wrote, tough
shit. If my answer is grammatically low-quality or is un-cited opinion
masquerading as fact, downvote it. If you think I\'m wrong, write your
own answer. But Quora is a question-and-answer site, not a debate site.
If you are simply commenting to tell me \"ackshually, you\'re wrong,\"
don\'t be surprised if I quietly delete your comment. Put anything
vaguely harassing in there, and your deletion will be followed by a
block/mute, and a BNBR report. I will do this immediately and with no
compunction. You have been warned. Be nice.*
