The answer, as with all legal answers, is "it depends." And note that
this is an answer exclusive to labor laws in the United States; other
countries may be different.

In this case, it depends on whether or not you are an "at-will"
employee, or a "contract" employee.

A "contract employee" has signed an employment contract which specifies
things like the term of employment, the reimbursement rate, and how
employment will be terminated. If you are a contract employee, you must
follow your contract's rules about how to sever your employment. If your
contract requires a certain timeframe between notification of
termination and actual work end date, you must follow that, or you could
be in breach of contract.

For everyone else, most states follow the "at-will employment" model.
Both the employer and the employee can terminate the working
relationship at any time for any reason, or no reason at all, with the
exception of the fact that employers cannot terminate employees for
legally-restricted reasons (age, sex, religion, country of national
origin, color, etc). If you are an at-will employee, you technically do
not legally need to inform your employer of your desire to terminate the
employment relationship until you are walking out the door. All things
considered, you probably should give them some heads-up. Traditionally,
employees would provide "two week's notice" before leaving in order to
give the employer an opportunity to have you train someone else in your
job, or to find a replacement, but today that is just a formality. It is
not legally required to give two week's notice before you leave. You can
literally stand up and say, "I quit," drop your company-owned equipment
on the desk, and walk out.
