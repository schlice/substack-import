So hold on here a second, let me see if I understand your question. Are
you saying that only the theist has a burden of proof to meet? Are you
claiming that the atheist doesn't also have a burden of proof? In other
words, are you suggesting that it requires too many leaps of faith to be
a theist? Are you saying **it doesn't require any faith to be an
atheist?** And are you also saying that the burden of proof required for
the atheist is somehow so much less than what is required for the
theist?

Because that would be a mistake. In fact, it requires **much more
faith** to be an atheist than it does to be a theist.

The atheist makes a claim that there is no god. This is an untenable
position to hold from a philosophical standpoint. As legal scholar and
philosopher Mortimer Adler says, \"An affirmative existential
proposition can be proved, but a negative existential proposition\--one
that denies the existence of something\--cannot be proved.\" For
example, someone may claim that a red eagle exists and someone else may
assert that red eagles do not exist. The former only needs to find a
single red eagle to prove his assertion. But the latter must comb the
entire universe and literally be in every place at once to ensure they
have not missed a red eagle somewhere and at some time, which is
impossible to do. This is why intellectually honest atheists will admit
they cannot prove God does not exist.

There's also the question about the seriousness of the charge. Being an
atheist isn't just a lifestyle choice. It could have serious
consequences, which could potentially be an eternal mistake. To
understand the seriousness of the charge and the evidence required,
let's look at an example. If someone set two glasses of lemonade in
front of you and told you to drink one, but one glass might be more tart
than the other, you probably wouldn't need a whole lot of evidence
before deciding which one to drink. But if instead you were told that
one was sweetened with sugar and the other with rat poison, you'd need
tons of evidence before you took a drink.

This is where a person sits when they are deciding whether or not to
live as a theist or as an atheist. Since being an atheist could possibly
result in irreparable and eternal consequences, it would seem that the
atheist should be required to produce detailed and overriding evidence
to support their position, *but they cannot*. **Atheism simply cannot
meet the test for evidence for the seriousness of the charge it makes.**
Instead, the atheists and those whom they convince of their position
slide into eternity with their fingers crossed and hope they do not find
the unpleasant truth that eternity does indeed exist and that such a
place is an awfully long time to be wrong. As Mortimer Adler says, "More
consequences for life and action follow from the affirmation or denial
of God than from any other basic question."

Being a theist doesn't prevent me from doing anything in my life that
the atheist can do. So living as a theist gives me exactly the same kind
of life that living as an atheist does. In other words, **it doesn't
cost me anything to be a theist, and the potential benefit is eternal.**
So to repeat a catchphrase:

***If I'm wrong, and there is no god, I've lost nothing. But if you're
wrong and there is a god, you've lost everything.***

Original question:

**Why can\'t theists meet their burden of proof about God? Then say
faith is a good enough reason to believe in God . Faith is ignorance not
evidence based**
