63 years later and the message is the same. The army doesn't matter,
whether it's the US Army or the British Army. If you're going to win a
war, you must have control of the air. Period. No army is "too"
dependent on air power. *Every* army depends on air power. If they
don't, it's because they don't really want to win.

So the message is clear: you must control the air to win the war; no
major war can be won without controlling the air.
