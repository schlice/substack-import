**Content:** [Are you kidding???\
\
There are hardly any regulations on pepper spray. As a matter of fact,
pepper spray is legal to carry in all 50 states.\
\
There are some restrictions on where pepper spray can be shipped by
sellers to independent buyers, but for the most part if you buy pepper
spray in a store you can carry it out. No background check, no license,
no training, nothing. It\'s no more complicated than buying a bottle of
water.\
\
I think there is at least one more regulation than that when buying a
gun.\

One or two.]{.rendered_qtext}
