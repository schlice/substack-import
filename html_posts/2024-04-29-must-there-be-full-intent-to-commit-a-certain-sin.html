We are guilty of all sin. We are guilty of sin we intend to commit. We
are guilty of sin we did not intend to commit. Sin is sin, whether we
intended to commit it or not.

The difference: **saved people should not intentionally sin.** But
that's not the question you asked.

To answer this question, we are guilty of all sin. All sin convicts us,
and it is impossible for us to do anything to save ourselves from the
conviction of sin.

Only faith in Christ can save you from your sin.
