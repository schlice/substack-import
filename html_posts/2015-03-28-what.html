**Content:** [My grandpa was a New York cop, and my dad was also a New
York police officer, and later detective. Growing up, I was always in
the police station. I knew many of the cops and detectives who worked in
the precinct, in the ESB (Emergency Services Bureau), and in the squad.
I was always around cops, and they were like family to me. I saw their
good sides and their bad sides. I watched the modernization (and
subsequent militarization) of the police force; I watched the transition
from revolvers to 9mm pistols. I watched the veterans squawk and blanch
at the changes, and the younger guys accept it more readily. Remember
*NYPD Blue*, where Jimmy Smits\' character carried a 9mm, and Dennis
Franz\'s character carried a S&W Chief\'s Special .38? Yeah, that show
actually got that part exactly right. I can attest to that.\
\
So when I was walking home from school and I rounded the corner and saw
police cars at my house, it was no big deal. There was always police
cars at my house. When my dad was in ESB, there were occasionally large
police tow trucks at my house (you\'ve seen the ones, that can pull a
Sherman tank). All of which was no big deal.\
\
But a crime scene truck? That one was new.\
\
And boy, there sure are a lot of cars here today, wonder what\'s going
on.\
\
Then I saw my mom crying because they took her engagement ring. Along
with the TVs, the 8-track (that was a huge blow - how was I going to
play my Meat Loaf album, which they conveniently left behind?), the
stereo, and my dad\'s service revolver. They politely left his duty belt
though. I was fine with the support and protection we received (because
it was great). I felt violated and scared and hollow when I saw my mom
crying. But I was never scared of the police.\
\
I was, however, scared of my dad. I can remember one time my friends and
I riding our bikes around one of the \"sumps\" (rainwater reclamation
sumps) that the county maintained throughout town. They were big
fenced-off pits in the ground, roughly a 1/8 acre plot of land with a
6\' flat rim at ground level and steeply sloped sides sunk a good 12\'
into the ground, sorta like an in-ground swimming pool. Stormwater
drains emptied into these sumps so that rain water could be reclaimed
into the water table (where our drinking water came from). They were
almost always bone dry. And great places for kids to ride dirt bikes.
Except that no one but county DPW (Department of Public Works) workers
was allowed in there. We\'d often build dirt bike tracks around the rim
and spend our days racing and jumping and generally not bothering
anyone.\
\
Until one day when we apparently bothered someone and they called the
police. We were all brought out of the sump one at a time and they took
our names, addresses, phone numbers, and schools where we attended. The
officer wrote them down on a yellow legal pad. Then he told us to go on
home.\
\
I wasn\'t scared of what the police were going to do. I was scared that
my dad would find out because he was Supercop and he\'d find out
eventually (or so I had worked myself up to think). I initially thought
the officers would recognize the name and go tell him, but you don\'t
work the precinct in which you live, so they apparently weren\'t aware
of him in our home precinct. Then I thought he or someone he knew would
be reading the blotter and see my name come across and he\'d come home
furious. I waited for him to come storming into my room when he came
home from a shift and be madder than Hell. Turns out he never found out,
and after a week or so of worrying when the boom was going to fall, it
never did.\
\
So as a kid, I didn\'t break the law because I was more scared of my dad
than I was of any punishment the police could give me.]{.rendered_qtext}
