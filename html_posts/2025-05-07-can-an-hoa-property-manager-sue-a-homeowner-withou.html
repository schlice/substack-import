No, a property manager cannot typically file a lawsuit on behalf of an
HOA.

Generally, the HOA board of directors or the HOA itself must engage the
HOA attorney to represent them in legal matters, including filing a
lawsuit. Property managers may assist the board in coordinating with
legal counsel, but they generally cannot act as the HOA\'s legal
representative.
