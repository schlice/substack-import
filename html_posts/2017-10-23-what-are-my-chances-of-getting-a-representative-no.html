It depends on how many people apply in your year and how many available
openings your representative has at that institution. Each
Representative can have no more than five cadets in any service academy
at any one time, so your chances depend on how many slots that
Representative has currently open, how many nominations he/she plans on
giving, and how many people apply.

As far as whether or not any one representative will be more or less
difficult from which to secure a nomination, no one can really say. They
will all use some combination of application, test, essay writing, and
board interview in order to grant a nomination, so at least that much
will be similar.
