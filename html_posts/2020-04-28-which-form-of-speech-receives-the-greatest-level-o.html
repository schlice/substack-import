**Which form of speech receives the greatest level of First Amendment
protection?**

That's not the way the Constitution works.

**All speech is protected. Period.**

But you've also probably heard that "Constitutional rights are not
unlimited." In practice, what this means is that at this point (all
speech is protected), **we carve out individual "exceptions" to that
general rule.**

Because one guy one time walked into a crowded movie theater and shouted
"FIRE!" and a whole bunch of people panicked and got hurt and he said,
"but all speech is protected!"

So lawmakers decided that all speech is protected, **unless** your
speech intentionally causes harm to someone.

And then another guy said, "That girl over there kills puppies and makes
soup out of their eyeballs" and that girl ended up losing her job over
the false accusation and the guy said, "but all speech is protected!"

So lawmakers decided that all speech is protected, unless your speech
intentionally causes harm to someone, or unless your speech is a lie
which hurts someone.

And then another girl said, "Cops are pigs! Hey, there's a cop over
there, let's go kill him!" And the crowd listened to her and they killed
the cop-pig, and she said, "but all speech is protected!"

So lawmakers decided that all speech is protected, unless your speech
intentionally causes harm to someone, or unless your speech is a lie
which hurts someone, or "incites violence" (causes others to commit
violence).

And that's how Constitutional protections work.

**TL;DR: The right is universal, with exceptions.** It is not that some
speech is "more protected" than other speech. It's that all speech is
protected, with the exception of certain forms of speech.

*Note: pronouns are used to distinguish people in this hypothetical
example; it's not an implication that women kill puppies. Try to employ
some common sense.*
