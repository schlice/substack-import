**Content:** [If an officer of a matching gender is available, you
should try to get that person there.\
\
However, if not, pat downs are appropriate.\
\
Don\'t forget, in today\'s marriage-equality world, even a same-sex pat
down could possibly be \"groping.\"\
\
One technique we learned to avoid groping accusations was to search
sensitive areas with the back of the hand. It\'s very difficult to grope
someone with the back of your hand, and it is still sensitive enough to
detect a concealed weapon.]{.rendered_qtext}
