You don\'t believe that the ***fully-constituted*** militias of all 50
states can quickly and easily overrun the US military?

The US military would be insane to try to take on the fully-constituted
force of all 48 contiguous states\' militias.

Besides, in a nation of laws, the military force that is created and
authorized only through the force of law will have a very difficult time
following an order that is, by its very nature, antithetical to that
law: attack US citizens. Most military members will not comply with such
an unlawful order; as the Nazi war crimes trials showed, \"I was just
following orders\" is not a defense. Military officers have the
authority, and the responsibility, to ignore unlawful orders.
