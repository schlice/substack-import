My neurologist used to tell me that the most "conservative" approach to
treating MS is to "conserve" as much brain tissue as possible.
Therefore, starting one of the approved MS therapy drugs as soon as
possible will help to slow down the disease progression and delay the
onset of the more serious effects of the disease.

It is also true in the MS world that *the longer you go between
relapses, the longer you will go until your next relapse.* In other
words, current disease activity is the best predictor of future disease
activity.

When I was initially in treatment, it was still a debated topic whether
or not early intervention could stave off more serious disability more
effectively than waiting for a second symptom disseminated by space and
time. But my neurologist was ahead of his time, and he advised me to
start treatment as soon as possible, even with only one visible symptom.
And I'm glad he did.

Nowadays, it's a given that the sooner you start MS treatment once
you're diagnosed, the more likely you will be to stave off the worst
effects of the disease for longer, and the better chance you'll have for
a long life without the worst effects of the disease.
