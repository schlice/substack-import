**What should you never say to a police officer while you\'re being
searched?**

OFFICER: Do you have any sharp objects in your pockets?

YOU: No, they damage the dime bags

\

YOU: No, that's not a gun in my pocket, but I am happy to see you.

\

YOU: If you happen to casually find, oh I dunno, a \$50 bill in my front
left pocket, you can have it if you let me go.

I'm sure there's more. I'll add more as I think of them.
