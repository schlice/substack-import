No

The justices submitted an unsigned opinion. Unsigned opinions do not set
precedent. The ruling affirms the Oklahoma Supreme Court\'s decision,
which simply says that *this* charter, for *this* charter school, in
*this* state, violates the Oklahoma Constitution and the US
Constitution.

If the court wanted to set precedent, they would have published a signed
opinion along with their reasoning. They chose not to do this, so there
is no precedent set in this case. Religious groups are free to bring
further cases discussing this particular issue in the future.
