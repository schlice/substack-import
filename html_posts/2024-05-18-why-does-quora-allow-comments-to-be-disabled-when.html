  ask and answer? And as a follow up, why do people post and then disable comments?"'

You answered your own question.

Someone asks a question, and someone else answers it. Comments are
superfluous and are only permitted at the whim of the answerer.

**While the community owns questions, I own my answer and any/all
comments on it.ยน** I can enable them or disable them. I can accept them
and then delete any I don't think enhance my answer. My answer, my
comments.

Sometimes, an answer can become more contentious than it was originally
thought to be, and the comments section becomes too overwhelming to
maintain, so some answerers will just shut it off. In the cases where I
had to do that, I'd go and edit my answer and add some sort of note
saying "I had to shut off comments because the Neanderthals among you
can't be civil" or some such wording.

\

ยน The major exception is Spaces, which can have their own rules about
disabling/deleting comments.
