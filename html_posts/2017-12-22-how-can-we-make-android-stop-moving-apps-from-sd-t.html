**How can we make Android stop moving apps from SD to internal storage
after they update?**

You can't. It's a function of the app environment in the OS. In fact,
Android does not natively support applications running from SD. You can
only accomplish this using 3rd party software packages anyway, and in
some cases, rooting.

**It is clearly a ploy to use up internal memory and force people to
upgrade.**

It is not clearly a ploy of any kind. It's simply not supported on
Android natively. The app, therefore, is installing according to
Android's rules, and when it upgrades, it does so to internal memory.
You have to **force** an app to SD with 3rd party apps.
