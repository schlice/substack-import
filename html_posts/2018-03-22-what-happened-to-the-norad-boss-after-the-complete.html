**What happened to the NORAD boss after the complete failure on 9/11?**

Nothing.

Because despite what [[Marc
Leeser](https://www.quora.com/profile/Marc-Leeser)]{.qlink_container}
and the OP would have you believe, **no one in the military "failed" on
9/11**.

Up until September 11, 2001, the military was focused on threats coming
from *outside* of the country. Why was that? First of all, it's because
*the law demanded it*. The Posse Comitatus Act and the Insurrection Act,
which are two of the oldest Federal laws in the country, forbids the
military from acting within US borders, enforcing US laws. In order to
get the military to engage domestically, it literally took an act of God
and Congress. So NORAD's air defense posture was to watch the ADIZ for
incoming aircraft. Read this answer for more details about that.

NORAD was **never** permitted to even so much as *look* at US aircraft,
operating within US airspace, with valid flight plans. That was the
jurisdiction of the FAA, not NORAD. Of course, NORAD had direct lines to
the FAA regional centers (and still does) so that we can coordinate
response when intruders cross the ADIZ into North American airspace, but
for domestic flights, we had no jurisdiction.

Therefore, on the morning of September 11th, NORAD crews saw **nothing
out of the ordinary**. The FAA was tracking some aircraft which had gone
off-course, but that was not a military concern. It was a *domestic*
concern, which would be handled by *domestic* law enforcement, not the
military.

We all saw the same thing that you saw, at the same time you saw it,
live, on TV, after the first plane had crashed into 1 WTC, and Paula
Zahn was covering it live, and the second plane crashed into 2 WTC,
right over her shoulder.

That's when everyone's collective minds went from, "This is highly
unusual but still could have been a tragic accident" to "This is
deliberate." But that didn't change the fact that even though US
military leaders had a good idea that the attack was deliberate, they
had no authority to *do* anything; they had no mechanism by which they
could do anything legally.

The military underwent some massive changes following 9/11. Besides the
Homeland Security Act which established the Department of Homeland
Security, President Bush also approved a new Unified Command Plan (UCP)
which created US Northern Command (USNORTHCOM). According to the UCP,
Northern Command\'s mission is to:

- Conduct operations to deter, prevent, and defeat threats and
  aggression aimed at the United States, its territories, and interests
  within the assigned area of responsibility and,
- As directed by the President or Secretary of Defense provide military
  assistance to civil authorities including consequence management
  operations

USNORTHCOM has participated in several domestic "consequence management
operations" since 9/11, and has remained on standby to assist the
President with providing military assistance to civilians.

But I bet you can already see the problem: the Posse Comitatus Act as
well as the Insurrection Act which still prevent the US military from
enforcing Federal or State laws. They did try to give NORTHCOM more
authority, but the nation's oldest laws held firm:

> The Military Commissions Act of 2006 lifted many restrictions placed
> on the military to support civilian administration by the Posse
> Comitatus Act, however the US Supreme Court ruled in June 2008 that
> significant portions of the MCA were unconstitutional. The \"John
> Warner Defense Authorization Act of 2007\" H.R. 5122 (2006)
> effectively nullified the limits of the Insurrection Act when it was
> passed; however, the bill was amended in
> 2008.[\[1\]](#LIflo){#cite-LIflo .citation_link}

The amendment to the Defense Authorization Act in 2008 essentially
gutted most of the nullification of the Insurrection Act.

As you can see, there is still significant uncertainty pertaining to
what the military is actually authorized to do when it comes to
supporting state law enforcement when discussing situations internal to
the homeland.
