Woohoo! Bring it on! I'll get my 15 minutes of fame on your YouTube
channel, viewed by your tens of subscribers.

See, cops don't become cops to be loved. Wanna be loved? Be a
firefighter. Everyone loves them. I'm fully aware that when I step into
a public area, there is always at least one camera somewhere recording
everything I do (primarily because someone is just itching for me to
screw up), and in some amount of time in the future, there will be one
on **me** recording everything I do (because the people itching for me
to screw up learned about body cams and tricked politicians into making
me do my own dirty work at taxpayer expense).

I am in public, I have nothing to hide, nor do I have any legal
expectation of privacy. So record away. But keep your distance.

And when I make it on to your YouTube channel, be a dear and send me the
link!
