**How do you survive a false rape accusations as a politician? Something
like \"You assaulted me 45 years ago, and I have waited all these years
for no reason.\"**

There are several ways to do it. Clarence Thomas survived exactly this
type of accusation, and he did so by denying that any sexual assault
ever occurred. He was nominated anyway, and is now on the Supreme Court.
The FBI did investigate his case, and found it to be "unfounded."

In Judge Kavanaugh's confirmation circus, the FBI also reviewed the
letter from Dr. Ford, and forwarded it to the White House. In this case,
there is no criminal investigation to be had here, as not only has the
statute of limitations long since expired, but there is also no
allegation of a federal crime. The FBI has already completed a
background investigation, but it does not routinely check the veracity
of any derogatory information it gets. It compiles that information and
passes it on to the White House. It does not do any additional
investigation, unless the White House asks them to do so, since it is
the White House's nominee. The White House can ask the FBI to re-open
the background investigation, but Trump has already stated that he is
loathe to do that.

The Judiciary Committee has given the victim the opportunity to testify,
and the presence or absence of an FBI investigation should have no
bearing on her testimony, especially since she has no authority to
demand that the FBI investigate, and neither does the Senate Judiciary
Committee. They can ask the FBI to investigate a crime that they become
aware of, but there is no alleged Federal crime here. The only thing the
FBI could do would be to re-open the background investigation, which it
cannot do without a go-ahead from the White House.

So how do you survive? Continue to tell the truth. If it didn't happen,
it didn't happen. You have two independent people who claim it didn't
happen, and one who did. And at this point, it's all circumstantial,
with poor memories all around.

That's not to say that it didn't happen, or that it did. It's also not
to disparage victims of sexual assault, which is indeed terrible. What
matters here, in this case, is what can be proven beyond a reasonable
doubt, and with a more than 30 year old allegation, there is nothing
here which can be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.
