**It\'s said that a sitting president can\'t be indicted since it would
disrupt the Executive branch. WHY? S/he has a vice-president who was
chosen to take over presidential duties. And there\'s a hand-picked
cabinet, all representing his/her views.**

There are several theories about why this is. Note that these are all
theories; while Nixon was going to possibly be indicted, he resigned
before that happened. No one has ever attempted to indict a sitting
President.

First, the Constitution vests executive power *solely* in the President
himself. Prosecuting crimes is an executive power. All other executive
offices (such as the Department of Justice) are empowered to indict
people only by **delegation** of authority from the President.
Therefore, unless the President *consents to be* indicted, he can't be,
because no person or agency may exercise the President's Constitutional
power in a manner to which he would not consent. If the President does
not consent to be indicted, then his authority is not delegated, and he
may not be indicted.

Second, the Constitution already has a remedy for elected officials who
commit "high crimes and misdemeanors": *impeachment*. The correct
Constitutional procedure is for the President to be impeached by the
House, removed from office by the Senate, and ***then***, only after he
is out of office, can he be indicted.

Finally, ***especially if he is not impeached, or even if he is
impeached and not removed from office***, the statute of limitations
would most likely be tolled (paused) until he does leave office, so once
he leaves office at the natural conclusion of his term, he can then be
indicted.

By the way, once he is removed from office following the
Constitutionally-approved method, one of his successors takes over
according to the Presidential Succession Act.
