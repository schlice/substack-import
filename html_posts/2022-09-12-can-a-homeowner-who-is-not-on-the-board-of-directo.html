As with all legal questions, the answer is "it depends."

Some HOAs have in their Governing Documents binding arbitration clauses.
If yours does, then as a homeowner, you can sue, but you will have to go
to binding arbitration rather than court.

And since lawsuits are usually between a homeowner and the HOA (of which
Board members and the management company are a part), it doesn't make
sense that only the Board or the management company could sue the HOA.
