Let me ask a countervailing question:

Is there any evidence of a crime? Clinton was impeached for lying under
oath to Congress. That\'s a crime. What crime is implicated by colluding
with Russians to convince stupid Americans to not think for themselves?
And what magic bullet do Russians have that somehow would make people
vote Republican when they are Democrat or Independent? You really think
a Facebook ad would do it? If so, we need to find those advertisers,
because I have some products to move...

Seriously, where is the crime? Please, someone tell me.

And another thing: you appoint a special ***prosecutor*** when you have
a crime to prosecute, not when you conduct a fishing expedition, trying
to find a crime. But hey, its only my money you\'re spending on this
fishing trip.
