**Content:** [The most likely answer: the gas station attendant called
the police and reported someone loitering in their parking lot. When a
business is open, the parking spaces for that business are for the
exclusive use of the customers of that business. When you park in one of
those spaces and you\'re not a customer, the business has the right to
question what you\'re doing. Because of the late hour, I can imagine the
attendant not checking the occupant out himself and just calling the
police to do it.\
\
When police are contacted directly about an individual, they are
obligated to check it out and see why you\'re loitering in the parking
lot of a business which is still open. They did so, they did not ask you
to do anything illegal, they asked you some basic questions and ran a
basic check for wants and warrants to see if you were a criminal running
from the law. Clearly, they believed your story.\
\
Directing you to a business which is not 24 hours to catch some shuteye
was the appropriate action for the officer to take.\
\
Also, waving off the lookey-loos was another good thing. Notice the
difference between the attitude they presented to you and the attitude
they presented to the other loiterers. They were a bit more harsh with
the loiterers than they were with you. This, again, is a sign that they,
at least at first blush, believed you.]{.rendered_qtext}
