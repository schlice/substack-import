It's not "contradictory." It's "illogical." It's what we call "blind
faith." Nevertheless, millions of believers who have been believers
their whole lives have believed without understanding *why* they believe
or *what* they believe and if there is any good evidence to support
their belief. That doesn't invalidate their belief (they believe the
right thing, and it matches what they know in their heart), but it's
still blind faith.

This is where the discipline of ***apologetics*** comes into play.
Apologetics is the discipline of defending religious doctrine through
systematic argumentation and discourse. The word "apologetics" comes
from the Greek ἀπολογία, which translates to "speaking in defense."

Despite what most people think about apologetics, that those of us who
practice it are just out to prove everyone wrong, we apologists are
actually here to prove ourselves *right*, to ourselves. We'd love to
impart some knowledge along the way, but apologetics allows us to
worship *better*.

The Great Commandment in Christianity is to love the Lord your God with
all your heart, all your soul, all your strength, and most importantly
in this context, **all your mind**. How do you love God with your mind?
You prepare yourself to answer questions of faith, like why do you
believe what you believe.

Apologetics helps the godly man to be "equipped" to do the work of God.
Our men's Bible study was titled "Equippers" for this reason.

**TL;DR:** It is possible to have belief alone without evidence. It
doesn't discount the belief and it doesn't minimize the faith. But the
faith could be ***so much deeper*** if the believer understood the why's
and how's behind what they believe.
