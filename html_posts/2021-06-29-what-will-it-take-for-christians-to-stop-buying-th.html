Proof. Overwhelming, convincing, literal proof in front of our eyes,
that we can see and touch. Literal proof right in front of us that there
is no God.

That's what we'd need to even consider abandoning faith.

There is precedent for those who needed proof. Thomas was one of Jesus'
disciples, and he refused to believe that Jesus was raised from the dead
until he had literal proof in front of his eyes, that he could see and
touch. The Bible recorded what happened next. The disciples had gathered
as they did every week, in a locked upper room (as they were being
hunted by the authorities at the time). Jesus had appeared to them
before, but Thomas was not with them. We pick up the story from there:

> Now Thomas (also known as Didymus), one of the Twelve, was not with
> the disciples when Jesus came. So the other disciples told him, "We
> have seen the Lord!"

> But he said to them, "Unless I see the nail marks in his hands and put

> not believe."

>
> Then Jesus told him, "Because you have seen me, you have believed;
> blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed." --- John
> 20:24--29 NIV

(By the way, the phrase "doubting Thomas" came from here)

Thomas needed to see Jesus to believe. And while that was fine for
Jesus, he also says, "blessed are those who have not seen, and yet have
believed." Jesus acknowledges that we will not be able to touch the nail
holes in his hand, or put our hand in his side where he was pierced by
the centurion's spear. But how wonderful is it for us, who didn't have
the luxury of those things, to still believe that he was raised from the
dead and takes away the sins of those who believe in him?

Since the only "proof" so far that god does not exist is being promised
by atheism, and atheism makes the claim that there is no god, let's turn
the question on them:

**When will atheism be able to present the proof that Christians need in
order for them to believe there is no god?**

They can't. Atheism is based on faith that their presumption about
science is correct. Atheism says that because you can't see God in a
microscope or a telescope means that he doesn't exist, and faith is
silly at best. Of course, they fail to see that the scientific method
simply isn't able to answer metaphysical questions very well.
Nevertheless, atheism is indeed a religious worldview. Just because it
doesn't have a higher power doesn't make it any less of a religion. The
theist looks at the totality of the circumstances and says, "there is a
god" while the atheist does the same and states, with exactly the same
level of conviction, "there is no god." They both operate from a primary
belief (and faith) that results in their own particular worldview.

But you can't prove a negative.

As legal scholar and philosopher Mortimer Adler says, "An affirmative
existential proposition can be proved, but a negative existential
proposition---one that denies the existence of something---cannot be
proved."

So atheism makes a claim that it can never prove. Therefore, Christians
will continue to believe that God exists, and atheists will slide into
eternity with their fingers crossed, hoping that they don't find out the
unpleasant truth that eternity does indeed exist, and it's an awfully
long time to be wrong. Adler continues on to say, "More consequences for
life and action follow from the affirmation or denial of God than from
any other basic question."

And there's no penalty in life to living in Christian faith. There's
nothing I can't do in this life that I could do if I were an atheist. I
haven't lost anything by being a Christian. At worst, the time I've
spent in fellowship has made me a better person, and that is certainly a
laudable goal, if nothing else. Basically, I look at it using the old
comparison: if I'm wrong, and there is no god, I've lost nothing. But if
you're wrong, and there is a god, you've lost *everything*.
