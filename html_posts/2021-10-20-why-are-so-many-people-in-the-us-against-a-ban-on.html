It's distasteful to make a profit off of someone else's health. As if
some greedy fat-cat banker tycoon is reclining in his million-dollar
mansion funded by the deaths of innocent people.

That's the image. It's certainly not the reality. But in reality, profit
driving a hospital's medical decisions is a distasteful topic. People
don't want their healthcare decisions dictated by a hospital's
cost/benefit calculation.

It can be done (with proper rules and oversight/regulation), but people
still find the whole notion distasteful. And they are concerned about
abuses in the name of profit.

Just take a look at the one segment of the healthcare industry which
remains unregulated: **air ambulances**. Just look what happens when a
Federal law says you can't regulate the costs of the service:

The video is relatively long in YouTube terms (\~22 minutes), but if you
really want to understand why our air ambulance system is broken, watch
this video.

The brief upshot of the video: air ambulance providers successfully
lobbied to classify their business as an **airline** rather than as an
**ambulance**. What difference does this make? Federal deregulation of
airlines (thanks to the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978) *removed
Federal controls over fares*.

When you're the only game in town, and Federal law cannot intervene on
your pricing, and your air ambulance is owned by a group of investors
and not by a group of doctors, prices necessarily increase far above the
cost of running the service to whatever health insurance will pay.

If it is going to be done at all, it must be done carefully and with
proper controls in place before people will accept it.
