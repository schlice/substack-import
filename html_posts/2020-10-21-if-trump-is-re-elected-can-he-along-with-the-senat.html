**If Trump is re-elected, can he, along with the Senate and possibly the
Supreme Court, rule Nancy Pelosi out of power?**

The only way anyone can "force" Pelosi out of the Speakership is to
change control of the House. If the Democrats retain control of the
House, they can choose the Speaker. No one else has authority to select
the Speaker but the House.

If you want Pelosi out, vote Republican in November.
