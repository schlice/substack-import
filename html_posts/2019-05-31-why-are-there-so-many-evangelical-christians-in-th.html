**Why are there so many evangelical Christians in the U.S. military when
their Jesus wouldn\'t have bombed countless foreign nations to expand
U.S. corporations\' access to foreign markets?**

It is interesting, isn't it? Why are there so many religious people in
the military, which in a nutshell exists to kill people and blow stuff
up?

The bottom line is that God places people into government in order to
rule over nations. Part of government's responsibility is defense. There
are plenty of examples in the Bible which show that it is indeed
Biblical for a nation to defend itself using warfare.

If you're thinking, "But the Bible says 'Thou shalt not kill,'" you're
probably thinking of the King James Version. The more appropriate
translation of that phrase is "Thou shalt not murder." Most situations
in warfare are not murder.

As for your accusation that the US military is nothing more than a
political tool, you're absolutely right. The military is indeed a
projection of the political will of the United States. But when you say
that we've literally slaughtered people just to somehow make other
nations do business with us, you're slightly hyperbolic and really off
the mark. It's like the one I hear all the time: "The Iraq War was all
about oil!" In a way, it was. Oil is part of the US economy, a very big
part. Indeed, oil is a big part of the world economy. Disrupting that
flow of oil, especially through an illegal incursion of one country into
another, would have had a major impact on our own economy. It's one of
the reasons the US Navy is keeping shipping lanes open throughout the
world and helping to defend against pirates: it benefits our economy. So
yes, keeping oil flowing is a major benefit to the US economy, and is
therefore something we're going to ensure continues.

And it's okay for a religious person to do those things.
