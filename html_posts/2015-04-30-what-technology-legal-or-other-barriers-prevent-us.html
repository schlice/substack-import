**Content:** [The folks over at
[[EveryCaller.com](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=316146&url=http://everycaller.com){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="everycaller.com"}]{.qlink_container} are working on porting
their popular Call Control system for mobiles to a small device that you
would put in-line to your home phone. They are calling it [[Call Control
Home](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=7efa5a&url=http://www.callcontrolhome.com){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="callcontrolhome.com"}]{.qlink_container} and it isn\'t yet
shipping (because they are working on crowdfunding it). But as far as
technology, this is the way to go.\
\
If you\'re a Linux junkie and you like open-source stuff, take a look at
setting up an
[[Asterisk](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=531c6c&url=http://www.asterisk.org){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="asterisk.org"}]{.qlink_container} PBX in your home. I know
what you\'re thinking: \"A PBX? In my house?\" It does sound a little
weird, but you get all kinds of cool features, like multiple mailboxes,
extensions for family members, etc. And it\'s open-source. But what\'s
most important here is that Asterisk hooks in to the public real-time
spam databases on the Internet (like the one at EveryCall) and can block
spam callers real-time.\
\
Legally, it\'s a bit harder. If you haven\'t done so already, you should
get on the [[National Do Not Call
Registry](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=de6d4a&url=https://www.donotcall.gov/){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="donotcall.gov"}]{.qlink_container} and once you\'re on that,
within a month, you should get fewer spam calls. If you continue to get
spam calls after being on the registry for a month, you can contact your
state\'s Attorney General\'s office (usually they have a website for
reporting spam callers) and provide as much information as you can. If
they get enough complaints, they can initiate legal action under the
spam calling laws.\
\
Here\'s a little sneakier way to handle spam callers:\
\
When a robodialer calls, press the button that indicates you\'re
interested and you\'ll get routed to a live person. Tell the person that
this is a business line, please don\'t contact us. If you happen to
start getting calls for business services, tell them that your number is
residential. They seem to respect that boundary, even when they have
little respect for the \"please don\'t contact me\" or \"please remove
me from your lists\" requests. Hey, if things are bad, it\'s worth a
try.\
\
If you have a traditional landline, some carriers have \"No
Solicitation\" services which play a pre-recorded message when anyone
calls. The message says something along the lines of \"You have reached
a number which does not accept solicitations. If you are a solicitor,
hang up now. If not, please stay on the line.\" If they stay on, then
your phone rings. You can program some phone numbers to blast right past
the message (like your family\'s cell phones).\
\
Don\'t forget that some solicitation calls can\'t be blocked; for
example, you can\'t stop getting calls from any business with whom you
have transacted within the last 6 months. You also can\'t stop political
survey calls, or research study calls.]{.rendered_qtext}
