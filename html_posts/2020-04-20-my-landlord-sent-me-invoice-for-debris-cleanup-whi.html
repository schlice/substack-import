**My landlord sent me invoice for debris cleanup which was dated one and
half months after I moved out and deducted the amount from my refund
check. Can I move to small claims court and get my money back?**

As long as the debris was not there during your close-out walkthrough
(you kept the documentation of your walkthrough with the landlord or the
property manager, right?), you should easily be able to make the claim
that the cleanup is not your responsibility.

But if you don't have documentation to show that the unit was clean
before you left, you're going to have a difficult time convincing anyone
that it was. It can be done, but it will be an uphill battle.
