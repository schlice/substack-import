Incorrect. CBD is most definitely a Schedule I drug, straight out of
Schedule I: Marijuana **and its cannabinoids, with on exception:** Pure
(--)-trans-Î”9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is also listed in Schedule III
for limited uses, under the trademark *Marinol*. Beyond that, any
cannabinoid of Marijuana is most definitely Schedule I. Marijuana is
actually listed as a "hallucinogenic substance" under Schedule I along
with any of its "salts, isomers, and salts of isomers whenever the
existence of such salts, isomers, and salts of isomers is possible
within the specific chemical designation"
