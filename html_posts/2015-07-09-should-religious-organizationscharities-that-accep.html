**Content:** [No one should be receiving charity from the government.\
\
The government should cease all charitable operations of any kind, and
return those monies to individuals.\
\
Individuals can then decide if they want to provide their money to
charitable organizations.\
\
The government was never designed to be a charity factory, and
redistribution of wealth in any form should be strongly discouraged in
the government. It creates too many entanglements from which the
government should be freed.]{.rendered_qtext}
