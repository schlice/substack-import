Is it the cell phone's fault that you practice distracted driving? Why
do we always look to technology to handle people problems?

We already have plenty of laws against distracted driving (yet we still
felt compelled to pass a new law against a particular kind of
distraction, but hey, I'm not a legislator). Do we need a new
technological solution to fight a people problem?

And even if we do, you still have to **use it** in order for it to do
any good.

*"Loss of phone privileges?"* How about loss of **car** privileges? Oh
wait, we already have that.
