**What is easier to get into? USAFA, USNA, or USCGA?**

All of the military academies are going to be challenging to get in to,
but it can be done. The challenge comes when you realize you have to be
both *appointed* by an "appointing official," and you have to be
*accepted* by the academy itself.

Appointments are given by "appointing officials:" Members of Congress,
the Vice President, and the President. Most cadets are nominated by
their Representative in the House. Getting your nomination is always a
challenge, because your member of Congress can only have five (5) cadets
in any one of the three service academies (USNA, USMA, and USAFA) at any
one time. The US Merchant Marine Academy gives ten (10) slots to each
member of Congress. The member can nominate up to ten candidates for
each slot. If they have slots, your member of Congress can nominate you
to attend more than one service academy. It's easier to get your
appointment from your Representative in the House than it is from your
state senator, the VP or POTUS, because you are dealing with a smaller
applicant pool with your Represeattive.

Next, you have to actually be *accepted* by the academy. This is just
like applying to college, but on steroids. The acceptance process is
separate from the nomination process, and is not dependent on the
nomination process. You can be nominated by your Representative and
still not be accepted by the academy, or vice versa.

USCGA is only easier because it doesn't need a nomination. You still
have to be accepted by the Coast Guard, but you don't need a nomination.
