You presumed that you're paying the same rate as other people who have
had auto claims, and that's a presumption you cannot make, and it's
largely incorrect.

Insurance companies can and do modify the rates of "problematic"
drivers. In some states, that calculus is mandated by state law. Here in
NC, "accident forgiveness" is not a thing. If you were at fault in an
accident, your insurance rates are going up, no questions asked, and
you'll pay that rate for no less than three years assuming you keep your
nose clean. That's because insurance rates are governed by *state law,*
not by the insurance company (when it comes to drivers who have negative
items on their driving history: at fault accidents, speeding tickets,
etc). The insurance company does this analysis in other states, raising
the rates charged to drivers who have negative items on their driving
history. But by and large, companies can afford to give "accident
forgiveness" in other states if it's your first minor accident and no
one was hurt and it's nothing other than an auto repair claim.

Additionally most large insurance companies offer you discounts for good
driving. Several of them offer vehicle monitoring devices which you plug
in to your OBD II port and connect to your phone, monitoring things like
excessive speed, hard braking, hard accelerating, etc. If the system
detects that you're a "good driver," you can get a discount of (in some
cases) up to 30% off of your premium. I know that Progressive and USAA
both use this system today; I'm certain other insurers do it also. So
while they may not necessarily change your premium because you're a good
driver (some do, but mostly not), they do offer *discounts* for safe
driving, and those can actually be fairly significant.
