**Since Brett Kavanaugh held a top secret security clearance in the Bush
administration, do you believe the FBI background investigation process
is flawed?**

Maybe I don't understand what you're asking.

Are you asking whether or not Kavanaugh should have ever received a TS
clearance if he's such a sexual predator? Meaning the FBI should have
caught this? I'll presume that's what you're asking.

As the subject of continuous background investigations and Periodic
Reviews (PRs), I feel reasonably qualified to answer your question.

Maybe if he underwent just one background investigation, the
investigators might have missed something. A second probably would have
picked up any missing information from the first. Three investigations?
By the third, they're just re-hashing everything they have already
found; there is nothing new to find. Judge Kavanaugh has been the
subject of **seven** background investigations. It is nearly a
statistical impossibility that over the course of **seven** background
investigations that information such as this would not be revealed.

Therefore, to answer your question, there are two possibilities.

1.  *The FBI background investigation process is flawed*. There is
    something that they are intentionally or procedurally missing, and
    it is causing them to overlook key details of a person's life, such
    that Kavanaugh's sexual assault history could have been completely
    missed over the course of seven background investigations.
2.  *The FBI background investigation process is not flawed at all*.
    Maybe it's working just fine, and there's simply nothing to find.

Is it more plausible to say that the background investigation process is
*flawed* such that key components of an individual's background are
being missed, or is it more plausible to say that the background
investigation process is *not flawed* and there is simply nothing to
find?

It's more plausible to say that the FBI knows exactly what they are
doing when it comes to *their core responsibility, the one that's in
their name:* ***investigation.***

**Therefore, it's far more likely that the background investigation
process is not flawed, and there's simply nothing there to find.**
