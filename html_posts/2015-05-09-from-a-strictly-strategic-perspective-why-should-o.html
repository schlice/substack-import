**Content:** [Terror groups never really achieve what they set out to
do.\
\
ISIS\' stated goal is to turn the world into an Islamic caliphate. Now,
you know as well as I do that this will never happen. The US will never
allow it. Democrats, while sometimes appearing sympathetic to ISIS\'
cause, will never allow the US government to be supplanted by an Islamic
caliphate. Republicans, while sometimes appearing weak-wristed on the
Constitution, will also, similarly, never allow this to happen. Despite
the political differences between Democrats and Republicans, they both
love their country, and will fight tooth and nail to preserve it. And
quite frankly, the US has the best military in the entire world, bar
none. No one comes close. China is starting to amass quite an army, but
they are technically inferior.\
\
Their mode of operation is terror strikes, which while they are annoying
and sometimes downright sickening in terms of the depths of depravity of
human character to which they will sink (i.e. burning children alive in
cages), will never bring about social or political change. Even though
it appears that sometimes we do, it is our stated policy that we will
never give in to the demands of terrorists.\
\
So why would you want to align yourself with an organization that has
absolutely zero chance of achieving its stated goals? If your
organization has a primary mission that is unachievable, you are nothing
more than a noisemaker; a rabble-rouser. Nothing to be taken seriously.
Yes, their actions are quite egregious sometimes, but they are but
\"sound and fury, signifying nothing.\"\
\
And should they attempt an attack on the US government, on US soil, that
kills a lot of people, that they actually claim responsibility for, they
will face swift and decisive destruction. If they hide in caves, then we
will declare war on, and wipe off the face of the map, any country
harboring them (as that country thereby becomes an enemy combatant).
Mark my words: World War III will be fought primarily in the Middle
East, as the terrorists become more emboldened, until they finally
\"awake the sleeping giant.\" When we bring our entire arsenal to bear
on ISIS and any country that doesn\'t immediately turn them over to us,
we will have World War III, as nations either align with us or align
against us.\
\
It will be long. It will be bloody. But we will prevail. We have
prevailed for almost 240 years. And we will continue to
prevail.]{.rendered_qtext}
