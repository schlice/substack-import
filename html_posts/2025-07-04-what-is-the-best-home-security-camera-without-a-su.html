The **best** home security cameras to buy without a subscription, *by
far* (and it's not even close) is the camera system from Ubiquiti. Their
UniFi system is second to none. Their cameras are all PoE cameras (no
flaky Wi-Fi here) and their data is stored on a DVR device in your home.
You will have to install Ethernet, a PoE switch, and a UniFi gateway
device to utilize the storage. But none of this goodness comes free. You
said you wanted the best home security camera system which did not
require a subscription, and this is it. Ubiquiti normally caters to
business installations, but their smaller UniFi cloud gateway systems
are a perfect fit for a home or small business installation.

If you want the best ***consumer-grade*** camera system you can buy, go
with Eufy. Their cameras are wireless, and they are solar-powered. When
you pair their cameras with the HomeBase 3 system, you can upgrade your
storage with external hard drives. No subscription is necessary
(although they offer one for online backup if you choose). The Eufy
system is *good*, but it's not *great*. Some issues with their system:

- The motion detection on their cameras is abysmal. The vast majority of
  the cameras in their lineup have absolutely terrible motion
  sensitivity. The event will likely be passed by the time the camera
  wakes up and starts recording, and that's sad. Some of their newest
  Pro cameras have incorporated LIDAR to improve motion detection, but I
  have yet to hear if it made a huge difference, and again, the majority
  of their product line uses really terrible PIR sensors.
- The solar panels basically don't work over the winter. The sun just
  isn't strong enough to do the job. If you live anywhere north of
  Florida, you're likely going to have a month or two where your cameras
  simply don't work. Be prepared to take them down and charge them with
  a USB cable during that time.
- Integration with Apple/Google/Amazon smart home tech is *there*, but
  it's not *great*. They've been "working on improving it" for years. It
  still sucks.
