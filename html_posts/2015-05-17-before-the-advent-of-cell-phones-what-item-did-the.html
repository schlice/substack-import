**Content:** [Toy guns.\
\
The rules surrounding the manufacture of toy guns has only recently been
expanded to include the hunter-safety-orange tips and the \"strong
suggestions\" that toy guns not be made to look like real guns.\
\
I had a Lone Ranger cap gun as a kid. It took rolls of caps on paper.
From 10 yards, it looked as real as any handgun.\
\
But I knew that I\'d never carry that thing in a threatening way, or it
could be mistaken for a real gun, and that would be the last mistake
I\'d make.\
\
Somehow, I survived without ever being shot by a police officer.\
\
Sometimes, it\'s not good to live and learn, as the cost of enrollment
at Consequences University is a little too high in that case. We should
do a better job of ensuring that our kids don\'t learn that lesson the
hard way.]{.rendered_qtext}
