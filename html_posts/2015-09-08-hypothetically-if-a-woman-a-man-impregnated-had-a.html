**Content:** [It sounds like they\'re just looking for money to help her
cover her medical expenses and they\'re looking to you to try to get
some.\
\
However, since you have \"from her lawyer\" in your answer, you do
realize that Quora is not where you should be asking this question, but
you should be asking it of your own lawyer. If you don\'t have a lawyer
yet, you need to get one. Yesterday.\
\
I\'m not sure why they are seeking redress from you. You didn\'t cause
the miscarriage, nor did you contribute to the condition which caused
the miscarriage. You contributed to the condition which would have
produced a healthy child, had it not been for the mother\'s underlying
reason for which she miscarried. Unless you were systematically beating
her or attempting to induce her pregnancy, how can you be held
responsible for the miscarriage?\
\
And if you can\'t be held responsible for the miscarriage, you can\'t be
held responsible for the medical costs surrounding the miscarriage.\
\
I suspect they want you to help contribute to her medical costs, which
should be reasonable. But the costs need to be reasonable
too.]{.rendered_qtext}
