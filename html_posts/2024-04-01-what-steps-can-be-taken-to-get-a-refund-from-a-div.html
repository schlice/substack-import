It depends on your definition of "unsatisfactory service." The only sort
of unsatisfactory service which is *actionable* is called "malpractice."

Malpractice occurs when your attorney does not provide competent
representation, or when they engage in professional misconduct.

Some of the things which may indicate incompetent representation could
include:

- Losing evidence, especially evidence crucial to your case
- Failing to file paperwork on time
- Lacking the skills needed to perform the duties hired to perform

Some of the things which could be considered professional misconduct
are:

- Intentionally overbilling
- Abandoning a client
- Concealing evidence
- Conflicts of interest

If you are unsatisfied with the services provided by your attorney, you
can do a few things.

1.  **Talk to your lawyer.** Tell him your concerns and see if you can
    work out a plan for improvement.
2.  **Get a second opinion.** To do this, ask your lawyer to send you
    copies of everything in your file, and take those copies to another
    lawyer for a consultation. Second opinions are relatively
    inexpensive, and are a really good way to "gut check" yourself to
    see if your lawyer is indeed really misrepresenting you.
    1.  To get that second opinion, you have to "get copies of
        everything in your file," or in other words, **get your file**.
        This step is really important, especially if there are deadlines
        and motions have been filed and trial dates are looming. You
        need to get all the work done so far so another attorney can
        better assist you. You may even ask your new lawyer to help you
        get your file. You may have to ask your state Bar Association
        for help to get your file. And if all else fails, you may have
        to sue your old attorney in small claims court to get your file
        and to reimburse you for the time spent redoing work in your
        file or the time and expense you incurred just to get the file.
3.  **Fire your lawyer.** You can always fire your lawyer and hire
    another one. But be warned, this may not be cheap, depending on how
    much work your first lawyer did, the quality of that work, and how
    much time you have until trial.
4.  **File a complaint**. File a complaint with your state Bar
    Association, which is usually the group that licenses attorneys. If
    your state uses a different group, complain to them.
5.  **Sue**. Yes, you can sue an attorney, *if you lost money because of
    the way your lawyer handled your case*. But suing for malpractice is
    a tough row to hoe. First, you have to show your lawyer mishandled
    your case and it cost you money. Then, you must show that the
    mistake lost you money that you would not have if your lawyer had
    handled your case properly in the first place.
