**If citizens wanted to impeach their Congressional Representative,
which government official would represent the people to initiate the
impeachment?**

You can't impeach a member of Congress. You cannot vote to recall your
member of Congress. Your best option is to not re-elect that person at
the next election. Work to ensure that someone else gets elected.
Remember that House members are elected every two years, and Senators
are elected every six years. There are no term limits.

Your state may have *recall* procedures for your *state* representative.
Voters in 19 states can recall elected officials at the state level.
Those states are Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Georgia, Idaho,
Illinois, Kansas, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, Nevada, New
Jersey, North Dakota, Oregon, Rhode Island, Washington, and Wisconsin.
