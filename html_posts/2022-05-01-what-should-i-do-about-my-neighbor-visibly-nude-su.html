As with all legal questions, the answer is "it depends."

And what it depends on is *what state you live in.*

In some cases, the sunbather can be cited for indecent exposure if they
are indecent in an area which a reasonable person should know is
viewable by someone who has not affirmatively consented to seeing such
things. In New Jersey for example, they can be cited under this statute
for simply being naked in their yard. The statute doesn't care where
they are. It simply says that if they are in an area which can
reasonably be seen by someone who didn't consent to look at what they
are seeing, they can be cited. In such a scenario, imagine if a child
saw them. They could *also* then be charged with contributing to the
delinquency of a minor, which would get them arrested, and probably
added to the sex offender registry. Contrast that with the indecent
exposure laws in Colorado. In that state, the exposure must be
sexually-related in order to be charged with indecent exposure. They
either have to be having sex, or exposing themself in a sexually
explicit manner (i.e. touching themself explicitly). Simply "being
naked" where they can be seen by someone else does not constitute
indecent exposure there.

Also, if you can see them in their yard from your own house, you have
every right to watch as well as record, so long as you do it from the
same place you can normally see them (i.e. a second-story window). In
other words, if the sunbather wants *privacy*, they need to go inside
and cover their windows. If they can be seen from a neighbor's
second-story window, they voluntarily give up their expectation of
privacy by stepping outside naked. Whether or not they will be charged
with indecent exposure is dependent on your local laws.

Therefore, check your state and local laws regarding indecent exposure.
And if your local laws allow the exposure (so long as it is not sexual
in nature), then just enjoy the show, and feel free to record it if you
choose. You can even post it online (where appropriate), but you can't
sell it, because that would be using someone else's likeness for
commercial gain without their permission. Do be careful about the online
part though, laws are still very new regarding posting nude images of
someone without their permission, and *revenge porn* is a problem that
some states are trying to address. You certainly don't want to run afoul
of any of those laws, so while you can watch and record, please be very
careful about what you do with those recordings.

Original question:

What should I do about my neighbor visibly nude sunbathing in their
backyard almost any day the sun's out now that it's getting warm- if
anything? I have now idea if there are even laws against this. Just
enjoy the show?
