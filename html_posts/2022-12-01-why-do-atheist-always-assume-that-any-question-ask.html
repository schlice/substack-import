already addressed the first part. I want to address this part:

> I mean there wouldn\'t be any like Atheism if there\'s no religion.

What an interesting thought. You're completely right, by the way. What
would "atheism" be without "theism?" Atheism does not exist without
theism, as atheism only makes sense if there is theism.

What do atheists believe in that is greater than themselves? The answer
is nothing. Atheism is only existent as a counterpoint to theism, such
that atheists can only point to theists and say, "I'm not that." In
other words, ask 10 atheists what an atheist universally believes,
without talking about gods or religion, and you'll get 10 different
answers. Because there is no universal belief other than a denial of
theism.
