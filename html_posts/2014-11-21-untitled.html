<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: [It is more than just intent. Generally, \"attempted\"<br>crimes involve intent and \"a significant step\" towards committing the<br>crime itself.\<br>\<br>Since at least one other person knew of the intent (the tipster), the<br>intent could be proved. The \"significant step\" would be sitting in<br>front of the bank, loading a gun. The act of loading the gun, while<br>sitting in front of the bank with the intent to rob it are likely enough<br>to charge someone with attempted robbery.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/Is-it-illegal-to-prepare-to-commit-a-crime-as-opposed-to-actually-attempting-to-commit-it/answer/Robert-Wagner-2<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
