<h2>Answer Comment</h2>

**Content:** [It is more than just intent. Generally, \"attempted\"
crimes involve intent and \"a significant step\" towards committing the
crime itself.\
\
Since at least one other person knew of the intent (the tipster), the
intent could be proved. The \"significant step\" would be sitting in
front of the bank, loading a gun. The act of loading the gun, while
sitting in front of the bank with the intent to rob it are likely enough
to charge someone with attempted robbery.]{.rendered_qtext}
