I love your story, but if I were to boil it down, I think the question
you're trying to ask is **how do I know if it is God speaking to me?**

There are so many voices that come at us on a daily basis, it's hard to
pick out God's voice over the din. So how do we do it?

- **Practice listening to him**. We do this by spending time with Him.
  You know when someone calls you (presume it's a time before Caller ID
  --- I know, shocker) and you don't even have to ask who it is because
  you know their voice so well that you automatically know it's them?
  You can get to the same place with God. The more time you spend in
  communion with Him, the easier it will become to pick out His voice.
  But you have to listen to *only* His voice, and that means freeing
  your heart and your mind of the distractions of this world, and
  Satan's accompanying voices. Spending time in quiet isolation and
  prayer, free of worldly distractions, will help you to hear His voice.
- **Test His words against the Bible.** Now, I know what you're
  thinking. Jesus said, "Do not put the Lord your God to the test." But
  the Bereans tested everything that Paul and Silas said against the
  Bible: "Now the Berean Jews were of more noble character than those in
  Thessalonica, for they received the message with great eagerness and
  examined the Scriptures every day to see if what Paul said was true."
  (Acts 17:11 NIV) You can always trust that the Bible contains the word
  of God, and you can rest assured that whatever you hear from God will
  never contradict what is written in the Bible. This is one way God
  trains us to recognize His voice: we compare what He says against the
  Bible. Satan will try to slip his voice in there too. The Bible says
  he "masquerades as an angel of light" (2 Corinthians 11:14). But you
  can stand firm in the truth, because what God says will always match
  the Bible.
- **See how His word makes you feel.** When God speaks to you, His words
  will never tear you down or condemn you. His correction is so loving,
  you'll feel conviction and want to change, but you won't feel shame.
  If you do, you can be sure that it is Satan at work. That's how he
  gets you to defy God; he makes you feel shame (a powerful emotion).

If you practice this regularly, and you use it to test what you are
being told and you find it trustworthy, bring this to your parents in
boldness, knowing that you are indeed hearing from God.

Remember that they may not believe you. Listen to them until you are old
enough to make your own decisions, they are your parents and they
deserve your respect. But once you can decide for yourself, pray about
it, practice it, and then do it.

Good luck and be blessed!
