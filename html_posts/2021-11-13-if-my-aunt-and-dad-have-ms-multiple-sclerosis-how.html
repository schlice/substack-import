Here's the actual answer to your question. Sorry it has taken this long.
This evidence is from epidemiological studies about who gets MS. You can
find this information at the National MS Society.

The rate of MS in the general population is about 1 in 750. Having a
**first-degree relative** with MS (like a parent or a sibling) changes
that risk to anywhere between 1 in 100 and 1 in 40.

But it's not all genetic. Take the identical twins example. They share
the exact same DNA, so if it was all genetic, if one twin gets MS, the
other twin should have a 100% chance of getting it. But the other twin
only has a 25% chance of getting it. So clearly, there are other factors
involved in who gets MS.

Some of those factors are age, sex, location where you grew up, your
heritage, and some infectious trigger to start the disease process which
we haven't yet identified.
