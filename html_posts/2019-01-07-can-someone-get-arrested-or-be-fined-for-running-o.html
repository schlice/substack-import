**Can someone get arrested or be fined for running over an animal?**

Certainly. The key is intent.

If you accidentally hit an animal, it's considered an accident. If you
intentionally hit an animal (i.e. you go out of your way to hit an
animal instead of trying to avoid it), it is a crime, and depending on
your state, you can be fined or serve time for it.
