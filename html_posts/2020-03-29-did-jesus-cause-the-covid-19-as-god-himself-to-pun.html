**Did Jesus cause the COVID-19 as God himself to punish the humans he
created so he can feel some satisfaction as a result of their sins?**

Nope, not even on the right continent, let alone the right ballpark.

Let's start with the "satisfaction" part. God does not seek to punish us
for our sins. In fact, God loves us so much that he sent his son to be
killed by us so that he could redeem us. That's how much he loves us. He
loves us so much that he sent his son to die so that our sins could be
forgiven. We didn't ask him to do that. We didn't beg him to do that. He
just did it. That's what we call *grace*: getting something we
objectively do not deserve. Does that sound like a god who would inflict
a virus on us as punishment for our sins? Not even close. Our sins have
already been forgiven. So why then would he continue to punish us for
something for which he's already forgiven us? It just doesn't make
sense.

Second, did God create COVID-19? You could say yes, by allowing the
conditions under which it could be created. If so, to what end? Why
would God allow this terrible thing to happen to people? He could stop
it instantly. *Why does God allow bad things to happen to good people?*

Let's just look at that "satisfaction" paragraph. God allowed Jesus to
be killed so that we could be redeemed. I would think that being killed
would qualify as a bad thing, no? God allowed that bad thing to happen.
And it was to his own son! Why would he do such a thing? He did this to
redeem us. He did this to give us a path to heaven. He did this so we
could freely choose him, and choose salvation. Remember, we were create
as sinful creatures, but with free will. You must be sinless to enter
heaven, and none of us are sinless. We are all sinners, and we all fall
short of God's standard. None of us *deserve* heaven. We are sinful in
our thoughts, in our hearts, and in our actions. But God made a way for
us to return to him. God sent Jesus to live a sinless life, so that he
could open the path to heaven for us.

We live in a fallen world. We live in a world full of sin. And we are
indeed sinful creatures. The Bible is clear that this life will not be
easy, and things like COVID-19 will happen. They have happened before,
and they will happen again. He never promised us an easy, carefree life.
But by his death and resurrection, Jesus found a way to beat the world!
"In this world you will have trouble. But take heart! I have overcome
the world. (John 16:33)"

Just know that all of this, these things that happen in this world, be
it COVID-19, the Black Plague, the Swine Flu, natural disasters, wars,
famines, and all of the objectively bad things that happen, all happen
for a reason. They all work as part of God's plan to glorify him and to
advance his kingdom. He also said that his plan will be hard to
understand, again because of our humanity. Think of trying to explain
the beauty of a sunrise to a baby still in the womb. It's impossible to
do. We will probably never understand why he allows things to happen.
And I'll tell you right now, when I finally meet him face to face, I'm
gonna have a few questions.

But he keeps his promises. And he has promised that if we believe in
him, we are saved. And that is a promise you can be sure of.
