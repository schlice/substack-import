**Content:** [Police are only allowed to use force one level greater
than the force presented. Police still can\'t shoot people who are not
threats; so far, every case you\'ve seen in the news where a police
officer shot an unarmed, non-threatening person, he was arrested. But
just because someone is unarmed doesn\'t make them non-threatening, so
don\'t misunderstand. And yes, there will always be outlier events, but
that is the exception rather than the rule.\
\
And police have NOT been \"increasingly accused.\" Accusations of police
brutality have actually been on the decline over the past 20 years. The
advent of videocameras on cell phones have \"publicized\" the issue far
more than it has ever been publicized before, and the police are
increasingly being shown in a very negative light. So while it
\"appears\" that police brutality is increasing, the problem is a
changing media landscape that increasingly paints police in a negative
light.]{.rendered_qtext}
