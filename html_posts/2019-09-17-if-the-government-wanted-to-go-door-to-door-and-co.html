**If the government wanted to go door to door and collect guns, how
would they know who owned any?**

If the government goes literally "door to door," they don't have to know
who owns any, because they're going to be checking every door.

That's going to take a *looooooong* time. And if I have 40 acres of
property, how are you exactly going to find the guns I buried somewhere
out there in those 40 acres? Are you going to employ a team of engineers
with ground-penetrating radar and a backhoe to search all 40 acres?
That's going to take weeks, and just on my property alone.

Now repeat the process a few hundred million times.

You can see the problem.

So if they're going to violate the Constitution and confiscate all those
firearms in contravention of the 2nd Amendment, then they may as well
violate a few more laws in the process, to try to make their lives
easier.

Like the law that says that the government cannot create or maintain
lists of gun owners. They could illegally seize all of the sale records
of any FFL who has ever sold a gun, and compile a list of people who
bought guns that way. That will get about 40% of gun owners. But that's
still not going to get all the guns, because those sale records only
show the *first* owner, and in most states, private party sales or gifts
do not need such rigorous records-keeping as the ones required of FFLs.
So they may go to half of those homes and find that the guns were either
lost, stolen, or sold to someone else.

That still leaves the remaining 60% of gun owners who acquired their
guns through private party sales or as gifts, whose transactions were
never recorded.

So the bottom line in all of this: the government wouldn't know where
all the guns are, there isn't a consistent record anywhere which states
where all the guns are, and in order to "get them all," they would, as
you suggest, have to go door-to-door to try to find them all. And they
still would be unable to do so.

**TL;DR: They wouldn't, and there is no record they could acquire or
create where you could even begin to know where they all are. They would
have to visit every house.**
