**Are we going back to the days when a rape victim\'s testimony doesn\'t
count as evidence?**

Thanks for your question,
[[Jordan](https://www.quora.com/profile/Jordan-Magill)]{.qlink_container}.
You have the question tagged with the topic of Brett Kavanaugh's
nomination hearings, and this is the question you ask? As someone who
professes to have survived professional politics, you ask a question
about a legal process in the context of political dinner theater.

I find that curious, that you can't tell the difference.

In the legal world, yes we've made some mistakes in our nation's legal
history, and failing to treat rape victims with the respect they deserve
was definitely one of them.

But the clown circus which judicial nomination hearings has become has
literally nothing to do with the legal system. In fact, Democrats have
completely *abandoned* any semblance of tradition imported from the
legal system: they have repeatedly called Kavanaugh "guilty" because
he's a man and a woman made an accusation. Specifically, Sen. Schumer
and others said that this is not a legal proceeding so there is no
presumption of innocence. How is this, in any way, something that would
be legally acceptable?

To prove it, let me ask this: *Could Brett Kavanaugh be charged with a
crime?* As in, arrested and charged with sexual assault, based on this
allegation?

The answer is an emphatic no, not only because the statue of limitations
has expired (which makes this a non-starter in court), but even if it
could be a court case, because the victim's testimony (of which you are
concerned) is so uncorroborated and unverifiable. Dr. Ford's testimony
is that while she remembers a year, she doesn't remember dates. She
doesn't remember where the alleged party took place. Every person she
has named as being present at the party has denied that they were
present at the party. Every person she claims took part in the assault
emphatically denies that it ever happened at all.

At least if she could remember a date, Kavanaugh could present
exculpatory evidence, as his calendar from that time has already been
provided (amazing that he had that, but still). So there's no way that
this case could be heard in an actual court of law.

So to answer your question: no, we're certainly not returning to an era
where rape victims' testimonies are not regarded as evidence. Because
nothing is changing when it comes to criminal law. The Kavanaugh
hearings change nothing in the law or in the rules of evidence.

But we're approaching a tipping point of *irrelevance* when it comes to
Judiciary Committee nominating hearings. Ever since Robert Bork was
treated this way, these hearings have been nothing more than, as I said,
political dinner theater, a place where Senators can pontificate,
grandstand, and audition to their base for a shot at becoming the next
candidate for President (see Harris, Kamala and Booker, Cory), not
actually find out any useful information. Anything they need to know can
be asked and answered in written questions and statements, and probably
already has been. The Senate is driving this process into irrelevance,
and it is by their own hand.
