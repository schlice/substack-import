This question goes back to the reason why marriage exists in the first
place. It's interesting, because this question was very recently argued
in our society, when the government, through its various machinations,
permitted same-sex marriage.

The question about why marriage exists in the first place was raised,
and was often debated. Because, as you stated, if marriage is for
procreation, if a couple is infertile and does not procreate, is their
marriage invalid?

Clearly, that answer is no. The marriage is not justified by children.
The marriage may be *blessed* by children, but the marriage is not
validated based on the presence or absence of biological children.
Remember: children do not make a marriage; marriage makes children. At
the very least, we should avoid putting the cart before the horse.

Therefore, whether or not you have children doesn't change the validity
of a marriage. Which raises another question: *what's the purpose of
religious marriage?*

Thankfully, the Bible has a lot to say about marriage.

The very first reason that the Bible gives for marriage was simple: Adam
was lonely and needed a helper (Genesis 2:18). This lays out the primary
reason for marriage: companionship. God created humanity for
companionship and fellowship. We are *designed* to be together. That
doesn't mean we can't live successfully on our own, but we are made for
community and communion.

This structure mirrors Christ's relationship with the church. The Bible
often refers to the relationship between Christ and the church using the
terms "bride" and "bridegroom." The structure of our lives reflects the
reality of Christ's love for the church. Jesus gave his life for his
bride, and his selflessness is an example we husbands should learn from.

And finally, to address your specific question, just because you don't
want children at your age doesn't mean that having a safe place to
express your sexuality isn't beneficial, either for you or for your
future husband. This world is full of sexual immorality and temptation.
Even if you're not looking for that sort of material, *it's looking for
you*. It pursues even the most chaste among us. Marriage is the only
place where we can safely express those desires, which helps us to be
stronger against that temptation to sin.

I know how you feel, as I'm knocking on 50 myself. The old maxim goes
like this: sex is like air; it becomes very important when you aren't
getting any. In practice, this means that the less we exercise our
sexuality (in whatever form that may look like at our age and our
physical condition), the more likely we are to be tempted. Expressing
our sexuality with our spouse is a *hedge* against the temptation of the
world, which is strong and addictive. Please don't forget that while you
may not desire children, or even intercourse, expressing your sexuality
with your spouse, in whatever form that expression takes, is still
important for you, and for your future husband. Together, you can
strengthen each other against the temptations of this world. In other
words, your marriage helps you to produce holiness and godliness in both
of your lives.

**TL;DR:** God created marriage to benefit us, and to promote a
vigorous, healthy society, not *just* to create children.

Original question:

According to Church tradition marrying is for procreation and a
sanctified outlet for sexual desire. But in 1 Timothy 5:9--16 it says
widows under 60 should get remarried. After 45 or 50 most women are
infertile and no longer overwhelmingly desirous of sex. So why is the
age so high? And do I have any business dating\--no luck finding a
husband due to chronic illness in my 20\'s\--now that I\'m pushing 50?
Could God bless such a union when He meant for marriage to be about
founding families which I cannot produce now?
