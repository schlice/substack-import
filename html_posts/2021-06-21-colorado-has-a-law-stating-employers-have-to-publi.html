If I'm a job seeker, why would you *not* tell me the salary range that
your job pays? I may be looking at the totally wrong job, and I may
spend weeks progressing through your interview process until I find out
that your position doesn't pay me nearly what I'm worth, or more
specifically, what I need to make. It only *benefits* a company to
provide the starting salary range up-front so that you only get
candidates who are willing and able to accept that salary to do that
work.

Please explain how disclosing a good-faith starting salary harms an
employer. So far, the only complaint posed by recruiter groups is one of
First Amendment reasoning, not that it harms the business, just that the
recruiter has the right to not disclose the starting salary.
