*(NOTE: I understand I'm not Jewish; however, the sacred texts we are
discussing are also a part of the Christian Bible).*

So to answer that question, you must first answer this question:

**What gave you the idea that God is in the protection business?**

In other words, where did you get this idea that believing in God
guarantees you a trouble-free life?

There's certainly no reference to it in the Torah (or in the Christian
Bible's Old Testament, same books). People have this idea that once you
believe in God, all your troubles cease, and I don't understand the
source of that belief. As if God walks in front of you with his great
cosmic leaf-blower, sweeping away all troubles from your path.

So tell me: what gave you the idea that God was supposed to prevent bad
things from happening to Jews?

Original question:

As a Jew, how do you come to terms with the fact that God didn\'t
protect His Chosen People (the Jews) from Hitler\'s holocaust or even
prevent / stop it? Does a part of you think the Jews were punished?
