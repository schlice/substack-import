**With a conservative SCOTUS, will that result in actual legislation to
preserve a woman\'s reproductive choices?**

No, because unless you failed Civics, SCOTUS does not write law.
Congress writes law. SCOTUS has nothing to do with actual legislation to
preserve a woman's reproductive choices (whatever that means).
