Participation in extracurricular activities is important to becoming a
strong candidate. The [[Academy
Admissions](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=338591&url=https://www.academyadmissions.com/admissions/advice-to-applicants/high-school-and-college-students/){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="academyadmissions.com"}]{.qlink_container} website says,
"Sustained participation in select activities over the course of your
high school career is preferred." Emphasizing one over the other is
probably not ideal. You do need all of it: the academics, the athletics
(your football will count for that), and other non-athletic
extracurricular activities as well. In short, all extracurricular
activities (athletic and non-athletic) are combined in your
Extracurricular Composite. The EC is combined with your Academic
Composite to form your Weighted Composite.

EC + AC = WC

Your Weighted Composite is added to your Selection Panel Rating to form
your Selection Composite, or your overall competitive standing. The
Selection Panel will look at qualitative factors that might be missed in
other objective tests, such as your Character Evaluation done by your
ALO, and your Fitness Assessment. These make up the "whole person"
evaluation that the Selection Panel Rating reflects.

WC + SPR = SC

Like I mentioned, strong academic qualifications alone are not enough to
make you competitive for appointment. The relative weighting of the
scores that go into your overall competitive standing are:

- Academic Composite: 50%
- Extracurricular Composite: 20%
- Selection Panel Rating: 30%

You can see that your Extracurricular Composite factors less heavily
than your selection panel rating, but the two combined (EC and SPR) add
equally alongside your AC to form your SC.

I strongly suggest you use the [[Admissions Liaison Officer (ALO)
Locator](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=3baf43&url=https://www.academyadmissions.com/admissions/outreach-programs/find-your-admissions-liaison-officer/){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"

Admissions website and get in contact with your ALO. They can help
answer your specific questions and help guide you through the admissions
process. Good luck!
