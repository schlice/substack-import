**If US forces wanted to, could they takeout Syrian air defense
locations and then continue striking the country with higher
efficiency?**

*Of course* they can.

However, one of the tenets of this particular strike was that it was not
intended to be *utterly and completely destructive to all of Syria's
military.*

In other words, the strike was **measured and precise.**

We struck exactly what we wanted to strike: the laboratories and
factories which were producing chemical weapons, as well as some other
important targets. But we didn't strike *every* possible target we could
have.

The attack was designed to do a few things:

- Hamper Syria's ability to continue to produce chemical weapons
- Hamper Syria's ability to use chemical weapons against its own people
- Send a very strong message that the use of chemical weapons will not
  be tolerated.

There were some other considerations as well. Most importantly that
there were Russian military units at those air defense locations, and we
were careful to strike *Syria*, not *Russia* or Russian assets in Syria.
