**In America why is it that someone can jump your fence, break a window
and climb into your house, and if they hurt themselves while robbing
your house they can sue you? They were trespassing and breaking and
entering, why can they sue you?**

In the *vast* majority of states, you cannot. This is mostly urban
legend.

There are very very few cases where this has ever happened in the United
States, and only perhaps one or two fit your scenario.

The oft-cited case is *Bodine v. Enterprise High School,* where Ricky
Bodine climbed onto the roof of a gymnasium to either steal a floodlight
or to redirect it so he and his friends could play basketball. Whether
or not he was a thief is not at issue. He was a **trespasser**.
Nevertheless, Bodine, while walking on the roof of the high school gym,
stepped onto a skylight which had been painted over. He fell down to the
gym floor and injured himself fairly substantially (some accounts say he
broke his neck and is now a quadriplegic). He sued for \$8 million in
damages, and apparently settled out of court for \$260,000 plus \$1,200
per month for life.

Whether or not this case is actually true is not relevant. What is
relevant is how courts determine the cause of an accident, and how
courts determine who is at fault for that accident. Simply being a
trespasser does not alleviate the property owner of liability. For
example, even if I was an invited guest into your home, if I
accidentally go the wrong way and end up in an area I was not allowed to
go, I'm a trespasser. If I'm looking for the manager and I wander into
an employee-only area, I'm a trespasser. I'm not a burglar looking to
steal your stuff. I'm an innocently lost patron.

But the reason is really irrelevant. The question: *is the property
owner alleviated of liability simply because the injured person does not
belong there?*

And depending on the state (and the rules it uses to determine fault and
cause), you may still be liable for a person's injuries if the injury
was caused by something that you, as a property owner, could have
foreseen might injure someone.

The question comes down to **negligence**. If the property owner was
negligent, and it causes injury to another person, the injured person
can recover economic and non-economic damages which flow from that
negligence.

In order to determine who is negligent and to what degree, courts use
the "proximate cause" definition to determine "legal fault." This is
different from "actual cause" or the "cause in fact," which is the
actual event which caused the injury.

There are a few tests that states use to determine proximate cause. The
one that most states use is called the *"But For"* test. This test is
used to determine whether or not the injury would have happened at all
**but for** the defendant's negligent action or omission.

There are other states which use the *"Substantial Factor"* test to
determine proximate cause. A substantial factor is one that contributes
materially to the occurrence of an injury. An action contributes
materially when its causative effects are in operation until the moment
of injury.

In either case, the court must make a finding of proximate cause, and
then determine the level of negligence on the part of the defendant.

In the case of the skylight, the injured party would sue the school for
negligence, and the school would counter-sue the injured party for
trespassing. The trespassing would limit the school's liability for the
negligence (and if the details of the case are to be believed, they
did). They settled out of court for a modified amount which took both
parties' level of fault into consideration.

(EDIT) I have personal experience with this level of fault finding. My
wife was involved in a car accident (she was rear-ended). In Colorado,
rear-end accidents are ***always*** the fault of the driver behind. She
faced significant medical costs and rehabilitation time from her
injuries, and our lawsuit was designed to recoup some of those costs.
The actual cause of her injuries was being struck from behind. The
proximate cause of the accident was the woman who turned into the wrong
lane into oncoming traffic which caused traffic to come to a sudden and
complete stop which precipitated the accident. This was one factor which
reduced the driver behind's liability. The second factor was the fact
that she got hit so hard from behind that it sent her into the car in
front of her. Because she also hit the car in front of her (albeit with
far less force), the court was unable to say exactly how much of her
injuries were caused by the driver behind, and how much of her injuries
were caused by her impact with the vehicle in front. Clearly, if we were
using a "substantial factor" test in Colorado, the vehicle behind would
have been the substantial factor, but whatever. Because she impacted the
vehicle in front, she received a ticket for following too closely. And
because she got a ticket along with the person behind, and because the
driver behind was not completely at fault for the accident, the driver
behind's liability was limited, as was our award for damages.

It's not as black and white as you think.
