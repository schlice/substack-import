Why do you feel the need to provide tangible proof of God's existence?
Why can't you believe in God without tangible evidence?

I posit that there are plenty of things that *even atheists* believe in
without tangible evidence that they exist. In fact, there are plenty of
things that we are very rational to believe in despite the fact that
there is no scientific evidence to prove them:

1.  Math and logic. Science can't prove them because science
    *presupposes them.*
2.  Metaphysical truths, such as there are minds which exist outside of
    my own.
3.  Ethical judgements. There is no scientific test you can do to prove
    that the Nazis were evil.
4.  Aesthetic judgements. The beautiful, like the good, cannot be proven
    through science.
5.  and ironically...Science itself. The belief that the scientific
    method accurately produces truth cannot be proven using the
    scientific method itself. You can't prove the tools of science (the
    laws of logic, the Law of Causality, the Principle of Uniformity, or
    the reliability of observation) by running some kind of experiment.
    You have to assume those things are true in order to do the
    experiment!

So the need for "tangible proof" of God's existence is a bit ironic,
since there are plenty of things we are very rational to believe in even
without "tangible proof." We are very rational to believe that sunsets
are beautiful and that the Nazis were evil, despite the fact that we
can't provide tangible proof that "beautiful" and "evil" exist.

\

Secondly, "tangible proof" is a bit silly, wouldn't you say? If God does
exist, He is necessarily intangible. He's not made of stuff we can
detect, because He *created* the stuff so can't be *made* of the stuff
He *created*, because then He would have to exist before He existed. So
you're never going to find one of God's hairs, or see one of God's
footprints. Those things do not exist.

But just because we don't have "tangible" proof that God exists doesn't
mean that we can't prove that God exists, at least prove beyond a
reasonable doubt. It just means that we can't use science to produce
that proof.

The correct tools to use are not scientific, but philosophical. Let's
not forget, philosophy is not divorced from science, as if you can rely
on science alone, and philosophy is just pseudo-babble for PhDs to
discuss while smoking pipes in dimly-lit rooms. Philosophy is the
*foundation* of science. Science is dependent on philosophy. In fact,
***science is a slave to philosophy.*** Bad philosophy results in bad
science, and good science requires good philosophy. Why? Because:

1.  **Science cannot be done without philosophy.** Philosophical
    assumptions are employed in the quest for causes and thus cannot be
    their consequence. For instance, scientists presuppose that reason
    and the scientific method enable us to comprehend the world
    accurately---a belief which is not provable by science. The
    foundational tools of science, such as the laws of logic, the Law of
    Causality, the Principle of Uniformity, and the reliability of
    observation, cannot be validated through scientific experimentation;
    they must be presumed to be true to conduct any experiment. Hence,
    science is fundamentally rooted in philosophy. Regrettably, numerous
    self-proclaimed scientists are really poor philosophers.
2.  **Philosophical assumptions can dramatically impact scientific
    conclusions.** If a scientist presupposes that only natural causes
    exist, then likely no evidence will persuade them that an
    intelligent source created the first single-celled amoeba or any
    other entity with apparent design. When proponents of Darwinism
    assume that intelligent causes are not feasible, they default to
    natural laws as the sole explanation. Conversely, if a creationist
    dismisses natural causes *a priori* (though I'm not aware of any who
    do), they too risk overlooking the correct explanation. However, a
    scientist open to both natural and intelligent causes is able to
    pursue the evidence to its logical conclusion.
3.  **Science doesn't really say anything---scientists do.** Data
    interpretation is always a task for scientists. However, when
    scientists allow their personal biases or unproven philosophical
    beliefs to influence their interpretation of data, they fall into
    the same trap they often criticize in religious
    individuals---allowing ideology to shape conclusions. Such instances
    warrant skepticism, as the resulting conclusions might merely be
    philosophical assumptions masquerading as scientific truths.

In philosophy, evidence is often presented in the form of *arguments*.
Over the years, thinkers have identified at least twenty arguments for
the existence of God, which vary in complexity. Some of these arguments
are based on the universe or history, while others are based on the
existence of reason and beauty. So just like we know that reason and
beauty exist, we can use the same tools to prove reason and beauty to
prove the existence of God.

So perhaps you can discuss the Cosmological Argument or the Kalam
Argument, which discuss the beginning of the universe, which demands
proof of a cause. We can discuss the Moral Law, and the fact that the
existence of the Moral Law implies the existence of a Moral Law Giver.

Those are just a few avenues we can use to discuss proof that God
exists.

Not knowing how to have a discussion with atheists doesn't make you a
bad person. It simply makes you uninformed. To be honest, Christians get
a mandate to spread the Gospel but never get any instruction on how to
do so. They never get to hear common arguments against Christianity and
how best to respond. This is evangelism in the form of *apologetics*.
Christians are rarely taught how to have a conversation with an atheist.
