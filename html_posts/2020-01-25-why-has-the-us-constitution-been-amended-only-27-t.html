> **Why has the US Constitution been amended only 27 times?**

Because it's hard. Not *impossible* (it has been amended 27 times, after
all), just *hard*.

The Framers wanted to make the Constitution *difficult, but not
impossible*, to amend. They did this because they did not want the
Constitution to just change willy-nilly with every passing generation.
They didn't want it to shift with the winds. They wanted it to have some
permanence. They wanted it to be a strong foundation upon which states
could build laws.

> constitution?**

Because you can't "add rights" that don't exist already. Here's the part
that most people find really difficult to understand: *the Constitution
doesn't grant rights.* The Constitution recognizes rights *which already
exist*, and prevents government from limiting those rights. That's a
tough concept to wrap your brain around. It's the difference between
***positive rights*** and ***negative rights***.

A **positive right** is one which someone must do something in order for
you to have the right. So if you had the *right* to healthcare (not a
healthcare *entitlement*, but the actual *right* to healthcare), someone
else *must* work to provide your right. They have no choice. For
example, doctors could not go on strike, because doing so would violate
your right to healthcare. You could go to the courts and demand they go
back to work, and they would have to. Your rights are *inviolate:* they
cannot be violated. This is just one of many reasons why in the United
States you do not have a right to healthcare. There are many healthcare
entitlements in the States, but you do not have a right to the fruits of
someone else's labor. You can engage in a mutual business arrangement
where you receive a service and they receive money, but that's not a
right. That's an entitlement program.

A **negative right** says that the government can make any rule they
want, except for making any rules about X. So for example, you have the
right to speak out against the government. The government can make any
other law they want about speech, so long as they don't make a law which
limits your ability to speak out against the government (note that I'm
only referring to the 1A clause about redress, there are indeed other
free speech rights as well). They do limit speech; they can limit the
time, place, and manner of your speech. They can make you get a permit
to speak in public if your speech will be disruptive. So for example, if
you want to protest by marching down a city street, you can, but you
must get a permit so the city can close roads and route traffic around
the protest, plan for extra law enforcement, plan around city services,
etc. In other words, the city must ensure that no one else's rights are
limited by you exercising *your* right.

The Bill of Rights (the first ten amendments to the Constitution) is a
series of negative rights, things the government cannot infringe on. The
Bill of Rights has a whole litany of "common sense rights" in it, such
as the right to free speech, the right to a free press, the right to
practice whatever religion you want, or no religion at all, the right to
keep and bear arms, the right to not have military soldiers quartered in
your home, the right to not be unreasonably searched and to not have
your property seized, the right to not incriminate yourself as part of
criminal proceedings, and so on.

These are common sense rights, and what makes them common sense is the
fact that *we have these rights without the Constitution*. The Bill of
Rights simply guarantees that the government cannot infringe on these
rights.

Finally, there is an amendment which states that *this isn't the limit
of rights you have*. Any other rights which weren't listed are reserved
to the states, and the people respectively. See? All rights are retained
by the people.

That's pretty common sense, in my book.
