**None.** There is no motivation whatsoever to promote a false
resurrection. Because if the Resurrection never happened, Christianity
falls like a house of cards, or a house built on sand. The Resurrection
is the bedrock upon which Christianity is built.

The Resurrection is the central event in Christianity. As Paul wrote:

> *And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile and you are
> still in your sins. \-- 1 Cor 15:17 ESV*

If the Resurrection were a false story, then the New Testament writers
certainly would have made them longer and would have added more detail.
They probably would have also said that they ***personally*** witnessed
Jesus physically rising from the dead. Instead, they get to the tomb
after He had risen, and they made no attempt to embellish their
discovery with flowing descriptions or any other sorts of miracles.
Matthew, Mark, and Luke don't even say anything about what the
Resurrection means to believers, and John reports that meaning in just
one sentence (John 20:31).

That point, the point about the Gospel writers *not* detailing the
theological implications of the Resurrection, deserves attention. It
indicates that they were concerned about getting the **history**
correct, not "inventing" a new theology.

New Testament scholar N. T. Wright makes the astute observation that
"neither 'going to heaven when you die', 'life after death', 'eternal
life', nor even 'the resurrection of all Christ's people', is so much as
mentioned in the four canonical resurrection stories. If Matthew, Mark,
Luke and John wanted to tell stories whose import was 'Jesus is risen,
therefore you will be too', they have done a remarkably bad job of
it."[\[1\]](#jbTmL){#cite-jbTmL .citation_link}

I tend to agree. If you go to most evangelical church services today,
the constant emphasis is "believe in Jesus to be saved." That notion is
certainly *taught* in the New Testament, but it is barely mentioned in
the Gospels, because the Gospel writers were writing *history*, not
*theology*. Certainly, the history has dramatic implications for the
theology, but those implications are explored elsewhere, in other New
Testament writings (and the Christian church primarily includes Paul's
letters to do that).

It would have been easy for the Gospel writers to detail the theological
implications of every historical event, but they didn't. They were
eyewitnesses who were writing *history*.

\

Additionally, if the Resurrection never happened, and the writers
weren't trying to build a new religion, but instead were merely
recording history as we just detailed, what could the Gospel writers
hope to personally gain by promoting it? What did they personally gain?
History tells us that they didn't gain fame or notoriety. They gained
persecution, torture, and death. Or at least the threat of death. They
were hunted down by the Romans and the Jews. They tried to kill John a
number of times but when they found him to be surprisingly resilient,
they simply exiled him to the island of Patmos for the remainder of his
days. Clearly, if the Resurrection wasn't true, then the writers'
adherence to the story makes no sense.

In other words, people might die for a lie they believe is the truth,
but no one dies for a lie they know is a lie. The apostle's willingness
to die to promote the Resurrection story can only be adequately
explained if they truly believed the story themselves. This lends
credence to the fact that, at the very least, *they* believed the
Resurrection actually happened.
