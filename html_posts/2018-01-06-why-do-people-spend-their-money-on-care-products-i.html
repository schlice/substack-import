In addition to what the other answerers have said, when I look good, I
feel good. When I feel good, I am confident, and happy. Self-confidence
is at least partially driven by our own appearance, Or at least how we
perceive our own appearance.

Ideally, we don\'t want our self-confidence to be driven by our
appearance, however it is true that at least in part, our personal
appearance drives our self-confidence.

Finally, in many industries that are customer-facing, personal
appearance standards are required. So it may not necessarily just be
because of how we want to be perceived to the world, or how we perceive
ourselves, personal appearance standards may be required as a condition
of employment.
