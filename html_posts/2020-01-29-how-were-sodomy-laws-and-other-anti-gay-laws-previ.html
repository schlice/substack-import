**How were sodomy laws and other anti-gay laws previously constitutional
in the US if there was no reasonable secular justification for them?**

First of all, where do you get the idea that somehow you need secular
justification for a law? Many of our laws came directly out of our
Judeo-Christian foundation as a nation, and no one ever thought that was
an issue until someone raised the issue.

Sodomy laws were struck down *because* of religion, not *in defiance* of
it. The landmark decision was *Lawrence v. Texas*, which struck down a
Texas sodomy law, and thus invalidated sodomy laws in thirteen other
states. It did this not because there was no secular justification for
the law, but because the law violated the substantive due process clause
in the 14th Amendment, reaffirming that intimate consensual sexual
activity of any kind was indeed protected by the due process clause.

**Wasn't it a clear violation of the separation of church/state?**

Not even close.

The only thing that would be a violation of the 1st Amendment is if the
state mandated a religion, or if the state prevented the practice of a
religion. There is nothing at all unconstitutional about passing a law
that is based in part on a tenet of any one particular religion.
However, as was true in *Lawrence*, any law could potentially violate
due process, regardless of its original source or intent.

"Separation of church and state" is a concept, not a law.
