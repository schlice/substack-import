**If someone breaks into your hotel room, are you legally allowed to use
a gun in self defense (in the US)?**

As with all legal questions, the answer is "it depends."

There are two main things which determine whether or not you can have a
gun in your hotel room:

- Gun carry laws in the state in which you are in
- The rules of the specific hotel

If the hotel does not allow you to keep your legal firearm with you in
your room, they had better provide adequate security, as hotels have in
the past paid high monetary penalties when "inadequate security" caused
guests to be attacked in their properties.

But even if you have a gun in your hotel room, regardless of whether or
not the state or the hotel allows you to have it there, the question
asked if you can use it for self defense. The answer is that **in nearly
every state, if you are in fear for your life, you can employ whatever
force you have at your disposal, including deadly force, to safeguard
your life.** Even in "duty to retreat" states, there's only one entrance
into your hotel room and it's highly unlikely you can escape from that
room.

So to answer (and qualify) the question: if someone breaks into your
hotel room **and you are in fear for your life**, you can use whatever
force you have at your disposal, up to and including deadly force, to
protect your life.
