The answer to every legal question is "it depends."

First of all, does the bus company have an *obligation* to make everyone
wear masks? Is there a law in your area? Is there a state-mandated
business rule requiring mandatory masking for buses? If there is, the
correct method for redress would be to contact your state's agency which
implemented that mandate, and advise them of the company not following
the mandate.

If there is no requirement for the bus company to enforce a mask
mandate, you're going to have a tough hill to climb in filing a lawsuit
against them. Not only are you going to have to prove that they didn't
do something that they objectively should have been doing, you're going
to have to prove that you were harmed by this policy. Did you get sick
because you rode the bus? And more importantly: *can you prove that you
got sick on the bus?* I think you'll have a hard time making that case.

Anyway, the only way to know for sure if you have a case is to contact a
personal injury attorney in your area if you are claiming that you were
harmed by the lack of masks and you can prove that you were harmed on
the bus.

Good luck!
