<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: [*The company that claims religious exemption for<br>abortifacients also profits from abortions in China. They also have won<br>an exemption from the ACA so they don\'t have to pay for that part of<br>the insurance*.\<br>\<br>irrelevant. Pharmacists are not dug companies. If you are going to<br>argue, stay on topic.\<br>\<br>*In a small town, there may be only one pharmacy within reasonable<br>distance. Not everyone has a car.*\<br>*If, say, a condom breaks, you really think mail order helps?*\<br>\<br>Nope. Not at all. But neither does having to go to the doctor to get a<br>prescription for the pills.\<br>\<br>*Planned Parenthood? Lots of religious groups are campaigning against<br>them, even sometimes bombing them or murdering doctors.*\<br>\<br>Again, off topic. They still exist despite having our tax dollars being<br>used to fund abortions\<br>\<br>*Ridiculous and disingenuous to say that a doctor\'s free samples are a<br>valid alternative to a pharmacist refusing medicine based on a religious<br>exemption.*\<br>\<br>You said there is no alternative. I showed you at least one.\<br>\<br>So why then can a pharmacist not exercise his protected religious<br>rights?]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/What-is-one-serious-credible-reason-why-I-should-consider-a-belief-in-your-god-s/answer/Tracey-Brystan<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
