<h2>Answer Comment</h2>

**Content:** [*The company that claims religious exemption for
abortifacients also profits from abortions in China. They also have won
an exemption from the ACA so they don\'t have to pay for that part of
the insurance*.\
\
irrelevant. Pharmacists are not dug companies. If you are going to
argue, stay on topic.\
\
*In a small town, there may be only one pharmacy within reasonable
distance. Not everyone has a car.*\
*If, say, a condom breaks, you really think mail order helps?*\
\
Nope. Not at all. But neither does having to go to the doctor to get a
prescription for the pills.\
\
*Planned Parenthood? Lots of religious groups are campaigning against
them, even sometimes bombing them or murdering doctors.*\
\
Again, off topic. They still exist despite having our tax dollars being
used to fund abortions\
\
*Ridiculous and disingenuous to say that a doctor\'s free samples are a
valid alternative to a pharmacist refusing medicine based on a religious
exemption.*\
\
You said there is no alternative. I showed you at least one.\
\
So why then can a pharmacist not exercise his protected religious
rights?]{.rendered_qtext}
