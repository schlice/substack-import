The only way that your brother would not have been able to buy firearms
in the US is if he was determined by a court to be a mental defective.

If this is the case, and he has sufficiently recovered, and he can go
back to court to prove that he has indeed improved, he can have that
determination stricken, in which case he can once again buy guns.

If a court never ruled him as a mental defective, then he would not have
been barred from purchasing firearms in the first place. Medical
