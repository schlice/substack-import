**Is the firing of FBI agent Peter Strzok against normal FBI rules
something worthy of an investigation\--possibly a Special Prosecutor?**

First of all, there are no "rules" to firings.

Your article in the Washington Compost says that they previously had
told Strzok that he would only face a demotion and suspension, **not**
that "rules" *required* such a punishment. Apparently, the FBI changed
its mind. There's nothing illegal or rule-breaking about that. It
apparently went against some earlier assurances that Strzok would not be
fired, but the employer does have the choice to fire an employee.

The FBI doesn't need to be investigated because they chose to fire an
employee. The FBI needs to be investigated for not firing an employee
*sooner*.

We knew since the DOJ filed its IG report on the Hillary investigation
that Strzok had some problems, saying that his text messages between
himself and his mistress, Lisa Page, "potentially indicated or created
the appearance that investigative decisions were impacted by bias or
improper considerations," and added that Strzok's behavior was "not only
indicative of a biased state of mind but, even more seriously, implies a
willingness to take official action to impact the presidential
candidate's electoral prospects." The report found that Strzok's
decision to put the Russia probe ahead of the Hillary investigation
could have been tainted by the same bias. The report said, "Under these
circumstances, we did not have confidence that Strzok's decision to
prioritize the Russia investigation over following up on the
Midyear-related investigative lead discovered on the Weiner laptop was
free from bias." Finally, the investigation determined that Strzok's
activities were "antithetical to the core values of the FBI and the
Department of Justice."

We knew since then that Strzok needed to go. If anything, the DOJ needs
to investigate why the FBI decided to keep him employed for as long as
they did following the findings in their IG's report.

At best, Strzok may be able to file a wrongful termination lawsuit
because he was such a longtime agent with a good record that he could
argue he had an "implied employment contract" with the FBI. However, the
IG report's findings regarding his conduct essentially imply that he
freely violated any actual or implied employment contract, and therefore
even a wrongful termination suit is unlikely to be successful.
