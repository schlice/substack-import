**What is the benefit from escalating a simple traffic stop into a
felony arrest by refusing to give your name and ID to a police
officer?**

None. There really is no benefit to escalating a simple traffic stop
into a felony (or misdemeanor) arrest.

You won't beat the ticket by increasing your belligerence. You will
*only* make the situation worse by escalating noncompliance.

There simply is no scenario in which things get *better* by turning a
simple traffic stop into an arrest of any kind. But withholding your
identification, which you are *required* to give when demanded by a
police officer, and which you *agreed* to give when you received your
license, and for which the DMV can *revoke* your license (automatically
in some states)?

And FYI, in most jurisdictions, it's at best a misdemeanor to fail to
identify yourself to a police officer. At which point you'll be
arrested, and you'll be held in jail until you can be positively
identified.
