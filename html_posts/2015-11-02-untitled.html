**Content:** [It\'s funny, you started out by saying that most of my
positions were wrong, but then you went on to agree with me on most of

What leads you to believe that it is okay to tell law abiding citizens
that they can\'t defend themselves with an equal level of force with
which they are being presented? Or at least close? The bad guys will
have semiautos at least. You\'re going to leave the good guys with
nothing but bolt action rifles? I can get 5 shots off in the time you
can cycle the bolt. Seems kinda unfair, don\'t you
think?]{.rendered_qtext}
