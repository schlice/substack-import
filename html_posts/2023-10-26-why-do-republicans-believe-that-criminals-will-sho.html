Because "unarmed" does not equal "not dangerous."

Remember, deadly force is justified when you are in fear of your life
***or grievous bodily harm***. If someone punches you so hard that they
break your orbital socket, you can go permanently blind in that eye.
This qualifies as ***grievous bodily harm***. You may defend against
such an attack using any force at your disposal, including deadly force.

But that's not the real issue here, is it. Because if victims of crime
are unarmed, *then why aren't criminals?* If criminals were going to be
real thugs like they want to be, then *they* should be unarmed. Why do
criminals have guns if the people they are committing crimes against are
unarmed? You know who is *not* going to disarm if you take their "little
right" away? *Criminals.*

Why do you think it's okay for a criminal to have a gun and to use it to
commit a crime, but it's somehow not okay for the victim to have a gun
and to use it to defend against crime? What do you have against crime
victims that you seek to disarm them?
