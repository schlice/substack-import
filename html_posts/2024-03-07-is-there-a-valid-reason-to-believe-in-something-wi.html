The question comes down to what you accept as "proof" or "evidence."

If you're talking about "evidence" as "scientific findings following
empirical testing using the scientific method," that wouldn't make
sense. There are plenty of things that science can't prove, but we're
all rational to believe. For example:

1.  Math and logic. Science can't prove them, because science
    presupposes them.
2.  Metaphysical truths, such as there are minds that exist outside of
    my own.
3.  Moral judgements. Science can't prove that the Nazis were evil.
4.  Aesthetic judgements. The beautiful, like the good, can't be proven
    by science.\
    \
    And surprisingly,
5.  Science itself. The belief that the scientific method accurately
    discovers truth itself can't be proven by the scientific method.

You may be able to use logic or reason to gain enough "evidence" to
believe something, even if science can't prove it.
