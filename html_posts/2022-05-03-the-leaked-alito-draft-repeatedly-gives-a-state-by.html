No, because Congress has always had the ability to codify access to
abortion. or to codify banning abortion. They just never had the
political will to do so.

The House passed a bill which would codify the right to an abortion on
September 21, 2021. It passed 218 to 211. That is a razor thin margin in
the House --- just seven votes. Nevertheless, it barely squeaked through
the House. But it didn't make it through the Senate, which would have
needed 60 votes to overcome a filibuster, and it didn't even have full
support of all the Democrats in the Senate. Susan Collins, a Republican
who usually votes with the Democrats, couldn't support the bill because,
she said, it would weaken the conscience protections in the Religious
Freedom Restoration Act.

Congress could always codify the right to access abortion, or to ban
abortion, in federal law, but they don't have the broad consensus they
need to do so.

Original question:

The leaked Alito draft repeatedly gives a state-by-state based context
but then says \"we return it to the people and their representatives\",
not states? Is this intentionally ambiguous to allow a future Congress
to pass a nationwide abortion ban?
