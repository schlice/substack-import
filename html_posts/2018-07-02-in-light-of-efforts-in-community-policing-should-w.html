**In light of efforts in community policing, should Warren v. District
of Columbia be overturned?**

There are a lot of moving parts that have to come together before the
precedents begun in *Warren* can be removed.

Primarily, what *Warren* did was to declare that law enforcement does
not have an obligation to protect any one citizen. Law enforcement has a
general duty to protect the public at large, but they do not have
specific requirements to protect any one person. This declaration has
wide-ranging effects, but primarily it goes to *liability*. For example,
without *Warren*, if your child was killed by a drunk driver, you could
theoretically sue the police for failing to protect him from that drunk
driver. If the police have a specific duty to protect all citizens, the
police become legally liable any time someone is hurt.

Despite the advancements in community policing, this will never change
because it physically can't. We simply don't have enough police officers
to make protection of every citizen a reality. We'd literally need **100
times** the amount of police officers we have now, and even then, we'd
still only have one cop to three citizens. Think of how high your taxes
would have to be to support a police force that is 100 times as large as
it is now. And with all of the talk these days about how we have a
"police state" (we really don't; read a freakin' history book for crying
out loud), do you really *want* the police department to be that large?

**TL;DR:** We just don't have nearly enough police officers to make it
possible to remove the liability limitations *Warren* grants to the
police, and it would be physically impossible to have enough.
