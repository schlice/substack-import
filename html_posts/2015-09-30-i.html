**Content:** [Some people do have chronic pain. And in some cases,
medically there is nothing that can be done.\
\
Have you seen a pain specialist? There may be things you can do
homeopathically. But drugs may be involved. Talking to a pain specialist
is your best option.\
\
I don\'t want to include a Google link beause it may not work correctly
for you, but try Googling \"pain management\" and if your browser is set
up correctly, you should see a map with locations of pain doctors near
you.\
\
And cannabis can be the answer even if you\'re not interested in smoking
it. CBD is one of the active ingredients in cannabis, but it doesn\'t
produce the psychoactive effects. That comes from THC. If you live in a
state which allows medical marijuana, you can get cannabis oil with THC
removed so you get the benefits without the \"high.\"\
\
The notable example is [[Montel
Williams.](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=6ac030&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montel-Williams){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container} From his book, he
mentions that he uses a cannabis oil to control his neurological pain
from MS. He says it\'s the only thing that will control his pain, and
he\'s tried every pain medication out there. As a TV personality, he has
the money to do just that, so I have no doubt that he has tried
everything out there. He says a few drops of cannabis oil on his dinner
takes his pain level from a 10 to a 3 so he can actually sleep at night.
And it doesn\'t make him \"high\". It just fixes his pain, naturally.\
