MS is a diagnosis of exclusion. In order to diagnose it, you have to
test for (and thereby exclude) every other medical cause for the signs
(bright spots on an MRI) and symptoms (dizziness, vertigo, etc)
experienced. There are many different tests that contribute to the body
of evidence in a diagnosis. Once you have excluded every other potential
cause for the signs and symptoms, you can consider MS. For example,
white spots on an MRI can be caused by many different things. From
injury to migraines, white spots on an MRI appear for different reasons.
And bright spots on the spine can indeed be caused by fat deposits.

In other words, MS is considered when everything else which could cause
the signs and symptoms has been tested for and ruled out.

Nevertheless, I would still consider seeing a neurologist. There are few
other doctors who are in as good a position to help you diagnose exactly
what is happening with your brother.
