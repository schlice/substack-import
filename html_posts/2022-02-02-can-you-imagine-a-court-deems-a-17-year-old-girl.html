So that's certainly one way to interpret the case, but it's not what
*actually* happened, and once you fill in the rest of the details, it
kinda makes a little more sense.

So Florida law says that you must have parental consent to talk to a
doctor about abortion, and to actually have one.

The 17 year old girl, whose name was not included because she is a
minor, said she researched the procedure, was not interested in
adoption, and wanted to get an abortion, and wanted to speak with a
doctor first.

The county court, which considers many different factors --- including
overall intelligence --- said that her intelligence was not up to
standard. While she claimed she was a B student, her GPA was a 2.0
(which is just barely D- level, just above failing). The County judge
said that her testimony was proof of either "a lack of intelligence or a
lack of credibility."

An appeals court overturned the county court ruling on a 2--1 vote. The
appeals court said the girl "had a 2.0 GPA right now, but she's making
B's so she hopes to bring her average up."

She said she wants an abortion because she knows she's not "financially
stable" right now and wants to get there before she has a baby. She
actually wants to first join the military and become financially stable
before she has a baby.

The appeals court said that \"the petitioner\'s testimony demonstrates
that she possesses an ability to assess the consequences of her choice
and the risk it entails, as well as the intention to reassess her
decision after consultation with her physician.\"

\

Original question:

Can you imagine a court deems a 17 year old girl \"not intelligent
enough\" to have an abortion, but by default, smart enough to have,
raise, and support a child?
