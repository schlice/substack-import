*(There's whole books written about those two little words)*

If they don't want to talk to you because you don't share *their* belief
in God? **Let them**.

I love the description of Mel's book:

> What if the key to happiness, success, and love was as simple as two
> words?
>
> If you\'ve ever felt stuck, overwhelmed, or frustrated with where you
> are, the problem isn\'t you. The problem is the power you give to
> other people. Two simple words---*Let Them*---will set you free. Free
> from the opinions, drama, and judgments of others. Free from the
> exhausting cycle of trying to manage everything and everyone around
> you.

The problem isn't you. The problem is *the power you give to other
people.*

So instead of spinning your wheels worrying about what others are going
to think of you, or what others are going to do because if you:

> - Stop wasting energy on things you can\'t control
> - Stop comparing yourself to other people
> - Break free from fear and self-doubt
> - Release the grip of people\'s expectations

And if you follow the advice in Mel's book, you can also learn how to:

> - Build the best friendships of your life
> - Create the love you deserve
> - Pursue what truly matters to you with confidence
> - Build resilience against everyday stressors and distractions
> - Define your own path to success, joy, and fulfillment

I recommend her book, but this isn't a paid advertisement. Just someone
who's been reading it and benefitting from its wisdom.

Maybe you could too.
