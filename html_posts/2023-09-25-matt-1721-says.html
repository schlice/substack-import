Matthew 17:21 is a bit of an odd duck, because it is not included in the
best translations of the Bible. Most Bible scholars think that it wasn't
actually part of Matthew's gospel, but was an addition in some
translations and was actually inserted from Mark's gospel (specifically,
Mark 9:29).

Nevertheless, that statement about whether or not it should have been
included in Matthew's gospel doesn't change the fact that some
translations do have it in there, and others just have it as a footnote,
noting that it was probably inserted by a translator from Mark's gospel.
We can still discuss it.

And what it *does* say is not related to performing praise and worship
during fasting. So let's discuss the context around this passage. **For
a text, without a context, is just a pretext.**

Matthew 10:5-8 tells us that Jesus had given His disciples power to cast
out demons. But sometime later in Matthew 17, we are told that they
could not cast out a demon that was causing a man to be a "lunatic." We
are told in this passage that consequently, Jesus cast out the demon and
then explained to the disciples why they could not. There is an
important lesson for us here. Some will say the disciples lacked faith,
but Jesus explained that the faith they had was not enough to perform an
instantaneous exorcism. They needed to fast and pray.

Jesus\' words (even if they came from Mark) imply that some demons
require additional effort to exorcise. Jesus explained that faith was
the cause of the disciples\' failure to cast the demon out (Matthew
17:17), **not** a lack of prayer and fasting. The true failure was that
they did not sufficiently trust the power of God to work through them.
Jesus was clear that if they had faith even as small as a mustard seed,
nothing would be impossible for them (Matthew 13:31--32; 17:20).

Still, prayer and fasting are just expressions of faith. It would not be
wrong for a Christian to pray or even to fast when trying to accomplish
the will of God. It *would* be wrong, however, to believe that prayer
and fasting are *themselves* sources of power. Those things are merely
expressions of faith in God. His power is what accomplishes His will.
Prayer and fasting have no power in and of themselves.

It is also important to note that worship and prayer are synonymous.
When we worship, we are praying, but it is a particular prayer praising
God. Worship, praise, prayer, and fasting are all expressions of faith.
There is no biblical reason why they cannot be done together.
