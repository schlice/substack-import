**Does declaring a national emergency allow the President to send
military forces to the border, under Posse Comitatus?**

No.

The National Emergencies Act allows the President to invoke certain
provisions of law (which are already written into those laws) which he
normally cannot access. There are over 400 individual actions the
President is authorized to take in over 100 different Federal laws which
can be taken when a national emergency is declared. Of course, the
actual actions are determined by the actual emergency, but it's all
spelled out in the law.

Posse Comitatus says that the military cannot enforce state law. The
military's role is to support and defend the Constitution from all
enemies, foreign and domestic. Defense of the homeland has not
traditionally been part of the military's mission, but the military has
been given more authority to defend the physical border of the country
(not just projecting US power overseas) since 2001. Because the military
is defending the *national* border, not a state border, and national
border security squarely falls under the Federal government, border
security can be legally bolstered by the US military without violating
Posse Comitatus.

Additionally, there are several Federal laws (10 USC ยง 284 comes to
mind) which allows the military to support "counterdrug" activities,
which has been taking place for decades. Military assets have been used
to support FBI and DEA counterdrug activities for many years.
