According to the Americans with Disabilities Act, service animals which
are trained to assist with a recognized disability can go anywhere that
people can go. Therefore, service animals are permitted in the passenger
compartment of aircraft, as they likely must perform one or more of
their duties for their human handler throughout the flight.

Note that [[Stanton

got it half right. "Service animals" are legally protected by the ADA.
"Emotional support animals" are ***not*** trained to do anything
special, and therefore are ***not protected by the ADA***.
Establishments have the right to restrict emotional support animals from
places of public accommodation. But they don't, because in today's
hypersensitive, overly-maligned society, it would be bad PR to restrict
someone's emotional support animal. So they just don't bother. So in
truth, they can restrict emotional support animals, but in practice,
they generally don't.

Any animal, service animal or not, can be restricted if it is
uncontrollable or if it is a danger or disruption to the other people.
