I would make only one correction to your answer.

You said:

*Politicians, especially those granted great power are supposed to be
suitable for their roles.*

In short, no they are not.

If they were "supposed to be suitable," there would be a test for
suitability built into the Constitution. In fact, it is quite the
opposite. The requirements to become President are:

- A natural born citizen
- at least 35 years old
- and has lived in the United States for at least fourteen years.

Other than that, there are no other requirements for being President,
and that includes any suitability requirement.

What this means is that suitability is *subjective* and is left up to
the voters. The voters have determined that Trump is suitable enough for
the job (or that his opponent was wholly unsuitable, depending on your
viewpoint) that they elected him.
