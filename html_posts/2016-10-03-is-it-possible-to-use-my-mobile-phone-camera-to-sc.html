The phone must then have specific software built into it to a) recognize
when the camera is looking at a QR code and not your family reunion, and
b) interpret that QR code.

While some phones may have b) built in, most phones are not constantly
scanning for QR codes while you're trying to take a picture. This is
generally why you need to indicate to the phone in one way or another
that you would like to scan a QR code. If your phone's camera app does
not have a built-in QR reader (most camera apps do not), you will need
an external app. Even then, you would have to indicate to the camera app
that you would like to scan for a QR code so that the app can search for
it.

The default camera app in Android does not continuously scan for QR
codes, nor does it have QR software built in to the camera app. If you
want to scan QR codes, you must download a third-party scanner.
