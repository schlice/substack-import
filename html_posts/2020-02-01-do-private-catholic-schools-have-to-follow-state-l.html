**Do private Catholic schools have to follow state laws about what has
to be taught**

In the United States, students must be taught to a certain level. This
level is determine by standardized testing, not by "what is taught."
States largely allow districts to develop their curricula, and to teach
it as they see fit, so long as student achievement on standardized
testing remains high.

Private schools are generally not bound by any curriculum rules which
might be set by a school district, although their students must still
meet a minimum average on standardized testing.

(EDIT) Thanks to [[John

for pointing out that I forgot my usual legal tagline: every state is
different. Even though many states can operate similarly, all states can
administer their education programs exactly as they choose, within
Federal law, which does not specify that a school must teach any one
specific thing.
