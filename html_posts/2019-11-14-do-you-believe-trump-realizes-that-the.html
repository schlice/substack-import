**Do you believe Trump realizes that the "transcript" he sanitized,
wrote & released will be the basis for his impeachment?**

Your thinly-velied condemnation of the President has not gone unnoticed.

Your poorly-worded question gave it away.

1.  The President did not write the call summary. It was written by a
    CIA operative who works in the White House. He listens to the calls
    and he records the main ideas of what was said. He's actually very
    good at this.
2.  The call summary was not changed from what the CIA agent wrote.
3.  All the parties on the call agree that the call summary accurately
    reflects the contents of the call.

If you truly believe that this call summary should be the basis to
impeach a President, then not only do you not understand what
impeachment is for, but you have truly lost the narrative. No crimes
have taken place. Nothing on the order of a "high crime or misdemeanor"
has transpired. Remember that in the Constitution, Article II Section 4
reads: \"The President, Vice President and all civil Officers of the
United States, shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and
Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and
Misdemeanors.\" So the intent of high crimes and misdemeanors was actual
lawlessness.

Indeed, throughout our history, impeachment was only ever proffered when
a President has violated a law. This is the first time in history that a
President will be impeached because the House of Representatives doesn't
like how he governs.

We have truly jumped the shark.
