**Can the President of United States be arrested while in charge?**

Practically, no the President cannot be arrested while in office. He is
surrounded by Secret Service and is under surveillance 24x7. It would be
a tremendous challenge to arrest the President.

Constitutionally, it's much more clear that the President cannot be
arrested. Article II, Section 1 of the Constitution is very clear: "The
executive power shall be vested in a President of the United States of
America." This means that **the President** ***is*** **the Executive**.
Not the President and the Vice President. Not the President and the
Attorney General. Not the President and the Director of the FBI. The
President only.

This was a deliberate decision on the part of the Framers, and it was
done in part to balance the Executive and check the power of the
Judiciary and the Legislature.

To that end, **all Executive authority flows from the President**. The
authority of any prosecutor to issue an indictment, the power of any
sheriff to attempt an arrest, all flows directly from the power of the
executive, which is exclusively vested in the President. It's the same
reason that a deputy cannot arrest the sheriff: it's the sheriff who
deputized the deputy. He could instantly revoke that deputization, and
the deputy would have no authority.

Therefore, the President cannot be indicted or arrested while in office
for several reasons:

1.  The President *is* the source for all executive authority. Since he
    granted the authority, it is plainly obvious that he will not allow
    himself to be indicted while in office.
2.  Arresting the President would have serious functional ramifications
    on the government. In order to maintain smooth functioning of the
    government, you cannot remove a key officer of the government and
    expect it to continue to run smoothly.

So does this mean the President is above the law? Of course not. The
Constitution included a provision to deal with Presidential lawlessness:
*impeachment*. You can impeach a president and remove him from office,
and then you can feel free to indict and/or arrest him.
