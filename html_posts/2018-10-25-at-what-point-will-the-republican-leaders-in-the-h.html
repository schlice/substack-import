**At what point will the Republican leaders in the House and Senate
finally say this country is more important than their donors and the
Koch brothers and stop Trump?**

I think you're going to have to be a little bit more clear about what
exactly you think is going on in Washington.

- How are Representatives and Senators voting against the will of the
  voters and in line with "their donors and the Koch brothers?"
- What is Trump doing that "needs stopping" that Congress is failing to
  do?

Representatives and Senators should always be voting in their
constituents' best interests, or they may not get re-elected. I would
have though that would have been clear by this point, but I guess not:
if you don't vote in accordance with the will of the electorate, you
don't get re-elected. More to the point: if your representative or
Senator is not voting in the way you like, don't re-elect them.

I'm still curious what you think Trump is doing that needs stopping, or
what Trump can do without the support of Congress that similarly needs
stopping. Unemployment is at its lowest rate in over 5 decades. Black
and Hispanic unemployment is at its lowest rate, ***ever*.** Tax cuts
have created jobs and have put more money back in your pocket. Stifling
government regulations have been rolled back at an amazing rate, getting
government off of your back and allowing you to be more free. The
military is getting funding again so that they can continue to fight
both the Global War on Terror as well as other military campaigns
simultaneously. We are stopping terrorist from making their way onto our
shores to execute their terror plots. We are trying to enforce the
border, despite Democrats' best efforts to stop us. So I ask again: what
exactly is Trump doing that "needs to be stopped?"
