Let's break this down, because there's a lot here.

> Why is Satanism legal and have the freedom to be practiced

For the same reason that Christianity, Judaism, Mormonism, and
Scientology are also all legal. The First Amendment says that government
"shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or
prohibiting the free exercise thereof." Pretty straightforward. Satanism
is a religion; Congress cannot make a law making Satanism illegal.

> while its beliefs provide hatred and murders?

I think you meant to say that these beliefs ***promote*** hatred and
murder.

I remember not too long ago when the radical arm of a particular
religion murdered over 3000 innocent citizens on US soil, and yet that
religion is still legal to practice.

Promoting hatred is not illegal. Even promoting murder is not illegal,
because along with freedom of religion, we have freedom of speech.

But there are limits. While I can say "All cops should die," and that's
legal, I can't then say, "So you all should go kill that cop right
there" because if they do it, I would be inciting violence.

Religion is not unique in spurring adherents to hate and murder.

> Wouldn\'t it be better if these religious groups stop existing for the
> protection of society?

In the short term, sure. Eliminating these religions would protect
society. But there's a few problems:

1.  Who gets to decide which religions are unsafe? Who gets to decide
    which religions are allowed to exist and which ones are not? Do you
    trust the government to make that decision? And before you answer
    that question, remember that your political opponents may be in
    office next term.
2.  History has shown us that despite government oppression, believers
    will still believe. When Christianity was banned in France during
    the French Revolution, it went underground, led by the likes of the
    [[Blessed William Joseph
    Chaminade](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=0e8441&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Joseph_Chaminade){.external_link
    rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
    onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
    qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}. Government
    suppression of religion does not stop religion.
3.  What happens when we move beyond religion? What happens when we
    decide that some words are too unsafe for society? What happens when
    we decide that some lifestyles are too unsafe for society? What
    happens when we decide that some ethnicities are too unsafe for
    society? The answer: **genocide**. It's been tried before (see:
    Hitler, Mussolini, Idi Amin, Saddam Hussein, Ho Chi Minh, etc). It
    has always failed.

Knowing this history about attempting to suppress religion, our Founders
decided that this country would be one where anyone would be free to
practice any religion they choose, or none at all. This includes
Satanism. But this in no way is an excuse for murder. Murderers can use
as their justification whatever they choose. The law does not care why
you killed someone, unless you are mounting a defense and you wish to
use self-defense as your justification.
