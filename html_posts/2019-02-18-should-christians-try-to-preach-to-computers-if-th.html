**Should Christians try to preach to computers if they are able to think
like humans in the future?**

"Being able to think like humans" and "possessing an immortal soul which
will live on after the body dies" are two totally different things.

I'm not sure that preaching to computers would do much more than hone
your own apologetics skills. You certainly won't be able to save the
computer.
