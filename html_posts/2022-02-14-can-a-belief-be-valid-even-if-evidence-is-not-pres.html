In order to answer this question, we have to determine what we believe
in, and I think we can take as a basic premise that we believe in what
is true. However, what is truth? How do we determine truth?

So first of all, does truth exist? I think we can say quite plainly that
truth does exist, and it is undeniable and absolute. You cannot say
"truth cannot be known" because that is a self-defeating statement which
claims to be a *known,* *absolute truth*.

So what are the processes by which we discover truth? We can start with
what we call the "[[First
principles](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=6cc14a&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_principle){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}." They are called the
First Principles because nothing is used to prove them. They are true
based on the nature of reality. They are what we call "self-evident." A
few of those truths are the [[Law of
noncontradiction](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=b63cdd&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_noncontradiction){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container} and the [[Law of the
excluded
middle](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=b3564e&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_excluded_middle){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}. The Law of the excluded
middle says that something either *is* or it *is not*. There is no third
alternative. For example, either God exists, or he does not. We use the
FIrst Principles to discover all other truths. Just as you need eyes in
your head to see, you need First Principles in your mind in order to
learn and understand all other truths about reality.

Beyond the First Principles, we generally determine truth by using
observation and then drawing conclusions based on what we observe. This
is a process called *induction*. This is different from *deduction* in
that deduction is taking a series of premises and drawing a conclusion
from them, while induction is the process of determining whether the
*premises themselves* are true.

Most of the things you know by induction are not 100% certain, but are
usually *highly certain*. For example, do you know with 100% certainty
that gravity will pull all dropped objects to the earth? The answer is
no, because you have not observed every object which has been dropped.

So if the things we know by induction are not 100% certain, can they be
*trusted*? Yes, with varying levels of certainty. Because none of us
possess unlimited knowledge, it is true that some of our inductions
could be wrong. But even when we are not 100% certain, we usually have
enough information to make *reasonably certain* conclusions about most
questions in life. So back to our example, can we be *reasonably sure*
that gravity will pull all dropped objects to the earth? Since nearly
every dropped object has been pulled to the earth, our conclusion that
all dropped objects will be pulled to the earth can be considered **true
beyond a reasonable doubt**. It's 99+% sure. It's not beyond *all*
doubt, but it's beyond *reasonable* doubt.

So even if we can't see something (since this is what most people call
"evidence"), we can use inductive reasoning, logic, and scientific
principles to determine the truth of the premise beyond a reasonable
doubt.
