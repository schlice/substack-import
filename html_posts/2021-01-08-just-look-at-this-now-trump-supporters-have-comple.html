**Just look at this. Now Trump supporters have completely turned on
Lindsey Graham and threw profanities at him in while he was in the
airport , calling him a "traitor." How did Trump manage to create such a
dangerous, loyal cult following around him?**

Trump is not entirely to blame for this.

He is, primarily, to blame for not shutting it down. He is to blame for
promulgating the "stolen election" trope. He is to blame for stoking the
fire that people were already feeling.

But let's look at how we got here.

Does no one remember this? The city of Kenosha is literally burning
behind him, but this is a "mostly peaceful protest."

I can't help but look at this image and see:

The media in this country, promulgated and supported by progressives,
did this. And what has it done? It taught Trump loyalists that *violence
is an acceptable way to vent your outrage.* It taught Trump loyalists
that *your outrage justifies your behavior.*

***So why does it surprise anyone that this is how the fringe on either
side of the aisle behaves?***

The reason that it surprises people is that historically, *Republicans
do not do this.* Even Republicans were somewhat taken aback by the
behavior of Trump loyalists. Because Republicans, by and large, do not
react emotionally. They react logically. They react cautiously. They
preach taking time to fully analyze before making changes, and if the
change is at all going to be disruptive, they don't prefer to make it.
So this violence was even a little surprising to them.

While Trump deserves much of the blame for not quelling this sooner (and
not backing off of the "stolen election" rhetoric sooner), the
conditions which led to this were not Trump's fault.

The blame for creating the conditions which led to this lie squarely
with the media in this country, and the progressives who enable them.
