**If someone has a child in secret, and doesn\'t tell anyone about him
until he is 18, so that he has no documents and no records about him
anywhere, how would this situation be handled by the legal authority?**

*(US answer; laws in other countries may vary)*

Once the child turns 18, he is considered an adult. There is nothing to
"handle" any more. There are no further child support payments which
need to be made, and in any case, those payments should have been
requested during the time that the child was a child.
