**Content:** []{.rendered_qtext}

My wife was involved in a pile-up accident. She barely tapped the car in
front of her, and then got plowed from behind when a driver failed to
stop ***at all***.

Her damages for her surgeries and physical therapy were limited because
she hit the car in front of her, and no one can know for certain how
much damage was caused by the front accident, and how much was caused by
the rear accident.
