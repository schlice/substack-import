The short answer is *it depends*.

Some Christians who don't understand the history of yoga see it as
nothing more than a way to exercise, and strengthen the body as well as
improving flexibility.

But yoga is actually a very old practice from India, and its goal is to
prepare the body for spiritual exercises aimed towards achieving
enlightenment. It is based on the belief that man and God are one, part
of the religious practice of *pantheism,* the belief that everything is
God and that reality consists only of the universe and nature. Because
everything is God, the yoga philosophy makes no distinction between man
and God. Consequently, this leaves the participant open to deception by
Satan and his demons, who are constantly looking for opportunities to
deceive Christians and turn them away from God.

\

So is it possible to do yoga as a Christian? I'd say *maybe*, but only
under very specific conditions.

As long as your practice of yoga:

- does not encourage you to trust yourself rather than God
- does not encourage you to seek answers to your problems within
  yourself
- does not encourage the belief that man and God are the same

then you might be okay doing yoga for solely physical exercise. But take
great care: the design of yoga was blatantly, overtly anti-Christian,
and those design philosophies have not changed.

Since Christians are admonished to not participate in things which may
pull them away from their faith, or encourage others in unfaithfulness,
yoga should be done only very cautiously.

> So, whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory

Whatever you do should be done for the glory of God, including your
physical exercise.
