**If someone says that guns are bad and nobody should own one, what kind
of fallacy would that be?**

It's not a fallacy in logic. It's simply an opinion.

If you were to say instead, "Guns are bad; everyone knows that, so
therefore no one should own them," that's what we call an **appeal to
omniscience**, because you are claiming that "everyone" knows something,
but in order to claim that, you have to know what "everyone" knows.
