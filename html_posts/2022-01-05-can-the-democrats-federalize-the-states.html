The federal government is limited by the Constitution. The 10th
Amendment clearly says that if it's not written in to the Constitution
as a Federal power, it is left to the states and to the people,
respectively.

So if you can show Article and Paragraph wherein the Constitution
provides the authority for the Federal government to run state
elections, then they can.

You can go ahead and look for it. I'll wait.

I don't have to wait long. The Constitution isn't all that big.

Spoilers: it's not in there.

TL;DR: No, the Constitution does not permit the Federal government to
run state elections.

Original question:

Can the Democrats federalize the states' voting laws like they want to,
or is it unconstitutional?
