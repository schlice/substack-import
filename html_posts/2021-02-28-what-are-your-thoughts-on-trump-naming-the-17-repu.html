**What are your thoughts on Trump naming the 17 Republicans who voted to
impeach him and said that the GOP needs to \"get rid\" of them during
his CPAC speech?**

1.  Trump has every right to say whatever he feels about those 7
    Republican Senators. and 10 Republican House Representatives.
2.  The GOP (a private organization) can conduct itself exactly as it
    chooses. They do not take orders from Trump.
3.  The public should understand that Trump is a former president, and
    his word carries exactly as much weight as that of a former
    president.
4.  His past words inform us about what we should think about his
    current words. Which means we take everything he says with a HUGE
    SCOOP of salt.
