**Can crime be cut down by 75% in the USA by eliminating this phrase
from the Constitution "No Cruel Or Unusual punishment"?**

We debate continuously in this country whether or not we should have
capital punishment. There is a vocal minority who believes that capital
punishment can be considered "cruel and/or unusual." Yet we still have
it.

Nevertheless, people still commit murder, even with the threat of the
state catching and killing them.

So even with a punishment as severe and final as death, people still
commit those crimes. There is at least, therefore, some evidence to show
that the severity of the punishment is not always a deterrent to crime.
So I don't think you can say definitively that you'll get a 75%
reduction in crime by allowing cruel punishments.
