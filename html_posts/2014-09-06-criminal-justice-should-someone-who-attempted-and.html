**Content:** [Yes, that is why there are levels of crimes, even the same
crime. Murder is a different degree of crime than attempted murder. In
any case, attempted \<crime\> is a lower level of crime than \<crime\>
itself. The \"attempted\" tag reduces the severity of the crime because
the crime was not completed.\
\
Ethically, you can say that the crime was attempted, but the moral
compass of the individual took over, persuading the doer to stop doing
the crime. This would be the ethical logic behind a lesser level of
crime for an attempt: the person\'s moral compass actually aided them in
stopping themselves; thus, they should be judged less severely because
they were able to stop themselves.]{.rendered_qtext}
