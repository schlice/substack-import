<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Yes, that is why there are levels of crimes, even the same<br>crime. Murder is a different degree of crime than attempted murder. In<br>any case, attempted \<crime\> is a lower level of crime than \<crime\><br>itself. The \"attempted\" tag reduces the severity of the crime because<br>the crime was not completed.\<br>\<br>Ethically, you can say that the crime was attempted, but the moral<br>compass of the individual took over, persuading the doer to stop doing<br>the crime. This would be the ethical logic behind a lesser level of<br>crime for an attempt: the person\'s moral compass actually aided them in<br>stopping themselves; thus, they should be judged less severely because<br>they were able to stop themselves.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
