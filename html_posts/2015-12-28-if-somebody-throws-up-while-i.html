The general answer to \"If X happens to someone else at a restaurant,
can I leave without paying\" is **no**. There are very, very few
circumstances that will directly exonerate you of *your* responsibility
to pay for *your* food at *your* table.

If I had to guess, you are probably assuming that the food is somehow
tainted, and if you eat your food, you too will become sick.

If this ever happens to you (someone puking at another table), **contact
the manager immediately** and express your concern. It is highly likely
that the manager will \"comp\" your meal (i.e. the restaurant will eat
the cost).

That said, you are **never** \"allowed\" (as a matter of policy) to
simply get up and leave without paying your bill. In most jurisdictions,
this is considered \"theft of service.\" You have an arrangement
directly with the restaurant, as does every other customer. Nowhere in
that arrangement is a clause that allows you to unilaterally break that
arrangement. You have to negotiate a new arrangement, which involves
talking to the manager. The manager is the only person who can \"comp\"
your bill, as it amounts to a loss for the restaurant. If the manager
deems that it is important enough for customer retention to do that, he
will, but it is entirely up to the manager, not you.
