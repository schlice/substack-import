**Does President Trump understand that mixed messaging between himself
and medical experts hurts the country by creating confusion?**

I understand that you may be confused by mixed messaging.

However, I didn't elect "medical experts" to run the country. Medical
experts, if they had their way, would keep us in lockdown for the next
18 months until a vaccine is distributed. Then, they'd identify everyone
who got a vaccine with some sort of identification to prove that you're
safe to leave your home.

Thankfully, medical experts don't run the country.

Trump takes advice from medical experts and creates policy which
**balances** the need for medical action with the needs of the economy,
which can also kill just as efficiently as the virus. Numbers released
just today show that **27 million people** have filed for unemployment
benefits since the start of the pandemic. Think about that. **27,000,000
people** can no longer buy food for their kids or afford their houses.
And there is a significant number of those families who already had
difficulty feeding their kids to begin with, many of them with school
food programs being that child's primary meal of the day. So now, not
only are they not in school being fed by a school food program, but
their caregivers have no means to make money to even potentially buy
food. Millions more children, beyond those who were starving before,
will be starving now. The UN has already warned that hundreds of
thousands of them may die.

And all of that because maybe 100,000 may die. 27,000,000 impoverished
because maybe 100,000 may die. Do those numbers add up to you?

If they do, then it's probably because you don't understand what
"flattening the curve" was all about. Flattening the curve was never
about preventing you from getting sick in the first place. Flattening
the curve was about making sure that we don't overwhelm the medical
system. This also means that yes, people will get sick. Yes, some people
will die. But you cannot prevent that. Even with aggressive measures
taken (the most aggressive we have the ability to take in this country),
people will still get sick and people will die.

This isn't an argument of lives vs money. It's an argument of lives vs
lives. It always has been. If we don't start allowing people to go back
to work, and if we don't start allowing people to earn money again, we
will be facing a second pandemic, and it has nothing to do with a virus.

Instead, our strategy should be one of allowing the young, healthy
people to go back to work, protecting the most at-risk among us,
monitoring disease outbreak, making changes where needed, and getting
the country back to work again. The medical professionals would never
stand for that.

It's good to hear what the medical experts say. But then it's important
to hear what the President says, which is what happens when you remember
who was elected to actually run the country.
