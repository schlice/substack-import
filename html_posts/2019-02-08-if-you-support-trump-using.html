**If you support Trump using \"national emergency\' power to build his
wall, would you continue even if it created legal precedent for a future
president to have unrestrained power to restrict assault and other
military weapons?**

It's clear you don't understand how this whole "national emergency"
thing works.

Many of our Federal laws have these little inbuilt "short-circuits" that
allow the president to do certain things (which would otherwise have to
go through Congressional approval or other processes) during a time of
declared war or declared national emergency. Clearly, declared war is
out, as declarations of war can only be made by Congress. But the
president can declare a national emergency, and it's solely his job to
do so. [[It's been done many
times](https://www.quora.com/How-can-a-U-S-president-simply-declare-there-will-be-an-emergency-some-number-of-days-in-the-future-specifically-pending-the-outcome-of-a-funding-measure/answer/Bill-Stein)]{.qlink_container},
probably more often than you know. It's governed by the National
Emergencies Act. The law outlines what the president needs to do in
order to declare a national emergency.

Once the national emergency is declared, all of these Federal laws with
their little inbuilt short-circuits become available to be used. For
instance, 10 USC ยง 2808 has the following in it (*emphasis* added):

> \[I\]n the event of a declaration of war *or the declaration by the
> President of a national emergency* in accordance with the National
> Emergencies Act (50 USC ยง 1601 et seq.) *that requires use of the
> armed forces*, the Secretary of Defense, without regard to any other
> provision of law, may undertake military construction projects, and
> may authorize the Secretaries of the military departments to undertake
> military construction projects, not otherwise authorized by law *that
> are necessary to support such use of the armed forces.* Such projects
> may be undertaken *only within the total amount of funds that have
> been appropriated for military construction*, including funds
> appropriated for family housing, that have not been obligated.

So in order for a national emergency to make guns illegal, there would
have to be a law that gave some agency the authority to do so in the
event of a national emergency.

But not even a national emergency can override the Constitution. So such
a law would be unconstitutional.
