**Why is it so difficult to understand someone has MS?**

There are a few reasons for this.

MS is a very difficult disease to diagnose. We have really good
diagnostic tools today, but there is nothing specific in the disease
that conclusively says that you have MS. There's no biomarker in a blood
test that will positively show you have it. Diagnosing MS is as much an
art as it is a science.

Also, people with MS live with this awful dichotomy of how good you look
on the outside as opposed to how bad you feel on the inside. Unless
you're walking with assistance, or in a wheelchair (which is rare in
MS), it's virtually impossible to tell that someone has it without them
telling you. Or even better is someone who only knows of MS from famous
people who have died from its complications, like Richard Pryor, and
they say, "You have MS? *But you look so good!*" That one always strikes
me, because I'm never quite sure what they think someone with MS is
*supposed* to look like.
