I can't answer who between those two makes a better human. There have
been wonderful humans who didn't believe in God at all. So simply
believing in God or following his commands does not automatically make
you a better human.

But what is better for your *spirit* is to do **both**, not either/or.
You must believe in God, love God, and repent of your sins, and live by
his teachings.

Original question:

Are you Christian? What is better for your spirit, to live practicing
the Christ\'s doctrine or believing in God, in the Virgin, etc.? Who is
a better human: s/he who practices the Christ\'s teachings or s/he
believer in God who do not practice them?
