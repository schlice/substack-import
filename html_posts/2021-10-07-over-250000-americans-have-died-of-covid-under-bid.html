*NOTE: This is a US framed question, so it is a US-framed answer.*

I missed where they promised that no one would die from COVID, and that
any deaths can only be attributed to mismanagement at the federal level.

We know that severe COVID causes severe respiratory distress. We also
know that people with pre-existing respiratory illness, which is the
fourth (chronic lower respiratory illness) and eighth (P&I - pneumonia
and influenza) largest killers of people worldwide, are hit very hard by
severe COVID. It's no surprise that a virus which causes severe
respiratory distress would hit hard against people who already have
respiratory issues of some kind. We also had few effective treatments
against the virus and its actions.

We now have a vaccine which has been distributed widely in this country,
we have a moderate understanding about how the virus transmits, and we
have some very effective treatment options thanks to the Herculean
efforts of doctors and nurses on the ground in emergency departments
across the country.

**No politician is responsible for anyone's death.** Unless a politician
is **literally** standing between you and the vaccine, or standing
between you and a treatment, they cannot be responsible for those
deaths. Yes, political mismanagement is a travesty, but it is the state
which controls vaccine distribution, not the federal government. If you
don't have access to a vaccine, you must first look to your state to
find out why not.

When you hear things like "politicians are responsible for COVID
deaths," this is politicians politicizing a virus. To a certain extent,
Trump did this as he was fixing blame for the virus on China, but Biden
really excelled at this particular facet of politics. He has *very
effectively* politicized the virus, politicized the vaccine, and made a
brand new moral segregation between people in the United States (people
who are "good" and do everything the government says, and people who are
"bad" and question what the government says is good), effectively
creating a two-tiered society.

Don't put much weight on any of that "X politician is responsible for
COVID deaths" talk. They're baiting you into falling for their
politicization of the virus for their own political gain.

Be smarter. Be better.

Original question:

Over 250,000 Americans have died of COVID under Biden\'s Presidency,
despite inheriting 3 vaccines and over 1 Million people a day being
vaccinated. Has he failed at handling COVID too? Is he responsible for
those 250K deaths like Dems say Trump was?

*Be cautious using the comments section.*

*This is a highly-emotional and politically-charged topic (see my answer
to understand why).*

*I have allowed comments to remain open on this answer. Some people like
to comment. Some people like to engage with me in a civil manner. But do
not misunderstand, I have no tolerance for harassing or inane behavior.
If you don\'t like what I wrote, tough shit. If my answer is
grammatically low-quality or is un-cited opinion masquerading as fact,
downvote it. If you think I\'m wrong, write your own answer. But Quora
is a question-and-answer site, not a debate site. If you are simply
commenting to tell me \"ackshually, you\'re wrong,\" don\'t be surprised
if I quietly delete your comment. Put anything vaguely harassing in
there, and your deletion will be followed by a block/mute, and a BNBR
report. I will do this immediately and with no compunction. You have
been warned. Be nice.*
