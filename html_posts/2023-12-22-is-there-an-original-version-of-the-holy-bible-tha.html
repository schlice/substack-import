First, there isn't an "original version of the Bible." The Bible is
actually a compendium of 66 books, written over the course of 1500 years
in three languages on three different continents.

Second, in the vast majority of cases, "churches" have not altered the
Bible.ยน But "translation" between languages involves altering some
words, out of necessity.

For example, Hebrew has fewer words than English. So some words in
Hebrew have multiple meanings. The translator must determine which
meaning was intended by the original author in order to choose the
correct English word. Greek has the opposite problem where, for example,
there are no fewer than six words in Greek which mean various forms of
"love" (i.e. parental love, platonic love, love between close friends,
erotic love, etc), yet in English, we just have "love."

Translation, therefore, involves the alteration of words in order to
convey the correct meaning.

Bible translations can range from "word for word" translations (which
accurately translate the words but the meaning may be more difficult to
understand) to "thought for thought" translations (where the translator
reads an entire sentence in the original language and then writes it in
the new language, trying to retain as much of the original words and
meaning as possible), or "paraphrase" translations (where an entire
paragraph is read and is re-stated without fidelity to the original
words whatsoever, but tries to retain the meaning of what was originally
written). Generally, as you get towards the "paraphrase" side of the
spectrum, the translations are easier to read and understand, but hold
less fidelity to the original words, where as you get closer to the
"word for word" side, the original words are retained, but you may not
get the original author's meaning.

ยน The one notable exception is the New World Translation, translated by
the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society, which is the first intentional,
systematic effort at producing a complete version of the Bible that is
edited and revised for the specific purpose of agreeing with their
religious doctrine. The Jehovah's Witnesses and the Watchtower Society
realized that their beliefs contradicted the Bible. So, rather than
conforming their beliefs to the Bible, they altered the Bible to agree
with their beliefs.
