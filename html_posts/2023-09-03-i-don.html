The president doesn't have the authority to overturn state or local
laws. The truth is that the president, like the Congress, follows the
will of the people. And the people (well, the white people anyway)
wanted these laws.

Jim Crow laws were state and local laws which existed for about 100
years (from the end of the Civil War until around 1968). They started to
crumble in the post-WWII reconstruction time period, which saw a great
deal of civil rights expansion for blacks (in fact, it was civil rights
for all, including blacks).

All of those presidents may have been good men and good presidents, but
they were not kings. They work for the people. And if that's what the
people want, the president (and the Congress) won't override them. The
multitude of state and local laws which existed around the country
testified to the fact that people wanted those laws.
