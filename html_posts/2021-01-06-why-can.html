**Why can't Donald Trump be charged with sedition?**

He can. In fact, anyone can be charged with anything.

The question is, can he be *convicted*.

The truth is, despite what you've heard here so far, **he can't.**

The actual charge is *seditious conspiracy.* Under Federal law, it is a
crime for two or more people within the jurisdiction of the United
States

- to conspire to overthrow or destroy by force the government of the
  United States or to level war against them;
- to oppose by force the authority of the United States government; to
  prevent, hinder, or delay by force the execution of any law of the
  United States; or
- to take, seize, or possess by force any property of the United States
  contrary to the authority thereof (18 USC ยง 2384).

To differentiate sedition from free speech, the government must prove
that the defendant **actually conspired to use force.** In other words,
two or more people making political speeches *advocating* for using
force to overthrow the government have not necessarily committed
sedition. In the vast majority of cases, that's protected free speech
(however undesirable). It is when you begin *actively planning such an
action* (such as coordinating the logistics of an actual overthrow
operation, distributing bullets, actively opposing lawful authority,
etc) that you cross the line into seditious conspiracy.

The goal of the law is to prevent attacks against the US while still
preserving the First Amendment.

In addition to the difficulty in proving seditious conspiracy,
*political speech* is even *more* protected. Politicians are the very
people entrusted with safeguarding our political system. It is most
likely that they would be the very ones speaking out against how our
system is run. To that end, political speech, being the very speech
which is designed to redress issues in government function, is the most
tightly scrutinized, with the largest amount of deference given to the
protections afforded under the First Amendment.

So absent some discovery of Trump actually sitting in on planning
meetings wherein discussions of how the Proud Boys are going to start a
revolution, I think you will find it unlikely that he could be charged,
let alone convicted, of sedition. Political speeches, *even speeches
which actively advocate for using armed force to overthrow the
government*, are also protected First Amendment speech, despite exactly
how distasteful such speeches may be.

*For the time being, I have re-enabled comments on selected answers.
Some people like to comment. Some people like to engage with me in a
civil manner, and I did kinda miss that\...a little. But do not
misunderstand, I take this step very cautiously, and I have no tolerance
for harassing or inane behavior. If you don\'t like what I wrote, tough
shit. If my answer is grammatically low-quality or is un-cited opinion
masquerading as fact, downvote it. If you think I\'m wrong, write your
own answer. But Quora is a question-and-answer site, not a debate site.
If you are simply commenting to tell me \"ackshually, you\'re wrong,\"
don\'t be surprised if I quietly delete your comment. Put anything
vaguely harassing in there, and your deletion will be followed by a
block/mute, and a BNBR report. I will do this immediately and with no
compunction. You have been warned. Be nice.*

*And if the crowd gets too belligerent here, I'll delete and disable
comments. They don't have to be on. Engage civilly or not at all.*
