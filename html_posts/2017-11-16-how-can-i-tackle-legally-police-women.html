So let's break this down.

If we're talking about *physically tackling someone*, there is no way to
legally do this unless you do so in self-defense, or in defense of
someone else. Mental harassment does not constitute a situation which
requires a physical response. You would be arrested for assault.

If we're talking about *tackling the situation,* you're instead asking
how you deal with a boss who is harassing you.

You have a few things you should do:

1.  *Start with the person.* It amazes me the number of people who don't
    directly address the individual and immediately skip to other steps.
    Always start at the lowest level and work up. If you need someone to
    accompany you because you don't feel safe talking to the person,
    bring a trusted co-worker or friend with you when you confront the
    principal, and be sure the principal understands that your friend is
    simply a third-party observer, otherwise it feels like you're
    "ganging up" on him/her. Confronting the person directly is
    important. Perhaps they are unaware of what they are doing. Perhaps
    the principal is actually a decent person and doesn't know his or
    her actions are coming off as harassing. If you can address it
    directly, do. Also, when I say "confront," that means address the
    issue. It does not mean "be confrontational." Address the *issue*,
    not the *person*. The person is not bad; their conduct is bad. Keep
    this in mind when you speak to the principal.
2.  If you've attempted to communicate your issues to the principal and
    it has not helped, *go to your HR group.* Let them know you tried to
    address the issue with your principal and he's not budging and the
    harassment continues. HR should be able to address the issue. HR
    should be able to deal with reprisals as well, which should also be
    highly discouraged in any organization.
3.  If HR does not address the issue, I suggest you get a lawyer at this
    point. Why? Because your next step is to *go to the Legal
    department* and advise them that you plan on suing the organization
    (I assume it's a school district) for harassment and creating a
    hostile work environment, and you're going to actually want a lawyer
    present when you talk to the Legal department. Make sure Legal knows
    you confronted the principal, and you went to HR to try to get
    relief and nothing has worked so far. Perhaps the threat of a
    lawsuit would do it. Be advised however, part of your contract when
    you hired on may have been to waive your right to sue in favor of
    binding arbitration. If this is the case, submit to the arbitration,
    but you should definitely come out fine assuming you did nothing to
    contribute to the harassment.
4.  If, at any point, you decide you don't want to deal with this
    anymore, it is up to you to extricate yourself from the situation.
    Yes, this means resigning. For your own mental health, if you reach
    a point where you simply can't deal with it anymore, take care of
    you first.
