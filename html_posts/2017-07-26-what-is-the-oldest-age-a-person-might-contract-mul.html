I had a PA at one clinic who developed and was diagnosed with MS in his
late 60s. It was relapsing-remitting, so they simply decided not to
treat it since the benefit would be minimal.

But to answer the question, there is no upper age limit at which someone
can be diagnosed with MS.

Additionally, there is no lower age limit. Pediatric MS is a thing as
well. These outer boundaries are rare, but they do exist.
