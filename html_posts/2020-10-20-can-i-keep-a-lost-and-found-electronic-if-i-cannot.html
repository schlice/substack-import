**Can I keep a lost and found electronic if I cannot locate the owner?**

As with all legal questions, the answer is "it depends." And in this
case, it mostly depends on where you find the property.

In the United States, you have to start with the definitions. "Lost
property" is defined as personal property that was unintentionally left
by its true owner. For example, a cell phone which falls out of
someone's pocket is considered lost property. For completeness, "real
property" cannot be lost. You can't "lose" your house.

Most jurisdictions in the US have laws regarding found property.
Typically, those laws require turning over the lost property to the
proper authorities. If the property is not retrieved within a set period
of time, that property is returned to the finder, and the original
owner's rights to the property are terminated.

So if you've found something that can be electronically tracked (like a
cell phone), your best bet is to return it to the nearest retail
location of that phone's carrier. If the phone is registered on their
network, they can reach out to the true owner and get the property
returned. If you've found something that is not electronically
traceable, you should reach out to your local police department
(non-emergency number, please) and ask what the procedure is in your
local area to report finding property.
