**Would Trump be devastated if it becomes blatantly obvious to him that
he is the most unpopular president ever?**

I was unaware that the Office of the President was actually cover for a
popularity contest. Hmm, I'm going to have to go away and rethink my
life now.

But before I go, the presidency is not a popularity contest. Popularity
does not make someone effective at their job.

As a commander, it was nice to be liked, but unnecessary. It's more
important that my orders be followed than I be friends with everyone.
You're never going to make everyone happy. It reminds me of this quote,
attributed to the poet John Lydgate and later adapted by President
Lincoln:

"You can please some of the people all of the time, you can please all
of the people some of the time, but you can't please all of the people
all of the time".
