**There are 9 congressional districts that border Mexico. None of the
congresspeople in these districts support the wall. Why do the
politicians in DC ignore the wishes of the people on the ground?**

Because border security is a **national** issue, not a state one. States
are barred from contributing to national defense. So the will of the
people on the ground is not relevant when it comes to border security.
