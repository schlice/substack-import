**Since the Roman Catholic Church has a long history of lying and
deception, why should we believe the Bible is accurate?**

False equivalency. You have a statement (The RC Church has a long
history of lying and deception), and a question (Why should we believe
the Bible is accurate?). Those two statements do not belong together.
Just because the RC church has a long history of lying and deception (a
statement which I neither support nor explore) doesn't place the
veracity of the Bible into question.

The Bible is a collection of works spanning thousands of years; it's not
a single volume written by a single person or group of people. It's
certainly not a book that was written or even edited by the Roman
Catholic church.

About the question, I think you're asking the wrong question. Instead of
asking why we *should* believe the Bible, I'd instead ask why do you
*not* believe the Bible? Ultimately, the truth of the Bible is founded
on the truth of Jesus. Jesus, the one who rose from the dead and saved
all of us, is the one who authorized the Bible, quoted from it,
referenced it in his ministry on earth, and believed in it. Really, the
question has nothing to do with the Bible itself; it has everything to
do with the truth of Jesus. Instead of asking whether or not you believe
the Bible, ask whether or not you believe in the resurrection of Jesus.
If you don't believe that, then the veracity of the Bible is completely
irrelevant because it would be shown to be inaccurate on the most
important message it is trying to convey. The rest is just details.

The Roman Catholic church did not write the Bible, so the church's
alleged history of truthfulness does not change the truth of the Bible.

**TL;DR: The truth of the Bible rests on the truth of Jesus.**
