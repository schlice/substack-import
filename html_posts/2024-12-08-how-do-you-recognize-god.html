**God's voice will never contradict the Bible.**

If you're hearing what you believe is God's voice, do like the Bereans
did and test it against the Bible to see if it is true (Acts 17:11).
God's voice will never violate Scripture.

Bank clerks are trained to recognize fake bills not by studying every
forgery which has ever been created, but by studying *the real thing*.
Once you know the real thing, you can tell a forgery simply by comparing
it to the real thing.

We do the same with God's voice. When we study Scripture, we know God's
Word. God's voice speaking to us through the promptings of the Holy
Spirit will always be in congruence with God's Word in the Bible. We
know His Word because it will never violate the Bible.
