**Content:** [As I understand it, there is currently no disease model
for multiple sclerosis in zebrafish. They do use zebrafish to study the
normal myelination process, as well as to test remyelination therapies.
While they use zebrafish to study remyelination, they cannot use the
same fish to study demyelination. The zebrafish has a very strong and
adaptive immune system.\
\
Zebrafish are cheaper to work with than mice, but mice can have an
MS-like disease induced in them, called [[experimental autoimmune
encephalomyelitis
(EAE)](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=518c15&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experimental_autoimmune_encephalomyelitis){.external_link

to study demyelination processes and treatments to slow this
process.]{.rendered_qtext}
