**You are mistakenly arrested as a suspect in a serious crime. Are you
wiser to say nothing (except name and address with ID as required) until
you get a lawyer or cooperate fully with the police and answer all their
questions?**

You are never "mistakenly arrested" until after a police officer says,
"We didn't mean to arrest you, you're free to go" or a judge says
"there's not enough evidence to support this arrest, you're free to go."

You are under arrest, and the police are working hard to ensure that you
go to jail for the crime, otherwise they wouldn't have wasted their time
arresting you.

You are arrested, and you are a suspect. Period.

**IF YOU HAVE BEEN ARRESTED, SAY NOTHING UNTIL YOU TALK TO A LAWYER.**

The police are not there to get you coffee and BS with you and be your
friend. Not that they are nefarious, just that they are not there to
hang out and chit-chat.

The police are there to find the person who did the crime, and you're
under arrest because they have reasonable suspicion that you're the
person who did it. You must be clear on this fact. And the police are
expert at making cases. Sometimes they make mistakes, but by and large,
they are really good at what they do, and they will find a suspect and
enough evidence to convict that suspect. To that end, you need an expert
to help you, otherwise you may find yourself on the wrong side of the
bars.

Once you get that shiny new pair of silver bracelets and a one way trip
to the Gray Bar Inn, your mouth closes. You say nothing until you have a
lawyer. Period.
