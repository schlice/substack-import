**Since the police are allowed to lie to you, can they lie about things
like You Must Open the Door, You Must Open the Trunk, or You Cannot
Videotape?**

The answer is "it depends."

Let's look at each of these:

**You must open the door:** I assume you're talking about "you must open
the door without a warrant." There is only one circumstance in which you
must allow access, and that is called *exigent circumstances.* In that
case, the police won't even bother asking you. If they ask, and they
don't have a warrant, you don't have to say yes.

**You must open the trunk:** In most cases, you don't have to allow a
search without a warrant. If the police want to search your car without
a warrant, they must have *probable cause.* If they have probable cause,
they will arrest you, impound your vehicle, and do the inventory search
at the police station, and that's legal. If they truly believe something
illegal exists in the car, they can get a warrant very quickly.

**You cannot videotape:** Yes, there are circumstances where they tell
you you can't video, or you have to move to \<some safe distance away\>.

What's most important here: for the first two, you can be arrested from
the results of those searches. For the third, you can be arrested for
refusing to stop video recording. If the police were wrong about any of
these, and they did a search without a warrant and they did not have
justification, your lawyer can get anything found during those searches
overturned, since they didn't get warrants.
