**Why do you like that Donald Trump Vetoed Congresses decision to block
his National Emergency Declaration on Border Security?**

Because he issued it, and he's standing behind it.

It's his opinion that there is a national emergency at the border, but
he wanted to get the funding through Congress. When Congress failed to
get him the funding, he pushed forward, continuing to do what he needed
to do to address the national emergency.

If Congress is really as "united" as Chuck Schumer says it is, then they
could easily get the 2/3 majority needed in both Houses to override the
veto, right?

Right?

The reason that Republicans sided with Democrats was not because of the
actual wall itself, or the national emergency, or border security. It's
because they are miffed that the President used a legal method to bypass
their denial of funds. So they'd like to send a message that the
President should not do that.

It's nothing more than sending a message. There isn't a snowball's
chance in the Hot Place that they'll be able to override the veto. They
knew that when they passed the resolution in the first place.

So they're all using the opportunity to virtue-signal: Republicans voted
against it either because they are strict constructionists like Rand
Paul and they're actually concerned about the Constitutionality of it,
or they are RINOs like Susan Collins. Democrats voted against it because
