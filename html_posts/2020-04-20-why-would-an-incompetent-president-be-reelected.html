**Why would an incompetent president be reelected?**

There are several reasons why an incompetent president would be
re-elected.

1.  He may be incompetent, but still wildly popular.
2.  Or maybe, "incompetence" is subjective. In other words, what one
    person finds "incompetent," other people find perfectly acceptable.
    Remember, political competence is not something you can objectively
    measure. It is highly subjective, and much confirmation bias exists
    in determining it. In other words, if you already thought of the
    president favorably, then you are far more likely to think of his
    actions as "competent," and vice-versa.
