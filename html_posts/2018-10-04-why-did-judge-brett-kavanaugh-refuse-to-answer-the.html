**Why did Judge Brett Kavanaugh refuse to answer the question given by
Senator Kamala Harris, who asked if he talked to anyone at a law firm
about special prosecutor Mueller\'s Trump investigation that indicates a
conflict of interest?**

Thanks for the A2A. I'm afraid I can't give you much more information
than everyone else did.

Harris asked Kavanaugh if he spoke with "anyone" at Kasowitz Benson
Torres regarding the Mueller probe, which is a law firm founded by
Trump's attorney, Marc Kasowitz. She then gave the ominous warning, "Be
sure about your answer, sir."

Understanding the tone of the question thanks to her warning, Kavanaugh
demured: "I'm not sure I know everyone who works at that law firm," he
said.

You can see the trap, can't you? Kavanaugh did. He answered that he
could not remember whether or not he spoke to anyone specifically at
that law firm regarding the Mueller probe, but he'd be happy to have his
memory refreshed.

Harris continued, "With all that you remember, you have an impeccable
memory, you've been speaking for almost eight hours, maybe more with
this committee, about all sorts of things you've been asked. How can you
not remember whether or not you had a conversation about Robert Mueller
or his investigation with anyone at that law firm?"

Kavanaugh again asked if his memory could be refreshed. He asked if
there was someone specific that Harris was asking about which would help
him remember.

She answered, "I think you're thinking of someone and you don't want to
tell us."

So you can see the trap: she was trying to bait him into admitting that
he had a conflict of interest. But clearly, she didn't have anything or
she would have said so.

Political dinner theater.

Don't forget to tip your server. Try the veal.
