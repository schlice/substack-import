God has provided ample proof of his existence, but he has done so in a
way that wouldn't impact your free will.

For example, if God came down from the clouds in a flaming chariot and
instantly made all wars cease and zapped Satan and all of his minions
away forever and removed all pain and hunger and any bad thing, wouldn't
you believe he existed? I mean, how could you *not* believe he existed?

But if that's the case, *you wouldn't be acting freely*. Any rational
person would *have* to believe he exists.

In other words, God has put us in an environment filled with evidence of
his existence, but without his *direct presence* --- which would be so
powerful that it would negate our ability to reject him. God has
provided enough evidence in this life to convince anyone *willing* to
believe, but has left just enough ambiguity so as to not compel the
*unwilling*. By doing this, God gives us the ability to freely choose
him or reject him without violating our free will.

That's the purpose of this life --- to choose to love God freely, for
love cannot be coerced; it must be freely given.
