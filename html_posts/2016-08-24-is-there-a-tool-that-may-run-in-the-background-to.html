Let's assume you're talking about Windows.

Your best bet is to build your own tool using an automation helper like
[[AutoHotkey](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=190a0b&url=http://www.autohotkey.com){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="autohotkey.com"}]{.qlink_container}. In AHK, the script
would watch a window for changes, and then take a screenshot. You could
take the visible contents of the window and save them in a variable
using `WinGetText`{.prettyprint .inline}, then do it again at a set
interval (say, every 5 seconds). If the two variables don't match, take
a screenshot by sending the `PrintScreen`{.prettyprint .inline} key.
