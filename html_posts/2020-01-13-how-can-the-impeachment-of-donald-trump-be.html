**How can the Impeachment of Donald Trump be "unconstitutional" as
stated repeatedly by Trump & his defenders when the process of
Impeachment is literally in The United States Constitution and thusly
supports the actions of the Democratic House?**

The impeachment process itself is Constitutional. The House has followed
Constitutional provisions when it conducted its portion of the
impeachment (drafting and voting on Articles of Impeachment). It may
have erred Constitutionally when it delayed transmitting the Articles to
the Senate, because the implication in the Constitution seems to be that
the Articles should be transmitted in a timely manner. This is not
stated, merely implied by the fact that there are prohibitions in the
Constitution against hindering another branch of government, and the
delay at least hints at such hindrance.

The argument that Trump makes has to do with the *basis* upon which the
Articles of Impeachment were written. In order to be impeached, there
must be a charge of "treason, bribery, or high crimes and misdemeanors."
The House's assertion that Trump abused his power was classified under
"high crimes and misdemeanors." The House asserts that it can define
that term however it likes, which is true. It is clear, even from a
casual reading of the Constitution however, that the framers intended it
to be far more serious than the charge the House makes, and should be
supported by weighty and convincing evidence which cuts across party
lines and convinces even the casual observer that a truly egregious act
has actually taken place. No such convincing evidence was produced.
There are explanations for everything which was presented. Appropriate
witnesses were never forced to appear (which should have happened
through the courts). If this was the limit of the investigation, it
should have led the House to *not* vote on Articles of Impeachment,
since weighty and convincing evidence was not produced.

Only because the phrase "high crimes and misdemeanors" can essentially
mean whatever a simple majority of the House chooses it to mean is the
reason why the actual impeachment is still, *just barely*,
Constitutional.

The fact that a *supermajority* of Senators is required to remove the
President from office **is a check on the possibility that an
impeachment might be partisan**. You *must* have bipartisan support in
order to **act** on Articles of Impeachment; otherwise, they are just
"sound and fury, signifying nothing." The fact that you were going to be
unable to convince a supermajority of the Senate of anything in this
impeachment process *should have* informed Representatives that they
should not be sending Articles of Impeachment forward. It is a pointless
exercise which will not produce a removal from office.

On a side note, do you think the House is blissfully unaware of the fact
that the President will not be removed from office? Of course they're
not. They know full well that their Articles of Impeachment will not
remove Trump from office. *So why continue this dog-and-pony show?*
Remember that everything politicians do is designed and timed
specifically to try to affect **you**, the voter. The entire reason
these Articles are moving forward is because they hope to gain some
political capital with you. They hope to position themselves as the only
thing standing between the sanctity of the government and a corrupt,
conniving President who hopes to be a dictator some day. If they can
convince you of at least some wrongdoing, you may (if you're an
Independent, at least) think twice about re-electing Trump.
