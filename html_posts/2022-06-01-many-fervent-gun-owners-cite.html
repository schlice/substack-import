Why does it matter? The fact is, it's legal to own and I want it.

The logic is the same for owning a Bugatti Veyron. I know that it can go
250 mph, but I certainly can't drive it that fast here in the city. Why
would you own such a thing? Is it so that everywhere you go, people will
admire your expensive car? Is it to feel like a rockstar? Or is it
because you appreciate the history of the Bugatti brand and you want to
be a part of it?

The point is, who cares? It's legal to own, and I want one.

Original question:

Many fervent gun owners cite \"protecting my family\" as a primary
factor for owning guns, but is the true reason just to feel like a
badass?
