Russians are no more or less sinners than we are. Humans all have
imputed sin from Adam. But sometimes, our national identity and our
politics make it really easy to see those who are different from us as
"evil."

Russians have been "the big bad enemy" since World War II. The two
nations (the USSR and the US) grew to be world powers. The race for
superior military power put us at ideological odds; the presence of
communism was an "existential threat" which needed to be contained, and
the Soviets made no bones about desiring to spread communism beyond its
borders. In contrast, the US's view is that we *liberate* countries and
allow them to "live free." We don't "install" democracy; we enable them
to have a democratic government and free elections. That is our end
goal, because to us, that is the "freest" form of government. See the
ideological difference there?

When you start to think that you are *ideologically correct* and your
enemy is *ideologically incorrect*, you can easily allow that feeling to
turn into "I am good, they are evil."

So while their form of government is *different* from ours, and we
clearly do not desire that form of government (well, at least in the
Republican party), they aren't any more sinful than we are.

No, God does not take revenge on behalf of people. God only looks at the
individual and their righteousness. Because even we who have been
wronged are also sinners.

Christianity was never meant to be a political movement. Instead, God
chooses to work in people *individually*, changing and saving them, and
those saved, changed people go on to change families and communities and
eventually nations.

Eventually, America, Russia, and indeed, every country in the world will
be eliminated, and the new Kingdom of God will be established with Jesus
as its ruler, and the people of Israel will lead as the chosen people.
Evil will be destroyed, Satan and his minions will be cast into the lake
of fire, and the new Kingdom will live for a thousand years.
