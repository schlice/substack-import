When my dad was a cop, they raided a drug dealer\'s home. This was
during the early 80s.

This drug dealer had fortified his home so no one unauthorized could
make it in. First, he had fenced in the yard and filled it with attack
dogs. He then constructed a concrete \"man-trap\" inside the front door
and replaced his entry doors with steel security doors. Within the
man-trap was a small teller window from which they could transact their
business.

To conduct the raid, first an officer in plain running clothes jogged by
the house and tossed raw chickens stuffed with sleeping pills over the
fence. Within 20 minutes, the dogs were neutralized as a threat. Then,
the main raid force moved in. They took the large department tow truck
(which can tow tractor-trailers and Sherman tanks) and drove it through
the chain-link fence and through the picture window (essentially, they
drove it through the front of the house). The security thug in the
living room literally pooed himself when the truck came in. The fenders
around the front tires of the tow were diamond-pattern stainless steel,
and they were stair-stepped. The raiding group simply climbed up the
fenders and into the house.

I tell you this story because if the police want into your house and
they have a warrant (even a \"no-knock\" warrant like this one), they
will get in. And if they have a warrant, then a judge has signed off on
the evidence presented and agreed that illegal drug activity was indeed
taking place inside that home. Remember that the evidence has to be
really solid before a judge is going to sign off on a \"no-knock\"
warrant, and there has to be real, conclusive evidence that knocking on
the door and announcing the warrant will result in lives lost and
evidence destroyed. These warrants are not issued lightly.

What I\'m trying to tell you is that the only people who need to protect
themselves against no-knock warrants are criminals.

So to clarify what I said before and to answer the specific question:
*How much would it cost to fortify your home against a no-knock
warrant?* It can't be done. If the police want to get in, they will.
There is no amount of money that will keep the police out if they choose
to get in. Unless you live in a bunker underground and it has no
entrance, the police will get in.
