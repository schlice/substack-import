First of all, none of us were there. None of us actually experienced
what the participants went through. It's easy to "Monday morning
quarterback" this thing, but while we do that, we should be careful not
to condemn anyone personally for their actions. We may have acted
similarly in a similar situation; until it happens to you, you don't
know.

All we can do is review the actions and see if anything could have been
done better. I believe that it could have been handled differently.

For starters, *Officer Yanez could have avoided giving Castile
conflicting directives in the first place*. He ordered Castile to
retrieve his license, but when Castile said he was carrying a gun
(legally), he was told not to reach for his gun.

**IF THERE WAS A QUESTION** whether following one order would have led
to violating a second order, Castile should have stopped, put both of
his hands on the steering wheel, and indicated that his gun was near his
license and he wouldn't be able to reach for one without reaching for
the other.

It's like any time you have two conflicting orders. You can't do one
without violating the second. *Castile should have stopped moving and
requested clearer directions*. Especially as the officer was continuing
to think that he was reaching for his gun, he should have stopped
reaching.

Once Castile indicated that he had a gun, if the officer was still
concerned that Castile could not reach for his license without reaching
for his gun, the officer should have taken him out of the car and
disarmed him, which in most places where concealed carry is legal, is
legal to do for the duration of the traffic stop.

The incident was a tragedy. That the officer was not held to account for
the error that he induced which led to the conditions that made the
officer fear for his own life is a miscarriage of justice.

I suspect the officer will face a wrongful death lawsuit (which he will
lose) and his conflicting orders leading to the death of a civilian will
likely cost him his badge.
