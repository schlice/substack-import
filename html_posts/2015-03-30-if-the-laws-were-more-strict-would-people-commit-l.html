**Content:** [Limiting the discussion to capital offenses as you asked,
I would say that the strictness of the law has little to do with whether
or not people will actually commit the crime. In some states, capital
offenses are punishable by death, and I\'m not sure we can get much
stricter than that. Yet, people still commit murder in those states.\
\
What tends to be the aggravating factor is the fact that people can get
away with it so easily. It\'s a known fact that most criminals do not
get caught. So if I\'m a \"smart criminal\" (an oxymoron if I ever heard
one), I\'d do the crime and NOT get caught. Yeah, I\'ll be a smart
criminal\...]{.rendered_qtext}
