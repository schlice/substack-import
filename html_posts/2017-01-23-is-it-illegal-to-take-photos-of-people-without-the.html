The answer, as with all things legal, are "it depends." Also, this
answer is specific for the United States.

The biggest things that will determine whether or not someone can be
photographed legally:

- Where the person is at the time you take the picture
- If they were in a public place, what you intend to do with the photo.

If you are in a public place, or a place with no reasonable expectation
of privacy (i.e. a sidewalk), you can pretty much take a picture of
anyone. There are some rules about when a person may not be in a public
place, so your mileage may vary, but in general, if you're just out in
public, you can photograph anyone. States vary on whether or not a
particular location is subject to the reasonable expectation of privacy
rule. If a person is in a house, but is standing in front of an open
window, most states say that this does not constitute a reasonable
expectation of privacy, while some do.

You can also pretty much do whatever you like with that photo (even post
it online), assuming you don't:

- attempt to sell the picture for profit,
- or miscategorize the person with the picture, or claim something false
  about the person (called slander or libel), which causes them
  demonstrable harm by your categorization of them.
