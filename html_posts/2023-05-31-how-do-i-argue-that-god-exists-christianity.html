God is not physical. There is no physical test in this world which can
detect God. So that's not the way we can argue that God exists.

But there are certain things in the world that we *can* detect, and
through repetition and observation, we know where those things come
from. So we can draw a logical inference based on what we already
observe in the world.

\

***The Beginning of the Universe\***
We argue that God exists because God *must* exist. There is no other way
that the universe could have come into existence.

- We know through scientific investigation that the universe had a
  beginning. The Big Bang, the second law of thermodynamics, the
  radiation echoes from the Big Bang, red shift of galactic objects,
  galaxy seeds, and a host of other scientific observations tell us that
  the universe had a beginning.
- The Law of Causality tells us that **everything which has a beginning
  has a cause.** Even the great skeptic David Hume said, "I never
  asserted so absurd a proposition as that something should arise
  without a cause." Therefore, we know that something *caused* the
  universe to come into existence.
- Einstein's theory of General Relativity (which has been proven
  accurate to at least five decimal places today) tells us that there is
  an ***absolute beginning*** ***to all time, space, and matter*** in
  the universe. This tells us a few things:
  - If there was a beginning to time, there was no time before that.
    There is no "before" before that, because time did not exist before
    that.
  - If there was a beginning to space, then space did not exist before
    that. There was no place for anything to exist, because space did
    not exist.
  - If there was a beginning to matter, then matter and energy did not
    exist before that. It wasn't in another form, because there was no
    space for it to exist, and there was no place in time for it to
    exist.

***So what caused the universe to come into existence?****\*
We know that there must be a cause. The Law of Causality says that
everything which has a beginning has a cause. Something, therefore,
caused the universe to come into existence. It didn't just "happen" by
random chance; chance isn't a cause.

We know that the universe did not create itself, because that's an
analytically false statement. You would have to exist before you existed
in order to create yourself.

Therefore, the only other remaining choice is that the universe was
created by an intelligent mind. Everything which has been created has a
Creator. Therefore, the universe has a Creator.

\

***But why God?****\*
We can look at the evidence we do have and determine that an
intelligence created life on earth. We know this because of *specified
complexity*.

Darwinists and evolutionists insist that we evolved from single-cell
organisms in some primordial goo and then over billions of years, poof!
here we are. But the supreme problem for Darwinists is not explaining
how all life forms evolved. The supreme problem for Darwinists is
explaining the origin of the *first* life. **For unguided, naturalistic
macroevolution to be true, the first life must have generated
spontaneously from nonliving chemicals.** Unfortunately for Darwinists,
the first life---indeed any form of life---is by no means "simple." This
became abundantly clear in 1953 when James Watson and Francis Crick
discovered DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid), the chemical that encodes
instructions for building and replicating all living things.

DNA has a helical structure that looks like a twisted ladder. The sides
of the ladder are formed by alternating deoxyribose and phosphate
molecules, and the rungs of the ladder consist of a specific order of
four nitrogen bases. These nitrogen bases are adenine, thymine,
cytosine, and guanine, which commonly are represented by the letters A,
T, C, and G. These letters comprise what is known as the **four-letter
genetic alphabet.** This alphabet is identical to our English alphabet
in terms of its ability to communicate a message, except that the
genetic alphabet has only four letters instead of twenty-six. Just as
the specific order of the letters in this sentence communicates a unique
message, the specific order of A, T, C, and G within a living cell
determines the unique genetic makeup of that living entity. Another name
for that message or information, whether it's in a sentence or in DNA,
is *specified complexity.* In other words, not only is it complex---it
also contains a specific message.

What we have observed is that **nature never produces messages**. We
have observed that **messages only come from intelligence**. We know
this because all of our observational evidence tells us that every time
we see a message, we know it comes from intelligence. And scientists
know this too, *they simply refuse to apply their science to the
creation of life*. How do we know they know? Because SETI exists. SETI
(the Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence) forever scans the skies,
listening for certain patterns in radio waves. Any idea what kind of
patterns they're looking for? Yep, you guessed it, *specified
complexity*. In the movie *Contact,* Jodie Foster plays a scientist who
is part of the SETI research team. In the movie, Foster gets extremely
excited when her antenna picks up radio waves that appear to have an
intelligent pattern, "One, two, three, five, seven, eleven . . . those
are primes!" she exclaims (meaning prime numbers). "That can't be
natural phenomena!" Indeed, random radio waves can be naturally
produced, but those that contain a message always have an intelligent
source. Prime numbers, from one to 101 in order, constitute a message
that only comes from an intelligent being.

So the logic in where we have come to now looks like this:

- Messages only come from intelligence
- DNA is a message.
- Therefore, DNA must have come from intelligence.

This isn't an argument from ignorance, and it isn't a "god-of-the-gaps"
fallacy. It is a logical conclusion based on observation and
repetition---the scientific method in action.

It is actually Darwinists who are committing a "god-of-the-gaps"
fallacy, and evolution is their god. Darwinists believe, *by faith,*
that our minds arose from mindless matter without intelligent
intervention. We say it is by faith because it contradicts all
scientific observation, which demonstrates not only that messages come
from intelligence, but also that an effect cannot be greater than its
cause (another facet of the Law of Causality). You can't give what you
haven't got, yet materialists/Darwinists believe that dead,
unintelligent matter has produced intelligent life. This is like
believing that the Library of Congress resulted from an explosion in a
printing shop, or that a tornado blew through an arboretum and a 747
ended up on the other side.

\

These, among many other scientific observations, are the ways that you
can cogently argue for an intelligent Creator. Now, it's worth noting
that we haven't even touched on which Creator is the right one. The only
thing we have proven is that a Creator is necessary, and must exist.
*Learning about* that Creator is the realm of religion, but we are not
even there yet. One step at a time. First, let's prove the necessity and
existence of a Creator, and then we'll take the next step and describe
that Creator.
