We don't know, and Samsung's not talking. They're investigating. We
should either hear by today or early next week what the exact issue is.

In response to the issue, Samsung has announced that it is recalling all
Note 7's. They have already pulled them off of store shelves, and they
plan on starting a full recall of the devices when replacement plans
have been made.

An anonymous Samsung employee has confirmed they think the problem is
with the battery, but they also claim that the issue affects "less than
0.1 percent" of the Note 7s sold to date. They also state that the
batteries for the Note 7 are sourced from China and Korea, and it is the
Korean batteries that are experiencing the issue. The issue only occurs
when the phone is being charged. Even though only the Korean batteries
appear to be affected, Samsung is proceeding with a full recall.

To date, 35 cases of the issue have been reported. Based on the number
sold, this issue affects approximately one in every 42,000 devices.

This is a big deal for Samsung, as over a million phones will need to be
replaced, and the recall is happening during their initial rollout
phase. The phone has already shipped to ten countries, and this is not
the best time to have a recall. The Note 7 is projected to be the most
popular Samsung phone to date, so this is a huge problem for Samsung.
They want to get this fixed and shipping again.

(EDIT) Our friends over at Engadget have answers on what the carriers
will do with your handsets:

> T-Mobile will offer a full refund on the handset and any accessories
> without restocking or shipping fees, but customers can keep the free
> Netflix subscription they received for pre-ordering. Verizon will also
> allow returns and offer refunds through the end of the month. Sprint
> is taking a slightly different approach: Customers can visit their
> local store to get \"a similar device until the issue is resolved.\"
> Last but now least, AT&T announced it will allow customers to exchange
> the Note 7 for a new handset and return any
> accessories.[\[1\]](#OHKWR){#cite-OHKWR .citation_link}
