**Will Apple comply with a warrant if the information (of the suspect)
does not match that of the device owner, i.e. the iCloud name and date
of birth is of someone else entirely?**

No company would comply with a warrant that does not match what the
warrant is asking for. Providing that information is not only illegal,
but it violates end user privacy. Before information can be provided
under the demand of a warrant, the information must match what the
warrant is asking for.
