**What would you if the passenger next to you on a flight put down your
seat tray and started using it without asking permission?**

You might try the following:

1.  Tell him he put the wrong tray down and he should use his own tray
    instead of yours. Put his tray down, put his stuff on his tray, and
    put yours back up.
2.  If he does it again, notify a flight attendant. They will either
    direct him to use his own tray and not yours, or if they can't work
    out the issue with him, they may be able to re-seat you.
