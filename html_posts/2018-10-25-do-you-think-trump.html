**Do you think Trump\'s continued, vitriolic attacks on his opponents
have helped incite the sending of suspect packages to many of them?**

I think I would be cautious in trying to assign blame for these packages
to anyone other than the person sending them.

That said, politics has definitely gotten more divisive in the past
decade, and both Republicans and Democrats have had a hand in creating
the political environment within which we all live today. No one person
or political party is "to blame" when it comes to creating the charged
political environment of today.

Trump is a "by-product" of today's environment. It is the political
landscape of today that allowed Trump to become president. He didn't
create the environment in which he is thriving; he simply is playing by
its rules.

Additionally, I'm pretty sure it's Democrats who have championed the
"#resist" movement ever since Trump was elected, and they are doing
everything in their power to **not** work together with Republicans, but
are instead resisting every Republican effort to do anything at all,
useful or otherwise. At least Republicans in the past offered concrete
solutions which were in opposition to what Democrats offered. Today's
Democrats spend more political capital #resisting than they do offering
concrete solutions that are different than what Republicans are
offering, let alone better. Is a pipe bomb "working together," "offering
a concrete solution different from what the other guy is offering," or
is it another example of "resisting?" I would posit that a pipe bomb is
closer to "resisting" than it is to "offering an opposing opinion."

Trump has not helped the political climate by simply being Trump. He's
also not done anything to change it, since he is keenly aware that the
#resistance movement is not going to change while he remains president,
so attempting to do anything to change it would be a waste of time.

So if you feel you must blame Trump for these pipe bombs, go for it. He
can handle it. But just know you're not adding any benefit to the
discussion; you're blaming a symptom of the problem, and not the
underlying problem itself. It's "iceberg theory," like blaming guns for
violence when we should be focusing on the causes of violence instead.
