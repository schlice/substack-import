**How can I find a licensed firearm instructor willing to teach a total
beginner?**

There are many places you can go, but probably the easiest for you will
be to visit your nearest gun range. They will not only probably offer
classes themselves (including ones for people just starting into
firearms from the ground up), but if you don't want to take their
classes, they will have a list of NRA-certified instructors who you can
contact directly to inquire about lessons.
