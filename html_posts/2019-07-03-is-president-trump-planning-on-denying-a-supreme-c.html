**Is President Trump planning on denying a Supreme Court verdict and put
a citizenship question on the 2020 census? Do you support him in this?**

First of all, SCOTUS remanded the case back to the lower courts, because
there were still questions of law that needed to be answered, and that
ain't their job, so to speak. Since the issue still needed to be
investigated further, they couldn't make a decision in time to get the
question added back to the 2020 Census.

Secondly, Trump ordered the US Census Bureau to print 2020 Census
questionnaires without the citizenship question. So no, he's not
planning on putting it in the census anyway.
