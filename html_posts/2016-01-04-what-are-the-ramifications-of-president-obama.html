They will have virtually no impact on anything.

The biggest provision in his executive order will be to require
small-scale gun dealers to get Federal Firearms Licenses (FFLs). This
means that they will have to conduct background checks on every firearm
they sell.

I have no problem with this. I would personally like all states to close
the \"gun show loophole\" by requiring all personal transactions to go
through a FFL. There are many FFLs who will, for a small fee, do a
background check for you. They issue a background check \"certificate\"
that states that as of \<this day\>, this person is legally authorized
to purchase a gun. It will certainly spur the creation of more FFLs who
will do nothing more than process background checks and issue
certificates.

But that wasn\'t the question, was it? The question was \"what are the
ramifications of that order\". Well, besides creating a cottage industry
of FFLs, not much else. It doesn\'t curb any gun violence. It wouldn\'t
have stopped a Sandy Hook, or a Charleston church shooter, or an Aurora
theater shooter. The guns used there were all purchased legally (even
though Charleston messed up, it was legal). Sandy Hook was basically a
\"stolen\" gun, but the owner purchased it legally. So these changes
mean zero to actual gun crime.

But it shows that the president is \"doing something\" to try to combat
the problem. Even if the something that he did has no impact on gun
violence in America, he \"did something.\" And that\'s better than \"not
doing something,\" I guess.
