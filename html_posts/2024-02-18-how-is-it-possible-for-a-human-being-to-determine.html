The answer for God's omniscience is found in the fact that **He exists
outside of time.**

Remember that God created time, so He exists outside of time. What does
that mean? Does that mean that He can freely travel through time? No,
not at all. It means that God exists *at all times simultaneously.* The
concept of time does not apply to God as He exists outside of time.

Therefore, for God, everything is **now**. The past is **now**. The
present is **now.** The future is **now**. God sees the assassination of
JFK at the exact same **now** that He sees the assassination of Abraham
Lincoln and you reading about it in this answer on your screen. It's all
now to Him, even though for you, it is the past and the present. And
everything which will happen in your future is also *now* to God, even
though you cannot see the future, even though you retain the power to
change the future.

Your free will and your ability to make choices are also functions of
the fact that you exist subject to time. In other words, you can only
choose one course of action over the other (freely, without coercion)
because you have arrived at a decision point **in your timeline.** Which
path you choose is 100% up to you, but God sees your decision point, and
the time thereafter, because for Him, they are all **now.**

For you, this moment in time is **now.** For God, *every moment in time*
is **now**.

So God is omniscient because He is not subject to time.
