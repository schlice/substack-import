**Why is it so hard to prosecute a US president?**

The power of prosecution was vested in a single, unitary president. All
prosecutorial authority in this country flows from that one person. This
is part of the *system of checks and balances* in the US. The singular
authority over the Executive Branch vested in one person is a hedge
against the power of the Congress.

To that end, **you cannot prosecute a sitting president.** That person
controls all prosecutions, and so cannot be prosecuted.

*So does that mean the President is above the law?*

Of course not. The Constitution provides a method to deal with
presidents who may break the law: ***impeachment and removal from
office***.

Once that president has left office (either through impeachment or at
the natural end of his or her term), they are once again subject to
prosecution.

And before you ask, since the president cannot be prosecuted while in
office, the statute of limitations is *tolled* (or paused) while in
office. The clock starts again the day the new president is sworn in.
