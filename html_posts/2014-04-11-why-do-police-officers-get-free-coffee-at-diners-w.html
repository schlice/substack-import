**Content:** [You do see this happen occasionally, but it is policy in
our department to not accept free items from anyone, public or business
owner.\
\
That said, while I can\'t take something for free, I also can\'t control
what you, as the business owner, charge me for it. So if you want to
give me a discount cup of coffee, I\'m okay with that, but please let me
pay.]{.rendered_qtext}
