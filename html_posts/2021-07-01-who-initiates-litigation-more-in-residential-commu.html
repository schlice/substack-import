Thanks for the A2A.

Litigation is usually initiated by homeowners. Very rarely does the HOA
initiate litigation. The only circumstance I can think of is if, instead
of referring a repeat violator to the fines process, they refer the
repeat violator to the attorney to initiate litigation to force
compliance with the Governing Documents. While it is less common,
sometimes an HOA board may choose to pursue litigation instead of fines
to force compliance, but usually it doesn't come to that. Normally, the
receipt of the first letter from the attorney spurs compliance (where
violation letters from the HOA did not), and it generally does so faster
and with less headache and expense to the HOA than the fines process.

Primarily, legal action (not related to litigation) initiated by the HOA
is related to paying dues and amounts to placing liens on homeowner
property. Similar to the instance listed above, usually the first letter
from the attorney advising that a lien will be placed on the property
spurs homeowners to begin communications and perhaps initiate a payment
plan to pay the back dues.
