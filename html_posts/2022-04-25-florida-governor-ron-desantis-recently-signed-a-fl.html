"A moment of silence" has always been permitted. A moment of silence is
not tied to a religion. Students *can* pray if they are so inclined.
Students who do not pray can merely remain in silence for a moment.
There is no imposition of religion at all in a moment of silence.

What has *not* been permitted is the school *leading children in
prayer*. Schools have tested this in the past, and they have lost in
court.

\

What is most disappointing is that the legislature of a state feels that
they only way it can compel its own Department of Education to allow
students their religion-neutral moment of silence is to write a law.
