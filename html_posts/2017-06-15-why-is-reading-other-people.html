The level of crime indicates what the majority of the public believes
should be a serious crime, and what they believe should be a less
serious crime.

I think the problem you may be running into today is that the vast
majority of things that come in your mailbox are relatively unimportant.
Most of your bills are now delivered electronically. You file your taxes
electronically. You communicate with your bank electronically. What do
you get in your physical mailbox? Junk mail, mostly. Circulars,
advertisements, credit card offers, etc.

But I bet that if you changed "mail" in your description (*I\'m pretty
sure reading other people\'s mail isn\'t that serious a crime)* to
**e-mail**, you'd change your tune slightly. I bet you'd be pretty
miffed if someone hacked your e-mail account and read your e-mail. They
could go to ***any account you own*** and reset your password, which
gets delivered to your e-mail. They could then shut off your electric
service, or transfer all the money out of your bank account, or buy
themselves a car and have it delivered somewhere, using your accounts
which they reset using your e-mail.

I bet you'd have no problem making ***that*** a felony. Phew, good thing
it is, eh?

But some people, especially the elderly, don't use technology nearly as
frequently as you do. Their bills and account statements are all still
delivered through the mail.

So because sensitive information can still be delivered using paper
mail, paper mail is still protected. Only the addressee listed on the
envelope can open it. And it's still a felony to read someone else's
mail, because it's still important to protect mail.
