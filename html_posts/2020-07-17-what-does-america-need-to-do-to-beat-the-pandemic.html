**What does America need to do to beat the pandemic?**

It's super-easy! We just do exactly the same things we did to beat the
common cold and influenza!

Wait, we didn't beat those? You mean they're still around? I mean those
viruses are hundreds, maybe thousands of years old, and they're still
around, mutating every year??? Why the heck can't the government beat
them?

Why hasn't the government locked us inside our houses because there are
simply some viruses we can't "beat?"

The short answer is that we may never "beat" the virus. Experts are
telling us that COVID-19 may become seasonal, like the cold and the flu.
And we will be able to develop a vaccine which will help us to fight off
the infection or to make us less susceptible to infection in the first
place (depending on the specific action of the vaccine). But that's
still going to take 12--18 months after a vaccine trajectory is
determined and we have successfully tested it and verified its efficacy
before it arrives at our local doctor's office. Therefore, we will
likely never "beat" the virus.

**That said, once we stop** ***living in fear*** **and** ***start living
again*, then we will have "beaten" the** ***pandemic*.**

We will get to a comfortable point where we will no longer **fear** the
virus. We are not there yet; we still live in fear of the virus. People
are distrustful. People are scared. People are hiding behind their
masks, keeping everyone at two arms' length. The media does not help,
daily barraging viewers with the "record high numbers of cases reported"
which only tells half the story. They neglect to tell you that the
number of deaths has been steadily on the decline.

**This** is what the media should be reporting. **We flattened the
curve.** Remember that? Remember that this was the whole point of the
lockdowns in the first place? We did it. And we don't seem to be
mentioning it. The fear-mongering tends to attract more eyeballs to your
news screen than the positivity that we did what we were trying to do.

*But we didn't flatten the curve! We're almost out of ICU space!*

Well, yes and no. Yes, we are approaching 95-100% utilization of ICU
space nationwide, but we always ran 80--85% capacity in ICU anyway. We
never ran a completely empty ICU. Additionally, not all of the cases in
ICU are COVID-19 patients; in fact, the percentage in the ICU who are
there directly because of COVID-19 complications is very low, around the
10--15% range, and is steadily falling.

*But what about the number of cases?*

Well, I'm glad you asked! **Brace yourself**. We're probably going to
have upwards of *60 million cases of COVID-19 this year*, just like
there was for the swine flu of 2009, for which we still have zero
immunity. It still, annually, causes hospitalizations and deaths, just
like influenza does.

And yet, I don't remember us shutting down the economy over those 60
million cases. Because we're able to treat the disease more effectively,
fewer people are dying. A trip to the ICU with COVID-19 now only nets
you a 20% chance of dying instead of an 80% chance, and that percentage
is falling by the day. Where getting put on a ventilator was pretty much
a sure sign that you weren't leaving the hospital under your own power,
now you can look forward to recovering from being on the vent.

Once we stop fearing the virus and start living again, we will have
beaten the pandemic.

**TL;DR: We will beat the pandemic, even if we don't beat the virus.**

*If you don\'t like what I wrote, tough shit. If my answer is
grammatically low-quality or is un-cited opinion masquerading as fact,
downvote it. If you think I\'m wrong, write your own answer. But Quora
is a question-and-answer site, not a debate site. If you were simply
going to comment to tell me \"ackshually, you\'re wrong,\" then you're
the reason why I disable comments. Well done, Karen. You ruined it for
everyone.*
