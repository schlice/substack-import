The United States was founded on the principle of individual
opportunity. Everyone has the opportunity to get a good job, and good
healthcare along with it.

If people cannot work, there is Medicare. The elderly are also covered
under Medicare. Children are covered under CHIP, or SCHIP at the state
level.

We'd like to pay for everyone's health care, but it's just a bit too
expensive.

Plus, we've already tried single payer health care in the United States,
and it failed.
