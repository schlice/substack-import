In general, you cannot be sued for leaving a negative review. But as
always, with legal questions, there are certain scenarios in which a
lawsuit might be the appropriate remediation.

- Libel. If you print something in your review which is **demonstrably
  false**, you are aware that it is false, and it does **quantifiable
  monetary damage** to the person you lied about, you can be sued for
  libel.
- You said "they have a form with your signature saying that you won't."
  That almost sounds like a "contract" or an "agreement" wherein you get
  something from them, and they get your guarantee that you won't leave
  a negative review. In theory, the same form would detail what each
  side would get out of this agreement, and what a "negative review"
  looks like (i.e. how many stars qualifies as "negative?" Can you say
  that anything at all was bad, like if you commented that the restroom
  was dirty, would that qualify as a negative review, etc), otherwise it
  would be up to a court to decide.\
  \
  And what did this "form" specify as the consequence for violating the
  agreement? Did it say that you can be sued? Or did it specify some
  other remediation?

As always, it depends.
