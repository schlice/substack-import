Juvenile cases are handled by the juvenile justice system. All states
handle their programs differently, but the goal of these programs in all
cases is *rehabilitation*, not *punishment*.

Yes, they will get "in trouble." But it won't be jail time. They may
have to appear in juvenile court, and they may be ordered to receive
counseling or other remedies. So long as the juvenile is behaved after
that, those records remain sealed and are expunged after the youthful
offender turns 18.

But is this completely necessary? Perhaps you can take the video footage
to the parents of the juvenile, and you can all have a screening party
together and talk about what happened, as well as what can be done to
prevent such tragedies in the future. Don't you think that would be more
productive?
