**If there is no direct evidence of Jesus being from any particular race
why is it bad to let the artist have their own interpretation of
Jesus?**

It's not "bad" to let artists use creative license. It happens all the
time.

The problem is not the *helpfulness* of the representation, but the
*truth* behind it. Any time we portray Jesus with an image, we
*constrain* our thinking and our praying to that image, and Jesus as God
is so much more than an image.

As J. I. Packer says in his book, *Knowing God:*

> *\[T\]he pathos of the crucufix obscures the glory of Christ, for it

So it's not "bad" to allow artistic license in depictions of Jesus. It's
bad for us, the people who see the images, because we end up forming an
image of Jesus which is not, and can never be, an accurate depiction of
his deity. To the extent that the image fails to represent the truth
about God, we fail to actually worship God, and so our worship ends up
falling short.
