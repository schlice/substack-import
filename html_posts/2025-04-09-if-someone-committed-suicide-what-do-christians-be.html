***NOTE: This is an answer about suicide in the realm of Christianity.
It is not meant to discuss any one situation, nor is it meant to judge

suicide.***

***If you fall into the last category, and you are considering suicide,
please seek help now. Please find the box titled "There is Help" and
reach out to someone. In the US, please call 988 or 1-800-273-8255, the

**TL;DR:** As far as Christians are concerned, what happens to them
depends on whether they have accepted Christ as their savior while they
were still alive.

To be sure, Christians view suicide as a sin. God, as our Creator, is
the only one who gets to decide when and how a person should die. Psalm
31 says, "My times are in your hands" (Psalm 31:15). God is the giver of
life. He gives, and He takes away (Job 1:21). Therefore, ending your own
life goes against God's plan for our life, and is therefore sinful.

But here's the important part: while we believe suicide is a sin, it's
just like any other sin we commit on a daily basis, with the notable
exception that we don't get the opportunity to repent of this particular
sin before we die. And if suicide is a sin like every other sin, then
**committing the sin of suicide does not determine a person's eternal
destiny.** Our eternal destiny rests solely on God's grace. Those who
trust in Jesus Christ are fully forgiven of every sin, and they receive
eternal life; those who reject Him remain condemned (John 3:16--18, 36;
Ephesians 2:1--10). And once we have been saved, we do not lose our
salvation because we have committed a sin. We face judgement for our
sins, but we are still saved if we were saved before.
