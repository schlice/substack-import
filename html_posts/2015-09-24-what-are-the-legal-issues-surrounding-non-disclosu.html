**Content:** [Okay, you stated that your spouse did not disclose that
she was previously married.\
\
*What difference would this fact make in any jurisdiction?*\
\
The only issue I can think of is if the previous marriage was not
properly dissolved in accordance with state law. If it was not, then the
current marriage may be invalid because she was still legally married
somewhere else.\
\
However, if the previous marriage was legally dissolved correctly, the
woman is free to marry again. I can\'t really think of any other legal
ramifications.\
\
If you\'re talking about a state which has fault-based divorce, are you
asking if this would be grounds for divorce? It would depend on the
state and the rules for what grounds on which a divorce can be
petitioned. But I don\'t know of any state that lists \"non-disclosure
of previous marriage\" as grounds for divorce.]{.rendered_qtext}
