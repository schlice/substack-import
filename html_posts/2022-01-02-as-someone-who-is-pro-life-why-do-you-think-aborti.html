Why do you think that the punishment for the rape should be carried out
against the innocent victim instead of against the perpetrator?

Let's pose this another way: let's say the mother had her day-old baby
with her when she was raped. Would you think about killing the baby to
punish the rapist *then*? Of course you wouldn't. So why do it before
the baby is born? What does a few weeks matter? Just because you wish to
assign less value to its life simply because of its temporal locality
still doesn't mean that it's appropriate to exact your revenge on the
baby instead of the rapist. If you want to kill someone, kill the
rapist. But that baby is as much a victim as is the mother. Why must you
victimize it twice?

Let it be born and give it up for adoption. The mother is no longer a
mother, she goes back to her life, the baby has an opportunity to live
in a family that can't naturally have children, it's a win-win.
