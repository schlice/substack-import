**Content:** [I think it\'s a valid question. What exactly does it mean
to infringe on a Constitutional right? Can you place reasonable
restrictions on firearms without infringing one\'s right to keep and
bear them?\
\
Let\'s look at another amendment to try to gain a better understanding
of \"infringment.\" Can you shout \"Fire!\" in a crowded movie theater
(assuming there is no fire)? Why not? If you possess freedom of speech,
you should be able to say whatever you want, whenever you want. But you
can\'t shout fire in a crowded movie theater. Interesting. Let\'s
continue this example. Can you gather a few hundred people in the center
of town and make a political speech? This is tailor-made for what the
Amendment protects. But what if, by your speech, the crowd goes into a
frenzy and destroys businesses and hurts people? You aren\'t rioting,
you just exercised your First Amendment right to speak. Is this legal?
Can the government legally prevent that speech without actually
infringing on your right?\
\
I asked a lot of questions, but they\'re all rhetorical. You can\'t
shout fire in a crowded theater. You can\'t whip a crowd into a frenzy
with your speech. There are reasonable limits (such as public safety and
preventing riots) that we can place on speech. The state has a vested
interest in keeping people safe; indeed, the state is well authorized
and remanded to do so. So reasonable restrictions on rights so that
people remain safe are absolutely allowed.\
\
The question then falls to balancing the safety of the general public vs
the free exercise of the right. Can you make a law that says if you
carry a rifle in public, the chamber has to be empty? The answer is yes
you can. Does this infringe on your right to keep and bear arms? Not
appreciably. Does it keep people safe? Debatable. Nevertheless, because
it accomplishes its goal without unduly infringing on your right to keep
and bear arms, this is a reasonable law. Can you impose a 10,000% tax on
ammunition? Does it keep people safe? Not really. Does it infringe on
your right to keep and bear arms? Absolutely. The ammunition is
considered part of the gun, and taxing at such a high rate is a clear
attempt at circumventing the Amendment by using the taxation authority
of the Congress. This, clearly, would be unconstitutional, and would
infringe on your right to keep and bear arms.\
\
Each law must be evaluated individually looking at each of these
criteria. The court has said that whatever laws are passed must further
a compelling state interest, and must do so in the least intrusive way
possible.]{.rendered_qtext}
