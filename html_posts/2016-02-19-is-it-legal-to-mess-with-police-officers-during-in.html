**Content:** [Yes, it is legal.\
\
But it is certainly not in your best interest. Wasting their time will
not likely be looked upon fondly. Additionally, you are probably there
for a reason. It probably wouldn\'t be beneficial to you to change the
subject, especially to something totally unrelated to the discussion.
They will probably think you are deflecting, which just makes you look
more guilty.]{.rendered_qtext}
