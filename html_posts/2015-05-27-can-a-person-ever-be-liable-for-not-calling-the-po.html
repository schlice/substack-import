**Content:** [You are talking about several different topics: the duty
to report a crime, and the duty to render assistance, and if there is
any liability for failing to do either.\
\
**Duty to Render Assistance**\
\
There are very few times when you would be required to render
assistance. There are a few states that I am aware of (Minnesota and
Vermont) that require you to render assistance, and failing to do so
(which includes something as simple as calling 911) is a misdemeanor in
Minnesota and carries a \$100 fine in Vermont. There are at least five
other states that are considering adding \"duty-to-assist\" clauses to
their Good Samaritan laws.\
\
However, in most cases, most notably in states where Good Samaritan laws
exist, there is no duty to actually render assistance except for those
people for whom it is their job to do so (i.e. EMTs, fire crews, etc).
Some states require those with First Aid / CPR training to assist, and
in these states, someone without training who acts incorrectly can be
held liable. Some states such as Colorado protect anyone stopping to
render aid, whether they have training or not, and whether or not they
use it correctly. They can only be held liable if they intentionally
misuse their training or act in a way that is intentionally negligent.\
\
**Duty to Report Crime**\
\
As with the duty to render assistance, the duty to report crime is not
universal across the states. Under English common law, misprision of
felony was a misdemeanor. Many states retained this law, but most have
removed it today. Misprision of felony is still a crime under US federal
law, but it requires active concealment of a felony, rather than just
failing to report it.\
\
Five states have laws which require passersby to report certain crimes.
Three require reporting crimes in progress (Hawaii, Massachusetts, and
Ohio), while two (Florida and Washington) require reporting some sex
crimes. These laws are seldom used and the penalties for violating them
are minor, but they support the idea that, particularly in those states,
indifference to a person's need for help is against public policy. \[1\]

\[1\] Haw. Rev. Stat. § 663-1.6 (failure to report crime in progress is
misdemeanor); Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 268, § 40 (fine for failure to report
violent crime in progress); Ohio Rev. Code Ann. § 2921.22 (failure to
report felony that has been or is being committed); Fla. Stat. Ann. §
794.027 (failure to report sexual battery is misdemeanor); Wash. Rev.
Code Ann. § 9.69.100 (failure to report violent crime or sexual crime or
assault against child is misdemeanor).\
