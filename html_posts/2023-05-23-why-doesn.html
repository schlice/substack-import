First, Quora has never concerned itself with "dealing with facts." In
fact, there are many spaces on this site which deal with things which
are objectively not facts.

Second, the implication in the question is that Christianity is
unsupported by facts.

I beg to differ.

The problems with the evolutionist's position are many. The universe is
not eternal, and so cannot be the First Cause. Before evolution can even
happen, you must start with an existing life. So which came first: the
first life, or evolution? DNA requires proteins for its formation, but
proteins are created using DNA; which came first? Even though the
evolutionist claims that random natural processes caused life to form
from existing chemicals, we cannot combine chemicals and create life.

Add to that the evidence that a creator god exists, including the fact
that natural processes have never been shown to create specified
complexity. Specified complexity is empirically detectable. When we
detect specified complexity (messages, like the message resident in DNA
for example), we know that it must come from an intelligent being
because all of our observational experience tells us that messages come
only from intelligent beings. Every time we observe a message, it comes
from an intelligent being. We couple this data with the fact that we
never observe natural laws creating messages, and we know an intelligent
being must be the cause. That's a valid scientific conclusion based on
observation and repetition. It's not an argument from ignorance, nor is
it based on any "gap" in our knowledge.

It's fact.

That some choose to ignore the facts to pursue their own dogma does not
change the facts.
