No, this section does not pertain to penalties for crimes.

A **bill of attainder** is a legal mechanism which existed in
pre-Constitution times, which stated that certain people or certain
groups of people were guilty of a crime and were punished in some way,
without ever having a proper trial. Because this violates due process,
it was specifically added to the Constitution. [[Several
laws](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=0d0d26&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_of_attainder%23Cases_before_the_U.S._Supreme_Court){.external_link

the US were struck down as bills of attainder.

An **ex post facto** law is one which makes you liable for conduct which
was previously legal. So for example, I purchased a 15-round magazine in
the state of Colorado before the law was passed that the maximum number
of rounds a magazine can hold is 10 rounds. If the 10 round law says
that the purchase of my 15 round magazine when it was still legal is
actually illegal, that is an ex post facto law. To be clear, they can
come back later on and say that *continued possession* of the banned
item is illegal, but the *purchase* of the item, when it was legal,
cannot be subsequently made illegal and apply to purchases before the
law was passed.

Neither of these provisions has anything to do with changing penalties
for crimes.
