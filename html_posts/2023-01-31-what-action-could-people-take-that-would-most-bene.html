**Be Kind.**

Like my friends at the [[Til Valhalla
Project](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=29ae31&url=https://tilvalhallaproject.com/){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="tilvalhallaproject.com"}]{.qlink_container} are trying to
remind us with this particular tee, everyone you meet is fighting a
battle you know nothing about.

*(Not sponsored, but hey TVP, I'm open to collabs...)*

"With each kind act, we make the world a little bit better." This is a
positive action **you** can take, **today**, that literally costs you
nothing, but noticeably and measurably improves society for everyone.

Swallow your pride, stifle that urge to lash out at that idiot who
doesn't know how to park, or that insensitive jerk who won't move to one
side in the aisle, or whatever little insignificant thing someone did
that triggered you in that moment. You have no idea what they are going
through, and **everyone is going through something**.

Take a deep breath, and **be kind**.
