**Content:** [Tecfidera is \"up there\" in the list of MS medicines that
carry some moderate to severe risk, as Tecfidera is one of the MS
medicines (along with Tysabri and, quite possibly, Gilenya, although
that is still being determined) which can cause PML ([[progressive
multifocal
leukoencephalopathy](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=9f0d6d&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_multifocal_leukoencephalopathy){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}). PML is a fast-moving
viral infection caused by the [[JC
virus](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=6a2af9&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JC_virus){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"

qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container} and exacerbated by
certain medications and treatment regimems for certain diseases such as
AIDS and MS. PML is usually fatal, but survival rates are improving.

qt-tooltip="nih.gov"}]{.qlink_container} says that the mortality rate is
around 30-50% in the first few months of identification of the disease.\

Tecfidera can also cause allergic reactions and GI symptoms.\
\
Talk to your neurologist about all your treatment options and your
entire treatment regimen. If you do decide to start Tecfidera, make sure
you get (at least) annual JC virus tests (unless you\'re positive for
JC, then you only need to have it done once). Whether or not you have
been exposed to the JC virus should factor in to your decision as to
which medicine to take.]{.rendered_qtext}
