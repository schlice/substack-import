If Christians have a God who they can blame and yell at when their life
goes horribly wrong, then they are either uninformed, or they are
actually atheists.

These weak, uninformed people seek to blame God for something that is
either patently not God's fault, or something which is within God's
power to alter, but He has chosen to not alter. They, like the atheists,
believe that *if God has the power to change something, they*
***expect*** *Him to change it.*

We could go down the path of explaining why expectations are bad, but
any first-year psychology student could do that, and this was asked in
the C&C space. Therefore, we'll keep this focused on the religious, not
the psychological.

This question is based on flawed logic. Let me see if I can draw out the
logical argument:

1.  I hold the opinion that something is wrong in my life.
2.  I know that God has the power to fix it.
3.  For whatever reason, God does not fix it.
4.  Therefore, God is wrong (uninformed Christian) or God doesn't exist
    (atheist).

So first, let's look at the deduction. Is 4 correct? If something is
*truly* ***wrong*** in your life, and if God has the power to fix it,
and He does not, does it naturally follow that God is wrong? Or are the
atheists correct that following this logic, God doesn't exist? No, it
does not follow. God may not intervene for any number of reasons. He may
not intervene because *you* may see it as a problem, but *He* does not.
Perhaps this trouble you are going through is meant for your growth.
Perhaps it contributes to God's larger plan. Or, perhaps, God *will* fix
it, but you're not ready. Or, perhaps, God *will* fix it, but *He's* not
ready (the time to fix it has not yet come). So as far as the deduction
to get to that end state goes, it clearly does not follow.

So we know that the logic, on its face, is wrong. But are the statements
themselves incorrect? This is important, because even if the logic was
correct, and the premises logically flowed to the conclusion, they could
still lead to a faulty outcome if the premises themselves were untrue.
And in this case, they are. Let's just start with #1. Is it true that
something is wrong in your life? You certainly may think so, but that's
not necessarily the truth. As we already discussed, God may have other
plans that you can't see. God doesn't answer every prayer with a yes. In
fact, there are four possible responses to a prayer that God can give:
**no, slow, grow,** and **go**. He could say **no**, you do not need
what you think you need, because it doesn't advance His good plans for
you. He could say **slow**, meaning that it is not yet His time to do
what you're asking. He could say **grow**, meaning that the time may be
right, but *you are not ready*. Perhaps you need to grow more as a
Christian. Or He could say **go**, meaning that He does what you're
asking.

So not only is the logic incorrect, but the premises themselves are
flawed.

**Therefore, the idea posited by the questioner, that Christians have a
God who they can blame and yell at when their life goes horribly wrong,
is both logically wrong, and based on flawed premises.**
