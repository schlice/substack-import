Your question is too broad.

- Do you want schools to educate parents how to safely store firearms?
- Are you asking about "guns in schools" and how the school will keep
  the guns away from the children?
- Are you asking about how parents and teachers can teach children to
  stay away from firearms?

Each one of those questions has a completely different answer, but since
your question was far too broad and not nearly detailed enough, I'm not
sure what you are asking.

Please try asking again, and this time, please be more specific with
what you want to know.
