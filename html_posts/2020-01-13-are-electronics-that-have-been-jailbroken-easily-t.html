**Are electronics that have been jailbroken easily traced?**

Not necessarily, but they can be.

The security that has been established by the manufacturer prevents
malicious software from running and gaining higher-level access to the
hardware, such that it will not open up security holes which may make it
more easily traced, or more easily hacked. If a third-party software is
lax with security, the protections in the un-jailbroken software will
prevent the third-party software from inadvertently opening up security
holes.

When we jailbreak a device, we remove the protections that are inbuilt
by the manufacturer, which allows us to install software which can
bypass those protections. While this is not inherently dangerous, it can
be, because it places the onus of security on the individual developer
rather than centralizing that protection in the operating system. If
they do it correctly, security will not be compromised. However, if that
software is lax with security, or is reckless with its security, it can
easily open up a security hole which hackers can use to break in to the
hardware.

So in general, a jailbroken device, by itself, is no more or less secure
than one which is not. However, the software you install *after* a
device is jailbroken can potentially open up security holes which can be
used by malicious actors to hack the hardware.
