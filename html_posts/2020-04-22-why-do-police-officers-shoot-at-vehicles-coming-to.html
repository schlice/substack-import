**Why do police officers shoot at vehicles coming towards them?**

(US answer only)

So in other words, why do police officers shoot at a person charging at
them with a deadly weapon?

Because it's a direct threat to their life. Someone is charging at them
with a deadly weapon.

If someone is charging at you with a deadly weapon fully intent on
killing you, you are well within your rights (police officer or not) to
respond with any and all force needed, up to and including deadly force,
to stop that attack. There are always state level differences here, but
if you are carrying a gun, you should know the differences in your
state.

Also, for accuracy's sake, the officers don't shoot at the "vehicle."
They specifically shoot at the driver, not the vehicle, even though by
shooting at the driver you are shooting at the vehicle, but now we're
just splitting hairs.
