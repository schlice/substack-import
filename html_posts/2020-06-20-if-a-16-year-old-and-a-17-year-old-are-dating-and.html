**If a 16 year old and a 17 year old are dating, and the 17-year-old
turns 18, while the 16 years old turns 17, would it be illegal to have
sex?**

As with all legal questions, the answer is "it depends."

Some states have what are called "close in age" exemptions (also known
as "Romeo and Juliet" clauses) for their statutory rape laws which state
that in order for statutory rape to apply, the two participants must be
more than a set number of years apart in age. That number varies by
state.

But not all states have this "close in age" clause. In the US, just over
half the states have a "close in age" exemption on their books. Check
the laws regarding statutory rape in your jurisdiction.

Best advice: wait a year and avoid the problem altogether.
