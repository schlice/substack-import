**Is it a sin to not like someone?**

Don't confuse the biblical *love* for liking someone, or being friends
with them. Mark 12:28--31 says:

> One of the teachers of the law came and heard them debating. Noticing
> that Jesus had given them a good answer, he asked him, "Of all the
> commandments, which is the most important?"
>
> "The most important one," answered Jesus, "is this: 'Hear, O Israel:
> The Lord our God, the Lord is one. Love the Lord your God with all
> your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all
> your strength.' The second is this: '**Love** your neighbor as
> yourself.' There is no commandment greater than these."

The Hebrew word for love used in the bold is *agapÄ“seis,* the root of
which is
[[*agape*](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=388322&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agape){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}*,* which is "love of
mankind." It is "the highest form of love" that the Hebrew language
could express. It's the kind of love God has for his people. So Jesus is
commanding us to love our neighbor with the same kind of love that God
has for his people, and also the same kind of love we have for
ourselves.

But *agape* doesn't mean you have to like them. It doesn't even mean you
have to be friends with them. Indeed, if you love them and you have an
issue with them, you should be trying to working it out. If you love
them and they are sinful, you are to show them through your love that
there is a better way to live.

**Is it also biblical to love the sinner but hate their ways?**

Absolutely. In fact, if you love the sinner (you should), you should
"hate" their sinful ways. This doesn't mean you can't be friends with a
sinner. Hello, we're *all* sinners. But that doesn't mean we must accept
their "sinful ways." We love the sinner, we don't love the sin. If I
wasn't friends with sinners, I'd have zero friends. We're all sinners.
This doesn't mean we condone their sin, though. We don't have to accept
it. We have to *love them through it.*

Original question:

Biblically speaking, is it a sin to not like someone? I am not talking
about hate or bitterness, but just having an issue with them. Is it also
biblical to love the sinner but hate their ways? Where in the Bible is
this true?
