**Content:** [Your statements are correct when you are not in a car.\
\
When you are in a car, you are *de facto* detained until the officer
allows you to leave. Try thinking that you are not being detained when
you are pulled over. Because under your theory, you could potentially be
pulled over and **not** be detained. That means you would be free to go
at any time. Try that sometime, next time you get pulled over. Believe
that you are not detained, and just leave. See what happens.\
\
OF COURSE YOU ARE BEING DETAINED! That\'s why you had to stop your car!
If you have to stop and you can\'t leave until you are told to leave,
**you are being detained.** Asking the officer if you are being detained
when you have been pulled over is simply stupid. So if you want to
demonstrate your ignorance of the law and traffic procedure, go ahead
and ask all of your silly questions like \"am I being detained\" and
\"am I free to go\" when you get pulled over. Gee, I dunno, I thought
the blinking red and blue lights gave it away.\
\
And I can *guarantee* you that this sort of attitude will not buy you
any lenience. Even if the officer had the option to give you a warning
instead of a ticket, he\'d opt for the ticket every time. I know I
would.\
\
Remember, you attract more flies with a teaspoon of honey than with a
gallon of vinegar. Try just a little kindness and courtesy next time.
You might find that it goes a **long** way.]{.rendered_qtext}
