**Is it true that an \"analysis of data from 1988 to 1997 showed that
states with \'high\' gun ownership had three times the rate of homicide
than states with few guns?\"**

It may be true, in exactly the same way that the number of people who
drowned in a pool in a given year shows a correlation to the number of
films in which Nicolas Cage appeared in during that year.

So clearly, we must stop Nicolas Cage from appearing in movies so that
people will stop drowning in pools. Right?

Clearly, that's not right. But why not?

**Because correlation does not equal causation.** This is sometimes
called the "[[false
cause](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=22885e&url=https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/false-cause){.external_link

fallacy.

Just because states with high gun ownership *may* have higher rates of
homicide **does not** mean that rates of gun ownership **causes** higher
rates of homicide.
