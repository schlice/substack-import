**Can neurologists approximate the onset of multiple sclerosis in a
patient from the patient's MRI?**

In general, the answer is no.

Most lesions on an MRI are **silent lesions**, that is, they produce no
symptoms at all. The only thing you can tell from the MRI is whether or
not those lesions are active (they will light up when contrast agent and
a specific MRI scan mode is used). Generally, inactive lesions are
"older."

But specific age of lesions cannot be determined from a single MRI.
