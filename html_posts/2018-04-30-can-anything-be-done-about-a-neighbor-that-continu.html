**Can anything be done about a neighbor that continually keeps calling
the cops on me? My dog sits in my yard while I do exercises on my porch,
cops get called. Nothing happens, they say it\'s okay if the owner is
outside.**

The calling of police is between the police and the caller. You are not
affected, and if you are not in violation of any laws or city
ordinances, it's literally none of your business. It's annoying, but
it's not your concern.

Eventually, the police will get wise to this person and will no longer
respond to "loose dog" complaints from that address.

If the police do not get wise within a timely manner, you might consider
filing a complaint at the police station, and complain that the police
are not addressing the behavior. Abusing the 911 system is a crime in
most locations, and they have to see that his pattern of behavior is
abusive.

You could also consider a harassment lawsuit if you were so inclined.
You might even check with a lawyer about doing so. But bear in mind that
if you and your neighbor were friends (which I doubt if he's calling the
police about your behavior), be prepared for that relationship to be
unrecoverable.
