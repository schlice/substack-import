Yes, the HOA can indeed repair the damage to the common area and invoice
the homeowner for the repairs. The homeowner can claim that he or she is
not responsible for the damage and can sue the HOA, so if the HOA is
going to pass the costs of the repairs on to the homeowner, they had
better be certain that the homeowner's negligence is what caused the
damage to the common area.

For example, if a homeowner's negligence in the clubhouse caused damage,
and the HOA has video surveillance footage of the homeowner in question,
they can absolutely repair the damage and then invoice the homeowner to
pay. They can add the amount of the damages to the homeowner's dues
account, add late fees if the homeowner does not pay, put a lien on the
homeowner's property if they still refuse to pay, and eventually
foreclose on the lien to be reimbursed for the damage.

However, for one reason or another, the HOA may choose to not seek
redress from the homeowner in question. If the HOA does not seek
repayment from the homeowner, they will have to do one of several things
to pay for the damage:

- Take out a small business loan
- Levy a special assessment to all the homeowners
- Use any available funds to pay for the repairs
