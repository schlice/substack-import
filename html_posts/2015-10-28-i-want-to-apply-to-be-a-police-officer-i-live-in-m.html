**Content:** [If it\'s legal within the jurisdiction in which you are
applying and if it was legal for you to use it, it\'s not likely that
the organization would not hire you because of it.\
\
However, they can refuse if that\'s the decision they wish to make.\
\
It\'s entirely up to them. Even if it is legal, it is still illegal
under Federal law. Therefore, the organization, if it does any work
outside of that jurisdiction, can legally disqualify you under Federal
law.\
\
Ultimately, it\'s up to the department.]{.rendered_qtext}
