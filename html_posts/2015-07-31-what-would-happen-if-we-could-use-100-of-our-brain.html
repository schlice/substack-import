**Content:** [In actuality, you should ask what you couldn\'t do if you
used all of your brain at once.\
\
Basically, the 10% thing came about in the early days of brain
understanding, when a metal rod or some other object pierced the brain
and the victim was nearly unharmed. Doctors surmised because of this
that parts of the brain sat unused.\
\
In actuality, you do use your whole brain as [[Dan
B](https://www.quora.com/profile/Dan-B-1472)]{.qlink_container}
mentioned. But when you are injured, your brain has the ability to
\"re-route\" around damaged areas and rebuild neural pathways. Some
damage can\'t be repaired or routed around, but much can. There are a
certain number of \"reserve\" stem cells available for rebuilding brain
cells, but by adolescence, your full complement of adult brain cells has
been formed, along with a reserve of cells not in use. This reserve can
be used to rebuild damaged areas and re-route around damage if needed.\
\
Using 100% of your neural capacity (active and reserve) would mean that
you have no more reserve available for when brain cells die off or are
damaged. This would mean that you would lose brain capacity daily for
the rest of your life from the moment that you used 100% of your neural
load.]{.rendered_qtext}
