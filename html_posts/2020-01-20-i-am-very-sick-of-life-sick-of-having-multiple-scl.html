**I am very sick of life. Sick of having multiple sclerosis and sick of
my life and the mess this disease and I have made it. What is the best
way to leave?**

I added Suicide as a topic, since you intimated that you're interested
in "leaving life."

About MS messing up your life, the **best** thing you can do is to
***beat it at its own game***.

MS tries to mess up your life. Beat it by showing it that it doesn't.

Oftentimes, when people feel this way, it's because they are isolated
and feel like no one else has it quite as bad as they do. I would
encourage you especially to find a support group near you. There are
many support groups offered by various MS organizations, but here's one
way to find them in the US:

[[Find
Support](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=abc4a6&url=https://www.nationalmssociety.org/Resources-Support/Find-Support){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="nationalmssociety.org"}]{.qlink_container}

If that doesn't work, search for support groups near where you live.

Once you get in with a support group, find ways to cope with the
symptoms you have. The neat thing about MS (and also the frustrating
thing) is that there is no one symptom which is unique to MS. Every
symptom you experience with MS is also experienced with other diseases.
So while there may not be an MS group near you, there may be a support
group for a different disease which experiences the same symptom. There
are coping skills you can learn to help you deal with the symptoms and
make them more bearable.

Lastly, don't give up hope. We are in an amazing time right now in the
history of this disease, and we've come so far in our treatment and our
research into this disease. Based on current research, I expect that
within my lifetime, we'll see something akin to a functional cure (i.e.
you still have the disease, but functionally, it has no impact on your
life).
