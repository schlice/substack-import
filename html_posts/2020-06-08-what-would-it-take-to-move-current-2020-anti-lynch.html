**What would it take to move current (2020) anti-lynching legislation
through the US Senate?**

Congress would need to do its job.

To set the stage, **laws which do nothing more than political pandering
or virtue signaling make bad law.**

This bill is no different.

And it seems the only person doing his job in Congress is the
oft-controversial Rand Paul.

Senator Paul knows that you can either virtue-signal or you can write
good law, but doing both is a difficult proposition. He claims that the
bill is poorly written and leaves the door open to frivolous charges. He
is demanding changes to the bill that he says are needed to ensure
lynching charges can't be brought for minor injuries. He said he seeks
the changes "not because I take lynching lightly but because I take it
seriously. And this legislation does not."

He also knows that being the lone voice of dissent on an *anti-lynching
bill* is horribly bad optics, especially in the time of George Floyd. In
response to a question about said optics, he replied, "You think I'm
getting any good publicity out of this? No. I will be excoriated by
simple-minded people on the Internet who think somehow I don't like
Emmett Till or appreciate the history of Emmett Till. I'll be lectured
by everybody."

The problem? ***He's right***.

The issue is with what the bill defines as "lynching." The authors of
the bill seek to redefine "lynching" in civil law as group violence
meant to intimidate people of color or other protected groups. The
offense would be classified as "a conspiracy by two or more people to
cause bodily harm in connection with a hate crime," with penalties up to
life in prison if convicted.

Senator Paul presented a scenario in which someone could be shoved to
the floor in a bar and suffer minor injuries and be accused of lynching.
He said that could lead to unfair incarcerations. He claims that the
current bill has no protections against such charges, and he wants to
make good law. He's right. As it stands, if two or more people cause
someone *any* bodily injury, it could be considered a lynching.

Senator Kamala Harris stood to showboat...err...counter his argument,
and in effect, *made his argument for him.* She said, "It should not
require a maiming or torture for us to recognize a lynching when we see
it and recognize it by federal law and call it what it is, which is that
it is a crime that should be punishable with accountability and
consequence."

She went on to point out that the recent killing of Ahmaud Arbery was
akin to "a modern lynching."

In other words, *we can redefine lynching and we can be sloppy with this
because* ***we'll recognize lynching when we see it****. And we're
correcting centuries of injustice, so let's push this through now while
we have the momentum on our side.* Indeed, the amount of support from
the remainder of Congress indicates that they do have momentum.

But the strongest leaders are the ones who stick to their principles,
even when everyone else won't.

So to answer the question, what would it take to fix the bill? Add some
valid definitions of lynching. Or at the very least, raise the standard
to "serious bodily injury," so that only crimes involving conspiracy to
cause "substantial risk of death and extreme physical pain" could be
charged as lynching. At least if you're going to pass a symbolic bill,
pass one that actually works and doesn't make things demonstrably worse.
