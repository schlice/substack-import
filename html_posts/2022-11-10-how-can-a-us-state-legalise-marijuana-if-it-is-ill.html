You're absolutely right, a state cannot "make legal" something which is
illegal at the federal level.

But what a state *can* do is to eliminate any of the penalties for that
federal crime in their state. This is what Colorado did. They eliminated
the penalties for possession of marijuana for personal use. There are
still penalties for distribution without a license and other drug
crimes, but possession of marijuana in amounts considered to be for
personal use is penalty-free.

The upshot of what happens is that, unless the feds actually want to go
into Colorado and actually start cracking heads (which they have done
for heavy-duty cartel traffickers, someday ask me how I know), the state
isn't going to prosecute the crime. And the state simply never bothers
to prosecute the federal crime because penalties are proscribed in the
state constitution.
