**Would it be illegal for me to put a device in someone\'s car to track
the car\'s movements?**

As with all legal answers, the answer is "it depends."

If it's *your car* and someone else is driving it, you absolutely can
add a device to track the car. If you have *joint* ownership of the car,
usually one owner can install a device in a car without the knowledge of
the other owner, assuming both owners drive the car regularly. You may
not be able to do this if the car is jointly owned but it is clear that
only one person drives that car (and you're not it).

It is generally illegal to apply a device to a car you do not own in
order to track it. This, of course, [[varies by
state](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=6ff19e&url=https://privateinvestigator360.com/gps-tracking-laws-50-states/){.external_link

In Texas, it is called "unlawful installation of a tracking device." It
is a Class A misdemeanor carrying penalties of up to one year in jail
and fines of up to \$4000. In most states, however, this is covered by
the state's *stalking* or *violation of privacy* laws.
