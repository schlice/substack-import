**What are some good arguments against "Should private clubs have the
right to remain all male or all female if they do choose so?" (in the
USA)?**

There aren't any "good" arguments against forcing all private clubs to
be gender-neutral. The Constitution provides for freedom of association.
The courts have continually found that in private clubs, they are indeed
allowed to pick their members. The more exclusive a club is, the more
right they have to restrict their membership to a specific gender. The
more public a club is, the less right they have to discriminate in any
way. For example, the Boys Clubs of America lost a Supreme Court ruling
and was forced to admit girls, and now they're the Boys & Girls Clubs.
The court found that they basically admitted everyone, except girls, and
that was discriminatory.

That said, states are allowed to fight gender discrimination in whatever
way they choose. Minnesota limits the tax exemptions it gives to
male-only golf courses. It is not preventing the clubs from forming,
it's just not giving as many tax exemptions to clubs which discriminate.

points to one reason why not all groups should be forced to allow all
comers:

> In the United States, expressive associations are groups that engage
