**Content:** [EMCÂ² field offices will normally allow employees to dress
casually. We still don\'t necessarily allow shorts or hats, although
some offices have different local policy.\
\
At Regional offices, and definitely at the Corporate campus in
Hopkinton, the dress is \"business casual.\" This means polo shirt or
dress shirt and slacks/dockers.]{.rendered_qtext}
