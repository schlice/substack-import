**If you\'ve been stopped by police and they request you open your
trunk, do you have to?**

Not without a warrant.

If they do not have a warrant, they can either get one, or place you
under arrest, at which point they can tow your car to the station and
inventory its contents. But of course, both of those need *probable
cause* (either to get a warrant to search or to arrest you).

Without those, any request to open your trunk should be answered with,
"Do you have a warrant?"
