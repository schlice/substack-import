Depends on what you mean by "unlocking."

If you're talking about a "carrier lock" so you can use it on another
network, there are no cons at all.

If you're talking about "rooting" your device, there are the standard
warnings about rooting your device. You make your device more unstable,
you risk opening up security holes, and you also won't be able to
upgrade your firmware automatically (only non-rooted phones get OTA
upgrades).

What you get in return is big though. You unlock the full capabilities
of the hardware. You can do things in the hardware you never could do
before. You have full control over the CPU and how it works. You have
full control over all of your applications; when they run, when they
die, etc. You can tweak your radio settings to get better signal
strength. You can add utilities like f.lux and other hacks and tweaks to
your phone to make your phone look and work the way you want it. You can
remove system packages and carrier bloatware. You can schedule reboots,
and tools like Tasker and Titanium Backup become infinitely more usable.

Note that some of this can be done with apps, but that's a lot of
disparate software packages to maintain for little individual functions.
