Sure! You can sue anyone for anything in the United States. But you'd
have to find a lawyer willing to do it, and you'd probably have to have
some reasonable chance of winning before that lawyer would take on such
a case.

If the HOA does something which clearly violates the Governing
Documents, you can refuse to comply, and when you are fined, you can
retain your own attorney to sue them.

But if you simply don't like what they're doing, even though it's
perfectly legal under your Governing Documents, you're going to have a
tough row to hoe if you want to challenge them (if you can even find a
lawyer to take your case).

You're better off running for the Board and working with them to change
their rules.
