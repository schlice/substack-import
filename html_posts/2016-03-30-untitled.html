*but that logic would justify the actions of Al Qaeda or Isis, carried
to it\'s logical conclusion*

Absolutely! If I were Al Qaeda or ISIS, I would absolutely use these
principles of war. Indeed, this is exactly what they do today, *sans*
nukes. \"Terror\" groups try to break the fighting spirit of a people.
That is their entire purpose. Make them pliable, make them unresistant
to change\...and then take over. Remember that their ultimate goal,
their \"end-game\" is the establishment of a worldwide Islamic caliphate
under Sharia.

*which is why the Geneva convention (these days at least) is usually
interpreted as outlawing such \'strategic\' actions.*

The Geneva Convention talks about what are \"appropriate\" things to do
during wartime. Shooting people is appropriate during wartime. We use
FMJ rounds so that the round will go cleanly through the warrior, with
the least chance that he will be killed. Hollow-points which are
designed to expand and release all of their energy in one person,
preventing over-penetration, are not considered appropriate, because
they have more chance of causing death than a full-metal-jacketed round,
which deforms far less when traveling through a person. The goal when
shooting someone, under the GC, is to \"take them out of the fight\"
while giving them the best chance for survival when treated by field
medics.

However, strategic warfare is indeed part of the GC. Hitting large
targets like factories which produce weapons and bullets, supply depots,
roads, bridges, communication systems, power grids, water/sewage
systems, etc. are all strategic targets designed to slow down the
military machine, cut off supply lines, and demoralize the people in
general. Will non-combatants be killed during those operations? Yes,
most likely. They are considered \"collateral damage\" and, while
tragic, are part of the cost of warfare. If at all possible, we try to
minimize non-combatant casualties. Remember the \"luckiest man in Iraq\"
video that Gen. Schwartzkopf showed of the bomb striking the bridge
immediately following the civilian vehicle crossing it? That person was,
in fact, lucky. The bomb strike was not timed to miss him. If he would
have died, it\'s likely we wouldn\'t have showed that video to the
press. But because he miraculously survived, we showed it. If he would
have died, the strike would have had the same strategic effect, but
there would have been one non-combatant casualty.

Another question: is carpet-bombing a city a valid technique under the
GC? Yes it is. If there are military operations which take place from
that city, carpet-bombing can disrupt those operations. We don\'t do it
any more because **we don\'t have to,** ***not because the GC says we
can\'t***. We can fly a cruise missile halfway around the world and
through the window of the operations center within a city, dramatically
reducing the amount of collateral damage done over a technique like
carpet bombing or dropping strategic nukes. The GC should be updated. In
the meantime, there\'s nothing that says that our tactical and strategic
warfare decisions can\'t be updated over time, within the confines of
the GC.

So why did we drop strategic nukes on cities in Japan? Several reasons
come to mind.

1.  We were (rightly) outraged over what we saw as a cowardly
    sneak-attack in Pearl Harbor.
2.  We needed a decisive turning point that would simultaneously break
    the fighting spirit of the people and convince the military leaders
    that continuing on a war path would be political, as well as
    physical, suicide.
3.  We needed to show the world the destructive power of this new weapon
    we had developed. The targeting committee had considered other
    targets, such as remote military bases. But at that time, we were
    already carpet-bombing and firebombing cities, killing thousands. We
    needed this bomb to kill. Hiroshima was a \"compact\" target. One
    bomb, from one plane, would wipe out an entire city. That was the
    effect that we wanted to impress on them, and it\'s exactly what we
    did.
4.  Also, Hiroshima was a valid military target city; there were
    factories and other military targets there. It was \"compact\"
    meaning if we dropped a bomb right in the center it would take out
    the whole city.

This is why the threat of the use of a nuclear option has been enough to
deter other nations from attempting such tactics.

But think about this. The Japanese were prepared to defend Tokyo to the
last man, woman, and child. The invasions of Iwo Jima and Okinawa had
been incredibly costly in terms of lives lost. An invasion of the
Japanese mainland by ground forces was expected to end millions of
lives, on both sides. Therefore, even many Japanese people today agree
that dropping the bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki saved as many, if not
more, lives than it took.

While the continued threat of nuclear annihilation may deter most
third-world nations from considering developing or using nukes against
the West, Al Qaeda and ISIS may be different. Once Iran finishes its
development of a nuclear weapon and gives it to one of these groups, we
will see just how far our kindness towards the \"peaceful
religion\"/political system of Islam extends, and how many Islamic
nations and sympathizers become \"collateral damage.\"
