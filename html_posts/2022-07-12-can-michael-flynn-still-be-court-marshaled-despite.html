Short answer: yes, but not for the crime for which he received a pardon.

Since Flynn is a military retiree and presumably receives retirement
pay, he is still subject to the UCMJ. In general, however, the court
martial authority is reserved for those who have retired and refuse to
return to active duty if they are recalled.

While the case law surrounding whether or not it is Constitutional to
apply UCMJ to retirees is still rolling, even today, currently it is
possible that a retiree can be court martialed.

But when it comes to presidential pardons, they also apply to cases
under UCMJ. Therefore, Flynn cannot be court-martialed for the crime for
which he has already received a presidential pardon.
