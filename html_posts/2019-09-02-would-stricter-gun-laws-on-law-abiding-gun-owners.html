**Would stricter gun laws on law abiding gun owners empower shooters of
mass shootings?**

Let's answer your question with a question.

***Why aren't there any mass shootings at police stations? Why aren't
there any mass shootings at gun ranges?***

The answer is because *while mass shooters are crazy and have lost some
form of their grip on reality, they still realize that* ***they can kill
more people in places where they know they will meet the smallest amount
of armed resistance.***

This is why mass shootings occur in free-fire zones (er, sorry,
"gun-free zones"), which essentially equates to "any place specifically
designated to disallow the lawful carry of firearms."

So you tell me.

If fewer law abiding citizens are carrying guns, would that make mass
shooters *less likely* or *more likely* to carry out their plans? If
mass shooters know they are less likely to meet armed resistance, will
they be *less likely* or *more likely* to move ahead towards their
objective?

If you say it makes no difference, then answer the question why there
aren't more mass shootings in police stations and in gun ranges.

Now look at it from the criminal's point of view. Thanks [[Chuck
