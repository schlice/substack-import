**If a police officer says, "I\'m not arresting you, just detaining you
with handcuffs," could a case be made that this is in essence an
arrest?**

No.

Detention (custody) and arrest are two separate, legal terms.

You are under arrest when a police officer has a reasonable belief that
you have committed a crime. The officer must be able to articulate that
belief as well as present the relevant facts which lead him to that
belief.

You can be detained by the police for lawful reasons, which include but
are not limited to, your safety, the officer's safety, de-escalation of
an emotionally charged incident, etc.

You can be detained by the police without being placed under arrest, and
usually the officer will tell you that you are not under arrest but
simply being detained for your safety as well as his.
