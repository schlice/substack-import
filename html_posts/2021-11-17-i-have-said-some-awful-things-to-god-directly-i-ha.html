When you prayed for forgiveness, did you just beg God to forgive you, or
did you commit to turn away from sin and put your life in God's hands?
Did you ask God to make you a new person in Christ?

Those are two different postures to approach God with. One says, "I did
bad things, I'm sorry" and the other says "I did bad things, I'm sorry,
and furthermore, I pledge to turn away from the bad things and to listen
to Christ as my savior."

Your anxiety is likely justified, since you probably live like I used
to. I spent many, many years simply praying for forgiveness. Asking God
to have mercy on me. But it didn't change *me*. I was still the same,
sinful person I was before, spinning my wheels, asking God to forgive me
while I didn't make any substantive changes to my life. Also, God
doesn't give us *mercy*, he gives us *grace*, and that's all we need.

In order to be saved, it's simple. You just have to ***repent*** and
***believe***. But what does "repent" mean? Yes, it means to say you're
sorry, but "repent" actually means "turn away." You have to **turn
away** from your sin. Commit to not sinning like that again. And commit
to living your life the way God wants you to live. You must truly,
honestly, confess your sins to God and ***repent*** of sin, and commit
your life to Christ.

You will start to see, and feel, a change.

Original question:

I have said some awful things to God directly. I have already prayed for
forgiveness, but I'm anxious that I was not being genuine and that he
will punish me. What should I do?
