Does Barack Obama bear any responsibility for his comments?

Statements like these have led to harassment of Republicans at
restaurants and at home. Senator Rand Paul was assaulted and suffered
four broken ribs because someone who disagreed with him "got in his
face."

Do they bear any responsibility for those attacks?

The answer is **no**, they do not. The only people who bear any
responsibility for the attacks are the **attackers**. No one else.

We hold our 1st Amendment rights dear in this country. You can speak
out. You can tell people to get angry. It's part of politics as usual in
America.

But should you?

Like I tell my kids, *just because you* ***can*** *doesn't mean you*
***should****.*
