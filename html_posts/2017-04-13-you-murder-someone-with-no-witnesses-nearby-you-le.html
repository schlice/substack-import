How do you get caught? **time**.

There is no statute of limitations on murder. So eventually, someone may
put the pieces together and figure it out. It may take 50 years, and you
may be old and gray when they do, but with no other physical evidence,
the only other thing you have against you is time. Eventually, someone
will figure it out.

Or they won't.

And you'll spend every day until you die looking over your shoulder,
waiting for someone to figure it out, and come for you.
