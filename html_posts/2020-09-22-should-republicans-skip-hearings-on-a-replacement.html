**Should Republicans skip hearings on a replacement for RBG and go
straight to a floor vote in the Senate?**

I think the prospective Justice should have the ability to give a speech
on the floor of the Senate, and then the Senate should move directly to
debate on the floor and a vote.

Questions are pointless. We never learn anything productive about the
new Justice that we don't already know from all of the provided
questionnaires and closed-door meetings that the Justice has with
Senators who request it. The question and answer period is nothing more
than an opportunity for Senators to speak and produce sound bites and
talking points. We can hear Senators speak any time. Let them make their
arguments in the debate over the vote. Don't waste time with hearings.
