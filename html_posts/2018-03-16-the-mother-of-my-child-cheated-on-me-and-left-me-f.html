**The mother of my child cheated on me and left me for that guy. She now
wants to try to make it work for our child but she still loves and
misses the other guy. They work together and always see each other. Can
this work out for us?**

So lemme get this straight. The girl cheats on you with "that guy." She
loves him. She misses him. They work together. They always see each
other.

But she still "wants to try to make it work with you?" You know, "for
the sake of your child."

Let me be brutally honest.

**It's not going to work. Ever.**

What might work will be co-parenting, but you two will never work as a
couple because despite her words, that's not what she wants. Because if
that's what she wanted, she would prove it through her actions, not her
words.

Be there for your child. Make sure you shoot for sole custody, but at
the very least, get joint custody. Be a good father for your kid.

But stay clear of that woman. She's nothing but trouble.
