False premise.

COVID-19 variants will not become *infinitely more infectious*. They
will, as all viruses do, become more *virulent* (which means they are
easier to pass on), but less *deadly* (which means...er...less deadly).

But there is always a physical limit. They still only survive outside
the body for a limited amount of time, so they still are only effective
as airborne viruses within close proximity to other people.

And there is a lot to be said for *viral load*, which determines whether
you received a large enough dose of the virus to actually induce an
infection.

So unless people are coming up yo your house and coughing on cracks in
your home, there's little chance that you aren't safe inside your home.

Original question:

With covid-19 variants becoming infinitely more infectious and
contagious will covid-19 eventually be able to seep in and out of
people\'s homes through open windows and cracks in people\'s homes? How
would this affect the efficacy of lockdowns?
