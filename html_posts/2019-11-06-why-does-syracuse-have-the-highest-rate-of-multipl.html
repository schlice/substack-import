**Why does Syracuse have the highest rate of multiple sclerosis
nationwide?**

The short answer is that we can't be sure that it does.

The study which shows Syracuse has the highest rate of MS in the nation
*actually* shows that Syracuse has the highest rate of people making
multiple sclerosis related claims against insurance.

We know that because we can see how many people seek medical care funded
by insurance.

But we don't know why this is. Perhaps Syracuse has the type of people
living there who overwhelmingly have commercial health insurance.
Perhaps medical care in Syracuse is just that much better, and so many
people are visiting doctors there.

But this may or may not directly translate to the number of people in
Syracuse who have MS.
