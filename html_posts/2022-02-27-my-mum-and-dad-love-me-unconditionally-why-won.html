I think you may be misinterpreting what "unconditional love" looks like.

Do you mean the fact that if you don't follow God's rules, you don't get
to go to heaven when you die?

You do know that the same thing holds true for your parents, right? If
you don't follow their rules, you won't be allowed to live in their
house for very long (assuming you are a legal adult where you live).

The same is true for God. He loves you unconditionally. It doesn't
matter how many times you sin. It doesn't matter how many times you
screw up. He will always be there, waiting for you.

But you have to *follow his rules*, just as you have to follow your
parents' rules. If you steal all the silverware from your parents so you
can sell it to buy drugs, they're not going to allow you to live in
their house for very long. Yes, they still love you and they will never
stop, but that doesn't mean they don't have ***boundaries*** which you
must respect.

God has boundaries, too. If you don't do what he tells you, or if you do
what he tells you not to do, he won't allow you to live in his presence,
either.

So in that respect, I don't see a difference between God and your
parents.

The only real difference is the particular rules each one has.

My mum and dad love me unconditionally. Why won't God do the same and
love me no matter what?
