**A legal question. You go to an office party and drink only soda.
Someone has drugged your drink. Driving home you black out and kill an
entire family. Are you guilty of a crime?**

(US Answer)

In most states, vehicular homicide is defined as a crime which "involves
the death of a person other than the driver as a result of either
criminally negligent or murderous operation of a motor
vehicle."[\[1\]](#tEzNa){#cite-tEzNa .citation_link} The "other person"
can be someone outside the vehicle (like a whole family in another car)
or someone in your own car (like a passenger).

This is a subclass of "criminally negligent homicide" wherein a person,
through **criminal negligence**, causes or allows another person to die.
Criminal negligence exists when the accused fails to foresee an
otherwise avoidable danger, and thus allows it to come to fruition. It's
not really a "malfeasance" wherein the accused knows the risk and
willingly exposes someone else to that risk; it's more of a
"nonfeasance" in that the risk is simply not seen by the accused. To
determine this level of negligence, the "reasonable person" standard is
used: would a reasonable person with the same general knowledge and
abilities react in the same way?

In this day and age, an "overabundance of caution" would state that you
never accept a poured drink at a party; you always open your own can or
bottle, or pour your own drink. But if you're at an all-adult party at
which you know the host, and you don't expect any foul play (such as at
a Christmas party at a co-worker's house as opposed to a young adult
frat house party), a soft drink poured from a bottle would be generally
regarded as safe. There is far less expectation of a tampered-with drink
at a co-worker's Christmas party than at a frat house party, to continue
my own example.

It would come down to whether or not a reasonable person would expect a
drink to be spiked at the particular party in question.

If it was a party at which a reasonable person might expect that a drink
could be tampered with, such as at a frat house party, it is possible
(although only slightly so) that a jury could find that there was a
foreseeable risk in accepting a poured drink, and that the accused
should have known that this could happen.

I would think, however, this would be the exception rather than the
rule. It appears in this case that the accused was attempting to be
responsible (only drinking soft drinks and not alcohol), and therefore
did not expect that his or her drink was being tampered with.

Therefore, I think that in this case, it's unlikely that the accused
would be charged with a crime.
