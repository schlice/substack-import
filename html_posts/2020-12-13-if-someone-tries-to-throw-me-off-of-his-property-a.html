**If someone tries to throw me off of his property and I refuse to leave
and the police don\'t show up, can the homeowner legally use physical
force removing me from his property?**

*(US answer only)*

As always, laws vary by state, but in most states, yes a homeowner can
use force to remove someone from his property. Deadly force can only be
used if the homeowner believes it to be necessary to stop a *forcible
felony*.

In Florida, a "forcible felony" means treason; murder; manslaughter;
sexual battery; carjacking; home-invasion robbery; robbery; burglary;
arson; kidnapping; aggravated assault; aggravated battery; aggravated
stalking; aircraft piracy; unlawful throwing, placing, or discharging of
a destructive device or bomb; and any other felony which involves the
use or threat of physical force or violence against any individual (Fl
Stat 776.08).
