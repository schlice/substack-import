So there's really two questions here:

- Can God stop anyone from getting a driver's license?
- Does God routinely do so?

The answer to virtually¹ every "Can God" question is **yes, God can.**
God is *omnipotent*, which means unlimited power. He is also
*omnipresent*, which means that He exists outside of time. All time is
"now" for God: the past is now, the present is now, the future is now.
He sees it all as "now". So can God stop anyone (be it a person with
disabilities or otherwise) from getting a driver's license? Yes, He can.

As to the second question, the answer is **no**, God does not do this.
If a person with learning disabilities or special needs does not get a
driver's license, it's not God's doing, it's theirs. God never promised
to take driving tests for anyone, and He never promised to keep anyone
from driving a car.

Take care of the things you can control. Let God handle the things that
are outside of your control.

¹ God cannot deny His nature, so God cannot do things which deny His
nature. For example, God cannot be evil, so God cannot do evil things.

He also cannot do things which are impossible to do in the context in
which they are being done. The example given is "can God create a rock
so heavy that He cannot lift it?" God is omnipotent, which means
unlimited power. This does not mean "God can do anything," but instead
it means "God can do anything *which can be done*." God's omnipotence is
more like the power to effect change, the power to make an action.
Therefore, a rock which God cannot lift would have to be a rock which is
infinitely heavy, as God can apply an infinite lifting force. However,
within the constraints of this physical universe, a rock which is
infinitely heavy must have infinite mass, and would therefore be
infinitely large, and in practice, you cannot have an infinite thing in
this universe. Therefore, since this universe cannot contain a rock with
infinite mass, God cannot create a rock so heavy that He cannot lift it.
