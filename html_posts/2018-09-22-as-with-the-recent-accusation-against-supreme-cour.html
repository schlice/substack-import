**As with the recent accusation against Supreme Court nominee Brett
Kavanaugh, should people \"believe\" an accusation of sexual assault
simply because the accuser is a woman?**

No.

If we are to live in a society governed by laws, then both the accuser
and the accused have rights.

The only time we simply believe an accusation without investigation and
without proof is in a [[kangaroo
court](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=40d983&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kangaroo_court){.external_link

People should not simply "believe" an accusation simply because the
accuser is a woman. The logic most people use is, "Why would she lie?
What does she have to gain? Her entire life is being destroyed by this
accusation. She's getting death threats. Literally, why would she lie?"

There are three points I'd like to make.

1.  Memories can be flawed. In the Kavanaugh-Ford case, Ford's memory
    differs from what she even told her therapist just six years ago,
    and what she told her therapist was a full **thirty** years after
    the incident. It is well known that memories become less perfect the
    more time removed from the incident. If her memories differ from
    what she told her therapist just six years ago, it's also just as
    likely that her memory of the actual incident **thirty six** years
    ago is also, potentially flawed. Therefore, she's not "lying" *per
    se*; she literally believes everything she remembers. But what she
    remembers may be wrong.
2.  While the majority of women who make accusations are telling the
    truth, the history of some high profile cases show that some women
    do actually lie about being abused, even if they have "nothing to
    gain" from the lie. The Duke lacrosse team actually was innocent
    in 2006. Crystal Mangum actually made up the entire ordeal. In 2014
    Columbia University student Emma Sulkowitz claimed that a fellow
    student raped her. She carried a mattress on her back to shame her
    alleged attacker, even though the university and police investigated
    the incident and found no wrongdoing. While she may have believed
    that she was raped (and she made sure everyone else knew it), the
    evidence showed differently.
3.  Sexual assault is a big deal, and everyone involved deserves to be
    heard and respected. Everyone, regardless of gender, deserves equal
    protection under the law. The accused has the right to face his
    accuser, and the accused in this country has the right to be
    presumed *innocent until proven guilty*, not the other way around.
    We do not presume guilt simply because the accuser is a woman and
    because she alleges a sexual assault.

These nomination hearings are already a political circus and a
monumental waste of time. Any of these questions could have been asked
and answered in writing, and if you want to make a case of "lying"
rock-solid, get it in writing. Then, if you catch the nominee in a lie,
he's automatically disqualified, and if you so desire, you can start
impeachment proceedings to remove him from his current position (if
applicable). Ever since Robert Bork, these hearings have been nothing
but political theater, a platform for Senatorial grandstanding and
auditions for president.
