No. The word "atheist" means "no god." Atheists affirmatively believe
that God does not exist. Some confused atheists say that it's not a
belief that God does not exist, it's a lack of belief that God exists.

Besides this being nothing more than semantics, *lacking* a belief is
called **agnosticism**. Having an affirmative belief that God does not
exist is **atheism**. There is a difference.

> **Have there been any cases of believers becoming atheists?**

Happens all the time. In fact, I bet the largest majority of atheists
were once believers, but they were turned off of religion because of
interactions with others in their church, or interactions or behaviors
of other believers.

While the logic of this is questionable¹, it does happen, and I posit it
happens quite frequently.

¹ Would you stop going to the gym because of the poor behavior of other
people working out? You might, but you'd probably complain to management
first. How many of these ex-believers do you think complained to
management before they left? I'm certain some did.
