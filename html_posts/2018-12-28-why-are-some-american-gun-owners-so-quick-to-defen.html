**Why are some American gun owners so quick to defend the right to own
bump stocks?**

To summarize what *everyone* here has said, we're not defending the
right to own bump stocks. We're decrying a Federal agency re-writing the
law, which is not their job.

The law very clearly says that an automatic weapon is one in which a
weapon fires more than one bullet with each trigger pull.

The ATF ruling *changed the law* and classified a bump stock as a
machine gun. A bump stock does not meet the legal definition of machine
gun.

This is a problem for several reasons:

- If someone is charged under the bump stock law and challenges the ATF
  ruling in court, it will certainly be struck down as illegal. It will
  then be illegal to ban bump stocks as machine guns because they are
  not machine guns. And that will make it *much* more difficult to
  control bump stocks. So this could actually backfire and make the bump
  stock problem worse.
- Allowing the ATF to unilaterally make something into something else in
  order to ban it enables a worrisome trend: allowing a Federal
  Executive-branch agency the power to *write laws*, which is
  unconstitutional.

The ATF does not have the authority to change laws. That's Congress'
job. The fact that Congress can't get shit done is not our problem. And
the solution is certainly not to allow the ATF to change the law as they
see fit.

I'm not fan of bump stocks. They're toys. Novelty items. In the 22 years
that they've existed, they've been used in only one crime, and it was
only somewhat effective because he had thousands of rounds and was
essentially "like shooting fish in a barrel."

But just because you don't like something shouldn't be the permission
you need to *violate the Constitution.* Do it right, and change the law.
Get Congress to actually do something productive for once. Have Congress
make bump stocks illegal. Let states make bump stocks illegal. Whatever.
But the ATF changing the classification of bump stocks into machine guns
is unlawful.
