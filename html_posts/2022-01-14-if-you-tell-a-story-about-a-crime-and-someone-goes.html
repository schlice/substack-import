As with most legal questions, the answer is "it depends."

If, by "you telling a story," you're hanging out in a bar telling a
story about a crime to a buddy, and a cop overhears you and decides to
investigate on their own, you have zero responsibility for what that cop
does or does not do.

If, by "you telling a story," you're sitting in an interview room in the
police station, giving a sworn deposition, and then the authorities go
after the perpetrator, then yes, your testimony is responsible for that
investigation.

And "responsible" how? Other than being the catalyst for an
investigation, you have no other "responsibility" here. You're not
"responsible" for the perpetrator committing the crime. You may be the
"responsible" party who informs law enforcement, but you bear no other
responsibility.

Original question:

If you tell a story about a crime and someone goes after the
perpetrator, are you responsible?
