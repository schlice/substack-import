<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [If you\'re looking for \"legal\" security, I\'d use MMS.<br>MMS is a form of SMS, and there are already some very tight laws around<br>who is allowed to view an SMS/MMS message, both on the transit servers<br>and at the destination. Any other software is going to be prone to<br>\"man-in-the-middle\" interception.\<br>\<br>If you are looking for \"physical\" security, I would only use [[Curtis<br>Priest](https://www.quora.com/profile/Curtis-Priest)]{.qlink_container}\'s<br>suggestion and go with BlackBerry. BlackBerry will keep the message<br>secure on the device, encrypt it in transit, and only decrypt it on the<br>destination device. BBM is a formidable messaging platform, if limited<br>in scope by the BlackBerry user base.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
