**Content:** [If you\'re looking for \"legal\" security, I\'d use MMS.
MMS is a form of SMS, and there are already some very tight laws around
who is allowed to view an SMS/MMS message, both on the transit servers
and at the destination. Any other software is going to be prone to
\"man-in-the-middle\" interception.\
\
If you are looking for \"physical\" security, I would only use [[Curtis
Priest](https://www.quora.com/profile/Curtis-Priest)]{.qlink_container}\'s
suggestion and go with BlackBerry. BlackBerry will keep the message
secure on the device, encrypt it in transit, and only decrypt it on the
destination device. BBM is a formidable messaging platform, if limited
in scope by the BlackBerry user base.]{.rendered_qtext}
