The "evidence against our faith?" You mean the evidence that God does
not exist? Because I have yet to see that evidence. No one has yet been
able to give me conclusive evidence that God does not exist.

But I do have positive, empirically detectable evidence of design in the
human cell, and the human brain. I do have positive, empirically
detectable evidence to prove that the universe had a beginning and
therefore is not eternal and could not have created us.

In other words, the evidence we do have lines up pretty well with the
theistic worldview as opposed to the atheistic worldview. We know that
the universe had a beginning and thus a cause. You can't get something
out of nothing, so something must have caused the universe to come into
existence. Does it make more sense to say that *no one* created
something out of nothing, or that *someone* created something out of
nothing? Which one of those positions is more reasonable? The theistic
worldview is more reasonable. Which position requires more faith to
believe? Does it require more faith to believe that *no one* created
something out of nothing, or that *someone* created something out of
nothing? The atheistic worldview requires more faith.

Therefore, when it comes to the question of evidence against my faith,
it takes more faith to be an atheist.
