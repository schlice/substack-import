This is a great question, and it's one that I've answered before. If
you're thinking about pursuing a military career, it's probably an
answer you'll want to read more than once.

I did the whole "college roadshow" thing when I was in high school. I
toured all the schools that I might be interested in. I saw Notre Dame
(my brother ended up going there), I saw Purdue, Georgetown, etc. Plus,
I saw all the service academies. The Coast Guard Academy told me that I
was already accepted and I hadn't even applied yet. All I needed was my
Congressional nomination and I was in. I toured West Point (old) and
Annapolis (better but still old) as well.

Then I toured the Air Force Academy. I was hooked. I already had a love
of flying. I had taken a glider ride over Long Island one time and I
caught the flying bug right then and there. Coast Guard would have been
pretty cool. New London, CT was about a two hour drive from my home and
I already knew I'd be in the top 10% of the class, but I also knew that
if I wanted to fly for the Coast Guard, I'd still have to command a
cutter for five years before I'd be eligible for flight school. Army and
Navy aviation is even more difficult to get into, with larger pools of
applicants. If I went Air Force, I was basically guaranteed a pilot
slot. Remember, this was in the late 80s/early 90s. At that time, if you
had your PQ (you were physically "pilot qualified") and you graduated,
and you hadn't washed out of Preliminary Flight Training at the Academy,
you were going to be a pilot. It was virtually guaranteed, although they
never "actually" guaranteed that we'd all get to fly.

And it's a good thing they didn't.

During my freshman and sophomore years at the Academy, the nation went
through Operation Desert Shield and Operation Desert Storm. At the
conclusion of these operations (as is commonplace with any major
military operation), they scale back after the war. They reduced the
number of active aircraft in the Air Force inventory following Desert
Storm, and that left a massive overage of pilots with nothing to do.
People in the class before me would go through UPT (Undergraduate Pilot
Training) and then be crammed into career fields so they'd have
something to do until an airframe came available for them to fly. They
just had too many pilots. So they had to "close the spigot."

A week before classes started in my junior year (1992), the
Superintendent called my entire class into the theater (Arnold Hall) and
addressed us as a class. He basically said that they were reducing the
number of pilot slots that they were going to offer to my class. We had
over 1,000 PQ cadets, and they were going to give us 225 pilot slots.
Normally, when you begin classes on your first day as a junior, that's
when your military service commitment begins. You can do your entire
freshman and sophomore years, walk away and owe nothing, but once you
start classes as a junior, your Active Duty Service Commitment begins.
Because of this development, they gave us an extra week to decide if we
really wanted to stay.

We were devastated. But they then said that we should really take that
week to think about why we were really at USAFA. Was it just to be a
pilot? Or was the job secondary to the fact that we were training to
become the best Air Force officers that we could be, regardless of the
career field we served in? To our credit, less than 10 people left the
Academy during that week. The vast majority of my class recognized that
we weren't really there to become pilots. We were there to become
officers first, and \<insert_job_here\> second. In the end, about 1200
cadets graduated on June 1, 1994, and only 225 went to fly. The majority
of us went into career fields all across the Air Force. This ended up
creating problems for us down the road, but that's a story for another
answer.

We learned another lesson through all of that. Life happens. And rarely
does life happen in exactly the way you imagined it. We also knew coming
into the Academy that if we kept open minds and rolled with the punches,
we'd all do well.

So I joined because I wanted to fly. I stayed because serving my country
was more important than the career field in which I actually did so. And
they are all important, even if you are not flying.
