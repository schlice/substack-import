Yes, there are some. I happen to live in one.

Colorado allows some verified volunteer first responders to have red and
blue lights to respond to emergency locations. I know a few members of
our county Search and Rescue (SAR) team who have lights and sirens in
their POVs so that they can get down to the staging area to buzz out to
a mountain rescue.

This is addressed in state law (of course). Colorado Revised Statute
42-1-102(6) (emphasis mine):

> *"Authorized emergency vehicle" means such vehicles of the fire
> department, police vehicles, ambulances, and other special purpose
> vehicles as are publicly owned and operated by or for a governmental
> agency to protect and preserve life and property in accordance with
> state laws regulating emergency vehicles; said term also means the
> following if equipped and operated as emergency vehicles in the manner
> prescribed by state law: (a)* ***Privately owned vehicles as are
> designated by the state motor vehicle licensing agency necessary to
> the preservation of life and property****; or (b) Privately owned tow
> trucks approved by the public utilities commission to respond to
> vehicle emergencies.*

As always, there is [[a
form](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=e60d73&url=https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/sites/default/files/DR2490.pdf){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="colorado.gov"}]{.qlink_container} you have to fill out, and
authorization stickers are provided for the vehicle. Also, the relevant
sections of law are on page 2.
