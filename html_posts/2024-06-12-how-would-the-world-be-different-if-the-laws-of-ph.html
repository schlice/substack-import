I hate to break it to you, but the laws of physics *do* make it
impossible for God to exist.

Good thing God exists *outside* of the laws of physics, right? He
created the laws of physics and so He is not constrained by them. God
exists outside of time, space, matter, and energy, as He created all of
those things so He is not limited by them as we are.
