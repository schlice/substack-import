If you are not active duty military and you move to the state, you are
now considered a state resident. According to the law, you are a
resident if:

- You own or operate a business within Colorado.
- You\'ve resided in Colorado for 90 days.
- You work in Colorado.

You have 90 days to register your vehicles with the Colorado DMV. You
have 30 days to get a Colorado driver's license. The license is easy;
you show your residency documentation, pay a \~\$25 fee, give them your
Iowa license, and off you go with a shiny new Colorado license.
Registration is also easy, just more expensive.

You do have to get your license and registration transferred, because if
you don't, you will be assessed late fees when you do.
