**Why I\'m I going to hell if I don\'t worship Jesus Christ?**

The answer is a little more nuanced than "if you don't worship Jesus,
you're going to hell." It requires some definitions, particularly a
definition of the word "worship" as well as the word "hell."

Christians generally define a point on the spectrum of belief in order
to say that a person has achieved salvation. The most often quoted
biblical reference is John 3:16, but there are many others:

> *For God so loved the world that He gave his one and only Son, so that
> whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.*

This, among others, establishes that "point" which Christians believe is
the point between salvation and "not salvation:" belief that Jesus
Christ is the son of God and that he died on the cross to forgive our
sins. The Bible is very clear on this point. A little later on in John
(14:2--6), Jesus says the following:

> *"My Father's house has many rooms; if that were not so, would I have
> told you that I am going there to prepare a place for you? And if I go
> and prepare a place for you, I will come back and take you to be with
> me that you also may be where I am. You know the way to the place
> where I am going."*
>
> *Thomas said to him, "Lord, we don't know where you are going, so how
> can we know the way?"*
>
> *Jesus answered, "****I am the way and the truth and the life. No one
> comes to the Father except through me****."*

It's clear that Jesus says that the way to salvation is through Him;
more specifically, belief in Him.

Therefore, "worship" means "believing that Jesus Christ is your personal
Savior who died on the cross to atone for your sins."

Christianity is the only major religion which believes that it is grace
alone which saves you; good works are incidental to the grace received.
You cannot save yourself. There is nothing you can "do" which will
*earn* you a place in God's eternal kingdom. As Christians, we know that
we are sinners and "fall short of the glory of God" (Romans 3:23). It is
*only* through the grace of God that you are saved, and that salvation
comes specifically from believing that Jesus Christ died on the cross to
pay for your sin. When you believe that the blood of Christ has washed
you clean, when you believe that Christ died to make all things right
between you and God, it is then that you have your salvation.

The definition of "hell," in most contexts, is not a fiery pit of
damnation which smells of fire and brimstone, but an eternal separation
from the love of God; an eternal rejection of the gift that Jesus so
freely offered you. He wants nothing in return for this gift. He has
given you the gift of salvation; all you need to do is *accept* that
gift.

In actuality, it's slightly more involved than that, but basically,
that's it.

*For the time being, I have re-enabled comments on selected answers.
Some people like to comment. Some people like to engage with me in a
civil manner, and I did kinda miss that\...a little. But do not
misunderstand, I take this step very cautiously, and I have no tolerance
for harassing or inane behavior. If you don\'t like what I wrote, tough
shit. If my answer is grammatically low-quality or is un-cited opinion
masquerading as fact, downvote it. If you think I\'m wrong, write your
own answer. But Quora is a question-and-answer site, not a debate site.
If you are simply commenting to tell me \"ackshually, you\'re wrong,\"
don\'t be surprised if I quietly delete your comment. Put anything
vaguely harassing in there, and your deletion will be followed by a
block/mute, and a BNBR report. I will do this immediately and with no
compunction. You have been warned. Be nice.*
