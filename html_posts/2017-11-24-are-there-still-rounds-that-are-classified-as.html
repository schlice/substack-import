"Non-lethal" implies that the round never causes death. Even beanbag
rounds can kill if you shoot them at close enough range at vital enough
areas.

The terminology "non-lethal" is being replaced by "less than lethal" in
most circumstances, since it more accurately describes the function of
the round.
