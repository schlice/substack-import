**Content:** [I\'m going to take the opposite stance and say that it\'s

It goes on to say that people who experience assault-based trauma are
likely to develop PTSD than those who experience non-assault-based
trauma (the difference between being assaulted vs witnessing an
assault). The individual in question must have witnessed or have been a
victim of an extreme stressor, such as the ones listed in the
definition. The individual would have felt intense fear or horror, or a
feeling of powerlessness to control such an event.\

While I absolutely agree that the court cases cited by
[[Natalie](https://www.quora.com/profile/Natalie-Smolenski)]{.qlink_container}
would be traumatic, they would not rise to the level of PTSD.
