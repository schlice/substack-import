One verse before the one you quoted stated why God said that He
regretted creating man:

> The Lord saw how great the wickedness of the human race had become on
> the earth, and that every inclination of the thoughts of the human
> heart was only evil all the time. The Lord regretted that he had made
> human beings on the earth, and his heart was deeply troubled. ---
> Genesis 6:5--6 NIV

God had judged humans, and they were found to be evil.
