Interesting you should mention that.

I suspect at least some of the victims of the shooting did have
concealed carry permits. So why weren't they carrying? Orange County's
concealed carry ordinance states that nightclubs, as well as several
other named venues such as schools, are ***gun-free zones***. Persons
with concealed carry permits are **forbidden, by law**, from carrying
their firearms into the nightclub.

Note that this provision in the law didn't seem to stop Mr. Mateen.

Isn't it sad that you realize how differently this scenario may have
played out had only one other person in the nightclub been armed...

More directly to your question, sheriffs across the country have been
appealing to their citizenry through the media to do just what you said.
They have been encouraging citizens to exercise their legal right to
carry a firearm.

It's interesting that this story was posted January 18. Prophetic, even.
