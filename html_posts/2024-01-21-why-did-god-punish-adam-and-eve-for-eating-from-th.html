> **Why did God punish Adam and Eve for eating from the tree of
> knowledge of good and evil?**

Because He told them not to, and they disobeyed Him.

It's really simple. He told them not to do something, and they did it
anyway. The tree didn't have any magical properties. The change in Adam
and Eve came from their disobedience. They became sinners when they
disobeyed God. Their eyes were opened because they were now sinners.
They "knew" evil because they *experienced* the evil of sin.

> **Isn't knowledge of good and evil the right way to live?**

Objectively, no. The *right* way to live would be to live in full
obedience to God. What has our sinful nature gotten us? Sorrow, hate,
disease, and death. God tried to spare us from that life, but that's the
life we chose. And because of that sin nature, we continue to choose
that life every day of our lives.

Still, in our sin, God sent His only Son to become human and take the
punishment for our sins that we deserve so that we can be reunited with
Him.
