So since you asked a question about religion, it only makes sense that
your answer come from a religious point of view. It literally makes no
sense for atheists to answer religious questions. It's illogical.

The Bible does not speak directly about masturbation. But there
certainly are principles in the Bible which apply.

> Everything that does not come from faith is sin ([[Romans

This passage tells us that everything we do that is not done faithfully,
anything we do that does not honor God, is sinful.

Whoa, so like, lots of my thoughts and deeds are sinful.

We are sinful creatures. We try to be good, but because we are human, we
have a sinful nature. We are only *saved* by the grace of God, but
that's another topic. Let's stick to the sin for the moment.

Our bodies have been redeemed and belong to God. Everything we do with
our bodies should be to God's glory. If we are not glorifying God with
something that we do, it can be sinful.

> The fruit of the Spirit is . . . self-control ([[Galatians
> 5:22--23](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=54e527&url=https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Gal%25205.22%25E2%2580%259323){.external_link

One of the fruits of the Spirit is self-control. Masturbation is almost
always a sign of a *lack* of self-control. Masturbation is often driven
by *lust,* which in biblical times was defined as a lack of
self-control, or a lack of restraint. Lust is desire without restraint,
and oftentimes, when people masturbate, it is out of a lack of
restraint.

So, *can* you masturbate in a way that includes a clear mind,
self-control, and a heart towards God? The best we can say is
*possibly*. But masturbation is a slippery slope at best. At worst, it
can lead to lustful thoughts, a lack of self-control, thinking of other
people besides your spouse, and possibly use of pornography, all of
which would be a *sinful* form of masturbation. Believers must be very
cautious that their minds and hearts are in a right orientation if they
choose to partake, in just the same way that they can sin in any number
of normal, natural ways, if the heart and mind are not in a right
orientation.

**TL;DR:** Since the question was specifically related to sin, the
answer is that in many cases, masturbation can be sinful.
