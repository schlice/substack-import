Short answer: **you don't**.

If you are trying to make peace with spending eternity in Hell, then you
are responding incorrectly to something that is *convicting* you. There
is a logical step that happens before trying to make peace with spending
eternity in Hell.

The logic goes like this:

1.  I recognize that I am a sinner, and without someone saving me, I'm
    headed to the hot place when I die.
2.  I now have two choices:
    1.  Make peace with spending eternity in hell, or
    2.  Admit my guilt, admit that I have sinned, and **repent and be
        saved.**

Since there is no peace in hell (it is a place of eternal torment), then
attempting to make peace with something which cannot be made peaceful is
an **invalid response**.

Once you have reached Step 1 and you realize that we are all sinners and
we have all fallen short of the glory of God, and that truth ***convicts
us***, the **valid response** is to repent of that sin, and accept
Christ as our savior who takes away the stain of that sin.

Christ has already done everything necessary to save you. Now all you
have to do is ***accept that gift***. Repent of your sin. Admit that you
are a sinner. Turn away from your sin and be saved.

That's the correct response.
