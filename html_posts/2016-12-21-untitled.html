Even on a welfare check, officers do not enter without exigent
circumstances being present. That said, on a welfare check, they will go
above and beyond to try to determine the welfare of the person in the
residence. They will bang on doors, knock on windows, and might even
peep in windows to see if the person is okay.

If they notice smells outside of the house that might indicate a person
was deceased inside the home, they may enter the home without a warrant.
The "plain smell" test is equivalent to the "plain sight" test.

If they hear a fight inside, and it sounds like someone is in trouble,
this is an exigent circumstance and officers can forcibly enter the
home.

In any circumstance, the officer must be able to articulate to the court
the reason for the forced entry, and it must comport with a valid
definition of exigency.
