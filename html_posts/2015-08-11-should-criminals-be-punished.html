More related to the prison system in the United States, the system is
supposed to be rehabilitative, not punitive. Clearly, opinions differ on
that point. If we were really going for punishment, why don\'t we have
torture chambers in prison? Why do inmates get medical treatment and hot
food and television and workout facilities? If prison is punitive, why
don\'t guards routinely beat prisoners?

In the eyes of the public, prison is retribution. In the eyes of the
criminal justice system, prison is rehabilitation.

(EDIT) Since the answer was merged, I\'ll try to answer the bigger
question, \"should prisoners be punished?\" Let\'s be clear: prison is
punishment, and not just because of the environment that is a prison.
Prison in a free country is punishment because your freedoms are taken
away. Your Constitutional rights are limited. This constitutes a
punishment in every sense of the word. It is not \"corporal\" punishment
(literally, \"punishment of the body\"), but it is punishment
nonetheless.

Our system of government and our system of economy in the United States
is a system of \"incentive.\" Good behavior is \"rewarded\" and bad
behavior is \"punished.\" Capitalism is a system of \"incentive:\" if
your business operates more efficiently than your competitor, you make
more money than your competitor. You are therefore incentivized to
operate more efficiently, thus building efficiency into the system of
economy. Similarly in law, in a Constitutional government, a nation of
laws is one based on incentive. Good behavior allows you to enjoy all of
the freedoms offered to you. Bad behavior limits those freedoms by
placing you in jail or restricting your movements for a period of time.
This is a punishment in as much as the lack of punishment is incentive
to continue to follow the law. Simply by \"being in prison,\" a person
is punished.

Sometimes, people conflate \"justice\" with \"retribution.\" For
example, you will see a court decision in which an accused was
acquitted, and the family of the victim says that \"there was no
justice.\" This is not true, there was indeed justice. Justice was
served, the bad guy went to prison, and the good guy walked. That
outcome was *just*, and so justice was indeed served. So what exactly is
the family looking for? They\'re certainly not looking for \"justice.\"
What they are really looking for is \"retribution.\" They wan their
\"pound of flesh.\" They want someone to *suffer* in the same way that
they are suffering. This is not justice. This is retaliation, it is
retribution, it is reprisal. So clearly then, if someone goes to jail,
the family believes they are *suffering.* Therefore, you can conclude
that in the eyes of the public, prison is punishment.
