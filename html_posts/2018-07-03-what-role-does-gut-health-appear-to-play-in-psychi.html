**What role does gut health appear to play in psychiatric and
neurological disorders?**

At some point, take some time and review [[the gut-brain
connection](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=365aac&url=https://www.google.com/search?q%3Dthe%2Bgut%2Bbrain%2Bconnection%26oq%3Dthe%2Bgut%2Bbrain%2Bconnection){.external_link

onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="google.com"}]{.qlink_container}. There's really too much
information to re-post here. But it's good stuff, and it's not just
marketing material from supplement makers. There are some very
interesting papers from [[Johns
Hopkins](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=3d57f3&url=https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/healthy_aging/healthy_body/the-brain-gut-connection){.external_link

[[Harvard](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=34553a&url=https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/the-gut-brain-connection){.external_link

connection and our new understandings of these. But if you've ever had
"butterflies in your stomach," or if you've ever had a "gut feeling"
about something, you intuitively know that there is a connection between
the gut and the brain. Yet only recently have we discovered some of the
real insights into this connection.

Some brief highlights:

- Along with the central nervous system (CNS) and the peripheral nervous
  system (PNS), we also have the enteric nervous system (ENS). This is
  sheaths of nerve fibers which surrounds the entire GI system from
  esophagus to anus.
- The ENS does the majority of the "heavy lifting" in controlling the
  digestion process: releasing enzymes, contracting muscles, etc.
- There is a very tight connection between the ENS and the CNS. Just as
  a distressed mind can send signals to, and influence, the intestines,
  a troubled intestine can send signals to, and influence, the brain.
  The result: a distressed intestine can lead to psychological symptoms
  like depression and anxiety. In short, we knew that a troubled brain
  could result in an upset GI system, but we're learning now that it
  works both ways.

As far as neurologic disorders, think about this: drugs meant to affect
the brain, like SSRIs, also induce GI changes. Irritable Bowel Syndrome,
or IBS, is partly caused by too much serotonin in our gut. You might
also think of IBS as a "mental illness" of the
ENS.[\[1\]](#YMgoP){#cite-YMgoP .citation_link}

We still have much to learn about this strange and complex interplay
between the "big brain" and the "little brain," but what we have learned
so far is very enlightening, and can help us in our understanding and
treatment of some very hard-to-manage diseases. We have much to learn.
For example, if there is such a connection between the gut and the
brain, could poor gut health be partly responsible for other diseases
within the brain, such as Parkinson's and MS? While probably not the
primary cause, they may definitely be related. More research is needed
into this fascinating area of medical study.
