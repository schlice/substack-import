If you own the home and he is not on the deed, you can inform him that
firearms, either openly carried or concealed, are not welcome in your
home. Since this is a custody thing and since courts and lawyers are
involved, I recommend you send a certified letter to inform him of your
requirement. Businesses restrict weapons all the time even when the law
allows properly registered persons to conceal firearms. You might check
your local laws to see if there is a requirement for signage to be
posted in a private residence which does not permit firearms; I know
there are some requirements for businesses in this category in some
states.

You cannot personally enforce this request, for several reasons:

1.  If the weapon is concealed, you'll probably never know he has it.
2.  If you do see the weapon, your only recourse is to ask him to leave
    and return without it. If he refuses, it is the equivalent of
    trespassing, and you would have to call the police to assist you
    with enforcing your trespassing directive.

In either case, I would advise you to remember that you are doing what
you are doing *for your daughter*. I would ask you to remember that, and
try not to cause a scene with her present. Instead, I would take note of
the situation and talk to him privately at another time, asking him why
he can't respect your boundaries (which may be one of the reasons you
got divorced in the first place, but that's a bit off topic). A gun safe
which can be locked in a car is very inexpensive (less that \$50), and
anyone who carries concealed should have one for those situations in
which you can't bring a firearm somewhere (like a school), so you can
just lock it in the safe in the car and you're good. It's really not
difficult to do what you asked.
