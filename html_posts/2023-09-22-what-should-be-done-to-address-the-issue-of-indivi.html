Laws should be clarified.

We should not be punishing the mother for getting an abortion from a
licensed abortion provider. The appropriate target is the licensed
medical professional who engages in unlawful medical practice. If
abortion is illegal in that area and someone licensed to perform
abortion performs one even thought the law says you may not, that is the
person to whom we should be directing our efforts, not the mother.

The laws should be made very clear that the mother is never the person
who should face prosecution for terminating a pregnancy through an
abortion.ยน

ยน This assumes that the mother got an abortion from a licensed abortion
provider. If she got a "back-alley abortion" or engaged in a "self-help
abortion" where such activity is illegal, she could face charges
herself.
