They were impatient.

Even after God gave them provision, even after God delivered them from
the hands of the Egyptians in the 11th hour, they still got impatient.

Moses went up to Mt. Sinai, and he *just took too long*. So they asked
Aaron to fashion them an idol while they waited.

*(NOTE: some people think that the idol was in place of God, and others
think the idol was a placeholder for Moses, but the issue is the same)*

So Aaron took their gold jewelry and made an idol for them to worship.

We all do this, don't we? We take the good things God gave us in
provision and we worship it. Like the big one: money. God provides the
money we need to live, and we worship it. This is a danger we all face,
not just the Israelites of the day.

But because the Israelites were not patient enough to allow God to work
in his time, they fell into the quick-fix trap of "quick, make an idol
for us to worship."

Original question:

Why would the people in Exodus choose to create and worship their own
idols when they have the true living God with them especially after
they\'ve seen how God delivered them from the Egyptians?
