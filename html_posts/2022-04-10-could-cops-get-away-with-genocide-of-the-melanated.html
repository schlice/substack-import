There is absolutely no way that the police could do such a thing.

Let's break it down:

1.  "Cops" are not one organized group. There are over 18,000 police
    organizations across federal, state, and local authorities,
    comprising on the order of a million sworn officers. There is not
    one "cops" organization.
2.  In order to get away with an organized genocide, they would all have
    to universally keep the secret, and their management chains would
    have not not only be complicit, but quiet. A cover-up of this
    magnitude could never be kept. There would be at least one
    whistleblower in the bunch.
