**Does the American With Disabilities Act apply to OCD?**

The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) does not specify the actual
conditions which it applies to. It simply defines what constitutes a
disability. It states that a person with a disability is "a person who
has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or
more major life activity." This includes people who have a record of
such an impairment, even if they do not currently have a disability. It
also includes individuals who do not have a disability but are regarded
as having a disability.

Therefore, if OCD "substantially limits one or more major life
activity," it would be covered. "Major life activities include, but are
not limited to, caring for oneself, performing manual tasks, seeing,
hearing, eating, sleeping, walking, standing, lifting, bending,
speaking, breathing, learning, reading, concentrating, thinking,
communicating, and working."[\[1\]](#tvUDN){#cite-tvUDN .citation_link}
