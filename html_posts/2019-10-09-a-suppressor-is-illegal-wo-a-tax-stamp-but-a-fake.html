**A suppressor is illegal (w/o a tax stamp), but a fake one is not, so
how quiet can a fake suppressor go before it becomes illegal and needs a
stamp or whatever, or how loud do you have to be?**

If the device reduces the report of the firearm, it's a suppressor.

How to test this:

- Fire the firearm without the device attached, check the volume using a
  sound level meter.
- Attach the device, fire the firearm, check the volume again.

If the volume reduced at all between the first and second firing, the
device is a suppressor and requires a tax stamp.
