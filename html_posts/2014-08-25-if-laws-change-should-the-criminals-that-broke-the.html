**Content:** [In all cases, people are judged based on the law that was
in place at the time the crime was committed. Past versions of the law
or potential future revisions of the law do not change the law that was
in place at the time of the act, and the general rule is that the law in
place at the time the crime was committed is the law that
stands.]{.rendered_qtext}
