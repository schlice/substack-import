Here is what the parent signs to when sponsoring a FOID card (emphasis
mine):

> \(1\) I am not currently prohibited from holding a FOID card insofar

> (b) I have not, i n the past 5 years, been a patient in a mental

Therefore, the parent is liable for damages (monetary) resulting from
the minor's use of firearms or ammunition.

When the families of the victims sue the shooter for wrongful death, the
parent will be financially responsible for paying (along with the
shooter, of course).

Original question:

Do you believe that Robert Crimo Sr., the father of the 4th of July mass
shooter in Highland Park, IL should be held accountable for sponsoring
his son\'s license to buy firearms? Isn\'t that like vouching for
someone?
