The problem with CFPB comes with the interpretation of the Vacancies
Reform Act, and its text which states that it is the \"exclusive means\"
for authorizing the appointment of an acting head unless another statute
expressly designates a particular officer to serve in that acting
capacity.

The legal battle is over the wording "exclusive." The administration
argues that the authors of the law would not have said that the VRA is
"exclusive" if it wasn't meant to be the overriding law, despite other
statutes. A statute can't be both "exclusive" and "subservient to
another law." The opposition states that where the VRA says "another
statute expressly designating a particular officer" means that
Dodd-Frank (which established CFPB and its chain of succession) is that
"other statute," so VRA doesn't apply. The administration says that if
other laws are to take precedent, then the VRA would have been worded to
say, "Any other law that names a succession takes precedence. In the
absence of such law, the VRA can be used." However, it does not say
that; it says that it is the "exclusive means" for appointing an acting
head. The word "exclusive" is the one that the administration claims
makes it supersede any other law.

So far, the courts have sided with the administration, refusing to
institute an injunction against the president installing an interim head
of the CFPB until a permanent head can be designated and make it through
Senate confirmation hearings.
