Really depends on the nature of the crash. Depends on how the aircraft
impacted the ground.\
\
For example, the plane on 9/11 that crashed in Shanksville, PA (or the
Germanwings flight) was nearly vertical when it impacted. The sheer
momentum of the aircraft, directed nearly vertically to the ground,
disintegrated most everything in the aircraft. Most of the airframe was
obliterated, along with everything inside of the aircraft. Human remains
would be scattered, and would generally be bits of flesh and bits of
bone. Very little would remain intact. You may find a finger or a foot
that were still intact (if enclosed in a strong enough shoe), but most
bodily structures would have been obliterated. You would only be able to
identify what parts belonged to whom using DNA analysis, and that would
only tell you what parts belonged together. You probably wouldn\'t find
enough whole parts to be able to positively identify anyone. Along with
obliteration, there would also be fire, since the fuel would most
certainly combust during the crash, so combining the obliterative force
of the crash along with the explosion and fire, and most physical
remains would be completely unidentifiable.\
\
In a crash where the aircraft impacts the ground at a lower angle, the
force of the impact is deflected much more greatly rather than if the
aircraft is more vertical. The lower the angle at which the aircraft
impacts, the more survivable the crash is. When an aircraft crashes and
disintegrates, but at a lower angle of attack, wreckage is far more
intact than in a more vertical crash. Airframe components break apart
rather than disintegrating, items within the aircraft are broken and
tossed, but some can retain their structural integrity. Human remains
are damaged and limbs and heads may be dislodged from bodies, but many
times corpses can remain mostly intact. Passengers will die mostly from
blunt force trauma caused by the impact with the ground, and the impact
from flying debris dislodged during the impact.]{.rendered_qtext}
