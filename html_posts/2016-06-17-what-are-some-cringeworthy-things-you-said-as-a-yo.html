I was sitting at a barbecue restaurant in St. Louis with a bunch of my
college-age friends (we were all a bit rowdy anyway), and the place was
noisy. I said, in a normal tone of voice,

"Man, I'm so hungry, I could eat the ass end of a dead rhino."

The waitress must not have heard me clearly, and in looking back, she
must have thought I said something else, perhaps something derogatory
about *her* ass, because she asked me what I said.

So I repeated it.

I guess she still didn't hear me, because she asked me to repeat it
**again**.

So I did, louder. Mind you, the first time I repeated it, it was still
funny. The second time was just annoying.

At that point, something changed.

Have you ever said something and it seemed like everyone got quiet and
listened to you?

That's exactly what happened.

Everyone stopped for a minute, processed what I said, and then turned
back to their own conversations, probably a little confused and probably
a little grossed out as well. Some of my friends probably learned a
little more about me at that point than I hoped they would.

*Mortified.*
