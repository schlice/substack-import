In NYC city limits, anyone selling something not in a store (i.e.
outside of a store) is considered a \"street vendor\" and needs a vendor
license.

You probably wouldn\'t be arrested, but you would most definitely be
cited for failure to obtain a street vendor license.

Outside of city limits, you\'d have to admit that the particular method
looks very much like Big Joe selling illegal weapons.
