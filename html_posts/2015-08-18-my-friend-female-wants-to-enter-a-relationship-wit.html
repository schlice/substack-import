**Content:** [You can\'t \"convince\" anyone of anything. She\'s 19, she
can do what she chooses with her life.\
\
Stand in one spot. Draw a circle around your feet. You have control over
everything inside the circle. You have no control over anything outside
the circle.\
\
You can tell her why you think that dating someone twice her age is a
bad idea. You can tell her that you think dating a married man is like
betting on a losing horse. You can tell her whatever you want to tell
her. Ultimately, the state considers her an adult, and so she should be
afforded the opportunity to make life decisions (even bad ones) on her
own.\
\
Just be there for her when she falls.]{.rendered_qtext}
