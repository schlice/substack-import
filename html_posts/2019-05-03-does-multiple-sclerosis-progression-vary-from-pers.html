**Does multiple sclerosis progression vary from person to person?**

Just as the symptoms of the disease vary from person to person, and just
as two people with the same symptoms can experience them differently,
the disease progression will indeed vary between patients.

The number one factor influencing the rate of progression is whether or
not a patient is taking one of the approved MS therapy drugs. While they
may act differently, the approved MS therapy drugs universally will slow
down the progression of the disease. While we can't stop the disease, we
can slow it down.

If you are taking an approved therapy drug, you also have to realize
that they work differently, and some may work better in some people than
others. The drugs all have different *efficacies*, or ability to produce
the desired outcome. Some drugs have higher efficacies than others, but
they are administered in a more efficient manner or in a more palatable
manner. For example, you may be terrified of needles, and so giving
yourself daily or periodic injections is a non-starter. Maybe infusion
or orals would work better for you, but their efficacies may be lower.
