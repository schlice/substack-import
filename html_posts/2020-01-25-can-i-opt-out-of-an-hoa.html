**Can I opt out of an HOA?**

Yes! You can opt to not purchase a home in a neighborhood which is
already controlled by a mandatory HOA.

A mandatory HOA is one which has been put in place by the developer,
before the houses began to be sold. This is the most common form of HOA
out there. The developer put the HOA in place, and now everyone who buys
a house is automatically part of the HOA. You cannot "opt out" of a
mandatory HOA. When you bought your house, you agreed to be part of the
HOA, and you do not have an option to say otherwise. As I said in my
opening sentence, you can opt out by not buying that home in that
neighborhood.

Some neighborhoods have "optional" HOAs, but these are less common.
These associations are more like "neighborhood clubs" than HOAs, since
you do not have to join. They will give you information about the HOA
when you buy your house, but you are under no obligation to join. If you
have one of these, you'll know, because they will be sure to tell you
that it is optional. These voluntary community associations may offer
amenities to members, such as reduced monthly rates for membership at
the community pool (or no monthly fees at all) or the community center
or gym, and other amenities and discounts on services. But for these
"optional" associations, you can usually pay out of pocket, or pay a
higher rate for non members, and use the same amenities.
