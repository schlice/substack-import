**Is it unprecedented for a US President to declare "We are at war"
publicly?**

No, it is not without precedent. Other presidents have said as much.
Roosevelt said , "I ask that the Congress declare that since the
unprovoked and dastardly attack by Japan on Sunday, December 7, 1941, a
state of war has existed between the United States and the Japanese
Empire." In other words, we are at war; it's up to you to officially
declare it.

Additionally, saying words is not illegal. 1st Amendment and all. And
saying it doesn't make it true. Congress is the only body that can
declare war, according to the Constitution.
