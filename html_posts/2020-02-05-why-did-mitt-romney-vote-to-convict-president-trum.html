**Why did Mitt Romney vote to convict President Trump in the impeachment
trial?**

It's a concept we call "virtue signaling."

He knows it won't make a difference. He knows that the President will be
acquitted. So it's a safe vote for him. He can vote however he likes and
it won't change the outcome.

So he votes in a way that "signals" to others what he wants to say.

In this way, he's signaling that he's a RINO: Republican In Name Only.
He's actually a Democrat.

He's someone who believes that it's Congress' job to overrule the will
of the American voter. He believes he knows better than you. He believes
government should take care of all of your decisions for you.

He's a Democrat.

That's why he voted to convict.
