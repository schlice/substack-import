There are two laws in Arizona that might apply to your situation:

13-1402 Indecent exposure: Class 1 misdemeanor\
13-1403 Public sexual indecency: Class 1 misdemeanor

- Indecent exposure (Arizona Revised Statutes section
  [[13-1402](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=a130c6&url=http://www.azleg.state.az.us/ars/13/01402.htm){.external_link
  rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
  onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
  qt-tooltip="state.az.us"}]{.qlink_container}): When a person exposes
  his or her genitals while another person is present, and the person
  exposing himself or herself is reckless as to whether the witness
  would be offended or alarmed.
- Public sexual indecency (Arizona Revised Statutes section
  [[13-1403](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=99a107&url=http://www.azleg.state.az.us/ars/13/01403.htm){.external_link
  rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
  onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
  qt-tooltip="state.az.us"}]{.qlink_container}): When a person performs
  one or more sexual behaviors while another person is present, and the
  person performing the sex act is reckless as to whether the witness
  would be offended or alarmed. The sex acts listed in the statue are:
  - Sexual contact;
  - Oral sexual contact;
  - Sexual intercourse; and
  - Bestiality.

So the keys here in order to make either of these charges stick are (and
you need all of them):

1.  You do the thing
2.  You are reckless as to whether or not someone else might see you do
    the thing
3.  Someone else sees you do the thing and is offended or alarmed.

As you can see, both of the listed offenses are Class 1 misdemeanors.
This means that you would either be arrested and charged with these
offenses, or you would be *released on your own recognizance* (ROR'd)
with a summons in hand requiring you to make yourself present in court
on X day at X time to answer these charges. Multiple charges for the
same violation (at different times) may require the person be added to
the sex offender registry.

If nether of these has happened, it's most likely that you were simply
released without being charged. This means that either you were seen by
someone and they chose not to press charges, or you weren't seen by
anyone, and were not reckless as to whether or not someone else might
see you. This is most likely the case, as the essential elements of the
crime were probably not met. If you were released without paperwork in
hand, this is the most likely reason why.

Of course, none of us can tell you specifically because we weren't
there. However, in looking at state law, it's likely that they simply
told you to get dressed and get lost because it would have been a
stretch to make any charges stick without a complaining witness.

If you are still worried that there might be outstanding charges against
you, you can always contact the police department with which you had the
confrontation, or you can engage a lawyer who can check for you.
