**Content:** [It\'s hard to say this, but if that\'s exactly what your
neurologist told you, he\'s wrong.\
\
What he may have meant to say is that your immune system will not attack
the myelin with the same vigor when you are older as it does now.
Everyone\'s immune systems slow somewhat as they age, so the damage will
occur naturally more slowly.\
\
However, this does not translate to \"your MS will get better.\" MS is a
progressive disease, it does not revert. Gliosis of nerve cells is
irreversible using today\'s (2014) medical technology. Once it happens,
the damage is done and cannot be reversed. So in that respect,
regardless of how slowly or how quickly your immune system carries out
its attacks on you, once it causes gliosis, those nerve cells are
damaged and that damage is irreversible. So \"your MS will get better\"
should not be taken to mean that your symptoms will start to reverse
themselves.\
\
For those with MS, we have to stay on some type of immunomodulator or
immunosuppressant in order to manage the disease. We cannot rely on \"it
will get better as you get older\" because as far as disease progression
goes, it doesn\'t get \"better.\"]{.rendered_qtext}
