**How can the U.S. make progress on gun laws that might satisfy both
sides of the aisle?**

Perhaps you are unaware of what makes a good compromise. A good
compromise is when both sides are ***not*** perfectly satisfied. If one
side is satisfied and the other is not, this is not compromise. It's
like the old saying, "Sure we have compromise in our marriage. She gets
what she wants, and I compromise."

In order to truly compromise, I have to give something that I don't want
to give, and you have to give something you don't want to give. Only
then have we reached a compromise.

Tell me: *what has the gun control crowd offered to give in exchange for
banning a particular kind of gun?*

This doesn't sound very much like compromise to me. One side demands
concessions from the other side, and offers nothing in return. Not even
empty platitudes. The gun controllers use leftist tactics to vilify
their opponents by calling them baby killers and insane gun nuts who
care more about their precious toys than the lives of our nation's
children. Emotional pleadings with no basis in reality is the only thing
they offer.

Will they offer national concealed carry legislation, or reciprocity?\
Will they offer re-classifying suppressors?\
Will they offer rolling back ineffective legislation like waiting
periods?\
Will they offer allowing new automatic rifles to be added to the
registry?

Until they come to the table with *something, anything*, then it's
abundantly clear that they're not really interested in compromise.
They're really only interested in **control**. And the gun rights
advocates will dig in their heels, bolstered by the fact that the Second
Amendment still exists, and we will never make any progress at all.

Therefore, **the only way that we will make progress on gun laws that
satisfy both sides of the aisle is when both sides of the aisle truly
give up something they want in exchange.** ***That's what compromise
looks like.***
