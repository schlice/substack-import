Unlike my other answering colleagues, in the United States, PA is
***usually*** at fault. This is because PA has a responsibility to
exercise care when driving. When PA is *tailgating*, this generally
alleviates PB of any negligence claims.

There are some scenarios in which PB would share some of the
responsibility for the accident:

- "Brake checks," which are scenarios where PB's car stops suddenly for
  no apparent reason
- Stopping to make a turn but then failing to make the turn
- Non-functioning warning lights (i.e. brake lights, tail lights) in
  PB's vehicle

If both PA and PB are found to share negligence, then the concept of
**contributory negligence** versus **comparative negligence** comes into
play. From
