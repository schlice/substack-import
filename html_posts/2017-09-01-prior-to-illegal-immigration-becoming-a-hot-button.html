Prior to ***case law*** existing (which was a *long time ago*), the
police could stop and question anyone about anything. They didn't read
rights. Heck, there were no rights to read.

Then some people were arrested, and they didn't think that the police
followed the spirit of the Constitution, and they were right, and case
law was born. It clarified and expounded on the meaning of those rights
in the Constitution and how they should be applied to police work.

Now, we have *Terry v. Ohio*, which allows police officers to use the
"reasonable suspicion" standard to **stop** anyone on the street who
they think is about to commit a crime, or has just committed a crime,
and question them. They can then, in conjunction with the **stop**,
**frisk** that person (which means pat down the outermost layer of
clothing) looking for weapons, so that the **stop** can go safely. This
practice, based on the bolded words, is called **stop and frisk**.

There is a similar set of laws called **stop and ID** statutes, and
these laws vary by state. They basically say, in their simplest forms,
that for the same reasons and the same justifications under which police
can stop and frisk, they can also ask you for your name, your personally
identifying information (PII), your valid ID if you have it, and what
you're doing. Note that in America, you don't have to have a driver's
license in your possession unless you're driving a car. So you can't
demand that someone on the street has a valid ID.

So if the police demand identification from an illegal immigrant, and
they don't have it, what then? If they give false identifying
information, what then?

The police were initially stopping someone because of suspicion of
criminal activity. If their investigation is unable to substantiate that
suspicion, the person is released.

But what if that person is an illegal immigrant? First of all, stop and
frisk or stop and ID does not cover legal status in the country. It
covers a specific, articulable reason for a stop, and that has to do
with criminal activity, not legal immigration status. Secondly,
immigration and legal status in this country is a Federal matter, not
covered by local police departments. In fact, states are specifically
enjoined from enforcing Federal law, because it is Federal, and the
police enforce state law.
