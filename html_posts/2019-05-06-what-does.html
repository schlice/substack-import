**What does "all gun control is racist" mean? It was printed on t-shirts
worn at a political rally in Harrisburg, Pa.**

Gun control disproportionately affects the poor. Especially when you
talk about certain gun control measures, like increasing mandatory
background checks or instituting mandatory licensing schemes, which will
increase the overall price of a gun, pricing the poor out of the market.
Essentially, any gun control measure which requires new hoops through
which a new owner must jump will increase the cost of a gun, which
disproportionately impacts the poor, probably the demographic which is
in the most need of guns for protection.

In areas where the poor communities are largely one race, the argument
is made that gun control is therefore racist because it affects one
particular race more than others.
