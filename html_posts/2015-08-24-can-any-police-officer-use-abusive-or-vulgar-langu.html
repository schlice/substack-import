**Content:** [Of course an officer can use abrasive language with
someone.\
\
Should he? Probably not, especially if the suspect was being polite. You
have to be able to relate to every person you deal with, and for some,
that type of language is normal. But the officer\'s language should, at
the very least, match the coarseness of your own.\
\
If you feel that an officer\'s behavior was unacceptable and didn\'t
match the behavior you presented to the officer, you should file a
complaint with the officer\'s department.]{.rendered_qtext}
