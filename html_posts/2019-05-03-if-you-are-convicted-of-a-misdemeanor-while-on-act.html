**If you are convicted of a misdemeanor while on active duty how long
will it be before the air force will find out?**

Under normal circumstances, the Department of Justice and the Department
of Defense will work together on federal crimes and work out who will
prosecute, so when it comes to federal matters, they probably already
know.

If a situation arises where the military does not know about a civilian
conviction, it behooves the military member to get out in front of it.
Reporting immediately to the JAG and to the unit commander and advising
them of what happened is the best way to *not* have the military take
any adverse action. Explaining that the civilian authority handled the
situation and no further adverse action is needed may allow them to "let
it go."

Failing to report it will present an image of guilt and a perception of
someone who wants to "cover up" his crimes, not "own up" to them.
