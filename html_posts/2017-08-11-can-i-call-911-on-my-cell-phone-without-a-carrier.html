If your phone can connect to the cellular network and make calls, but
you simply have no SIM card or no subscription to a carrier's service,
then yes, your phone will be able to call 911. But if the phone is so
old that its radios are no longer compatible with the current cellular
network, it simply won't work at all.

I keep a previous generation cell phone in my "safe room" in my house,
plugged in to the wall. It has no SIM card, but it still can receive a
cellular signal and is still able to make calls on a carrier network. In
an emergency, I can use that phone to call 911.
