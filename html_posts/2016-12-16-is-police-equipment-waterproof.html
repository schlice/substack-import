Depends on the equipment you are referring to.

Most of the "gear" in the "leather" is waterproof. Handcuffs, batons,
pepper spray, firearms and bullets, and Tasers are generally not
affected by water. They do need to dry completely or some components may
risk rusting. Most flashlights are also water resistant, though some
models may have some issues in the water.

The "leather" is not waterproof. If the officer is wearing true leather
"leathers" then it is not waterproof and will be irreparably damaged
from being submersed. Even the fake leather that some leather gear is
made from is not water resistant and will also be damaged by submersion.

Some ballistic vests don't take kindly to water either, so that could be
an issue.
