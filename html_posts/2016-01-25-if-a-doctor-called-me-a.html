Generally, no. There is no law against being a jerk. Your best bet would
be to file a complaint with her practice. If she is a solo practice, I
would leave the practice and find a new doctor, and write her a bad
online review because she is a jerk.

If her characterization of you led you to suffer some harm (i.e. her
characterization of you led you to get fired from a job), this is called
\"slander\" and then becomes actionable.

But beyond that one scenario, just calling you a name is not illegal.
