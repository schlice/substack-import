If the Justice Department is right and a sitting president cannot be
indicted and arrested, then the president is not legally in a position
in which an indictment is possible.

Therefore, a court could find that a statute could be "frozen" (the
legal term is *tolled*) until such time as the president *becomes
eligible for indictment*.

Now that Trump is no longer president, a prosecutor could have brought
charges. They've had a full year to bring charges. No one has.

So either there was no actual, chargeable crime, or the statute of
limitations has now, officially, expired in the year since Trump has
left office.

\

Original question:

Do democrats realize statutes of limitations aren\'t frozen just because
a person becomes president and every \"crime\" Trump is accused of have
passed that?
