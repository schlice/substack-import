**If God is a God, then why does he let people suffer, and if he's
really true, why is he just watching people suffer?**

Let me relay a story I heard. It's about a boy named Chris whose face
had been burned in a fire. He sent this note to his psychotherapist:

> Dear Dr. Gardner,
>
> Some big person, it was a boy about 13, he called me a turtle. And I
> know he said this because of my plastic surgery. And I think God hates
> me because of my lip. And when I die, he'll probably send me to hell.
>
> Love,
>
> Chris

Chris figured that if God was so powerful and all-knowing, then God must
hate him if he allowed such a terrible thing to happen to him.

You're not alone if you feel this way. Many people have felt this way.
Even the greats of the Bible had this happen to them. Look at Joseph. He
was hated by his own brothers, sold into slavery, imprisoned, falsely
accused of attempted rape, and threatened with execution. There was no
indication that God had explained to Joseph all of the reasons why he
had to go through all of that, or what would eventually be done with his
life. **He was expected, as you and I are, to live out his life one day
at a time in something less than complete understanding.**

What pleased God was Joseph\'s faithfulness **when nothing made sense.**

But I must ask you: *where did you get the idea that God would not allow
you to suffer?*

It certainly wasn't the Bible, because there it says that we should
expect trouble. Jesus told His followers to anticipate suffering. \"I
have told you these things, so that in me you may have peace. In this
world, you will have trouble. But take heart! I have overcome the
world.\" (John 16:33). Paul wrote, \"In all our troubles my joy knows no
bounds. For when we came into Macedonia, this body of ours had no rest,
but we were harassed at every turn\--conflicts on the outside, fears
within\" (2 Cor 7:4-5). Peter said, \"Dear friends, do not be surprised
at the painful trial you are suffering, as though something strange were
happening to you. But rejoice that you participate in the suffering of
Christ, so that you may be overjoyed when His glory is revealed\" (1
Peter 4:12-13).

Does this mean we\'re always going to suffer? Paul said we are \"more
than conquerors.\" He wrote in Philippians 4:4-7, \"Rejoice in the Lord
always. I will say it again: Rejoice! Let your gentleness be evident to
all. The Lord is near. Do not be anxious about anything, but in every
situation, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your
requests to God. And the peace of God, which transcends all
understanding,will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.\"

There appears to exist this great paradox where we are told to expect
suffering and hardship, but we are encouraged to be joyful, thankful,
and \"of good cheer.\" But how can we be joyful in the face of hardship?
How can we be secure when we are surrounded by insecurity?

**Trust God.**

The BIble tells us to \"\[t\]rust in the Lord; lean not on your own
understanding\" (Proverbs 3:5). \"Leaning\" is that demand for answers
\-- \"throwing faith to the wind if a satisfactory response cannot be
produced. It is pressing God to explain Himself \-- or else! That is
where everything starts to unravel.

\"If we can comprehend even a tiny portion of the Lord\'s majesty and
the depth of His love for us, we can deal with those times when He
defies human logic and sensibilities. Indeed, that is what we must do.
Expect confusing experiences to occur along the way, and don\'t be
dismayed when they arrive. Welcome them as friends\--as opportunities
for your faith to grow. Hold fast to your faith, without which it is
impossible to please Him. \'Lean into the pain\' when your time to
suffer comes around. Never yield to feelings of self-pity of
victimization, which are Satan\'s most effective tools against us.
Instead, store away your questions for a lengthy conversation in
eternity, and then press toward the mark.\"[\[1\]](#azsOB){#cite-azsOB
