**Content:** [Your answer is not a rant. It\'s a valid concern about the
structure of the Federal government. Remember what I said in my answer:
**the People choose Congress, the States choose the President.** The
current system ensures some level of equality throughout the states, so
that states with small landmasses are not dwarfed in their power by
states with large landmasses, and states with small populations are not
dwarfed by states with larger populations. Allowing a popular vote for
President makes the election a popularity contest, and doesn\'t take the
best interest of the state into consideration. You would think that
voters take their states\' interests into consideration, but most often
they do not.\
\
You speak in terms of percentages of votes, but you don\'t speak in
terms of percentages of eligible voters who actually vote. When our
voter turnout is such that one out of every five eligible voters
actually casts a vote, I don\'t think it\'s right that a popular vote
determines the winner. In that case, it really is a popularity contest,
and the more popular person will win, because people will actually make
the effort to vote for him, whereas if they are not thrilled with him in
general, they won\'t. That\'s not democracy. That\'s representative
government, where the disinterested are forced to live with the choices
of others.]{.rendered_qtext}
