**What will happen if I block two handicap parking spaces?**

If you have a handicap hang tag or plate, nothing. People will just
assume you can't drive, or perhaps your handicap is so severe that you
can't drive *well.*

If you don't have a handicap tag or plate, the police can be called and
you can be cited for unlawfully parking in a handicap spot. You could
potentially receive two tickets for parking in two handicap spots. The
fines for those range in the hundreds of US dollars.
