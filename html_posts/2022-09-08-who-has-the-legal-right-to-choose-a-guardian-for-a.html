As a parent, you can look ahead to an eventual possibility of needing
guardianship for your children and you can *designate* a guardian, and
that's normally accomplished through your will. As long as the person
you designate in your will is available, capable, and willing, the court
will grant your request.

If a guardian must be chosen because *you have died without a will,* or
if a guardian must be chosen because *a child is being removed from the
home*, the guardian is chosen by the courts. The courts always hold as
sacrosanct and most important the welfare of the child, and the best
interest of the child. Tangentially, the court tries to place the child
with the closest relative on the family tree, and who has the most
runway to raise the child (financial means, time to devote to the child,
etc). The problem with allowing the court to choose a guardian is that
clearly, you as a parent don't have any input into that decision at that
point, and the court may choose someone who has the means to raise your
child, but maybe won't necessarily raise the child *as you would have*.
This is why you really want to have a will to account for your wishes
when it comes to your minor children.
