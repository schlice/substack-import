I'm not seeing the same thing you are.

It must be where we are getting our news from that is the problem. My
guess is you are following the mainstream media, and they have an agenda
to push. It's the same agenda that Leftists (who are different from
liberals) are pushing: **corporations are bad and evil and need to be
tightly controlled.** So they will do whatever they need to do to
advance their agenda, including wall-to-wall coverage of the "little
guy" fighting back against the "evil corporation." So I bet you're
seeing continuous coverage of every statement the guy's lawyer is
making, and anything else they can dredge up about him or United
Airlines.

It plays right into our overall frustration with airlines in general, so
it's a compelling story. United is one of the world's biggest carriers,
so it's natural for the mainstreams to stick with this story like it's
going out of style.
