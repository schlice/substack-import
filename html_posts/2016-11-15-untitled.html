**The United States was never a democracy.**

It was never designed to be, either. Democracies do not work, because it
makes it too easy for a candidate to game the system.

We have *representative government* and a *federation of independent
states.* We are not one big United State of Amerika. We are 50
independent states in one federation.

If it was, the candidates who appeal to the largest populations of
people would win. For example, a candidate could win just the big cities
(ahem, Hillary), ignore ***large*** swaths of the country, and still win
the election. This is far from "fair." Plus, *every single vote matters
a great deal,* so voter fraud becomes far more important an issue to
deal with.

The Electoral College solves both of those problems. It requires
candidates to appeal to a much larger cross-section of the country. And
it makes voter fraud, while an important issue, something that less
appreciably changes the outcome of the election.

Finally (and if there is any reasoning for the EC that we can throw
out), the Founders were very worried about a central government
abrogating too much power onto itself. It was worried about the original
plan of Congress electing the President and installing a puppet leader,
and Congress having all the power. Clearly, over the decades, the
President has been granted far more power than originally designed, so
this is less of a concern. The founders solved this by making the
following statement:

- **The people elect Congress, but**
- **The states elect the President.**

This makes the states relevant in playing a role in government, since
the state (as a whole) elects the President, but the people directly
elect their Congressmen. Originally, there was no direct election of the
Senate, but that changed as well. That's why the Senate served longer.

Nevertheless, the Electoral College eliminates the bias that big cities
have over less densely populated areas. Without the EC, politicians
would completely ignore small states and areas with small populations.
They would fight over the big cities and the population centers in the
country, and that's far from fair.

No one wants a true democracy when only 2/3 of eligible voters actually
participate.
