The answer is yes, but it is unlikely.

The legal standard is that the law at the time of the action is the law
which governs. Therefore, if a criminal action is taken while that
action is actually a crime, it can be prosecuted.

However, the truth of the matter is that the action has now been
decriminalized. It is likely, therefore, that there will be little will
to prosecute a crime which is no longer a crime. That action was
intentionally decriminalized; the impetus therefore is that no one wants
to actually prosecute such a crime.

So legally, the crime could be prosecuted, but in actuality, it is
unlikely that anyone would take up that mantle to prosecute that crime.
