They're not. For the most part, we already have those things, so it's
really hard to claim that you want more. And we must be cautious when
trying to add more.

Let's look at what you listed:

**Free healthcare:** Since our focus is on newborn babies and young
children, you already have free healthcare. It's in a program called the
Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP). CHIP is health insurance
that covers uninsured children in families which make a modest income
but too much to meet the requirement for Medicaid. The biggest reason
that uninsured children still exist is because families make more than
200% of the poverty level (higher than the CHIP limit) but the family's
employer doesn't pay for dependents, because annual premiums for family
coverage are simply too high. So the problem here is not that we're not
providing a program. It's that people outside of the program are not
being covered. While we'd love to cover health insurance for every child
in America, regardless of how much money their family makes, we have to
spend our tax dollars wisely. We spend our healthcare dollars where it
makes the most sense.

**Food assistance:** We have this too. It's programs called the
Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and the older (but
still kicking) program called Women, Infants, and Children (WIC). WIC
provides free basic food staples: milk, cheese, butter, bread, etc, and
SNAP allows families to buy nutritious foods to keep their families fed.
According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities (CBPP), in a
typical month of 2017, "SNAP helped about 42 million low-income
Americans afford a nutritious diet." These programs work.

**Free daycare:** Yep, you guessed it, we have that too. Every state
gets money from the federal government to pay for child assistance
programs. They have different names in different states, like vouchers,
fee assistance, subsidies, etc. These programs help families who qualify
pay for child care so they can work or go to school. Every state also
has Head Start programs which are federally funded, and some states have
fully funded pre-K for ages 3 through 5.

Now, I bet you're going to say, "but I don't qualify for X because my
family makes too much money, what about us?" Interestingly, the
Brookings Institute did a study. They framed their study with the
following paragraph:

> Policy aimed at promoting economic opportunity for poor children must
> be framed within three stark realities. First, many poor children come
> from families that do not give them the kind of support that
> middle-class children get from their families. Second, as a result,
> these children enter kindergarten far behind their more advantaged
> peers and, on average, never catch up and even fall further behind.
> Third, in addition to the education deficit, poor children are more
> likely to make bad decisions that lead them to drop out of school,
> become teen parents, join gangs and break the law.

With this in mind, they found the formula for success: the three things
teens and young adults can do to virtually guarantee themselves entry
into the middle class:

- Finish high school
- Get a full time job
- Wait until you turn 21 before you get married and have children.

> Our research shows that of American adults who followed these three
> simple rules, only about 2 percent are in poverty and nearly
> 75 percent have joined the middle class (defined as earning around
> \$55,000 or more per year). There are surely influences other than
> these principles at play, but following them guides a young adult away
> from poverty and toward the middle class.[\[1\]](#Aqxvc){#cite-Aqxvc

Finally, if you can't afford to support a family right now, maybe
abortion is not the only choice. Instead of killing your baby, why not
give it up for adoption? There are so many families who cannot have
children who are adopting kids from overseas because there just aren't
enough babies here in the US available for adoption. You can literally
have your baby and walk out of the hospital with no baby. You just tell
them that you want to give your baby up for adoption, and they'll take
care of the rest. In all states, there are programs where you can give
your baby up for adoption within the first three days at any fire
station, no questions asked. It's easier to give up a newborn baby for
adoption than it is to break your iPhone. And it's okay to say, "I got
pregnant, but I'm not ready to have a family yet, because I'm not in a
good financial position." That's okay! Let's stop stigmatizing these
things. Let's instead call that "smart family planning."

Abortion is not the only answer.

Original question:

Why are people who claim to be pro-life and are willing to end all
abortions against social programs that help children such as free
healthcare, food assistance, and free daycare programs?
