**Trump says you have to take the children away.**

Trump doesn't say this, the law does. The law says that you cannot
incarcerate a child (accompanied or unaccompanied) for more than 20
days. Congress can re-write this law if they choose, but the courts have
upheld the law. Trump is merely enforcing the law as it is written,
which is exactly what he was elected to do.

**In what other laws has the President not historically followed the
letter of the law?**

President Obama was famous for not following the letter of the law. He
used Executive Orders to direct Federal agencies to specifically *not*
follow the law. He called it many things, such as *prosecutorial
discretion*, which lawlessness is most certainly not prosecutorial
discretion. Discretion in enforcing laws does **not** mean writing
policy to selectively ignore enforcement. This is a terribly
disingenuous reading of the law, one which does not jibe with how law
should be enforced.

What President Trump is doing is both legal and correct. The Executive
merely enforces the laws given to it by Congress. The blame here lies
squarely on the shoulders of Congress. If they don't like the law as it
is written, they are perfectly free to re-write that law.

And as I understand it, an effort is currently underway in Congress to
do just that. But I'm going to predict something: Democrats will oppose
the change to the law! Yes, I know, the hypocrisy of it all. The very
same people who are railing against the fact that children are separated
from their parents will refuse to vote for the very law which would fix
the problem.

Why?

Because they care more about beating up the president than they do about
keeping illegal alien children with their parents. They'd rather
continue to use pictures of crying children to beat on the president
because they think it will gain them political points in the upcoming
elections.
