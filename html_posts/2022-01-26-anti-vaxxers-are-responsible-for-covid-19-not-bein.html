The CDC says this statement is untrue. Fully vaccinated people can still
get COVID-19. Fully vaccinated people can still transmit COVID-19. So
this statement is, objectively, **false**.

See the first answer. The vaccinated do this, too.

> the antivaxxers should be in JAIL?

What law have they violated? Last I checked, medical decisions were a
personal choice, not the realm of the state?
