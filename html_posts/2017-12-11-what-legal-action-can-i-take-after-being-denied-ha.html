**What legal action can I take after being denied having a \"CO\" on
scene and stating I was being illegally detained?**

You do what everyone does: hire a lawyer and take it up in court.

You can state all day, till you're blue in the face, that you want a CO
on scene.\
You can state all day, till you're blue in the face, that you believe
your detention is illegal.\
*None* of that changes the detention.

Remember the old axiom: you may be able to beat the rap, but you can't
beat the ride.

That means that you may be able to successfully defend yourself in court
(by proving that your rights were violated by not being allowed to have
a CO on scene, or even prove that your detention was illegal), but
you're still going to be arrested and booked. You'll still have to cool
your heels in jail until your arraignment, and you may have to continue
to cool your heels in jail until you are bailed or until your trial.
