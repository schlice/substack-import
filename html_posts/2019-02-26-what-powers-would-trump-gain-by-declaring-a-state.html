**What powers would Trump gain by declaring a state of emergency?**

Congress has delegated at least 136 distinct statutory emergency powers
to the President during a time of declared war or when he declares a
national emergency.

Note all of the references to Federal laws in here. It's important to
remember that Trump **only** gains the powers *which were authorized by
Congress.* Clearly, however, he only gains the powers in the laws which
are specifically related to the national emergency. He is required to
declare which laws he is implementing and for what reason.

In this case, Trump is invoking the powers in 10 USC §2808(a)
authorizing military construction projects.
