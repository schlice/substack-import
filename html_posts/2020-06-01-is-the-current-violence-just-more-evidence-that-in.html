**Is the current violence just more evidence that innocent, law-abiding
citizens should own firearms for self-protection?**

No. The *current* violence is just more evidence that radical leftists
and Antifa can hijack peaceful protesters and turn their protests into
hate-filled riots.

However, if the *current* violence gets worse, as Antifa has pledged to
do, and rioters start breaking into houses, then you had better already
own a gun and know how to use it.

But as you can tell, there's a timing problem here. If you don't own a
gun now and you haven't trained on how to use a gun to protect your
family without hurting your damn self, you may run out of time between
when rioters start leveling up their violence and when you can get a gun
and train with it enough to be effective.

The key? You have to employ the old Boy Scout motto (remember them?):
*Be Prepared.*

You have to go out now and buy a gun and train with it so that you can
defend your family **before** the violence gets bad.

The current violence doesn't require innocent, law-abiding citizens to
do anything other than to stay home. But if the current violence starts
to spill over into your home, you don't have time to prepare. You only
have time to *react*.
