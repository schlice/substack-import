**Content:** [In general, it is **not** legal to defend your business
using deadly force, regardless of whether or not there is a state of
emergency in effect, and whether or not you see a visible police
presence. You can only defend your **person** using deadly force, not
your **possessions.** You cannot defend your business using deadly
force.\
\
If you post armed guards outside your store, these brave (and slightly
off-center) people are putting their **physical bodies** in the way of
looters. They can then use a self-defense justification if they must
open fire on a looter. But that\'s not a job I\'d wish on anyone.\
\
To defend your business, you should do the following:\
]{.rendered_qtext}

1.  Add gates or rollup doors. You can make it very difficult for
    someone to actually get into your store. Some gates can lock from
    the inside as well, making it next to impossible to get in from the
    outside. Looters will move on to softer targets.\
2.  Add security cameras. Looters like to loot, but they don\'t like to
    let anyone know that they loot. Threaten to post video of anyone
    looting your store online.\
3.  Call the police. I know you are thinking that this is silly during a
    riot, but you should be on record that looters were attacking your
    store. Helps with the insurance claim.\

You should not:\

- set up booby traps (this is universally illegal)\
- fire warning shots (depending on the circumstances, this can be seen
  as a threat, which may be a felony)

I should also mention that while this is illegal in Baltimore, in Texas
you can defend your store using deadly force if you can show that using
non-deadly force would put your own life or the lives of others at risk.
It\'s a narrow exception.
