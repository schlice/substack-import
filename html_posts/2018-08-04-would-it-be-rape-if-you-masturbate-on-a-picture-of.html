**Would it be rape if you masturbate on a picture of someone without
that person\'s consent?**

LOL

**Rape** is defined in most jurisdictions as sexual intercourse, or
other forms of sexual **penetration**, committed by a perpetrator
against a victim without their consent.

Penetration. As in, from one person to another person.

Masturbating to a picture makes up like 99% of the porn industry.

So no, dear questioner, masturbating to a picture without the consent of
the person depicted is most definitely not rape.
