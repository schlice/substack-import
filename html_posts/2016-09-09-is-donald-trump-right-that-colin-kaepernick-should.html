Short answer: **Trump is wrong, but so is Kaepernick.**

Longer answer: Trump is wrong. This country welcomes free speech, even
if it's speech you don't agree with. That includes both Kaepernick's
speech and Trump's speech as well. If you allow Kaepernick to express
his views, you have to allow Trump to do the same. However, the US is
the most inclusive, most welcoming country in the world. No other
country is quite as easy to become a citizen as ours is. We (used to)
welcome dissenting speech, and people who question and think generally
seek out those with whom they disagree to engage in healthy,
thought-provoking debate. We have become so sensitive in this country,
we can no longer engage in debate because we fear upsetting someone. We
have done our children a disservice by teaching them that they have the
right to never be offended. Nevertheless, Trump, in trying to spin up
his base, is actually portraying the wrong message to the nation, and to
the world. I'm sorry Trumpers, but he's wrong on this one.

Kaepernick is wrong as well.

1.  While he has the right to express his opinion, it is disrespectful
    and based on lies.
2.  Also, the NFL is wrong in allowing this nonsense to go on during a
    football game.

Let's address point 1. Kaepernick is sitting during the National Anthem
to protest police treatment of blacks in this country. Groups like the
ACLU, Black Lives Matter, and the Obama administration parrot this
narrative.

***EXCEPT IT'S COMPLETELY WRONG***.

The chief conceit of the Black Lives Matter movement is that the most
dangerous thing in the life of a young black man is a racist police
officer. This is a **lie**. To be clear, this is not a factual error, or
a misstatement. A **lie** is *intentionally misrepresenting the truth to
gain some advantage or express an opinion that would not otherwise be
served by the truth.* That is what we have here.

If you do not believe that Black Lives Matter is lying to you, take
literally five minutes out of your day and get the facts:

As you can see, there is no government agency in this country that is
more dedicated to the lives of black people than the police. When a 911
call comes in, the operator does not ask the color of the person's skin
before dispatching officers. Officers go towards the gunshots,
regardless of who fired them. The whole foundation of the Black Lives
Matter movement is **a lie**. And Kaepernick is wasting his stage
protesting *that?* This is, indeed, sad.

If you want to protest something, protest the fact that illegal
immigrants *do* take jobs from honest American citizens, because
employers get away with hiring them, and then underpaying them because
they don't take taxes out of their pay. The government does nothing
about this. Protest the fact that Americans step on and burn the flag as
a form of "protest" and "free speech." "If you want a symbolic gesture,
don\'t *burn* the flag; *wash* it."[\[1\]](#xezzw){#cite-xezzw
.citation_link} In other words, *be the change you want to see in the
world. Protests are great, but get off your butt and* ***do something
about it.***

William McRaven, Chancellor of the University of Texas System (a former
Navy SEAL) sent the following regarding Kaepernick's actions (emphasis
mine):

> Honoring the flag does not imply that the republic for which it stands
> is perfect. Far from it, honoring the flag is our collective
> commitment that we will constantly attempt to get better as a nation,
> to improve as a people, and to use the freedoms we have been given to
> make the earth a better place.

> I spent 37 years defending freedom of speech and freedom of

> However, while no one should be compelled to stand, **they should

> Nor should it come without respect.**

Sitting to protest the flag disrespects everyone who has ever fought for
the ideals for which it stands. Sitting to protest ideas which are wrong
just makes you look stupid as well as disrespectful. No one is saying
you don't have the right to do it. We're just saying that doing so is
not without consequence.

And speaking of allowing you to do it, let's talk about the NFL. People
tune in to the NFL because they want to watch ***football***. They tune
in to Monday Night Football (and now Sunday and Thursday) because they
want to be *entertained*. They want to escape from the stresses of the
day and relax watching a non-political sporting match. They really don't
want to see political protests during a football game. Yes, players are
entitled to their free speech, **but there are consequences for every
action you take**. I've taught my kids that since they were very little.
Some consequences are good (get good grades and maybe get to go out for
ice cream), and some are bad (get bad grades and lose screen time). But
there are always consequences for every action. Just because you make
political speech does not shield you from consequences. I know plenty of
people who will no longer watch football because of this nonsense, and I
am included in that bunch. I'll watch *theScore* on my phone and get
score updates over Twitter. I don't need to watch even more political
drama on TV.

The NFL, by allowing these charades to go on *during a football game,*
risks alienating the **very people** who pay the salaries that allow
people like Kaepernick to have the stage to make those protests. In
other words, **the NFL risks losing customers over this**. If they are
more interested in being politically correct than increasing market
share and keeping happy customers, then I am more interested in ***DOING
ANYTHING ELSE BESIDES WASTING BRAIN CELLS WATCHING THEIR SHOW.***
