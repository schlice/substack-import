**Do colds last longer when you have multiple sclerosis?**

No, there is no mechanism in the disease that makes you get sicker or
stay sicker for longer.

However, many of the medications for MS are *immunosuppressants*, which
mean they depress your immune system. If you're on one of these
medicines, you will get colds easier, and it will take you longer to get
over them if you do catch one.

So while MS itself does not make colds last longer, some of the
medications you may take for MS may make a cold last longer.
