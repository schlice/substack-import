**How can my employer force the vaccine on me or fire me? I like my job
and don't have any skills or a degree. I live in Texas and I have worked
there for five years at a senior retirement home.**

Texas is a "right to work" state, and their retaliation laws are weak.
They have anti-retaliation laws for discrimination and for very specific
federal law violations, but they do not have anti-retaliation law
regarding failing to participate in a violation of federal law. While
forcing someone to get a vaccine or face termination would be grounds
for a wrongful termination lawsuit, retaliation for failing to
participate in a violation of federal law is not protected under Texas'
anti-retaliation law.

about strong employee protection states, but Texas is not one of them.

Sorry about that. While it is still possible to sue, since violation of
the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act can carry criminal penalties, it's
unlikely to succeed.
