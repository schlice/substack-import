**How do you get out of an abusive marriage without getting deported if
you are illegal?**

The answer, as with all legal answers, is "it depends."

The only way you could be in the United States and be "illegal" is if
both you and your spouse are illegal aliens. In that case, you run the
risk of being deported at any time, whether you're married or not. If,
however, you were married to a US citizen and you're concerned that
leaving your marriage would ruin your chances of becoming a citizen
through naturalization, that is far more complicated. As long as you had
a bona-fide marriage, leaving the marriage because of domestic abuse
would not be considered evidence that your marriage was fake. So it is
possible, even after leaving your US citizen spouse, to be granted a
green card or to complete the process for citizenship. You'd have to
work with an immigration attorney at that point.

However, all of that aside, ending the abuse should be primary. Your
life may depend on it. If you're in an abusive marriage, *regardless of
your citizenship status*, I highly suggest you get out of it.

So how can you get out of your abusive relationship *and* not involve
law enforcement? There are alternatives. There are local support groups
and groups which assist victims of domestic violence which are NGOs
(non-governmental organizations). These vary depending on where you are
located, so you should first look for an organization near you which
helps victims of domestic violence. They can assist with temporary
housing, food and clothing, job placement assistance, and if needed,
permanent relocation assistance. They can also help connect you with
divorce attorneys who can help you get out of your marriage and ensure
that the appropriate documentation exists to ensure that your
immigration status is not affected.

Whatever you do, please don't stay in an abusive relationship to keep
your immigration status. You can get out, and you can keep your status.

Good luck!
