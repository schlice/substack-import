As a Board member myself for many years in multiple states, I can tell
you that the most successful Board members are there because they care
about the neighborhood. They want the neighborhood to succeed. They want
to ensure the money we pay in dues is actually spent in a responsible
way (i.e. finding the best, most reasonably-priced contractors, staying
on top of repairs, addressing issues as they appear, etc).

In my current neighborhood, we have a fair amount of rental houses. We
maintain contact with the rental agencies that manage those houses, and
we have a good relationship with them. During the intervening periods
when the units are vacant, we watch for issues at the houses. We have
physically intervened in cases such as, for example, a sprinkler line
burst and was shooting water all over the property (but it was vacant at
the time).

There was another time when one of our homeowners was out of town on
vacation and had inadvertently left his garage door open. Using our HOA
contact list, we were able to get in touch with the homeowner on
vacation, and he gave permission to close his garage door, which I did
using the "push the button and run out of the garage" method.

The most effective Board members serve because they are invested in
their neighborhoods and want to see them succeed. Yes, it's absolutely
true that some people who serve on a Board don't understand why the
Board exists, or think of the Board in an inappropriate way (as if the
Board is the "neighborhood police" which it is not). But usually, the
Board is made up of multiple people and usually, not all of them think
that way.

The problem is that while many complain about the HOA, not many will
give of their time to do something about it. This is reflective of
society as a whole, so it's no surprise. Especially now with social
media, many people can very easily complain with very little effort.
