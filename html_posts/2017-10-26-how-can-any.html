The problem you are experiencing is one of ***frame of reference.*** The
reason you have a frame of reference problem is because ***morals are
relative***.

Unless we all hold to the same ultimate moral standard (which we do
not), everyone's morals can be different. We all are not Christian. We
all do not hold to the same ultimate moral authority (for Christians, it
is God). Therefore, if we do not all share the same ultimate moral
authority, morals are relative.

*But if everyone has their own ultimate moral authority, how do we
create civil society?*

The answer is **law**.

In a society of laws, the law becomes the base level of morals to which
everyone must adhere, regardless of their own personal moral standards.
Therefore, what is "civilised" is to *follow the law.*

Therefore, if capital punishment is *legal*, it is therefore *moral.*
Whether or not it is moral for *you* is not relevant. In society, the
only moral standard we can have is the law.
