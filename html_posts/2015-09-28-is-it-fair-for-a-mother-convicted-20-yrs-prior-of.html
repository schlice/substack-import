**Content:** [Let\'s be honest: life isn\'t fair.\
\
You really wouldn\'t want it to be fair, would you? I always tell my
kids this when they observe one child getting something that they
didn\'t get; they tell me, \"that\'s not fair!\" I tell them, \"Well, if
you want everying to be *fair*, I\'d have to punish you when he does
soemthing wrong, you know, just to be *fair.* To be *fair*, everyone has
to have the same outcome.\" The complaints about life being unfair
usually dissipate at that point.\
\
You don\'t really want life to be *fair*. You want life to be *just*.
That means everyone gets exactly what they deserve. And that\'s going to
be different for everyone. Life in the United States is based on this
concept: everyone has an *equal opportunity* to succeed. Not everyone
ends up the same way, but everyone starts out the same way, with the
same opportunities.\
\
For the mother in question, while it is certainly tragic that a mother
felt like she needed a gun to protect her family and she had no other
options than to illegally get one, the simple fact remains that she
illegally obtained a firearm. Is it *fair* that this happened? No,
probably not. But is it *just*? Absolutely. Under the current law, she
got exactly what she deserved.\
\
Some states have rules that allow convicted felons to regain their
rights to gun ownership under certain conditions. Lawyers can also help.
In California, there is a law firm that helps convicted felons regain
firearms rights by, in some cases, getting the felony conviction reduced
to a misdemeanor. In other cases, they can obtain a Governor\'s Pardon,
which will also restore their gun rights. They can also have the
original case expunged, which means the same as \"it never happened.\"\
\
State laws vary, and if you were convicted of a nonviolent felony at a
state level, that is the jurisdiction that takes precedence when the
Federal court looks at whether or not guns can be owned. 18 U.S.C. §§
921(a)(20) and (a)(33)(B)(ii) say that \"\[a\]ny conviction which has
been expunged, or set aside or for which a person has been pardoned or
has had civil rights restored shall not be considered a conviction for
purposes of\" the federal gun ban. To determine whether someone\'s civil
right to own a gun has been restored, federal courts \"look to the law
of the jurisdiction of conviction . . . and consider the jurisdiction\'s
entire body of law.\" *United States v. O\'Neal*, 180 F.3d 115, 119 (4th
Cir.), *cert. denied*, 528 U.S. 980 (1999). So the question of whether
or not you can ever again own a gun depends on where your conviction
took place, and whether or not they ever restore civil rights to felons.
For example, in Colorado, nonviolent felons only lose their gun rights
for 10 years. In North Carolina, however, they *never* restore civil
rights to convicted felons. Even moving to another state, the Feds would
look to the state where you were convicted, and their law, to see if
your civil rights were restored following your conviction.\
\
Contact your local bar association to get a referral to an attorney who
might be able to assist with such an endeavor. They\'ll be able to tell
you if it\'s even possible, and if you have a chance at getting your
civil rights restored.]{.rendered_qtext}
