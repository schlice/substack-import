**Content:** [In the UK, \"revenge porn\" is illegal under the Criminal
Justice and Courts Act 2015, and this would not only be considered
revenge porn, but blackmail. You may consider consulting with a
solicitor to determine what rights you may have. Since he is in Belarus,
you may not be able to do anything about it, but you can try.\
\
Additionally, Facebook has very strict rules regarding this sort of
thing. I would suggest immediately contacting Facebook should he post
something. The photos will be deleted and his account will be removed
from Facebook. Facebook can then take the photo evidence and provide it
to a solicitor seeking it, in order to prove your legal charges.\
\
What he\'s doing is a crime. If he tries to press ahead, he should be
held to account.\
\
Let\'s talk briefly though about what he\'s doing and how he\'s going
about it. He continues to do this because he knows that **he\'s pushing
your buttons.** He\'s getting to you, and you\'re letting it affect you.
I know it does; it\'s traumatic. *But he doesn\'t have to know that it
does.*\
\
The next time he says something like \"If I put this on Facebook, I
wonder how many likes it will get\", say \"I don\'t care; none of my
friends will like it, and you will lose your Facebook account and
possibly end up in jail, so I wouldn\'t post that if I were you. Just
some friendly advice.\" He may perceive that as a challenge and go ahead
with it anyway, in which case he will lose his Facebook account and you
will have the evidence you need to press charges. This will be a hard
thing to do, but you must not give him the feeling of control over you.
He only continues with this because he knows it affects you. You can\'t
let him win.\
\
If he ends up posting the pictures somewhere outside of Facebook (like
on a revenge porn website), you may be out of luck. This is why **you
have to move past the pictures**. First of all, they\'re just pictures.
You may endure some embarrassment. If you haven\'t already told your
fiancé, this is the time to do so. He will understand (in fact, I bet he
would be able to truly appreciate the same photos!). Talk it out with
him, have a good laugh about it, and get past it. If you let it get to
you, the ex wins. You can\'t let him win. This is the only control he
has over you; the only way you can really stop it is to move past the
pictures; don\'t let them affect you.\
\
If you are considering signing a prenuptial agreement with your fiancé,
consider adding a \"social media\" clause to it, with language that says
something like you agree not to share posts or photos that are likely to
harm the other\'s reputation.]{.rendered_qtext}
