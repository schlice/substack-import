**How could public bathrooms be made better?**

Since most folks have talked about cleaning them more, or better, let's
instead talk about design features which could improve usability and
sanitation.

1.  More hands-free devices. The less you have to touch in a public
    bathroom, the better. Hands-free sinks and hands-free soap
    dispensers are a great start.
2.  Get rid of air dryers. This is a less popular design choice, since
    using air dryers reduces trash which must be collected. However, it
    is well known that air dryers actually make bathrooms *less*
    sanitary by spreading germs all over the walls and floor, rather
    than capturing them in paper. Hands-free dispensers and plentiful
    trash cans are helpful.
3.  Doors should swing *outward*. Bathroom doors should swing outward
    rather than inward. Once you've washed your hands, touching a door
    to open it is another contact point where germs can transfer, and
    while I wash my hands well, we all have seen *that guy* or *that
    girl* who does their business and walks out without washing. I don't
    want to touch the door handle after them. Therefore, bathroom doors
    should swing outward, and should not have handles which require
    turning or unlatching in order to get out of the bathroom.
