**Content:** [Thanks for the A2A, but I\'m sorry, I have to agree with
the other posters.\
\
I\'ve had surgery. My quality of life is far better now than it was
before. \"A healthy person\" is a holistic definition, not defined by
the number of surgeries one has.\
\
And where would you rank elective surgery in this measuring? For some,
the nose on their face is the bane of their existence. Getting it
changed drastically improved their self-esteem, and thus their quality
of life. Would you consider them \"more\" or \"less\" healthy overall,
post-surgery?\
\
And your analogy of \"If something breaks and you fix it, it\'s not so
effective as it was before\" is also not true. Have you ever seen wood
glue? It\'s like white glue on steroids. It permanently bonds to the
fibers of the wood, and in actuality, once the glue dries, the glued
area is stronger than the surrounding wood.]{.rendered_qtext}
