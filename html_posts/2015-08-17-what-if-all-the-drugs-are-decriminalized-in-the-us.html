I don\'t think it\'s fair to lump all drugs together. So if we simply
declare \"all drugs\" legal, I think it would be worse. I\'ll explain.

In the world of drugs, there is a very clear distinction: *marijuana*
and *everything else.*

Marijuana pales in comparison to other drugs. At worst, consuming too
much (especially in an edible) can kill you; it\'s near impossible to
smoke enough to kill you. In general, it just makes you mellow and
hungry, which is an entreprenurial avenue for some.

But drugs like meth are life and body-destroying drugs and should be
fought and prevented. It\'s true that people will still do what they
want and if there are people who want the drugs then there will always
be a market, whether or not it is a legal one. But using the
\"prohibition\" logic (we tried to prevent it once and look how well
that went; people will use it anyway) is not a reason to make it legal.
It would be a challenge to control, as people can still cook it up in
their homes if they choose (if they don\'t want to buy the legal stuff,
or if it is too expensive). It\'s hard to control the effects on the
body, or to be able to consume it on a regular basis without any
long-term effects. It\'s not a \"social\" drug like alcohol, where the
body\'s metabolism can render it inert with few long-term side effects.

We have to be careful with legalization because, especially with the
younger set, ***legalization implies social and societal
acceptability***. Many people won\'t do these drugs simply because they
are illegal, and that stigma keeps many who have addictive personalities
and tendencies from actually crossing the line and becoming addicts. The
answer is not \"let them become addicts and we\'ll fix them in
arrears.\" That\'s simply ludicrous. What sort of deficit must we
possess for the sanctity and the worth of human life that we simply
allow people to destroy it, **and** then implicitly tell people that
it\'s acceptable in this society? Government becomes the willing
accomplice in the destruction of human lives and families, simply for
political and fiscal expediency (\"let\'s get rid of this costly \'war
on drugs\'\"). Government can\'t suddenly declare itself uninterested in
the welfare of its citizens. Legalizing all drugs sends that message.

Need a real-life example? Just look at Colorado, the first state in the
country to fully legalize recreational marijuana, and create a real
marketplace for it. The studies are coming out (slowly), but we are
finding that not only is marijuana harmful to kids, but the fact that it
has been recreationally legalized has planted the idea firmly in kids\'
heads that it is safe and accepted. Marijuana oil in an e-cig is rapidly
becoming the drug of choice in high schools across the state, and the
logic behind it is, \"hey, it\'s medicinal, and it\'s legal.\" School
Resource Officers here spend a portion of nearly every day running
confiscated vape oil through THC testing. I don\'t yet have any stats to
show how much they find, but they test every bit of vape oil that they
confiscate. I do know they are fighting a losing battle, as the public
perception of the drug is softening, and kids feed right into that.

Also, we have an ***epidemic*** of 18-25 year old homeless people now in
the state. Many of them came from out of state, believing they\'d be
able to \"smoke pot, and find some work when we get there, to pay for
our pot.\" The \"smoke pot\" goal was easily realized; the \"find work\"
goal was not. Entry-level unskilled labor jobs for that age range are
next to unavailable statewide. So they show up, smoke away what money
they came with, and end up in the (already overcrowded) homeless
shelter, or on the streets, panhandling for drug money, or worse.

Legalizing and controlling some drugs may help to reduce unnecessary
enforcement. And it certainly will reduce the amount of money we spend
prosecuting drug offenses. It\'s the right thing to do to legalize
marijuana. But applying that same formulary to all drugs is simply
wrong-headed.
