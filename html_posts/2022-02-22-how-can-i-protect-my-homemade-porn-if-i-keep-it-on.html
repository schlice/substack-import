It's easy to protect while it is on your phone. The trick is *keeping*
it on your phone.

Apple (whose iPhones are in the hands of just over half of the US
population) obfuscates this in order to make it easy. Basically, the
data on your phone is encrypted any time your phone is secured with a
passcode or Touch ID or Face ID (depending on iPhone). [[You can check

However, the data in your iCloud backup is not encrypted. You can be
hacked and your private homemade porn can be leaked. It has happened
before. Just ask [[all the celebrities whose nudes were leaked after
their iCloud accounts were
hacked.](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=6bb152&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_celebrity_nude_photo_leak){.external_link

In other words, while your iPhone's encryption protects your data while
on your iPhone, data which is synced with iCloud is unencrypted. A hack
of your iCloud account will reveal your photos and videos.

This exercise gets *much clearer and easier on Android devices*,
especially Samsung devices.

Samsung offers *secure folders* which are secured using their Knox
framework. Samsung's phones basically create a *separate operating
system partition* which is secured through the Knox framework. This
partition is only visible to the OS when it has been unlocked. You can
store any data you want in there, but it is only visible when it is on
the phone and decrypted using Knox. When you backup your Samsung phone,
the backup of your Knox partition is a complete data backup,
*fully-encrypted.*

So if you have a recent Samsung device, go into Settings \> Biometrics
and Security \> Secure Folder. If you haven't set up your Secure Folder
yet, tap Start to begin. If you have, you will see Secure Folder
settings.

Once setup is complete, you will have a new app in your App Drawer
called Secure Folder. If you open it, you'll see a whole slew of apps
with a little folder icon with a lock on them---things like Calendar,
Gallery, Camera, Samsung Notes, etc. You can add copies of any other app
to the Secure Folder, just press the "+" icon. The data in the apps
inside the Secure Folder will not be visible outside of the Secure
Folder. By default, the Secure Folder will be locked when you lock your
phone, and you will need to unlock it again before that data will become
visible.
