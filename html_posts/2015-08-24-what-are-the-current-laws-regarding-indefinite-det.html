**Content:** [There is no relevant law surrounding indefinite
detentions. Case law is being created as legal challenges to the
detentions in Guantanamo are being heard by the courts.\
\
The law is tough because the accused are not US citizens, and they are
not being held in the United States. They don\'t fall under the
(complete) Geneva Convention because they are not fighting for a nation
that is a signatory to the Convention, nor are they fighters for a
nation, in uniform, under a state flag. There are some provisions that
apply (such as the treatment of prisoners of war), but most provisions
of the Geneva Convention do not apply to terrorists.]{.rendered_qtext}
