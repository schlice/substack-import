**Content:** [To answer the Constitutional question, no. There is
nothing you can add to an amendment that would make it unable to be
repealed or overridden by a later amendment.\
\
To answer the moon question, only the United States is bound by the
Constitution, no one else amongst \"mankind\" is bound by it. So adding
an amendment saying \"The moon belongs to all mankind\" only binds
Americans, not the rest of the world.\
\
The moon belongs to all mankind through international treaty, not the
Constitution. It\'s up to each individual member country to uphold that
treaty. Antarctica is treated the same way as the moon, although it\'s
much easier for a nation to get to Antarctica than to get to the
moon.]{.rendered_qtext}
