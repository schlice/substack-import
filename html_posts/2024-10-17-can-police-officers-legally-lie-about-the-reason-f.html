Yes.

Police officers can lie about virtually anything. They can lie to you
when they are conversing with you. They can lie to you when they
question you. They can lie to you when they identify the reason they
stopped you. They can lie to other non-involved citizens.

There are virtually no restrictions on when an officer cannot lie to
you, **with one exception.**

When they are **under oath**, their statements must be truthful. This
could be while filling out official documentation, or when they are
testifying in court. When it comes time to explain an arrest to the
judge, or to give other testimony under oath, their statements must be
truthful.

Officers can be less than truthful for a variety of reasons. They can
use deception tactics in interrogations to gain information, so long as
it doesn't violate other laws, like laws against entrapment. They also
cannot fabricate evidence or coerce a confession through extreme
tactics, as there are separate laws about that which would render those
confessions invalid.
