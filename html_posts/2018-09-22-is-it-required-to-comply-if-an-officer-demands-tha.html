**Is it required to comply if an officer demands that you step out of
your car at a traffic stop? What is the purpose of this command?**

The answer is yes; if an officer demands you exit the vehicle, you must
comply. If you fail to comply, you may find you end up with a shattered
driver's side window, a cut seat belt and various bruises from being
dragged out of your vehicle, but if you have to be dragged out of your
vehicle, you're going to jail, not just getting a ticket and going on
about your way.

The purpose, clearly, is not necessary to articulate. It could be
because you're acting cagey. It could be because you appear to be acting
unsafely. It could be because the officer thinks you may have been
drinking and wants to test you. It could be because he thinks you may be
a flight risk and it's safer to just take you out of the car. It could
be for *any reason at all*, but courts have clearly stated that the
police have the right to remove you from your vehicle at any time for
any reason at a traffic stop.
