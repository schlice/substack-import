**Do Republican senators have any solid evidence for believing Kavanaugh
neither sexually assaulted women nor lied, or are they determined to
vote for his appointment simply to get another conservative voice on the
Supreme Court?**

You can't prove a negative. Therefore, you will never have "solid
evidence" that Kavanaugh didn't do something.

You can only prove a positive. You can prove that Kavanaugh did
something, with evidence.

The FBI, the US Congress, and every news agency in the country has
literally been scouring under every rock and shrub looking for *any*
piece of evidence to show that Kavanaugh did anything which one person
alleged he did.

After **seven background investigations** and countless people
searching, *not one shred of corroborating evidence has been found.*

*While it's possible that he could have done it and managed to elude
notice by anyone, its just not likely.*

So on balance, is it right to destroy someone's life and to deny a
Presidential nomination simply because of one, unsubstantiated,
uncorroborated allegation?
