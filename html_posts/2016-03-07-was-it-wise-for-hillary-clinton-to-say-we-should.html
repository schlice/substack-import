The statement you quoted, on its face, wasn\'t very controversial. I
think we can all agree that we need to do a better job of identifying
those who are mentally unstable and getting them help.

The ***problems*** with her statements come **after**. She proposed
closing the \"gun show loophole\" which does not exist. She proposed
closing the \"Charleston loophole\" which says that if your background
check does not return an answer after three days you can purchase your
firearm, which is not what happened in Charleston either, and is still
not a cause for unhinged people going on shooting rampages.

She then claimed that the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act
(PLCAA) prevents people from suing gun manufacturers, ever. She called
it \"blanket immunity,\" and this is an incorrect characterization of
the law. She claims that PLCAA prevents people from suing gun
manufacturers to make their products \"safer.\" This is patently false,
and totally absurd.

Guns are very safe tools to operate. Very rarely do you hear of someone
being injured when they properly use the gun.

It\'s easy to confuse \"Safer for the operator\" with \"Safer for the
person at the business end of the gun\" when you fail to realize that
guns are actually designed to kill. If they do kill, the gun is working
properly. If the operator was uninjured, the gun is also operating
safely.

And under PLCAA, if a gun is unsafe to operate, the manufacturer can
still be sued.

The purpose of PLCAA was to prevent the Left\'s tactic of trying to sue
gun manufacturers into oblivion because their products killed people. If
their products are unsafe, you can still sue them. And if you want to
pressure a manufacturer to make a \"safer\" handgun (whatever that
means), you don\'t do that through the courts. You do it through your
purse or wallet. You buy the safer one, you ignore the unsafe one.
That\'s how free markets work.

You don\'t see people trying to sue Ford when a drunk driver kills a
family. You don\'t see people telling Ford they need to make a \"safer\"
car.

But this is exactly what Clinton wants to do. She wants to repeal PLCAA
so that gun violence victims\' families can transfer the liability from
the shooter to the manufacturer, something that is unprecedented in
history.

Don\'t let her rhetoric fool you.

In fact, Bernie Sanders actually had it right:

> If that is the point, I have to tell you I disagree. I disagree

> But if they are selling a product to a person who buys it legally,

While Bernie and I agree on very little, on this point we totally agree.
