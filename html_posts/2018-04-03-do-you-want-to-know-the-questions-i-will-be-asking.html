**Do you want to know the questions I will be asking my neurologist
about my relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis?**

Question details:

> I have an MRI this month and will be asking follow-up questions about
> my results as well as questions around whether or not I should have a
> second child due to my current status and what my life will look like
> with 2 children while being a victim of MS.

So there's two questions in there:

- whether or not I should have a second child due to my current status
- what my life will look like with 2 children while being a victim of
  MS.

With regard to your first question, I advise women not to change their
life goals due to MS. So in general, I tell women to go ahead and get
pregnant. It will be the most MS-free nine months you will experience.
In general, MS symptoms disappear during pregnancy. We know that there
is a hormonal component to MS, and we know that during pregnancy,
hormonal changes tend to suppress MS disease activity. We *also* know
that once you have your baby, those protections tend to fall off, and
you'll likely experience a relapse. But beyond the fact that you'll be
symptom-free during your pregnancy, and you're likely to experience a
relapse after your baby is born, you can get pregnant and have a normal
baby.

If you're worried about whether or not your baby will have MS, it is
true that having a first-degree relative with MS increases their risk of
developing the disease. The average person in the United States has
about one in 750 (.1%) chance of developing MS. For first-degree
relatives of a person with MS, such as children, siblings or
non-identical twins, the risk rises to approximately 2.5-5% (between one
in 40 and one in 20). We do know that it's not all genetic though.
Location of childhood makes a difference. There is a higher prevalence
of MS development in children who live above 40 degrees latitude before
they turn 15. Girls develop MS two to three times as frequently as boys.
Some recent studies have shown that the ratio may be closer to four
times as frequent. Also, exposure to an as-of-yet unidentified viral
trigger starts the disease process. [\[1\]](#vrgQA){#cite-vrgQA
.citation_link}Whether or not you want your children to incur that risk
is up to you, but there are so many unknowns that it's illogical to base
your decision solely on the fact that you have MS. Ultimately though,
it's up to you.

To your second question, you will have to make allowances for your
disease. MS is life-*changing*, not life-*ending*. Modern medications
have made lifespans of people with MS nearly match lifespans of people
without the disease. That said, you will have to work around the
disease. You may get more tired more quickly, so you may have to be more
conscious about pacing yourself. You can't allow your kids to run you
ragged. If you're thinking about breastfeeding, you will have to work
closely with your neurologist regarding your MS medication and therapy.
So beyond a few extra decisions you have to make about what you do
during the day, your life will pretty much be the same as it would have
been had you not developed MS.

Hopefully, some of this helped you. Make sure you ask your neurologist
all of these questions as well, and work closely with him or her on your
treatment plan and any lifestyle modifications you may need to make.
Keep asking questions; knowledge is power!
