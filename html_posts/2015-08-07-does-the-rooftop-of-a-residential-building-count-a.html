**Content:** [I\'m going to piggyback on [[Christopher
Hawk](https://www.quora.com/profile/Christopher-Hawk)]{.qlink_container}\'s
answer and say that whether the building is open-access or not, the
police can usually enforce laws there.\
\
If the building is privately owned, a tenant or the owner can lodge a
complaint with the police that the law is being violated and the police
can investigate and issue citations. If the building is on public land,
anyone can lodge a complaint and the police will investigate.\
\
There are a few places in a few states that police will not enforce
laws, but they are very few. Police normally have jurisdiction anywhere
within their area of responsibility (AOR).]{.rendered_qtext}
