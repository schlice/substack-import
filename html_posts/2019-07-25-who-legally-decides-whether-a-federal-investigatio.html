**Who legally decides whether a federal investigation is legitimate or a
\'witch hunt\'?**

Realize you're attempting to apply legal logic to a judicial proceeding,
and you can't do that. But it's an interesting thought experiment, so
let's look at it.

Since a "witch hunt" isn't a legal term, no one legally decides whether
or not an investigation is a "witch hunt."

However, a judge can easily determine if an investigation is legitimate
by determining whether or not evidence exists to allow the investigation
to move forward.

To that end, had this case gone before a judge as a legal matter, would
it have been deemed "legitimate?"

Initially, the investigation centered on whether or not the Trump
campaign "colluded" with Russia to steal the 2016 campaign. Since
"collusion" is not a crime, a judge would have found that there was no
prosecutable offense to be investigated, and so the investigation itself
would not have been legitimate.

Again, as I initially stated, this is not a legal matter. These
investigations are judicial matters, not legal ones.
