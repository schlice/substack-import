**What do I do if a tenant abandons the property?**

(US answer only)

When a tenant leaves the property and the landlord believes the tenant
will not return, the law says that the tenant has abandoned the rental.

Normally, the rental agreement states that if the tenant is going to be
absent from the property for more than two weeks, notice must be given,
otherwise the landlord may consider the property abandoned. As is true
of all things in the US, states have varying rules to determine when a
landlord can presume that a tenant has abandoned the property. But
without presumption of abandonment, or if the landlord is at all unsure
about whether or not the tenant has abandoned the property, the landlord
should go through the legal process to declare the unit abandoned if the
rent has not been paid and the tenant still has possessions in the unit.
Some ways to determine whether or not the unit has intentionally been
abandoned:

> - Did the neighbors see them move?
> - Are the utilities shut off?
> - Did the tenant put in a change of address at the post office?
> - Is there any significant furniture left?
> - If you have access, are there sheets on the beds?
>
> In some cases, the tenant has been arrested or is in the hospital,
> which would explain why he hasn't been around. Or, maybe the tenant
> has moved, but left behind some furniture to pick up later on. **Even
> if the tenant is not sleeping there, they are still "in possession" if
> they have their personal belongings in the unit and have not shown an
> intent to abandon these items.**[\[1\]](#gKxRO){#cite-gKxRO

If the tenant left property behind, the property is considered
"abandoned property." States have [[different
rules](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=950624&url=https://www.thebalancesmb.com/how-long-does-a-landlord-have-to-keep-a-tenant-s-property-4588407){.external_link

landlord must hold abandoned property, but after that period of time has
elapsed, the landlord has the right to keep, sell, donate, or dispose of
the property. The landlord must attempt to contact the tenant and
provide notice of the abandoned property, but then after the mandated
period of time has elapsed, the property can be sold, donated, or
discarded. If the landlord has gone through the legal process of
declaring the unit abandoned, the attempt to contact the tenant will
have already taken place.
