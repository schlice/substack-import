Why do some people believe in the existence of love despite never having
seen it? Is it possible to accept that love does not exist?

Seriously. What is love? Is it a chemical? Is it DNA? Can you run a
scientific experiment to test for the presence of love? What is the
chemical composition of love?

So clearly, there are things which exist that all of us would be very
rational to believe in, despite the fact that we cannot see them.
