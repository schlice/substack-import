Absolutely! Repent and believe, even Catholics do this.

However, they miss the mark when they focus too heavily on "eating the
bread" and "drinking the cup." They can certainly perform those rituals,
but the thought that eating the bread and drinking the cup is what saves
you is decidedly unbiblical, regardless of how Catholics twist
themselves into a pretzel to try to justify it, even in light of the
definitive exegetical evidence against it. No disrespect to my Catholic
brethren, but growing up Catholic gives me a pretty unique perspective.

Additionally, holding that the Magisterium and Church Traditions are
sources of God's word is also decidedly unbiblical, with similar
exegetical evidence against it.

So Catholics can indeed have saving faith, so long as they don't focus
on the trappings of the church to have it.
