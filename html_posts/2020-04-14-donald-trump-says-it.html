**Donald Trump says it's his call to reopen the country. Does the
constitution say otherwise?**

Well yes, but not in the way you might think.

The Constitution tells the various branches of government what they are
allowed to do. This is a very limited set of things. The Constitution
isn't very long. For hundreds of years, government has tried to grow
outside of that boundary, but it finds itself constrained by the
Constitution.

So it's not that the Constitution "says otherwise." It's more that the
Constitution doesn't say so. And if the Constitution doesn't grant the
authority to any branch of Federal government, the authority belongs to
the states.

Trump is using that specific language not because he thinks he actually
is king of the US, but because he is trying to put a very fine point on
the fact that he wants to be the one to influence the states when they
should start allowing businesses to re-open. He and his science team
have set themselves in the position to provide the bulk of the technical
understanding of the virus and its current impact. He also wants to be
the one to say that it's time to start letting people get back to work,
but he knows that the authority to allow businesses to re-open and
people to go back to work lies in the states.

But he also knows that **the people carry great sway in influencing
their state governments**. And if the people start to hear that Trump
says we should go back to work but state governors are not allowing
businesses to re-open, people will riot.

So ultimately, while Trump only holds advisory authority over the
states, not actual Constitutional directional authority, he holds great
sway over the minds of the people, and he will wield that to force the
states to comply lest they face backlash, not only now, but in November.
And you can rest assured that any challenger to an incumbent in November
will use any failure to re-open their economy as a hammer come election
time.
