Activities? That depends on your specific MS and what your symptoms are.

Most people with MS are adversely affected by heat. So if you happen to
live in a hot climate (like me), you must be very careful to not allow
yourself to overheat. On those days, frequent breaks in the shade or in
a cool location (perhaps with air conditioning) will be required.

But because MS is so variable, what you are able to do and for how long
will also vary. Listen to your body and don't push yourself.

Enjoy your life, but maintain sensible limits.
