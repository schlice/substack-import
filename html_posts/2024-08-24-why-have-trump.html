Because honestly, crowds at the convention don't determine who is going
to win the White House. It doesn't determine which candidate has more
energy. It doesn't determine who has more support. It doesn't determine
which party has more support for their platform.

The convention is not a microcosm of the nation. Crowd sizes don't tell
us anything substantive.

And by the end of the evening (these speakers go until the wee hours of
the morning), people are tired. They want to leave. Only the hardcore
followers will stick around, along with the family members of the
speakers, and RNC staffers.
