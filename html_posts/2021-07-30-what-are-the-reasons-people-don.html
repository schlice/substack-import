There are a variety of reasons someone would choose to not be
vaccinated. There are religious objections to vaccines. There are health
reasons which might make vaccinations dangerous to the person taking it.
And of course, there are those people who just don't trust the
government.

In addition, this vaccine is not approved by the FDA. It has not gone
through rigorous testing, and we don't know if there are any long-term
effects from taking it.

Ultimately, objections to vaccination are no different than any other
vaccine ever.

However, my understanding of **freedom** includes a belief that society
should allow adults to make consequential decisions about their lives,
which includes the decision to forgo a vaccine which might preserve
their own life.

This decision should have no impact on your life. If you're vaccinated,
don't worry, you won't get COVID, despite the fear mongering of the
legacy media and the public health establishment. Breakthrough
infections are exceedingly rare for the vast majority of us, and if they
do happen, they would be mild anyway. The unvaccinated don't care, and
I'd refer you back to the previous paragraph.
