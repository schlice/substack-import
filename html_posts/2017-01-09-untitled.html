*That such outrages are contained (for the time being, and forseeable
future) to a given region, or that there is little support for them
beyond those regions is not really the point. What is the point is that
within these regions (allegedly protected by that same Constitution, to
little discernable effect), through popular, duly enacted acts of
democratic legislation, the meaningful exercise of a substantial,
fundamental right is effectively suppressed.*

Actually, that *is* the point. We're talking about repeal of the Second
Amendment, not local repression of rights. Local laws will remain until
someone challenges the constitutionality, and such a challenge makes it
all the way to SCOTUS assuming they actually deign to look at it. Don't
say that this is hopeless, because it happened twice in recent times,
and to great effect: *Heller v. District of Columbia* and *McDonald v.
Chicago* have both overturned repressive local ordinances. Now, we need
more test cases in places like New York and California to challenge
their laws on the grounds laid by those two cases.

Nevertheless, to your point, we were talking about repeal of the Second
Amendment, not local issues. Repeal of the Second Amendment would
require a plurality of states and a supermajority in Congress, and there
just isn't that kind of support out there.

*If one takes the position that fundamental rights are entirely subject
to duly enacted democratic process, then all bets are off, and we're
always a majority vote and pariamentary \[sic\] procedure away from any
conceivable outrage.*

Fundamental rights are not subject to laws. However, the democratic
position is that rights can be managed, controlled, and regulated. You
should know by now the classic example: you can't shout "Fire!" in a
crowded theater and then claim that your right to free speech is
absolute. This example shows that rights are not absolute, because for
every right, there is a requisite responsibility. We have the
responsibility to exercise our rights prudently, and with the safety of
our fellows in mind. This is exactly the purpose of law: to ensure that
your free exercise of rights does not impinge on others' free exercise
of rights, and vice versa.
