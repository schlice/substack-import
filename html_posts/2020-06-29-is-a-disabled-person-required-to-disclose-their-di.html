**Is a disabled person required to disclose their disability in public
or place of business to be exempt from mask mandates?**

Short answer: **yes**, in limited circumstances.

Longer answer: For businesses and government agencies dealing with
disabled persons who cannot wear masks, this means allowing for a
***modification*** to the mask policy to accommodate the disabled
person. Depending on the specific disability, this might mean:

- allowing a person to wear a scarf, loose face covering, or full face
  shield instead of a face mask
- allowing customers to order online with curbside pick-up or no contact
  delivery
- allowing customers to order by phone with curb-side pick-up or no
  contact delivery
- allowing a person to wait in a car for an appointment and enter the
  building when called or texted, or
- offering appointments by telephone or video calls.

There are also reasons why a business would not be able to modify their
policies:

- If the modification fundamentally altered the original service. In
  other words, if the change to accommodate the disabled individual is
  so severe that the original program, service, or activity is no longer
  the same
- If the modification would pose an undue financial or administrative
  burden on the business or agency
- If the modification posed a direct threat to the health or safety of
  others. Note that this must be a direct threat, not the potential of a
  threat. In other words, if the person who could not wear a mask was
  confirmed to be COVID-19 positive, this would be a direct threat,
  whereas the simple fact that they could not wear a mask without the
  positive COVID-19 diagnosis would not be a direct threat.

The DOJ says that there are three possible ways for a business to
address an identified disability which requires the business to change
its policy:

> 1.  Agree to the request.
> 2.  Ask for medical documentation about the person's disability that
>     is necessary to:
>     1.  Verify that the individual meets the ADA definition of
>         disability (i.e., has a physical or mental impairment that
>         substantially limits one or more major life activities); or
>     2.  Describe the needed modification; or
>     3.  Show the relationship between the individual\'s disability and
>         the need for the requested modification.\
>         \
>         It is important to remember that **if a person's disability is
>         obvious, information about the disability should not be
>         requested** unless it is necessary to evaluate the
>         disability-related need for the modification. In most cases,
>         an individual\'s medical records or detailed information about
>         the nature of an individual\'s disability are not necessary
>         for this inquiry.
> 3.  Deny the request. If a request for modification is denied, a state
>     or local government agency must provide a written statement as to
>     why the request was denied. Private businesses are also encouraged
>     to document the reason for denying a request for reasonable
>     modification, provide a copy to the person with a disability, and
>     keep a copy on file.[\[1\]](#aTeaG){#cite-aTeaG .citation_link}

So as you can see, only if a business needs to understand the disability
better so that they can show the relationship between the individual's
disability and the need for the requested modification will they
actually ask for information about the disability, and only while
attempting to provide an accommodation for that disability.
