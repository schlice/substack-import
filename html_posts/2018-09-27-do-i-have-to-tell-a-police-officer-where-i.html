**If stopped by a law enforcement officer, are you required to tell them
where you are going or where you\'ve been?**

In the United States, you are not required to converse with the officer
about anything other than the reason for which you were stopped, which
is your driving behavior.

You are required to give your real name. You are required to present
your driver's license and other secondary information (registration,
proof of insurance) if they are required in your state.

Beyond that, you are under no obligation to try to explain your driving
behavior. You can let the officer's perception of your behavior stand
without explanation, and you can accept your ticket and move on.
