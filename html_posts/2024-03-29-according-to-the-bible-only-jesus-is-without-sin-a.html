You have a few inaccuracies in here which are causing your confusion.

1\. You said that because only Jesus was without sin, it implies that
humanity is "inherently flawed." **But this is incorrect.**

Humanity was created with the *potential* to sin. This potential, which
God absolutely adores and promotes and protects, is called **free
will**. Free will, if we are truly free, means that we have the *free
choice* to pursue good or evil, with zero consequences in this life.

So in this life, I can choose to *kiss* a puppy or *kill* a puppy, and
my life continues on without interruption (human consequences
notwithstanding). God allows me to choose good or to choose evil. He
desires for us to choose good, but He allows us to choose evil, because
that is the very nature of free will.

2\. God does not condemn anyone to hell, not even the flawed. **People
choose hell on their own.**

Those who make a conscious decision to reject God will be eternally
separated from Him, which is a torment beyond any I can think of. As in
point 1, those who choose evil choose hell as well. That's their choice.
Their free will separates them from God.
