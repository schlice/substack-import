**Why hasn't Admiral McRaven face charges related to the purge of the
bin Laden death photos in violation of FOIA requirement to retain
them?**

*Amazing. Every word of what you just said...was wrong.*

Thanks for the A2A. Just to clarify and consolidate what everyone has
already said:

- There was no FOIA violation as the photos were classified.
- FOIA does not impose storage or retention requirements for
  information; it provides requirements for how to disseminate data upon
  formal request, exemptions to the FOIA requirements, and provides for
  certain types of information to be automatically released without a
  request being issued.
- There was no "purge" of OBL's photos. There was only a reminder on how
  to handle classified information.
