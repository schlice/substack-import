I still fail to understand how this is a technology problem. It's not,
it's a people problem. This is a problem of human nature. It is not a
problem which can be solved with technology.

I assume you're trying to say that we should dampen the inside of
vehicles so that they cannot send or receive data or cellular signals.

But that begs several questions:

- What about emergencies?
- What about passengers?
