**My two-and-a-half year-old daughter won\'t potty train at all. What
should I do as she is getting frequent rashes from the diapers?**

At home, put her in underwear. On the road, put her in pull-ups.

Tell her that it's time (make a big deal of it) and that she gets to
wear big girl underwear.

She will wet them. Be prepared for that. But it will be far less
comfortable than wetting a diaper or pull-ups.

The whole idea behind pull-ups was that you could feel the urine inside
of them, unlike a diaper that "locks it away." That way, they could feel
the point at which they go and at which they start to feel
uncomfortable. With underwear, she won't like the feel of wet clothes,
and she'll prevent that (eventually) by using the bathroom before she
wets them.

Important point: don't shame her or be angry at her when she wets her
underwear. Just work with it---help her change into dry clothes,
extolling the virtues of how good it feels to be in dry clothes and
saying how uncomfortable it must have felt inside those wet clothes.

And take heart --- there aren't any 8 year olds still wearing diapers
because they never learned. It will come, and all kids get there at
different times.
