> *Who owns the parking space in front of shops and houses legally?*

**Whoever owns the street or the parking lot.**

If the spaces are on a city owned and managed street, the city owns the
spaces. If a business association owns and maintains the street, the
spaces are owned and managed by the business association. If the spaces
are in a parking lot, it is the owner of the parking lot who owns the
spaces.

The picture you posted does not make clear who owns the "street"
pictured. It could either belong to the city, or it could belong to the
business association which owns the buildings.

Regardless, the owner of the land under the car also owns the spaces.
