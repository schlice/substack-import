I feel particularly able to answer this question.

My disability doesn't directly impact my legs. It impacts my **energy**.
[[MS
Lassitude](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=b1325a&url=https://www.nationalmssociety.org/understanding-ms/what-is-ms/ms-symptoms/fatigue){.external_link

onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="nationalmssociety.org"}]{.qlink_container} is a real issue
for people with MS.

Even walking through a hot parking lot can sap my energy on a bad day.
The difference between parking in the back of the lot and parking in the
front of the lot may make the difference between whether or not I get to
spend that evening with my family or spend that evening in bed. Most
times when this happens I don't even make it to bed; I fall asleep on
the couch right after dinner.

So no, my disability does not **directly** impact my legs. And if you
see me park in a handicapped spot and get out of my car, your first
thought might be, "Well, that guy looks perfectly healthy, why the heck
did he park there?"

Now you know.

Beware of **hidden disabilities**, and don't judge people before you are
fully informed.
