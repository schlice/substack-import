**Is it true that you don't have to show a cop your ID when they request
it at a routine check point?**

Depends on the kind of checkpoint.

If you are driving a car, in the United States, you are required to have
your driver's license in your possession (this is not always true in
other countries, but it is in the US). You are required to present it to
law enforcement upon demand. It doesn't matter what that officer is
doing, or where he is. If you are the operator of a vehicle, and an
officer demands to see your license, you are required by law to present
it. Period, full stop.

If it's a walking checkpoint, you are not driving a car, so you are not
required to possess or show any identification. We don't have "papers"
that can be demanded at any time anywhere.

The only documentation required of you is your license *when you are
driving a car.*
