Absolutely.

The opinion strengthens the First Amendment and provides that not only
are we free to speak, we are free to *not* speak. In other words, not
only can the government not prohibit our speech, but now it is clear
that the government may not *compel* us to speak.

That's what the ruling stated. The First Amendment prohibits the state
from using its anti-discrimination laws from compelling a business to
speak a state-approved message with which the business owner disagrees.

And that's it. Like most rulings, and despite the shrieking cries of the
liberals, the decision is not a license to discriminate. \"Consistent
with the First Amendment, the Nation's answer is tolerance, not
coercion,\" Justice Gorsuch wrote in the majority opinion. \"The First
Amendment envisions the United States as a rich and complex place where
all persons are free to think and speak as they wish, not as the
government demands.\"
