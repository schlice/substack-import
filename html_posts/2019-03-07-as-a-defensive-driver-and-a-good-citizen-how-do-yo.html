**As a defensive driver and a good citizen, how do you respond when
someone is tailgating you when you are going the speed limit in the
right-most lane, in a city where such tailgating is commonplace?**

You have several choices, but the most recommended ones:

1.  Slow down and create a larger gap in front of your car than you
    normally would (between you and the car in front of you). This will
    allow you to slow down more gradually if you have to stop suddenly,
    thus hopefully preventing a rear-end collision. And also, since
    you'll now be going slower than the speed limit, you may convince
    your tailgater to go tailgate someone else.
2.  Move to another lane.
