<h2>Answer Comment</h2>

**Content:** [My original answer covered that. It is not the child that
validates the marriage. And I think that all of us would consider
fertility tests before marriage far too much government intrusion. So
the state does the next best thing: it offers marriage to the
combination of human beings which can mate, and thus procreate; ability
to actually do so is secondary.\
\
Let me turn it around: what if an otherwise healthy married couple chose
not to have kids? Should their license be revoked? I don\'t think
so.]{.rendered_qtext}
