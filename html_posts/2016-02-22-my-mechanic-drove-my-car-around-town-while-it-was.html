When you drop your car off at the shop, you expect them to repair it and
then take it for a test drive, so some driving of your vehicle to verify
the fixes is expected.

The question is reasonableness.

Was the amount of mileage driven \"reasonable\" to verify the repairs
performed? Was extra driving required to verify the repairs? The shop
owner will likely be able to justify his use of the vehicle in testing
his repairs, but it\'s not up to him or you, it\'s up to the court to
determine what is \"reasonable.\"

I would suggest following [[Nick
Bauer](https://www.quora.com/profile/Nick-Bauer-10)]{.qlink_container}\'s
advice and start by talking to the shop owner. Do not be accusatory in
your tone. Show the shop owner the toll receipts, discuss the amount
that the vehicle was driven and explain that you don\'t think it was
reasonable. If the shop owner agrees with you, you might be able to
persuade him to chip in on the cost of your rental car.

If you are not satisfied after talking to the shop owner, you are
certainly within your rights to sue the shop and request reimbursement
of your rental car. Depending on how much money you are talking about,
this could be handled in small-claims court, without lawyers. But if we
are talking larger sums of money, you may need an attorney to assist you
with filing your lawsuit.
