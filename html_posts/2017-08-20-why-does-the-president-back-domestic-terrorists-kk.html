Let's be absolutely clear.

The president backs the rights of *all* Americans to exercise their
Constitutional rights. KKK, BLM, white supremacists, Antifa, whoever.
They all have a Constitutional right to express their opinions, however
flawed they may be. Of course, the media heard this and went completely
apoplectic, which is only because they failed history, or slept through
it. I think that's a pre-requisite to becoming a journalist these days.

That said, the president **does not support their ideas**. He said so
vociferously, and repeatedly, in the days following the Charlottesville
incident.

You can actually support a group's right to speak, while simultaneously
denouncing **the content of their speech**.

The media would do well to learn that lesson. Ah, but alas, that lesson
doesn't make money. And since the media is primarily there to make
money, doing so will generally tend to skew the news they present.

I think I've typed Evenlyn Beatrice Hall's quote so many times over the
last few weeks that it's going to get burned into my screen, but here it
is again. She was actually discussing Voltaire and the kind of person he
was, which is why this quote is sometimes incorrectly attributed to
Voltaire. Interestingly, this *used* to be the position of the Democrats
and liberals (i.e. Kennedy liberals), but nowadays with Progressives
taking over the Democrat party, it is increasingly becoming untrue.
Nevertheless, Hall's quote, with which I and the President fully concur:

> I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your
> right to say it.
