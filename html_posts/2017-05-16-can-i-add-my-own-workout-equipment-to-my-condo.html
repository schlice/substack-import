Generally, the answer would be no. The reason: liability.

If your HOA wants to work with you, they might draft up an agreement
which would include some release of liability for anyone who uses it
(that way you can't be sued if it breaks and injures someone). You would
also have to release them from liability if the equipment gets stolen or
broken, and you would be 100% responsible for that.

But generally, because there is such risk to both you and them in terms
of liability, it's not likely that they would allow you to put your own
equipment in the common area.

But talk to them about it. As I've often said, it's not my HOA. Feel
free to ask them and see what they would be willing to work out with
you.
