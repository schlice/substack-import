**Why do so many conservatives believe that Joe Biden should be
impeached?**

I think you and I may have drastically different definitions of "so
many, " but since you didn't specify an actual percentage (or any
sources to back up your claim), I'll take it on face value.

The real reason why "so many" Conservatives believe that Joe Biden
should be impeached:

**They are applying the new Trump impeachment standard:**

***If a President can be impeached for perfectly legal First
Amendment-protected speech, then any Federal official, past or present,
can be impeached for any speech that one political group dislikes.***

That's right, you heard it here: Trump's speech was **absolutely**
**protected by the First Amendment.** Not even sketchy, not even
possibly illegal, **absolutely, 100% First Amendment-protected speech.**

How do I know this with such certainty? Apply the Brandenburg test for
incitement speech. The Brandenburg test was developed in *Brandenburg v.
Ohio* in 1969, and it is used to determine when inflammatory speech
calling for illegal action can be restricted. The Brandenburg test says
that speech can be restricted if:

1.  the speech is "directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless
    action," AND
2.  the speech is "likely to incite or produce such action."

BOTH elements are required. The imminence test was exemplified in
another case which used the Brandenburg test: *Hess v. Indiana* in 1973.
The court concluded that Hess' speech, while laced with vulgarities, did
not specify a time for lawless action. The Court concluded that the
speech "amounted to nothing more than advocacy of illegal action at some
indefinite future time."

In order to qualify as inciting, it must produce *imminent* *lawless*
action. Trump did not even suggest to his listeners that they engage in
lawless action, even if it was imminent. *Even if he knew that lawless
action would ensue from his speech, it doesn't make his speech inciting
because he didn't actually suggest committing lawless action.* So
Trump's speech was, therefore, Constitutionally protected. Another
Brandenburg test case said that fiery speech is also not
unconstitutional. In *NAACP v. Claiborne Hardware* in 1982, the Court
discussed why fiery rhetoric is not unlawful:

> *Strong and effective extemporaneous rhetoric cannot be nicely
> channeled in purely dulcet phrases. An advocate must be free to
> stimulate his audience with spontaneous and emotional appeals for
> unity and action in a common cause. When such appeals do not incite
> lawless action, they must be regarded as protected speech.*

Nevertheless, the House voted to impeach him because they did not like
the quality of his fiery rhetoric, completely ignoring *Claiborne* and
engaging in conduct which is completely unconstitutional.

So if we follow this new logic, we can say that any speech that Biden
has made that we disagree with is impeachable. We've set a new,
unconstitutionally-low bar for impeachment, and more worryingly, **we
are undermining the very core of the First Amendment: being able to
speak out against the government.** Where does it end? If your speech
incites people to march on Washington (even if you told them to do so
"peacefully and patriotically") and it turns into a riot, can you be
held responsible? Under the Trump rule, you can. Who's going to speak
out against the government now?

And with this new low bar in place, what's to say that the House can't
impeach a *former* office holder? Can the House impeach Nikki Haley for
speeches she gave at the UN? Can the House impeach Hillary Clinton for
actions she took as Secretary of State? Under the new Trump impeachment
principles, *in theory,* ***yes we can***.

And if we can try former office holders (who are now civilians) in
Congress instead of in the courts, what's to say that you or I can't be
tried in the Senate if we've ever had government affiliation? I was an
HOA president (and a current VP in a new neighborhood). Our Governing
Documents are filed with the county. Couldn't that be interpreted to
mean I am a government official? Could I be tried in the Senate? Under
the new rules (where civilians can be tried in the Senate because they
are former office holders), yes. Bills of Attainder be damned.

Thank you, Congressional Democrats, for denigrating the very principles
of the Constitution, and ignoring them for your own perceived political
gain. As usual, it is only the nation, and the Constitution, that
suffers.
