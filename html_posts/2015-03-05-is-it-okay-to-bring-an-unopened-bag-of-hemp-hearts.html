**Content:** [No, unless the seeds have been sterilized. Unsterilized
hemp seeds are a Schedule 1 controlled substance and cannot enter the
U.S. without the appropriate DEA paperwork.\
\
For any other hemp products, if the hemp still contains THC and can
cause THC to enter the body, it cannot enter the U.S.]{.rendered_qtext}
