**Does a person with a \"Do Not Resuscitate\" order have a right to sue
if EMTs save their life after a car accident?**

First of all, there is never a situation in which you do not have a
right to sue, unless you entered into a contract with an arbitration
clause in which you pledged that you would not sue.

Secondly, you can sue anyone for anything, that's not the question. The
question is how likely you would be to prevail.

In general, DNR orders apply to hospitals, where the order can be
confirmed with relatives and kept on file. They generally do not apply
to emergency responders, as they would usually not have a method of
determining the validity, or even the presence of, a DNR order. And for
the vast majority of people treated by EMTs, you wouldn't want them
wasting their time trying to find out if you have a DNR order before
treating you.

It would be difficult to indicate that you had such an order, in a
meaningful way, that EMTs would be able to follow. You could tattoo
"DNR" on your forehead, I suppose, but even then, would an EMT know that
this meant "do not resuscitate," or "David North Rules"? Who knows? And
what if it did mean "David North Rules" and an EMT thought it meant "do
not resuscitate" and let you die? Way too much risk for an EMT to *not*
do their jobs.

(EDIT) I should have added that some states recognize "Do Not
Resuscitate" bracelets from companies like MedicAlert. Usually the
bracelet has a scannable QR code which EMTs can scan with any smartphone
or tablet to retrieve a copy of your DNR. Other states require that a
DNR be on file with a doctor in addition to you wearing a DNR bracelet.
In any case, any EMT who complies in good faith with a DNR order will be
immune from liability. Additionally, any EMT who, in good faith,
attempts to determine if a DNR exists and fails to find one would
similarly be immune from liability for performing lifesaving procedures.

Ultimately, the answer is that you would be unlikely to prevail in such
a lawsuit against EMTs.
