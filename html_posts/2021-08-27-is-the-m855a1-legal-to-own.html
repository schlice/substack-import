The answer, as with all "is this legal" questions, is "it depends."

The M855A1 is a 5.56 mm ammunition for M4 Carbine rifles the M-249 SAW,
and the M16A2, or any medium rifle with a 1--7 twist in its rifling. The
M855A1 is a round optimized for the M4's shorter barrel, where the M855
was optimized for the M16.

The only problem is that M855A1 ammo is not available for civilian
purchase. So if someone is selling M855A1 ammunition, they somehow got
the ammunition from the military and is out there selling it as a
private seller. It's not available to be resold yet.

I'd avoid buying ammunition that is not available for sale to civilians.
