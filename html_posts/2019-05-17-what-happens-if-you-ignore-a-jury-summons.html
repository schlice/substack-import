**What happens if someone gets served a summons to appear in court, but
they don't go?**

Normally, the judge finds you in contempt of court and issues a *bench
warrant* for the person's arrest. This means the police can treat it
just as they do any other arrest warrant. Depending on the reason the
warrant was issued, they may not immediately serve the warrant. In such
a case, it can sit and wait until the next time you have an interaction
with police.
