So you think that Trump left his multi-million dollar salary as CEO of
the Trump Corporation so that he could make a \~\$200K salary as
President? Not likely at all.

Also considering the fact that he has pledged to donate his entire
Presidential salary to charity (which he has done), it's extremely
unlikely that he's "doing this for the money."

Interestingly, I think you'd have a hard time convincing anyone that his
ego drove him to be President. I think it's his conviction to what he
believes is the best course of action for the country rather than his
ego. It's his ego that tells him that he's a good president and that
he's doing the right thing, but it's his love for his country and his
belief that he knows what's best that is really driving him. I'm not
sure he is President simply because he has a big ego.
