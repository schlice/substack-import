That's a great question, isn't it? If you can earn your own salvation,
then why did Jesus have to die? If my method of salvation is at my own
hands, then why was a sacrifice necessary?

These are rhetorical questions.

The answer is that **being good alone will not get you to heaven.**

In fact, it's exactly the opposite.

**We are saved by grace alone, not by works.**

*But*, I hear those who know some passages from the Bible saying, *what
about where it says that faith without works is dead? Doesn't that mean
your salvation is dependent on works too?*

**NO!**

Your salvation is dependent on Christ alone. But someone who is truly
saved will be "a new person in Christ." Their actions in this life will
reflect that reality. This is what that passage was trying to say.

When we are saved in Christ, we will be "born again" and become "a new
person in Christ." The works we do are also a reflection of that faith,
as they are too a gift from God. Works are the outer reflection of our
faith. If you don't see the works, you can safely bet that the salvation
and true faith does not exist.

In the New Testament, works are often referred to as fruit. Jesus said
of the topic, "\[N\]o good tree bears bad fruit, nor does a bad tree
bear good fruit. Each tree is recognized by its own fruit. People do not
pick figs from thornbushes, or grapes from briers. A good man brings
good things out of the good stored up in his heart, and an evil man
brings evil things out of the evil stored up in his heart. For the mouth
speaks what the heart is full of." (Luke 6:43--45)

That's a really important statement: *each tree is recognized by its own
fruit.* We are *recognized* as Christ-followers by the *fruits* we bear.
So our *deeds* will reflect our designation as followers of Christ.

You are *saved* by faith. You are *recognized as a follower of Christ*
by works. Works follow faith; works flow from faith. It is your faith
that creates the conditions which allow God to gift you with works. But
it is not the works which save you, it is the faith alone which does.
