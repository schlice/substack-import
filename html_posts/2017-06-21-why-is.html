To continue to deconstruct your erroneous question, the police have not
been acquitted of "wrongdoing."

The police officer in question was not charged with murder, because his
actions did not meet the standard for murder.

The officer believed that there was an "imminent threat of unlawful
force which was intended to, or likely to, result in death or great
bodily harm." The District Attorney found that this belief was
reasonable, and therefore did not bring murder charges against the
officer.

The officer still faces several further challenges:

- An internal police department investigation to see if any department
  policies were violated. This may coincide with the "use of force"
  review that the department will conduct, to see if the officer's use
  of force was reasonable. I suspect that they will find that the
  conflicting directives the officer gave will factor heavily into their
  decision as to what to do with him. They can reprimand him, refer him
  for remedial training, or discipline him further, up to and including
  termination (i.e. he could get fired).
- A wrongful death lawsuit, brought by the family on behalf of Castile.
  Again, because it was the officer who induced the situation in the
  first place, I suspect he will lose this lawsuit.
- Possibly a review by the Department of Justice for civil rights
  violations. If such a review occurs, I believe the officer would also
  be found to have violated Castile's civil rights.

I suspect that the sum total of all of this will be losing a wrongful
death lawsuit and losing his job.
