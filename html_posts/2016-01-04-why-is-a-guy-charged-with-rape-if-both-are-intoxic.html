Gender bias. In the vast majority of cases, it is the male who is the
aggressor and the female who is the victim. So charge the male, and in
the vast majority of cases, you\'re going to get it right.

But just \"charging\" someone with rape doesn\'t guarantee a
\"conviction.\" And when both parties are intoxicated, then there is
enough reasonable doubt that can be generated about what was consented
to and what was not that it would be very challenging to actually get a
conviction when both parties were admittedly intoxicated.

Best advice: Don\'t have drunk sex. Too many legal issues.
