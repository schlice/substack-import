**How can my primary care physician dismiss me from his practice for
coming in for my appointment with symptoms of the very conditions he is
treating me for? What about the American With Disabilities Act?**

Hi
[[Mary](https://www.quora.com/profile/Mary-Vaughan-17)]{.qlink_container},
thanks for your question.

The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) specifically addresses
**disabilities**. The ADA defines a person with a disability as "a
person who has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits
one or more major life activities." This includes people who have a
record of such an impairment, even if they do not currently have a
disability. It also includes individuals who do not have a disability
but are regarded as having a disability (or people who are perceived by
others as having a disability).

Unless you, and others, categorize your condition as a "disability," you
are not covered by ADA.

That said, this doesn't mean you are without legal recourse.

In the United States, most employment is "at will," which means either
you or your employer can terminate the working relationship for any
reason, or no reason at all, so long as it is legally permissible. So
let's talk about legal permissibility. When you quit, this is called
*voluntary termination* and when you are fired, this is called
*involuntary termination.* There are two types of involuntary
termination.

- When your employer gives you no reason for your termination (i.e.
  "thanks, but we no longer need you here"), unless there is some
  documented issue which was the unspoken "cause" for your termination,
  this is called an *involuntary termination without cause*, and is
  generally legally permissible These would be things like downsizing
  and general layoffs.
- When you are fired for a specific reason, this is called
  *involuntarily termination with cause*, and the cause must still be a
  lawful reason. This generally is for things like violating policy,
  disrupting the workplace, and similar reasons. This should be the last
  step in a progressive disciplinary action plan which should be well
  documented.

In your case, you were terminated because you have a health condition
(not necessarily a disability). This is generally considered termination
for cause. In most circumstances, this is only valid if your condition
prevents you from performing the essential elements of the job with or
without reasonable accommodations. Also, if your condition is
contagious, or your condition causes you to risk the health and safety
of others, it can be grounds for termination.

I would strongly suggest you contact a licensed attorney in your area
who specializes in employment law. You have a unique set of
circumstances, and there may be legal remedy here. A lawyer can help you
sort out your options.
