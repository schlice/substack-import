I don't think so, because I don't view the Church of Jesus Christ of
Latter-Day Saints (LDS for short) as a **cult**. I view them as a
**culture**.

I think we do ourselves a disservice, as non-Mormons, to view the LDS as
a cult. As a closet Christian apologist, I find that when we "label" a
group as a cult, we tend to do things like highlighting the historical
inaccuracies we may find in their religion, or taking a more stern
apologetic approach (especially in desiring to debate doctrine) which
could easily feel like an attack.

I prefer to think of Mormons as a ***culture*** rather than a
***cult***. What's the difference, you may ask? The easy way to see the
difference is to imagine yourself doing a mission trip to a foreign
country. You'd probably be first struck with the fact that they speak a
different language. Among many other things, they have different customs
and courtesies. They would have unique and interesting foods. But all
the while, you'd take all of this in stride, because you were dealing
with a different *culture.*

Mormons do have a unique culture. They have their own clothes and food
customs. They even have their own holiday. In many cases, they feel
enormous pressure in society just to prove themselves worthy. These are
just some of the cultural differences we must keep in mind as we
minister to our Mormon friends.

If you treat Mormonism as a *culture* rather than as a *cult*, you will
be more likely to take time to get to know them and their customs (which
is exceptionally easy since, to a person, they are incredibly kind and
loving¹), which will, in turn, drive you to be more patient and loving
in the process. It will also cause you to patiently understand their
unique needs, which will provide you the visibility you need to
determine how best to reach them.

So are Mormons a cult or a culture? How you answer that question may
very well drive how you reach out and share the Gospel with them.

¹ Seriously, when was the last time you met an *angry, mean Mormon?*
Can't say that I've found one yet.
