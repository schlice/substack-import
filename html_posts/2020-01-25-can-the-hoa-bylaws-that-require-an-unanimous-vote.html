**Can the HOA bylaws that require an unanimous vote be changed to the
majority rule? Also, would it have to be unanimously agreed on to be
changed?**

It depends on the current bylaws.

The rule can be changed, but it would have to be changed in accordance
with the rules which are currently in place. If the current approved
bylaws require a unanimous vote to change the rule, you must have a
unanimous vote in order to change the rule to a majority vote.
