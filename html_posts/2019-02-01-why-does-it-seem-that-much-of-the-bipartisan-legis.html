**Why does it seem that much of the bipartisan legislation in the US
seems worse than legislation created along party lines?**

It *seems* worse because it *is* worse. It's worse for me or you,
specifically.

But it's best for ***us***.

That's the very nature of compromise. Both sides give a little bit of
what they don't want to give to reach a consensus. Neither side wants to
give up what they do, but they do it for the sake of compromise.

And that's why bipartisan legislation *seems* worse for me than the
original partisan bill which gave me everything I wanted.

But while it may not check 100% of all my boxes, it works for
*everyone*, which is why it is a bipartisan consensus bill.
