**Content:** [Note we are talking about civil annulment, not religious
annulment.\
\
You should be able to file your civil annulment in the county in which
you currently live. In most cases, a civil annulment is fairly
straightforward, since there is a small list of authorized causes of
action that can meet the standard for a civil annulment. The short list
of authorized causes in most states (from

- **Fraud or misrepresentation.** One spouse concealed or lied about
  something that was essential to the marriage, like the ability to have
  children.
- **No consummation of the marriage.** One spouse is physically unable
  to have sexual intercourse, and the other spouse didn't know it when
  they got married.
- **Incest.** The spouses are too closely related by blood so that their
  marriage is illegal under the laws of the state where they married.
- **Bigamy.** One of the spouses was still legally married to someone
  else at the time of the alleged marriage.
- **Underage.** One of the spouses was under the age of consent at the
  time of the marriage.
- **Unsound mind.** One or both of the spouses was too impaired by
  alcohol or drugs at the time of the wedding (or didn't have the mental
  capacity for some other reason) to understand what was happening and
  give consent to the marriage.
- **Force.** One of the parties was forced into the marriage**.**\

\
Most annulments take place after the marriage has been in place for only
a short time (a few weeks to a few months), so there is usually not much
community property to divide, and usually no children to worry about
custody and support payments.
