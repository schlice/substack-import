**To what extents are co-workers and work friends obligated or expected
to help people with disabilities with day-to-day needs?**

"Obligated" or "expected?" None.

Co-workers and work friends have no obligation to help people with
disabilities do anything that they have not been asked to do.

Co-workers and work friends may *offer* to help people with
disabilities, but if that offer is rejected, that's it. Nothing more is
expected or demanded.
