**Not at all.** Democrats are doubling down, and they are doing so
specifically because they believe it is the best strategy.

We've all seen them doing so, and many have been flabbergasted. *How
could they possibly still think that way after the drubbing they got in
the last election?*

They literally do not care about the results of the election. They truly
believe that **Trump will F up so badly that they will be able to sweep
in and say, "told ya so."**

They believe that in two years, Trump will have stepped on *so many
toes* during his first 100 day blitz and beyond that they can ride the
discontent into office. They believe that they will be able to
capitalize on all of the negatives, missteps and *faux pas* which will
undoubtedly be highlighted and replayed *ad nauseum* on the legacy media
channels, and ride that wave of discontent right back into office,
***utterly ignoring all of the positive change that Trump is
implementing.*** *And they will then get to work dismantling everything
that Trump has done, and we'll be right back in the same spot we were
two and four years before.*

So what to do?

1.  Executive Orders are not enough. EOs are easily undone on Day 1 of
    the next Democrat President's administration. **Trump must work with
    Congress to** ***codify these changes into law.*** EOs do not create
    law. Trump must give these policy changes more permanence through
    Congress. Congress has to take ownership of these issues and pass
    these measures as law, which will make it much tougher to undo them.
2.  The administration must do a better job showing the benefits of the
    changes they are making, and how those changes affect John Q. Public
    and Jane Q. Public. Sure, *we* can see how the changes are reducing
    the deficit and how they are putting our current levels of spending
    back on solid ground and how we are implementing the Will Rogers
    rule (when you find yourself in a hole, the first thing to do is
    stop diggin',) but these need to be translated to **real, tangible
    benefits for ordinary everyday Americans who are struggling to get
    by on a smaller paycheck which doesn't go as far as it did four
    years ago.** They just see Trump imposing tariffs (which would hurt
    their spending ability), not the fact that the tariff tool was
    nothing more than *leverage* to gain compliance (which is working,
    btw), and Democrats will use that misunderstanding to sow confusion
    amongst the low-information voters to whom they pander.

That wave of discontent which propelled Trump and his team into office
has crashed on the beach last month, and that's great, but if Trump and
his team don't justify their work, the next wave won't be carrying
Republicans on it.
