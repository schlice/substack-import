**My lease states \"The landlord may enter the apartment to provide
services, inspect, repair, improve or show it.\" Is that technically
saying they can enter whenever they want without prior notice?**

There is generally more in the lease than just that.

Generally, the lease document will go on to describe when and how the
landlord gains entrance into the apartment, as in something like *the
landlord will contact the tenant and provide a minimum of 24 hours
notice of entry for any purpose* or wording like that.

Keep reading your lease and see if you can find the language which
discusses when they will enter. See if there's a tenant's rights group
in your area or legal aid which may be able to help you review the
lease.

If worse comes to worse, talk to your landlord. They're usually not
jerks (though sometimes, everyone can be a jerk. Just ask my wife...).
Tell them that you have no problem if they come in whenever they need to
in order to do all of those things, but you'd like just a little bit of
advance notice and can they do that. I suspect they'll tell you their
current procedure and maybe can work with you to ensure that you get
advance notice before they come in. Advance notice is standard practice
for apartment complex management and maintenance.

*For the time being, I have re-enabled comments on selected answers.
Some people like to comment. Some people like to engage with me in a
civil manner, and I did kinda miss that\...a little. But do not
misunderstand, I take this step very cautiously. My mental well-being
isn\'t worth your harassing, inane behavior. If you don\'t like what I
wrote, tough shit. If my answer is grammatically low-quality or is
un-cited opinion masquerading as fact, downvote it. If you think I\'m
wrong, write your own answer. But Quora is a question-and-answer site,
not a debate site. If you are simply commenting to tell me "ackshually,
you're wrong," don\'t be surprised if I quietly delete your comment. Put
anything vaguely harassing in there, and your deletion will be followed
by a block and a mute. I will do this immediately and with no
compunction. You have been warned. Be nice.*
