Because of the design of the reader, you can't get a smartphone to
directly communicate with the magnetic strip. Samsung's MST (Magnetic
Secure Transfer) won't work with today's card readers.

So there are a few solutions:

1.  Add an external reader to the pump that will accept NFC. Any
    smartphone that supports NFC-based payment systems (Apple Pay,
    Android Pay, etc) can then be used at the pump. The smartphone would
    be initially scanned and the pump would place a hold (probably about
    \$50) on the card. Once the transaction is complete, the hold would
    clear and the actual charge would be made.
2.  Implement a cloud-based solution where the pump and the smartphone
    connect to the same portal, and the payment is authorized to the
    card on file. When the user scans the QR code, the pump is
    authorized. At the conclusion of the dispense, the payment on file
    gets charged.
