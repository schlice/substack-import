You give a great opportunity to make a point, which is why I didn\'t
summarily delete your comment.

Yes, it is true that both the addict and the user/abuser both begin in
the same place: a poor choice. Everyone makes poor choices in their
lifetime. It happens. And on a side note, your absolutist opinions about
addicts are quite disturbing, and pretty closed minded.

The problem comes **after** that first poor decision. In the brain of
the addict, the system which controls choice is broken. It causes
addicts to *inappropriately* assign more importance to the drug than
would normally be assigned. The drug becomes more important than sleep,
food, sex, hygiene, etc. in the primitive portion of the brain.

Being an addict is not a choice. It is a disease *of choice.* Addicts
should not be treated like criminals. They should be treated like
patients.
