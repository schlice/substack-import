Wow, three questions in one! Aren't I the lucky one? I will helpfully
split the one question into three and answer all of them.

> What does it mean to put 100% faith in Jesus Christ

It means to trust him, completely and totally. It means you understand
who he is (God in human form, the word became flesh) and what he has
done for you (died to pay for your sin). It means rejecting any other
method by which you might attain salvation. You can't believe that Jesus
is the way to salvation and also believe that you can earn your way into
heaven by doing good things or whatever. There is only one way to
salvation. This is what it means to be "all in" for Christ.

> how do we truly believe he died for our sins even though we don't know
> him

Great question! I mean, this stuff happened thousands of years ago. Some
guy could have totally made this up!

The problem with that (and it is a big one) is the Bible isn't just any
old book. It wasn't written by *one guy*. The Bible is a *compilation
of* 66 books, written by about 40 different authors, over the span of
*1500 years* on three continents. There is no possible, physical way
that these authors could have collaborated to concoct such a story and
have such *unity* in the message. Throughout the entire Bible,
everything points to Jesus. Every story, every song, every poem,
foreshadows the life of Christ.

Additionally, the Bible contains a great deal of *prophecy*. Prophecy is
the ability to see events in the future, before they happen. Some of
these early Bible authors were prophets. They foretold events that were
to take place. And hundreds of years later (thousands of years later in
some cases), those prophecies *all came true in the life of Jesus
Christ*. The probability of those things happening are *astronomical*.

But, you say, couldn't Jesus have read those early works and then just
*done* those things? Sure he could have. But could he have controlled
*his birth*? Could he have controlled *his lineage*? Everything about
him and his earthly ministry was foretold by prophets. The chances of
that happening by chance are too high to even be probable.

Therefore, we know the Bible must be true, and must be the inspired word
of God, because only God could have inspired these writers to write what
they did.

There's no reason to believe that the Bible is true, but then not
believe what it says.

So how do we know that Christ died for our sins? The Bible tells us so.

> what do we if we're are ignoring our conscience and we are
> unrepentant?

When I was in pilot training, I can remember one time when ATC told me
to fly at 9000 feet. I was flying along, and my instructor said, "What's
your altitude?" I said, "Just under 9000 feet, yeah, I know I'm a little
low." And he sort of raised his voice a little and said, "Well, fix it!
You're the pilot!" So I pulled back a little on the stick and we climbed
up to 9000 feet.

If you know you are doing the wrong thing, **fix it!** Don't wait until
some time in the future. It's not like you're going to have to so
radically alter your lifestyle that you'll be bored, or you will feel
like you're missing out. I know, because I've been there. Your
conscience is trying to guide you. Maybe it's time to start listening.

God will always love you. He will never leave you. He will never give up
on you. He is literally waiting for you to make the right choice and
accept Jesus as your savior and give your life over to him and to repent
of your sins.

But no one will ever force you. You are always free to make your own
choice. He wants that, too. He wants you to choose him knowing
everything you know. He wants you to see that his way is better. He
wants you to see that his way leads you to life, and to freely choose
him.

So? What are you waiting for? Like my flight instructor said, fix it!
It's time to stop ignoring your conscience, and it's time to start
living the way God wants you to live. The sooner you do, the sooner you
will end this struggle in your heart. Warring against your own
conscience simply cannot end well. It simply leaves you frustrated and
angry. **So stop doing that.**
