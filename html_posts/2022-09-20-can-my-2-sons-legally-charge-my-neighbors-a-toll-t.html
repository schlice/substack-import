Your trolling is a bit sad.

Looking at the 6 questions you have asked since you joined Quora in
August of 2013, you are either

- a male, married to a woman, with a 14-year old son who you want to
  punish by forcing him to wear diapers,
- an elderly woman with a hermit living in her basement
- a man who asks others if they would be "sucked by a gay"
- a person whose landlord apparently opens his mail because of a clause
  in his rental agreement,
- a person who has a daughter and has no idea who should be "grooming"
  her,
- or a person with two sons who apparently are the trolls on the bridge,
  charging people a "toll" to use a public road, and threatening people
  with deadly force. Where I live, you wouldn't last five minutes
  wielding a firearm and threatening motorists. The Sheriff's Office
  responds very quickly to high priority calls.

The Quora Partner Program has produced some of the finest examples of
trolls to have ever been invented. But you're not one of them.
