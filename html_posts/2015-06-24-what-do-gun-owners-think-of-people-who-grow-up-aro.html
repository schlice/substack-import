**Content:** [Congratulations. You developed a conscience and the
ability to think on your own.\
\
You\'ve decided that there are other things more important in your life.
How can anyone fault you for that? It\'s not my place to look upon you
with despair and say, \"how sad, he grew up around guns and now he
doesn\'t even want to buy one.\" It\'s absolutely positively none of my
business.\
\
But by the same token, don\'t deride those that choose to buy guns and
carry them and own them. And don\'t try to place your values on them,
and say that if it\'s good enough for you not to own a gun, then it must
be good enough for everyone else.\
\
The phrase \"to each his own\" comes to mind. This essentially means, I
have mine, you have yours, and we\'re okay with that.\
\
Voltaire said, \"I may not like what you have to say, but I will defend
to the death your right to say it.\" Those of us who are military/police
understand this facet of America better than most. I don\'t have to
agree with you. But I will still defend you, and your ability to say
whatever you choose, even if you choose to deride me for my own beliefs
and choices.]{.rendered_qtext}
