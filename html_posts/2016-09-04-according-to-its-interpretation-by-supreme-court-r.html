First of all, for the purpose of this answer, we will consider a "known
law-breaker" to be someone who has been adjudicated by a court to have
broken a law.

The Constitution lists only as its requirement that the individual be a
US citizen in order to be protected by it. Unless you somehow lose your
citizenship when you break the law, you are still protected by the
Constitution, even after doing so. While some of your rights are
curtailed while you're in jail, even inmates still have Constitutional
rights, though not many.

There are only a few very well controlled times that anyone's rights can
ever be curtailed, and even in those cases, the curtailment of your
rights is very limited and specific. Most of these are all accomplished
at a state level. The primary and most well-known circumstance under
which you can have your Constitutional rights curtailed is when you are
**convicted of a violent felony**. Some of the rights you may lose,
depending on state:

- The right to vote (also known as disenfranchisement)
- The right to purchase and/or possess firearms
- The right to sit on a jury
- Employers are allowed to discriminate against convicted felons and not
  offer them employment simply because they are a convicted felon,
  although they are not required to do so
- The right to work in certain occupations, such as any job with the US
  government, law enforcement, child care, or any occupation which
  requires a professional degree or certification
- Parental rights are often severely curtailed when a parent is
  convicted of a felony. Felony is a big red flag to family court
  judges, usually driving them to award rights and custody to the other
  parent.
- And while it's not necessarily a loss of rights, convicted felons have
  a very difficult time doing anything that requires paperwork of any
  official capacity, including signing leases and loans.

**Domestic violence** is another area in which rights get curtailed. In
my state (Colorado), if you are involved in legal proceedings regarding
domestic violence, the court is required to issue a protective order to
put the opposing parties "in their corners" while the case is ongoing.
Colorado passed a law in 2013 that says that if you are convicted of
domestic violence, you lose the right to purchase and/or possess
firearms. That same law also triggers when you have a domestic violence
protective order issued against you. This means that once legal
proceedings for domestic violence begin, you lose possession of your
firearms, and the offender is required to surrender his firearms within
24 hours of being served the protective order.
