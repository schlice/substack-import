The problem you're running into is a fundamental misunderstanding of
morality, and by whose standards do you judge how moral someone is.

Morality for all people is something which is developed throughout your
childhood and upbringing, for theists and atheists alike. Your morals
are shaped throughout your childhood and into your adult life.

The difference between the theist and the atheist is **the source of
that morality**.

- For the atheist, the source of that morality is the **shared moral
  goals of society.**
- For the theist, the source of that morality is **that religion's deity
  and the teachings of that religion.**

The problem arises when atheists attempt to interpret the shared moral
goals of society. The big stuff, clearly, is well understood in society.
Don't murder, don't kick old ladies in the shins, etc. All societies all
over the world share these moral imperatives (which raises an
interesting question in and of itself, but we'll ignore that for now).
But as we get down into the weeds, we start to see variation, not only
between societies, but between people themselves. How high do we value
virtue? To what extent is philanthropy noble? When do I have to stop to
help that person, or when can I go on about my merry way? These are most
definitely variable when you try to interpret society's position and
then impart it on to your children.

But make no mistake: **to each individual, those actions are 100%
moral.** But if the ***source*** of your morality is not solid,
unchanging, and timeless, then the morals you may develop over your
lifetime may not match the morals of others in society. This is the
problem when you do not have an unchanging source of morals. Your
morals, essentially, become ***self-referential***.

So are atheists, by default, less moral than people of other belief
systems? No, not at all. They believe they are acting 100% in accordance
with their morals, and they are. *The disconnect is in comparing their
morals with the morals of others.*
