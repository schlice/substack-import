God rarely speaks to people audibly these days.

Is that a sign that He has changed? Or is that a sign that *we* have
changed?

Actually, I don\'t think either of those are true. I think God doesn\'t
speak audibly to us anymore because ***the message*** has changed. We
don\'t need the audible voice of God in our lives anymore. We have the
Bible. If we read the Bible with an open heart and we ask the Holy
Spirit to help us understand it, that\'s where the voice of God comes
from.

So if you are hearing the voice of God while you read the Bible,
rejoice! God speaks to us through His Word, which is timeless.

Some Christians take a really long time to get to the point where you
are, where you\'re actually hearing the voice of God through the Bible.
Being able to quiet your mind and open your heart enough to let the
Spirit come in and speak to you is a skill, one that not even all active
Christians have mastered (myself included). I actually have to be
cautious myself, because I can easily slip into envy when I see how
easily some people hear God\'s word.

**TL;DR**: if you read the Bible with an open heart, and you hear the
voice of God from its pages, you are doing something right!
