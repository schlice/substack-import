**What's wrong with Rand Paul? Why does he prevent the anti-lynching
bill to pass? Does he have enough American blood in his hands?**

Rand Paul takes his job seriously. And he's concerned because he knows
he's *creating law,* not just *making a political statement*.

And in his view, this bill makes *bad law*. In general, bills which do
nothing more than make political statements are bad law, but this one
was not rigorously constructed.

He is demanding changes to the bill that he says are needed to ensure
lynching charges can't be brought for minor injuries. He said he seeks
the changes "not because I take lynching lightly but because I take it
seriously. And this legislation does not." He presented a scenario in
which someone could be shoved to the floor in a bar and suffer minor
injuries and be accused of lynching. He said that could lead to unfair
incarcerations. He also claims that the current bill has no protections
against such charges, and he wants to make good law.

He also knows that being the lone voice of dissent on an *anti-lynching
bill* is horribly bad optics, especially in the time of George Floyd. In
response to a question about said optics, he replied, "You think I'm
getting any good publicity out of this? No. I will be excoriated by
simple-minded people on the Internet who think somehow I don't like
Emmett Till or appreciate the history of Emmett Till. I'll be lectured
by everybody."

At the very least, he stands up for what he believes, and while you can
fault him for many things, caving to political pressure is one thing
that you can't.

*Sorry, no comments on this one.*

*If you don\'t like what I wrote, tough shit. If my answer is
grammatically low-quality or is un-cited opinion masquerading as fact,
downvote it. If you think I\'m wrong, write your own answer. But Quora
is a question-and-answer site, not a debate site. If you were simply
going to comment to tell me \"ackshually, you\'re wrong,\" then you're
the reason why I disable comments. Well done, Karen. You ruined it for
everyone.*
