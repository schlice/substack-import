Many sins are about the condition of the heart rather than the actual
action. So in this case, I'd ask why you are hacking a computer.

Security researchers and penetration testers routinely attempt to hack
computers in order to discover their security flaws and either get them
fixed, or advise their clients how to fix them.

Malicious hackers attempt to hack computers in order to steal personal
information or infect the computer for future nefarious use.

Which one are you? Both fall under the heading of computer hacking, but
the condition of the hacker's heart, and his intentions, are very
different in both cases. In the case of the malicious hacker, what he is
doing would rightly be considered stealing and would thus be sinful.
