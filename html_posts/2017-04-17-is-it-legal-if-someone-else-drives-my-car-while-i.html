So I just want to clarify for you what I think I've understood from
everyone (as well as my own knowledge).

There are no violations of law here. If you're pulled over, and it's
your car, and you've authorized another licensed driver to drive it,
you're perfectly legal. If you get into an accident, you won't be
charged with unlawfully operating a motor vehicle. You have the right to
allow any licensed driver to operate your vehicle, and they don't need
to be listed on your policy to do it.

You may run into trouble with your insurance company if you get into an
accident or try to make a claim on your car, because of your
non-disclosure.

Your best bet: if you are living together and have been doing so for any
significant period of time, you should contact your insurance company
and advise them of the new living arrangements. If you ever drive his
car, he should do the same. It will be best for you if you tell them now
(sooner, rather than later), and certainly better to tell them now than
after you have a claim.

Again, as long as he's a good driver and you've been living together for
any significant period of time, it's not likely that the insurance
company would have changed your premium (much). So again, you should be
fine, and you get credit for doing the right thing **before you had
to**.
