Jussie Smollett was charged with breaking laws which actually exist.

There is no law against "hiring people to commit a hate crime." You can
contract with someone to commit a crime, but the contract is illegal and
unenforceable. If they were to actually commit the crime, the people
committing the crime would be charged with committing the crime, and you
would be charged with conspiracy to commit a crime.

But that's not what happened here. Smollett hired actors to pretend to
beat him up. Any physical contact was consensual, so the assault was not
a crime. Therefore, none of what actually occurred was a crime. The
crime happened when he tried to lie to the police about what happened.

There are laws against falsely reporting a crime (which in Illinois are
encapsulated under their disorderly conduct statutes), and that's what
he was convicted of. He was convicted on two counts of lying to
detectives about a battery, one count of lying to detectives about a
hate crime, one count of lying to a police officer about a battery, and
one count of lying to a police officer about a hate crime.

Original question:

Should Jesse Smollett be charged with hiring people to commit a hate
crime? He did pay two men to assault a gay black man and if he isn\'t
charged, what message does this send to other people considering
committing hate crimes?
