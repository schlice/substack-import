**Content:** [Could be for any number of reasons. They may have received
an informational message that you\'re a potential runner (you like to
drive off when the officers get out of their car). They may want to
separate you from the people in your vehicle if they suspect that you,
or one of your passengers, may be dangerous. Or maybe they just want to
separate you from your party so they can have a more \"candid\"
conversation with you than they would do in front of your passengers.\
\
Also, location of the stop will influence whether or not you are asked
to get out. It\'s generally safer to keep you in your car if you were
stopped on the side of a busy road. There\'s less chance of you being
injured if you stay in your car than if you get out.]{.rendered_qtext}
