**Content:** [*Should the high income earner fail to pay, the state will
enforce that contract. This is done at no cost to the low income
earner.*\
\
Except that this is not the case, or there would be no instances of
deadbeat dads, ever, because the state would simply use its power to
enforce the contract. It does not do this. We\'d like it to do this, and
lots of single moms out there would love it to do this, but it does not.
These same single moms still have to pay attorney\'s fees to bring said
deadbeat dad to court; the state does not od this
automaticlly.]{.rendered_qtext}
