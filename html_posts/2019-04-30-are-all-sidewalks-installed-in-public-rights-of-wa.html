All new construction and modifications to existing construction is
required to meet ADA rules for sidewalks.

The slope for all landings must be between a minimum of 1% for drainage
and a maximum of 2% for pedestrian stability in all directions. A
minimum 5 ft. x 5 ft. landing must be provided wherever two sidewalks
cross, or a turn may be required. ADA ramp specifications require a 1:12
ramp slope ratio which equals 4.8 degrees slope or one foot of ramp for
each inch of rise. For instance, a 30 inch rise requires a 30 foot ramp.
ADA guidelines require a minimum 5\' x 5\' flat, unobstructed area at
the top and bottom of the ramp.
