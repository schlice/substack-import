You could always start with Pascal's Wager:

> If I'm wrong and there is no God, I've lost nothing. But if you're
> wrong and there is a God, then you've lost everything.

In other words, it costs you nothing to believe in God. At best, I would
have to rein in my sexual proclivities, but I would say that given the
amount of STIs floating about out there, I think it would be prudent to
do so anyway. But failing to believe in God could have some pretty
drastic and eternal consequences, and eternity is an awfully long time
to be wrong.

Thoughtful believers will indeed question themselves and their beliefs,
some even continuously, and there is nothing wrong with doing so. The
study of apologetics is exactly the study you're looking for. It's not a
study of "what do I believe" but a study of "why do I believe what I
believe" and "how do I justify how I believe what I believe?" There's
nothing inherently evil about justifying your belief. In fact, it's part
of the Great Commandment (**emphasis** mine):

> "Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the Law?"
>
> Jesus replied: "'Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with
> all your soul and **with all your mind**.' This is the first and
> greatest commandment. And the second is like it: 'Love your neighbor
> as yourself.' All the Law and the Prophets hang on these two
> commandments." --- Matthew 22:36--40 NIV

How do you love God with your mind? Do you think about love? I know how
I can love God with all my heart and all my soul, but how do I love God
with all my mind?

I *use* my mind for the purpose for which it was intended. I study the
word of God, I think about everything I believe, and I ***ground my
theology***. I ask myself not only "what do I believe" but **why**. When
I hear something that I believe, I always ask myself **why**. What is
the basis for that belief? Apologetics is the study of why we believe
what we believe. It's not about proving someone else wrong. It's about
continually proving yourself and your beliefs *right* and knowing and
understanding the foundations of your belief.

Faith is not blind, despite what atheists will try to tell you. They'll
tell you that your faith fills in the gaps of the unknown, so it could
literally be anything else that fills that gap, not necessarily God. But
faith is not blind. Faith is knowing what you believe, and being able to
support it. Faith is being able to stand firm in your belief, because it
is well-supported. It's not some blind allegiance to an idea which has
no support. It's full-throated support of a belief which is rational and
reasonable.

Know what you believe, and know why you believe it.

Original question:

Do believers ask themselves questions like \"what if I\'m wrong?\"
\"Could it be that all my beliefs are false?\" and \"What if atheists
are right?\"?
