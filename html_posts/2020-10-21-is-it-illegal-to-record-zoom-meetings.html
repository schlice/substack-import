**Is it illegal to record Zoom meetings?**

Zoom allows Zoom meetings to be recorded. However, when the host begins
recording the meeting, participants are given the *option* to disconnect
from the meeting. Thus, by continuing on with the meeting, the
participants *consent to recording*.

When you screen record a Zoom session, you do not give the participants
the option to opt out of being recorded.

So depending on why you are recording, and what your intended use is for
the recording, most likely the recording would violate privacy laws
where at least one person attending the meeting lives.

The only exception I could see is recording a Zoom session that is
already being recorded. All participants have already consented to being
recorded, so consent is not an issue there. The issue may be *control of
the recording,* which the host may have wanted to retain. Depending on
what you do with the recording, you could still run into legal trouble.

The most legal way to record a Zoom session: ask the host to record it,
and then ask the host to give you a copy. If you can do that, you can be
sure you have a legal and permitted copy of the meeting.
