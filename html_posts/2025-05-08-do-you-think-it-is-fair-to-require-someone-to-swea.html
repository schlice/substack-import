As always, the answer is in the details.

The admonition about telling the truth exists whether you are giving an
expository answer (during direct questioning), or when you are only
allowed to answer with a simple yes or no (as when being
cross-examined). Anything you say "under oath" must be the truth, the
whole truth, and nothing but the truth. But there is a great difference
between what happens during **direct examination** and
**cross-examination**, and why you can only give certain types of
answers during each phase.

Direct examination presents the witness' version of events, and
establishes facts favorable to the side calling the witness. To that
end, lengthy, detailed answers are permitted. The questions asked must
be "non-leading," which means that the witness is answering of his or
her own volition and not being "led" or coached.

On cross-examination, however, the exact opposite happens.
Cross-examination seeks to undermine the credibility of the witness in
the eyes of the jury. The witness is asked leading questions about his
specific statements he gave during direct examination. The witness is
limited to only yes or no answers to ensure that the witness only
specifically addresses what they said during direct examination, and is
questioned regarding those statements. In other words, to ensure that
the witness cannot introduce new testimony during cross-examination, his
answers are limited to simple yes or no answers. The questions during
cross-examination are specifically leading questions, leading the
witness to answer either yes or no.

Like his prose during direct exam, his yes or no answers must also be
truthful. But it makes no sense for him to lie during cross-examination,
because doing so would contradict the statements he made during direct
examination, accomplishing exactly what opposing counsel is trying to
do: discredit the witness.
