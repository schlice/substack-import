Treason can only be committed during wartime. Full stop. Your quoted
treason section says so.

Quoting someone else is not an act of incitement.

Unless you have trouble reading, the quote from Pastor Jeffress says
that removing the president from office will cause a "Civil War like
fracture in this Nation." In plain-er English, it says that such an
action will cause a fracture in this nation, which is like the fracture
we experienced during the Civil War. This is about as far from inciting
civil war as you can get.

Come on now. The whole Russia thing was far fetched. The Ukraine thing
(or Russia version 2) is even more so. Now we're just getting silly.
