**Can Trump\'s judges be removed?**

I will take issue with the question only in the fact that they are not
*Trump's judges*, they are actual judges appointed by Trump, just like
every other Federal court judge has been appointed by a President.

So, can a judge appointed by Trump be removed? Yes, through impeachment,
just like any other appointed Federal official. "The president, vice
president, and all civil officers of the United States are subject to
impeachment."
