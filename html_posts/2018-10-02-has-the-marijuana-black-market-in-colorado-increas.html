**Has the marijuana black market in Colorado increased since the state
repealed its state laws prohibiting it?**

So quick point of clarification. A state can't make legal what the
Federal government has made illegal. What the state *can* do is change
the penalty within the state for violating a Federal law. Colorado
changed the penalty for violating Federal marijuana laws to **nothing**.
No penalty for violating the possession law.

Now, to answer the question: has the black market increased? The answer
is a resounding **yes**. The black market has gotten much better quality
merchandise, and they move it to market much faster as in most cases,
they don't fear repercussions.

*But if they got rid of possession penalties, why is there still a black
market?*

The state allowed cities and municipalities to enact their own laws
regarding how marijuana is to be sold. There are many places within the
state which have enacted their own laws prohibiting recreational
marijuana sales. Some cities have mandatory store hour limits, and the
state has a limit on how much you can buy in a single transaction.
Additionally, where it is legal to buy, there are still age
restrictions. Finally, we have lots of Federal land in Colorado
(National Parks, etc), where possession is still illegal.

So any time you have restrictions, you will have a black market which
defies those restrictions.
