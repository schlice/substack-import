**Content:** [The gun makes it easy for a small person to kill a much
larger person. It makes it easy for a small person to kill anyone.\
\
But so does a homemade bomb made from a readily-available LP tank. I can
kill lots more people in a much shorter period of time with a bomb I can
make in my basement with parts I buy off the Internet, completely
legally.\
\
But that involves time, money, and effort. A gun involves much less
effort, and I can still kill a few people. To most people who have lost
the correct mental capacity to make rational decisions, the gun is the
faster and easier choice.\
\
But if all the guns in the world were simply vaporized in the blink of
an eye (along with the requisite information on how to make them), would
the person who has lost the mental capacity to make rational decisions
simply ***not kill*?** The answer, unfortunately, is no. They will use
whatever tool is at their disposal: IEDs, cars, hatchets, baseball bats,
sharpened sticks, etc.\
\
The tool provides the opportunity. The ***killer*** is often glossed
over, because that discussion (how to prevent killers) is ***orders of
magnitude harder*** to have than simply banning something tangible, like
the gun the killer used. And guns are a famous target of the \"we gotta
ban something\" crowd simply because the gun is purpose-built to kill.
Nothing else that a killer could potentially use is purpose-built to
kill. So the gun becomes a very natural target for their ire.\
\
Reducing guns should rightly reduce gun violence. But reducing guns
***will not reduce violence overall.*** That\'s a much harder discussion
to have. But until we have it, these kinds of incidents will
continue.]{.rendered_qtext}
