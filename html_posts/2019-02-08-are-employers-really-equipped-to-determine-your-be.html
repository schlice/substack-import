**Are employers really equipped to determine your best options for
health insurance?**

The answer is that they are not. But that's because they don't. They
don't actually determine your best options for anything. They offer you
health plans that they pay for. That's it. They say, "we contracted with
Health Insurance Company X and that's the health insurance we offer."
They may actually partner with multiple health insurance companies,
depending on how big they are.

You are under no obligation to accept those plans. You can always
opt-out and buy your own insurance if you choose. You can also choose to
not work for that company and take their health plans.
