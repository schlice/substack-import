**Content:** [If the member of the military was within his legal rights
to resign, he can resign for whatever reason he\'d like. Even being told
by a sitting Congressman to resign. All perfectly legal.\
\
The law expressly forbids inciting someone to perform acts that are
illegal, like insubordination or mutiny. Resigning when one has the free
will to do so is not illegal, regardless of the reason the person gives
to resign.\
\
In actuality, if you don\'t have any service commitments, you don\'t
really give a reason for leaving AD, you just leave. Your DD-214 simply
states \"completion of active duty service commitment\" as the reason
for termination of active duty.]{.rendered_qtext}
