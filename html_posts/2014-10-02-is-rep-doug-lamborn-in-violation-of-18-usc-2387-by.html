<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [If the member of the military was within his legal rights<br>to resign, he can resign for whatever reason he\'d like. Even being told<br>by a sitting Congressman to resign. All perfectly legal.\<br>\<br>The law expressly forbids inciting someone to perform acts that are<br>illegal, like insubordination or mutiny. Resigning when one has the free<br>will to do so is not illegal, regardless of the reason the person gives<br>to resign.\<br>\<br>In actuality, if you don\'t have any service commitments, you don\'t<br>really give a reason for leaving AD, you just leave. Your DD-214 simply<br>states \"completion of active duty service commitment\" as the reason<br>for termination of active duty.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
