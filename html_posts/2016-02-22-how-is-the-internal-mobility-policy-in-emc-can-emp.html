Absolutely!

There are minimum requirements for the position you are currently in.
This means that you must meet the minimum time in your current position
before you can transition into another position in the company. Check
with HR if you are unsure about your current position. Feel free to use
the new \"Ask HR\" chat feature!

Assuming you have met the minimum requirements for time in your current
position, you can absolutely seek to move to another position. You can
scan the internal job postings on EMployeeCentral. I\'ll leave the links
out since they won\'t work unless you\'re browsing Quora from work; try
not to do that.

Once you apply for an internal position, the only other caveat is that
you must **notify your current manager** that you are applying for an
internal job posting.

If you qualify for the new position, you will be contacted by HR, and
they will walk you through the rest of the process.

Good luck!
