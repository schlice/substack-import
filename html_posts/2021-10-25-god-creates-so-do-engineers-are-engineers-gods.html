You failed Logic 101.

A → C\
B → C\
Therefore, A → B

This is **logically false**.

Let's put some context to this false logic:

Girls have green eyes.\
Goats have green eyes\
Therefore, girls are goats.

There isn't a situation in which this logic passes.

Here is logic which works:

A → B\
B → C\
Therefore, A → C

This is **logically true**.

Let's apply some context to this one.

Girls have green eyes.\
All green eyes are beautiful.\
Therefore, girls' eyes are beautiful.

While not speaking to the veracity of these statements, the logic is
sound.
