**If protesters block access to an airport is that a criminal offense?**

While the First Amendment guarantees you the right to protest, the state
can reasonably restrict the **time, place and manner** of your protest.
Courts have found these restrictions to be reasonable and to not unduly
restrict your right to protest.

If you want to block the **road** into the airport, don't. Most states
have laws which prevent obstructing a road or highway. The offenses are
not serious (mostly misdemeanors) but they are criminal offenses. The
road into an airport is indeed a city road, and you can be arrested for
obstructing a road. The same law also holds you responsible for any
monetary damages caused by your obstruction. So if you obstructed a road
and a businessman missed a meeting causing a contract to fall though,
you could be sued and held liable for the lost revenue. If you obstruct
a road and cause a car to divert around your roadblock and the car gets
damaged, you can be held liable for the damages.

But let's say you're simply staging a standing protest outside of the
airport, with picket signs and protesters with bullhorns. If you are
impeding the normal flow of passengers into and out of the airport, you
can be "asked" to move (which means the police order you to move and
arrest you if you fail to comply). If you're simply standing on an
exterior sidewalk but people can still get around you, you might be
allowed to stay.

Your best bet, as always, is to get permission for your protest first.
This generally entails applying for a permit to hold a protest, which
you can do at your City Hall. The airport can ensure that normal airport
traffic continues unimpeded, and you can hold your protest.
