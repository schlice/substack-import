**President Obama** supports \"non-common-sense\" gun control which he
labels as \"gun control.\" Things like:

- limits on magazine capacity
- banning \"scary-looking\" assault weapons
- national gun registries

and the only one that actually makes a little bit of sense (if it\'s
done right):

- background checks on all gun sales

By the way, \"doing it wrong\" means keeping a record of every gun sale,
thus creating a *de facto* national registry of guns. And no, we do not
do this for cars; you can buy a car and never register it with the
state. Of course, you could never drive it on a public road, but there
is no requirement to register a car when you buy it. You only need to
register it if you want to drive it on a public road.

If it\'s done right, we might support something similar, if it equated
to a national concealed carry permit, just as your vehicle doesn\'t have
to be registered in every state in which you drive. This would only mean
registering weapons you intend to carry concealed, not all weapons (for
whatever good the gun control crowd thinks this might do).

Sadly, there are no calls to \"do this right.\"

**President Reagan**, when he was president, was steadfastly against any
form of gun control whatsoever, even after he was critically wounded in
1981 in an assassination attempt. Even with that attempt on his life, he
went further, calling for the abolition of the BATF.

Note that after he left office, he did soften a little, and he did
support the Brady Law, passed in 1993, which requires all purchasers of
guns from businesses to get Federal background checks through the NICS,
disqualifying purchasers who are felons and who are declared mentally
ill by a court.

He also was in favor of the silly limitation on magazine size, but that
(thankfully) never came to fruition nationally.
