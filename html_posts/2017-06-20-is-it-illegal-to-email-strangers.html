In the US, this would be considered spam, which is **opt-in**. You can
only send commercial email to people who have opted-in to receiving
email from you. As long as the people to whom you are sending email have
already consented to being on your list, you are fine to email them
according to the frequency you informed them of when they joined your
list.

If, however, you have a random list of email addresses, you cannot email
them.

In the US, e-mail is covered by the [[CAN-SPAM
Act](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=09ce7d&url=https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/can-spam-act-compliance-guide-business){.external_link

read it over carefully before you send any email.
