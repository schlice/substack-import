God ***is*** the standard. God ***is*** morality. So if God does
something, it is *de facto* moral.

You're probably thinking, "Yeah, but God kills people! How is that
moral?"

It is true that God has directly killed, or has instructed His people to
kill, thousands, including women and children. And as you may recall,
God killed the *entire population of the world* at one point, save for
Noah and his family.

"Right!" you're probably thinking. "If God kills innocent people, that's
murder! Why can God get away with murdering people?"

In order for God to commit murder, He would have to act "unlawfully." We
must recognize that God is God.

> *His works are perfect, and all His ways are just. A faithful God who
> does no wrong, upright and just is He --- Deuteronomy 32:4 ESV*

*see also Psalm 11:7; 90:9*

God created man, and as man's creator, He expects man to obey Him
(Exodus 20:4-6; Exodus 23:21; 2 John 1:6). When man sins (acts in
disobedience of God), he faces God's wrath (Exodus 19:5; Exodus
23:21-22; Leviticus 26:14-18).

> *God is a just judge, and God is angry with the wicked every day. If

You're probably saying, "Yeah, but what about those women and children?
When God wipes out whole cities, that *has* to be murder!" However,
**the Bible does not detail one instance where God killed "innocent"
people**. In fact, compared to God's perfect goodness and holiness,
there is no such thing as an "innocent" person. We are all sinners
(Romans 3:23), and the wages of sin is death (Romans 6:23a). God would
be *completely justified* in wiping us all out. The fact that He has not
done so shows that while God is *just*, He is also *merciful.*

Back to the flood, God's justice was clearly on display, because He had
already judged the entire world before He flooded it:

> *Then the LORD saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth,
> and that every intent of the thoughts of his heart was only evil
> continually --- Genesis 6:5 ESV*

So yes, morality is objective. Following God's law is objectively moral,
and if God declared it to be moral, it is moral.
