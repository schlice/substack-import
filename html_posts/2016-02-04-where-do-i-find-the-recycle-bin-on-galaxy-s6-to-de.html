The S6 (as with any Android phone) does not have a \"recycle bin.\" If
you delete a video file and your free space was not reduced, then your
used space isn\'t being taken up by videos (not appreciably anyway).

I would highly suggest downloading **DU Speed Booster** from the Google
Play store. It will do a thorough analysis of your phone and help you to
remove any junk you have out there that is unnecessary. Best of all,
it\'s free.

From the app\'s main menu, choose \"Trash Cleaner\" and let it do its
bit.

While the speed booster and trash cleaner functions are still relevant
today, I'd try to steer clear of the "battery saver" functions. If
you're on a modern Android version (i.e. 7.0 or higher), the operating
system does a fine job of managing processes which might be draining
your battery. You do have to give it a little time to figure it out, but
it will.
