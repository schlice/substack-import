No. Ethically, life is seen as good. Our bodies are intrinsically
programmed to want to live. When you're drowning, you struggle to get
out of the water so you can breathe. Our bodies are built with natural
survival techniques. It is clear that physiologically, we are designed
to live. Therefore, life is good.

Since death is an end to life (which we just established is good), then
ethically, death is not good.

Suicide is manually inducing death (which is not good), and so
ethically, stopping someone from manually inducing death is the opposite
of "not good" which is good.

If someone believes that life is bad, they have a belief problem, not an
actual bad life problem. Sure, they have troubles (so does everyone),
but ethically, as life is seen as good, they can overcome their troubles
just as countless other people who have troubles can (and do).

Besides, there are numerous ways to overcome troubles in your life, and
suicide is simply too final of a way to do so.

So from a purely ethical perspective, it is indeed ethical to attempt to
stop someone from committing suicide. If they really, really want to,
that's because they are really, really confused, not because it's
unethical to stop someone from committing suicide.
