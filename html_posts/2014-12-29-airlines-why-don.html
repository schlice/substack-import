The FDR (Flight Data Recorder) records the positions of all of the
aircraft control surfaces as well as the positions of the gauges and
dials in the cockpit. There has been discussion lately that FDRs may not
be accurately recoring information from \"glass\" cockpit screens, so
there has been a move to add video recording.\

The problem, of course, is cost. Airlines have some of the thinnest
profit margins of any industry in America, clocking in just about
\$4/passenger/flight. Anything that might interfere with that very slim
profit margin is going to be very closely scrutinized, and if it\'s not
absolutely needed, it won\'t be added.]{.rendered_qtext}
