**In September we will see the 200,000th person to die from COVID-19 in
the USA. What could Mike Pence have done differently to make that number
smaller?**

Nothing, and it is fallacy to think that any person could have "done
something different" that would have caused fewer people to die.
Absolute lunacy.

It's hard enough getting 50 states to work together to stop the virus,
and then you have to work against people who believe that Trump somehow
has the ability to *order them to do things*. It's called the
Constitution. Read it.

**Was Pence deliberately set up for failure by Trump when given this job
to lead the task force?**

Pence was put in charge of Federal efforts to assist the states with
their relief efforts. No one could have done it any better. I suppose
you could have gotten someone in there who would have declared martial
law and sent the National Guard to literally patrol the streets and
arrest anyone not wearing a mask or venturing outside their front door,
but beyond that, what exactly do you think that we could have done
differently? State governors know their states better than the Federal
government, and county commissioners know their counties better than the
state governors.

It seems you may have forgotten that the goal was never to completely
eradicate the virus. The goal was to flatten the curve. And we did that.
But it's not going away. Not any time soon.

Sure, numbers are going up. Even worse, it's likely that COVID-19 will
become a seasonal virus, just like the cold and the flu. But we'll
develop annual vaccines for it just like we do for the flu, and you'll
get your flu/COVID shot every year, and you'll mostly stop it just like
the flu.
