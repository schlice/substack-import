**Content:** [As long as people are not moving forwards and backwards
too much changing the center of gravity on the plane, everyone standing
up and dancing shouldn\'t have much impact at all. Assuming that the
plane is at altitude and cruising with autopilot engaged, changes in all
three axes of rotation should be dampened and corrected automatically.
You would have to have everyone move forwards or backwards dramatically
in order to affect pitch, and you would have to have everyone flop to
one side of the plane or the other in order to potentially impact roll,
even though that\'s much less likely. It would be nearly impossible for
passengers or cargo to affect yaw.\
