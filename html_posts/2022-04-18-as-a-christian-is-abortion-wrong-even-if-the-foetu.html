Remember that we're answering this as a Christian. And as a Christian,
all abortion is wrong, regardless of the reason, because all life is
created by God. God knew you before you were even conceived. He knew
exactly what you would become. The Bible says that God formed you in the
womb, stitched together the very fibre of your being. Voluntarily taking
that life without justification violates the Sixth Commandment (you
shall not murder). The only time abortion is not wrong is to save the
mother's life. Other than that, abortion is morally wrong and violates
God's law.

What other crime allows you to kill the victim? I can't really think of
any. You do realize that the baby is an innocent victim, correct? Why
does it have to die? It's kinda illogical.

Legally speaking (not as a Christian), I can see that a rape is not
consensual, and therefore the woman did not consent to having her body
be used to grow a baby for nine months. In that limited circumstance, I
could see early-term abortion being permitted, even though I still
believe killing babies is wrong.

And that's about it for me. Late-term abortion should never be allowed.
Allow the baby to come to term and give it up for adoption. Abortions
out of nothing more than the mother's convenience should never be
allowed.

And why would abortion be allowed in the case of "stolen condom
self-impregnation?" The woman wants a baby so badly that they would be
willing to steal a condom and self-impregnate with its contents. I don't
think she'd *want* to terminate that pregnancy. The father might, but
she would likely not.

*Sorry, no comments on this one. It's simply too contentious a topic,
and I don't really care to argue with pro-choice folks today.*

*If you don't like what I wrote, too bad, go kick rocks. If my answer is
grammatically low-quality or is un-cited opinion masquerading as fact,
downvote it. If you think I'm wrong, write your own answer. But Quora is
a question-and-answer site, not a debate site. If you were simply going
to comment to tell me "ackshually, you're wrong," then you're the reason
why I disable comments. Well done, Karen. You ruined it for everyone.*
