**What steps can a student in the sophomore year take that would help
him/her get into USAFA?**

I'll assume this is you, for the sake of making a question easier to
answer.

First thing you should know is that you're at the perfect time to start
thinking about what you have to do to get into USAFA. And the first
thing you should do is to visit the [[Academy
Admissions](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=60e33c&url=https://www.academyadmissions.com/){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="academyadmissions.com"}]{.qlink_container} website. There,
you'll find a few important things:

- [[Find your
  ALO](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=3baf43&url=https://www.academyadmissions.com/admissions/outreach-programs/find-your-admissions-liaison-officer/){.external_link
  rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
  onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
  qt-tooltip="academyadmissions.com"}]{.qlink_container}: An ALO
  (Admissions Liaison Officer) is an Academy grad and Air Force officer
  whose job it is to assist you throughout your admissions process. Your
  ALO will help you select appropriate high school classes so that you
  can be competitive, make sure you're engaging in team sports, help you
  with your admissions packet, assist with the nomination process, and
  generally just encourage you in the right direction to give you the
  best chance for success. Finding your ALO and contacting that person
  is critical. I would not wait to do that.
- The Admission Tracker App: The app (available for
  [[iPhone](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=9a269e&url=http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/united-states-air-force-academy/id427133480?mt%3D8){.external_link
  rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
  onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
  qt-tooltip="apple.com"}]{.qlink_container} and
  [[Android](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=e32eee&url=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id%3Dcom.u360mobile.airforceacademy%26feature%3Dsearch_result%23?t%3DW251bGwsMSwyLDEsImNvbS51MzYwbW9iaWxlLmFpcmZvcmNlYWNhZGVteSJd){.external_link
  rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
  onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
  qt-tooltip="google.com"}]{.qlink_container}) provides a checklist of
  steps that you can follow to assist you along your admissions journey.
  Download that and start tracking your own checklist.

On the website, you'll also find all sorts of information relating to
your admissions packet, namely what things the Academy is looking for in
the ideal cadet. I'll briefly review them here, but the website goes
into excruciating detail about every step of the process.

The [[steps you need to
follow](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=80e2b6&url=https://www.academyadmissions.com/admissions/the-application-process/application-steps){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="academyadmissions.com"}]{.qlink_container} are outlined on
the website, but let's talk about what you can be doing right now, as a
sophomore, to give yourself the best chance to succeed:

- **Get good grades**. Academics makes up the largest portion (50%) of
  your entrant score. Getting the best grades you can get is critical.
  Now, you don't have to take all kinds of AP or Honors classes (but if
  you do well in them, it won't hurt). If you do score 4 or 5 on an AP
  class, you can actually use it as transfer credit which will apply to
  your core academic requirements. While AP or Honors classes are not
  necessary, you do have to have excellent academic scores, and you need
  to score well on the standardized testing (i.e. SAT or ACT). To be
  academically competitive for an appointment to the Academy, we
  recommend completion of the following high school courses:
  - four years of English (with a college preparatory class in writing)
  - four years of math (strong background in geometry, algebra,
    trigonometry and pre-calculus)
  - four years of science (lab-based and should include biology,
    chemistry and physics)
  - three years of social studies (to include a course in U.S. History)
  - two years of a modern foreign language
  - one year of computer study
- **Participate in team sports.** The large majority of cadets
  participated in some form of organized team sport while in high
  school. The Academy isn't looking to see *how many* team sports you
  participated in. What they are looking for is "sustained participation
  and leadership in a few activities." Most cadets also lettered in
  their team sport. Doesn't mean that you can't get in without a varsity
  letter, but if you consider that most cadets lettered in their varsity
  sport, earning a varsity letter is a step in the right direction.
- **Participate in non-athletic extracurricular activities.** Again, as
  I mentioned, sustained participation and leadership in a few
  activities (such as a team sport and other non-athletic activities)
  makes you a strong candidate. The Academy only looks at activities you
  participated in starting in your sophomore year, so again, this time
  is perfect for you.

Each one of these things on your admissions packet is weighted and
scored. These scores combined form your overall rank, and your packet is
ranked alongside all of the other packets that are submitted for that
class year. Normally, the Academy receives approximately 10,000 packets
per class year.

The best thing you can do right now is to focus on your grades, and make
sure you are doing everything you can to keep your GPA high. If that
means before or after school tutoring or help from your teachers, do it.
If it means doing extra credit assignments, do it. Do whatever you can
to keep your grades up. This is the time when stupid mistakes can derail
your chances, so don't do that.

If you have other questions, please feel free to ask.
