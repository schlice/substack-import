**A man in California with +1000 guns was arrested, what exactly is he
charged with?**

A quick Google search found that the man was licensed to own the
weapons, and there is no limit to the number of weapons you can own, but
he was charged with unlawfully selling weapons, which is a California
charge.

Sometimes, the quantity of something makes you a potential dealer. For
example, possessing more cocaine than you can possibly consume yourself
gets you charged with possession with intent to distribute. This case is
similar. While there is no limit to the number of guns one person can
own, when you have illegal sales *and* a quantity of guns this large,
you have the potential for federal charges of selling guns without being
a registered gun dealer.

(EDIT) More details are emerging about this particular story. It seems
that this man definitely was a Federal Firearms License (FFL) dealer,
however certain firearms are illegal to sell in California. It appears
that the man possessed some of these prohibited weapons. It is unknown
from the details of the story whether or not the man attempted to sell
one of these prohibited weapons, but we do know that he was in
possession of them.
