This is an excellent question!

So first of all, with the sheer number of different religions and sects
around the world, it makes it very difficult to know which one is right.
But religion is not unique in this. In school, if you take a test on a
math problem and you get it wrong, the solution is as simple as someone
sitting you down and showing you the right way to compute it and helping
you find the right answer.

It's just so strange that so many people just say, "All religions are
right, they're just different ways of looking at the same thing." At
this point, these relativists often pull out the example of the elephant
and the six blind men. They say that if you point the blind men at an
elephant and you ask them to identify what they "see" (feel), you'll get
six different answers. One man feeling the leg will identify that it is
a tree, another feeling the body would say it's a wall, the one holding
the tail would say it's a rope, while the one feeling the trunk would
say it's a snake. The man feeling the ear might say it's a fan, and the
one feeling the tusk would say it is a spear. The relativist will then
explain that the elephant is like God and the blind men are like world
religions: they are all experiencing God differently, but they come to
different conclusions about what they experience. Religious truth, we
are told, is relative to the individual. It's subjective, not objective.

At first, the fact that there are so many contradictory religions in the
world might reinforce the elephant parable, and lead to the notion that
truth in religion can't be known.

**But this is far from accurate.**

The rebuttal to the elephant parable is this: *what is the perspective
of the one telling the story: the narrator?* That person has an
*objective* view of the scene and can tell that the blind men are all
wrong. The narrator would not know that the blind men were wrong unless
he had an objective perspective of what is right.

So if the person telling the story can see that it's an elephant, can't
the blind men see it too? Of course! If they suddenly could see, they
would realize that they too were wrong, and it's actually an elephant in
front of them, and not a rope, a snake, or a spear.

So that leads us to a number of questions:

- Is there absolute truth?
- Can truth be known?
- Is it true that God exists? Can the truth about God be known?

We know that **absolute truth** exists. And we can prove that it does.
The relativist says, "All truth is relative," but isn't that an absolute
statement? If the relativist declares that all truth is relative, he's
making an absolute statement, is he not? Therefore, his very belief is
self-defeating. The postmodernist says that there is no truth at all,
but he actually holds that one truth exists: postmodernism is correct.
Therefore, postmodernism too is self-defeating by its own nature. The
skeptic says, "We can't know what the truth is." But *are you sure* that
you can't know? And the more certain you become that you can't know, you
actually defeat your own position, because you become more absolute
instead of more skeptical. Therefore, skepticism is also self-defeating.

So if absolute truth exists, we know right off the bat that agnosticism,
postmodernism, relativism, and skepticism are all false positions.

Next, the Law of Noncontradiction says that a thing can not be "X" and
"not-X" at the same time. So while Islam and Judaism teach that Jesus is
not God, Christianity teaches that He is. One of these has to be right,
and the other has to be wrong. So there is truth, and it can be known.
This means that pluralists are clearly not right when they say that all
religions are true, or they say "I'm speaking my truth" as if it is
"true for me but not for you." Contrary *beliefs* may exists, but
contrary *truths* do not.

Finally, can we know that God exists, and can the truth about God be
known?

The answer is yes, we can, and we can use logic to do it. In order to
answer the question, you have to ask the correct question first. And
that question is: *why am I here?* *Why is there something, rather than
nothing at all?* The search for the truth about why something exists
rather than nothing at all leads us to understand the truth about God.
The argument for God can be expressed very simply:

1.  Something exists.
2.  You can't get Something from nothing.
3.  Therefore, a necessary and eternal entity created Something.

Even atheists do not deny this logic. They simply claim that the
universe is that eternal entity. However, to date, all scientific and
philosophical inquiry has proven and re-proven that the universe had a
beginning, and the body of evidence proving this fact is continually
growing. If something had a beginning, it is not eternal. Therefore,
being that the only two sources of eternality are an eternal universe or
an eternal Creator, and we have proven that the universe is not eternal,
an eternal Creator must exist.

*Therefore, the only logical conclusion is that a creator God exists.*

Now, this conclusion says nothing about what kind of God exists, but it
does rule out all pantheistic religions. All pantheistic worldviews say
that the universe is God and is eternal. And this assertion is false.
So, Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, and all other pantheistic religions are
ruled out as valid belief systems.

\

So in just a few paragraphs, we have discovered that atheism,
agnosticism, postmodernism, relativism, pluralism and skepticism are all
false. We have also discovered that all pantheistic religions such as
Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, etc, which believe that the universe is God
and is eternal, are also false.

So we're left with just monotheistic religions. But can we tell which
one of the monotheistic religions is right?

Well, we can use another scientific principle: the Law of Causality.
This law says, in part, that *an effect must resemble its cause*.
Therefore, can we use forensic analysis to work backwards from the
effect (us) and learn anything about the cause (God)? The answer,
unsurprisingly, is yes. From creation, we can tell the following about
God. He is:

- Supernatural in nature (as He exists outside of His creation)
- Incredibly powerful (to have created all that is known)
- Eternal (self-existent, as He exists outside of time and space)
- Omnipresent (He created space and is not limited by it)
- Timeless and changeless (He created time)
- Immaterial (because He transcends space)
- Personal (the impersonal can't create personality)
- Necessary (as everything else depends on Him)
- Infinite and singular (as you cannot have two infinites)
- Diverse yet has unity (as all multiplicity implies a prior
  singularity)
- Intelligent (supremely, to create everything)
- Purposeful (as He deliberately created everything)
- Moral (no moral law can exist without a lawgiver)
- Caring (or no moral laws would have been given)

Now that we have determined the characteristics of the God who created
the universe and everything in it, *is there any remaining monotheistic
world religion which describes this God?*

In fact there is: Christianity describes this God perfectly.
Christianity says that God is:

- supernatural (Genesis 1:1),
- powerful (Jeremiah 32:17),
- eternal (Psalm 90:2),
- necessary (Exodus 3:14, Colossians 1:17)
- omnipresent (Psalm 139:7),
- timeless/changeless (Malachi 3:6),
- immaterial (John 5:24),
- personal (Genesis 3:9),
- infinite/singular (Jeremiah 23:24, Deuteronomy 6:4),
- diverse yet with unity (Matthew 28:19),
- intelligent (Psalm 147:4-5),
- purposeful (Jeremiah 29:11, Psalm 19:1-4),
- moral (Daniel 9:14),
- caring (1 Peter 5:6-7).
