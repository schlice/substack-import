I assume you're talking about these.

Perhaps you can see just inside the upper segment on the leftmost number
is a small window and something inside it.

Yep, it's a radar emitter.

The more sophisticated signs are "smart signs," and usually the portable
ones the police put out are called "smart trailers." These generally
contain a small computer which records the time of day and the average
speed, to better utilize police personnel during patrol operations.
