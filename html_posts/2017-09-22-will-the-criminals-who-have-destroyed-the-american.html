To answer this question, you have to elaborate.

- You must identify who the criminals are, if you know who they are.
- You must identify the crime committed, if you know it.
- You must identify what, to you, constitutes "real justice." Is that a
  proper decision in court, or will you only be satisfied if this person
  or persons is either incarcerated or executed? This helps to clarify
  your definition of "justice." To some, "justice" actually means
  "retribution."
