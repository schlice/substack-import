**For those out there that have been through military basic training,
are you or anyone you know immune to CS gas or pepper spray?**

Military training involves CS tear gas. Only specialized units use
pepper spray (i.e. military law enforcement, and not in every
situation). Everyone trains on CS tear gas in the military, because it
has immediate, debilitating effects, but it rapidly clears from the body
with virtually no incidence of long-term effects.

I went through it as a trainee, and I administered it as a trainer. I
have never seen someone be able to remove their gas mask and breathe
normally. What I have seen is a difference in the amount of time it
takes to affect someone. Most people are immediately impacted by the
gas. Besides the choking, you literally get fluid from every pore in
your face: eyes water, nose runs, saliva, and for most, it's
instantaneous. Just this massive explosion of snot and tears. Some can
actually take a few breaths before starting to choke and tear up. But
everyone is affected by the gas.
