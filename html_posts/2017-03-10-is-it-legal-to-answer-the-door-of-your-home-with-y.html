The short answer is that it is illegal to point a gun at someone who you
do not intend to shoot. There are two crimes here: the criminal law at
question is called **brandishing a weapon**, and it attaches any time
you hold a weapon in a threatening manner, such that it can be brought
to bear against another person. The tort crime is **assault**, which is
differentiated from the crime of assault in that the tort assault can be
verbal or non-physical (or in this case, a simple assault with a
weapon), and in tort law, a battery is the physical execution of that
assault. A criminal assault involves physical attack.

To be legally compliant, you can answer the door with a holstered
pistol. You can answer the door with a slung shotgun or rifle (assuming
it is not slung across the chest and your hand is not resting near the
trigger). Anything else could be considered brandishing and is a crime.
