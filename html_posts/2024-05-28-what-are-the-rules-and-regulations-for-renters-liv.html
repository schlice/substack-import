The specific rules for renters will vary by HOA, especially when it
comes to things like usage of amenities. But in most cases, renters have
the same rights as homeowners except that they can't vote in HOA votes.
They must follow all the same rules as homeowners do.

Check the CC&R for specific rules for renters. The landlord should have
provided you with a copy of the rules.
