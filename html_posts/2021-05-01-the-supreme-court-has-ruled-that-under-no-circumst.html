The devil is in the details, as they say.

SCOTUS decisions have indeed said that the police are not obligated to
help you. What this means in practice is that if you are injured by
something or someone the police failed to stop, you cannot sue them for
that failure. For example, if the police release a suspect from custody
and that suspect gets a weapon and kills your family member, you cannot
sue the police for releasing that person from custody, even if they knew
the person was dangerous and could have been a threat.

Police are required to provide general protection to the public at
large, but they have no specific duty to keep you free from harm.

So why do we need them if they're not here to protect us? We need them
to perform their actual job: law enforcement. That means that when
someone refuses to follow the law, the police bring them to see a judge.
That's about the extent of their jobs. They are not your personal
bodyguards. They are not designed, nor could they ever be, to keep you
free from harm.

According to the Constitution, that's your job.

(EDIT) Let's address your "hunt" comment. Why, pray tell, would the
police be hunting you? Perhaps because they are doing their job? You
know, that pesky "law enforcement" job? Where they go after the people
who broke the law?

**People don't like the police because the police remind us that there
are consequences for our actions.**

Instead of looking askance at the police for doing the jobs we asked
them to do, maybe instead you should look at yourself and see if there
is any reason that they are coming for you.
