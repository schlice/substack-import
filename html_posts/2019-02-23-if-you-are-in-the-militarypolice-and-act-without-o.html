**If you are in the military/police and act without orders, is that
illegal?**

The answer is "it depends."

Your duties and responsibilities are assigned to you. Technically, you
have a standing order to fulfill your responsibilities. You have wide
latitude to do what is needed to fulfill your responsibilities and
duties.

It is unlawful to act *against* your duties and responsibilities. So if
you're ordered to do something, and you do the opposite, that's a
failure to follow orders or a dereliction of duty. In the military, it
violates the Uniform Code of Military Justice. For the police, as long
as the action taken wasn't illegal in and of itself, then it violates
department policy, so while not necessarily "illegal," it can still get
you fired.
