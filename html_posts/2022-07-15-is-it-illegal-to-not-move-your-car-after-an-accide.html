No, it is not illegal to not move your car after an accident. But I will
tell you that the first arriving police officer will ask you if your car
is still drivable, and if it is, to pull it off the side of the road.

If your car is still drivable, it is strongly advised that you move it
out of traffic. It doesn't have to be in place on the road in order for
police officers to figure out exactly what happened in the accident..

Also, it's much safer for you and for the rest of the traveling public
for you to move your car off of the active roadway. There's less chance
of a secondary accident taking place, and it's safer for responding
police officers to work on the side of the road rather than in traffic.

TL;DR: If you are able, please move your car out of traffic after an
accident.
