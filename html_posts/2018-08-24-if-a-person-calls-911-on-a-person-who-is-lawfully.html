**If a person calls 911 on a person who is lawfully carrying a gun in
the open, why isn't he/she arrested for abusing an emergency line and
taking officers away from a possible real emergency?**

The situation you're describing is not classified as false reporting.
False reporting (at least in Colorado) would consist of reporting an
event which does not exist.
[[Swatting](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=19e73b&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swatting){.external_link

false reporting using the 911 system.

However, calling 911 and reporting a person with a gun is not false
reporting. The police can absolutely come and check it out and see what
the person is up to, and then perhaps advise the caller that it is legal
for people to openly carry firearms in that jurisdiction.
