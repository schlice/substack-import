In many jurisdictions in the United States, while speed cameras may be
legal under state law, they are not used for general traffic monitoring.
They are used in very specific situations, such as school zones (which
are universally 20 mph) and some states will use them in construction
zones.

States vary on the legality of automated speed enforcement systems. **18
states and the District of Columbia** have passed laws that permit the
use of speed cameras. **9 states** have passed laws that prohibit the
use of speed cameras. But even in the states where it is legally
permitted, it is generally seen as government overreach when they are
used for completely autonomous speed monitoring and ticketing.

Unlike in the UK, the US was founded on a healthy distrust of
government. Government only has the authority which it has been given in
the Constitution and nothing more. Americans, as a group, are generally
very wary of government overstepping its Constitutional bounds. We are
completely disinterested in having government tell us what is "for our
own good."
