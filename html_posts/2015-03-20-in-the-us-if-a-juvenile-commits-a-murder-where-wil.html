**Content:** [They go to kids jail.\
\
Seriously. Except it\'s not called \"kids jail.\" It\'s called
**juvenile detention**, a **youth detention center**, **juvenile hall**,
or as it is colloquially known, **juvy**. The name varies by state, but
the function is the same: the youth detention center houses youthful
offenders (YOs) who are awaiting trial, or who are awaiting placement in
other programs or facilities.\
\
What happens next is a function of whether or not the YO is going to be
tried as an adult. If so, he will go into the regular court system and
will be tried there. If he is not going to be tried as an adult, he will
be tried in the *juvenile court system*. Juvenile court has different
standards and different punishments for crimes committed by YOs.\
\
Once they enter the juvenile court system, most YOs charged with murder
will be treated as adults in the United States and will proceed to trial
under the regular legal system. There are still some children who are
not eligible to be tried as adults, and the age varies by state, but in
nearly all states, children can be tried as adults for capital offenses
such as murder, robbery, rape, arson and kidnapping.]{.rendered_qtext}
