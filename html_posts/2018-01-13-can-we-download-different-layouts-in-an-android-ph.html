Android, unlike iOS, can have different \"launchers\" applied, which
totally change the home screen. You can completely customize the home
screen and icons, backgrounds, animations, widgets, colors, themes, and
more!

There are many to choose from, but some favorites are Nova Launcher and
Action Launcher. They are highly customizable and a lot of fun. Search
for \"launchers\" in the Google Play Store, or search for a few of the
ones I mentioned.
