I think Christians are concerned about both.

**But believers who simply misunderstand God have a better chance of
being saved than atheists.**

Some people are simply not destined to be saved. I know it sounds harsh,
but it's nevertheless true. And if that is true, then die-hard atheists
are beyond salvation through their own choices.

But Christians who misunderstand God have a chance to improve, learn,
and be redeemed.

I'd want to invest more time in the misunderstanding Christian than in
the die-hard atheist.
