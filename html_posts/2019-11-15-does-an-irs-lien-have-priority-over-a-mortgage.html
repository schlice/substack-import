**Does an IRS lien have priority over a mortgage?**

If you have a mortgage at the time the IRS files a blanket lien, the IRS
lien would go into second position behind the first mortgage. If you
have a second mortgage, the IRS lien would go into third position.

If you owned the house free and clear at the time the IRS files a
blanket lien, the IRS lien would go into first position. Any subsequent
mortgages you open would fall behind the IRS lien, unless you used the
proceeds of the mortgage to pay off the IRS lien.

There are a few exceptions, one of which is if the HOA has put a lien on
the property for unpaid HOA dues. The HOA will actually slot in behind
the mortgage(s), but **in front of** the IRS.
