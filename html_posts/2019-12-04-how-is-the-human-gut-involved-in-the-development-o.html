**How is the human gut involved in the development of multiple
sclerosis?**

The answer is "we don't know exactly how yet, but we know that it is
involved."

Along with the research you indicated, which shows that certain signal
proteins are found more often in MS patients than in the general
population, [[a longitudinal pilot
study](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=c763ba&url=https://onlinelibrary.ectrims-congress.eu/ectrims/2019/stockholm/278432/caterina.ferri.effect.of.dimethyl.fumarate.on.gut.microbiota.in.patients.with.html){.external_link

ECTRIMS has been monitoring how dimethyl fumarate (marketed in the US as
Tecfidera) affects the gut microbiome, and has even gone so far as to
say that *one of the primary modes of the drug's operation is to alter
the gut microbiome*. (From my own experience with Gilenya, I wouldn't be
surprised if the same were true for that drug as well, along with any of
the other oral MS meds).

So put those two together. You have a drug which alters the gut
microbiome. That microbiome has a definite correlation to disease
progression in MS. It is natural to conclude that there could be a
causal relationship there.

In fact, we have long recognized in medicine that there is a [[gut-brain
connection](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=62b894&url=https://www.google.com/search?q%3Dgut%2Bbrain%2Bconnection){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="google.com"}]{.qlink_container}. You know all about the
Central Nervous System (CNS) and the Peripheral Nervous System (PNS),
but how much do you know about the [[Enteric Nervous System
(ENS)](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=dbfceb&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enteric_nervous_system){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}? I bet a good half of you
reading this don't even know it exists. The ENS is a portion of the
Autonomic Nervous System and consists of a mesh-like coating of nerve
fibers around the entire digestive system. It actually performs the
"heavy-lifting" of controlling the digestive process. Those ENS nerve
cells, most especially the ones surrounding the gut, are virtually
identical to nerve cells found in the brain and CNS. So when someone
says they got "a gut feeling," it could be because the gut responds
physically to the same signals which trigger emotional centers in the
brain. This is also why dyspepsia causes us to be in a bad mood. In
other words, when our gut hurts, our emotions are affected, and
vice-versa.

Recognizing that there is a connection between what happens in our gut
and what happens in our brain seems straightforward, but may be a key to
unraveling the disease process in MS.
