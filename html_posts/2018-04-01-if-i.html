Doesn't it make sense that if you're looking for a pilot slot, you'd try
to go to the place that has the most, and whose whole organization is
dedicated towards flying?

Between USAFA and USNA, USAFA has more pilot slots right out of the gate
than USNA. You have a much better chance of becoming a military pilot
out of USAFA than anywhere else.
