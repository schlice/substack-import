There's always a justification. You just may not like it.

Trump\'s tariffs are framed as a response to the legal proceedings
against former President Jair Bolsonaro This decision is linked to
Bolsonaro\'s ongoing legal challenges related to the 2022 election and
his alleged involvement in a coup attempt.

Bolsonaro, who is facing charges related to the January 6th events in
Brazil, is accused of attempting to overturn the 2022 presidential
election. Bolsonaro, a close ally of Trump, denies the charges and
claims he is being politically persecuted.

Trump sent a letter to Brazil\'s President Lula, stating that the
treatment of Bolsonaro is \"an international disgrace\". Lula rejected
the letter and is considering retaliatory tariffs.

The tariffs could impact various sectors, including steel, coffee, and
beef, potentially causing price increases for consumers and disrupting
trade flows.

The situation adds another layer to the complex relationship between the
US and Brazil, with implications for regional influence and trade
dynamics. The tariffs also highlight the fact that **tariffs are not an
economic tool; they are a political tool.** They're not meant to improve
your cost at the point of sale; they're meant to accomplish a political
goal.
