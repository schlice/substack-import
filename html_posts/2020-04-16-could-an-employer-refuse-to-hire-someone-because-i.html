**Could an employer refuse to hire someone because it believes that it
would be unsafe for that individual to work with the machinery required
to perform the essential functions of the job because of a disability?**

*(US-specific answer)*

Basically, yes, the employer can refuse to hire someone under those
conditions.

The employer would have to show that the person cannot perform the
essential functions of the job safely, even with reasonable
accommodations. Being able to perform the job safely is part of the
essential functions of a job: not just doing it, but doing it safely.

If a disability prevents a person from doing the job safely, and no
amount of reasonable accommodations will help, then the employer can
pass on hiring that person and can cite the inability to overcome the
disability with reasonable accommodations.
