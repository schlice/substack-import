I assume you are referring to the McDonald\'s case pending in Seattle.

[[McDonald's Sues Seattle Over \$15 Minimum Wage, Cites Fourteenth
Amendment](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=6b1ade&url=https://thebillfold.com/mcdonald-s-sues-seattle-over-15-minimum-wage-cites-fourteenth-amendment-a394d9d55a9%23.ko2ed8bys){.external_link

The information about the original lawsuit comes from Fortune magazine:

The plaintiffs argue that they are being discriminated against because
they are simply associated with big corporations (even though they are
franchisees, and so they pay their employees out of their own profits,
so in that respect, they are no different from any other small
business). They are using a 14th Amendment argument because they are
being treated differently from other businesses, which have seven years
to comply with the new law, as opposed to franchisees, which are only
given three years to comply.

at The Billfold is incensed that McDonalds would attempt to use the 14th
Amendment and claim that a business should be treated as a person, and
that McDonalds is so rolling in cash that it\'s just beyond the pale
that they couldn\'t see paying \$15 an hour to their employees from
their vast coffers of money.

I know we\'ve detailed this before, but I can\'t seem to find it at the
moment. So I\'ll just re-iterate a few bullet points.

1.  McDonald\'s is only one franchisee being represented by the
    International Franchise Association, but it seems to be the one
    everyone is singling out. Nevertheless, McDonalds, like so many
    other corporations, is not a person. It is a group of individual
    people, all making salaries, all sharing profits, all paying for
    inventory and food and production, together. A very large group, but
    a group nonetheless. However, the government feels that a
    corporation (a legal construct, not a person) should be taxed.
    However, it is people that pay taxes, not legal constructs, since
    only people can actually \"make\" money. Therefore, it is the
    government, through its incessant taxation of corporations, that
    have chosen to make corporations into \"people.\"
2.  If a corporation is treated as a person under the law, it has the
    full protection of the Constitution, and the 14th Amendment should
    apply.
3.  Franchisees are not their parent company. They are independent
    businesses, owned and operated by a person who buys a \"license\"
    from the corporation. They make their own individual profits, and
    they pay licensing fees back to the corporation. In turn, the
    corporation provides the licensee with raw products and the means to
    turn them into licensed products that they can then sell. **The
    corporation would not be paying the higher wages; the franchisees
    would**. They can\'t afford that any more than any other business.

As for the \$15 an hour minimum wage law, the objections to it have
nothing to do with greedy corporations who want workers to suffer, or
any other deluded sort of conspiracy theory related to unchecked
capitalism. In fact, I don\'t even have to explain it. A man who knows
the true value of a dollar, Mike Rowe, from *Dirty Jobs* fame, was asked
the same question about McDonald\'s and the \$15 an hour minimum wage.
He was asked what he thought might happen to the price of a Big Mac
should this law go into effect.

I can\'t argue with the logic and wisdom of the great one, Mike Rowe.
Instead of focusing on paying unskilled employees more, unskilled
workers should ***get a skill*** and make themselves **worth more.**
Government subsidies? Let\'s subsidize trade schools, so that people can
learn a trade, a marketable skill. Remember when schools used to teach
that stuff? It all went away when we started to think of school as
nothing more than \"college prep.\" Once we got that mindset (that
college is the end-all, be-all of life), we \"overlooked\" skilled-labor
jobs. We now have about three million positions that need to be filled,
and hardly any of them require a four-year degree, but almost all of
them require skilled labor.

Entry-level jobs are called \"entry-level\" because ***you\'re not
supposed to stay there.*** These jobs will eventually be replaced by
technology.

That\'s what a \$15 an hour minimum wage will do to your economy:
elimination of entry-level jobs.
