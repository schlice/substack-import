**What do you think of the federal appeals court tossing out Boston
marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's death penalty conviction? Is his
current sentence of life imprisonment without possibility of parole
just?**

So let's dissect what happened at the appeals court. And let's not
forget that not all charges were vacated, only the death penalty
eligible charges. Some other charges were allowed to stand.

In this case, it's easiest to start with the words from the judges
themselves.

So if you truly believe in the rule of law and in the promise of the
14th Amendment which essentially promises that all are equal under the
law (including the very worst among us), then the high bar set by
*Patriarca* to vet the jury and eliminate bias must be enforced. And if
the judge doesn't meet the standard, then it is entirely possible that
bias could have played a part in these jury decisions.

**In short, assuming the conclusion about the judge failing to meet the
standards set by** ***Patriarca*** **were correct, the appeals court was
right to vacate the death penalty eligible findings.**

The DOJ has a number of avenues it can pursue. It can ask the appeals
court to review "en banc" instead of just having a 3-judge panel review.
It can ask the Supreme Court to review. Or it can allow the appeals
court rulinggo back and re-do the penalty phase of the trial for these
charges only, and *ensure* that the judge follows the rules to the
letter regarding vetting prospective jurors' exposure to the case and
*ensure* that the jurors can ignore that publicity, assuming the
government still wants to pursue capital punishment for those charges.
