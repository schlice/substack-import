Absolutely, but there is no \"standardized\" test across all states.
Each state gets to determine hiring requirements for their departments,
but nearly all departments across the country require psychological
exams.

Our department does several psych exams during the hiring process; at
least one exam is done as a multiple-choice test format, and at least
one other is done as a one-hour evaluation by the staff psychiatrist.

The results of the exam will determine whether or not the candidate is
suitable to be a police officer and will comprise the body of evidence
presented to the hiring board to determine whether or not a candidate
will be recommended for hire.
