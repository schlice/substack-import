As with all legal questions, the answer is "it depends."

In all cases, if you are in a situation in which you fear for your life,
you can always defend yourself. But you will have to articulate why you
felt as if your life was in danger.

You always have a right to self-defense, no matter what the age of your
attacker is. Persons of any age can commit assault and/or battery. You
can use whatever force necessary to stop the unlawful conduct.

The criminal side of the equation is simple. A crime was being
committed. You used reasonable force to stop the crime. You are not
guilty of anything because you acted in self-defense.

The civil side is going to be much more difficult and nuanced. They are
going to try to parse exactly what you did to see if the force you used
was excessive based on the age of the person attacking you and their
ability to really injure you. This idea of *proportionality* in the
civil assault case will be on vivid display. If the child kicked your
shin and you flat-out cold-cocked him with one of those punches you use
at the amusement park strength testing games and you cause him a
concussion *with your fist*, the courts will not look too kindly that
you stopped the "attack" with only the force required. But if the child
is swinging (and possibly connecting) with a baseball bat and you
cold-cock him with the same punch, your defense might be seen as
reasonable, and your liability for any injuries your punch caused would
be severely reduced.
