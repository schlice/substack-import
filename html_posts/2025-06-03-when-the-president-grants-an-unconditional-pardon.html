Pardons do not automatically mean any fines the convict paid are
refunded. It depends on whether the fines have already been collected
and processed by the Treasury Department.

If the fines have not been paid, or if they have been paid but not yet
processed by the Treasury Department, they can be refunded.

If the fines have already been paid and processed, usually there is no
getting it back.

\

Now, if you're talking about a *civil* forfeiture (for example, if you
were the victim in a criminal case and the person went to jail and then
you sued them), the fact that they were pardoned doesn't erase the fact
that they engaged in the behavior. It only erases any of the criminal
penalties of the conviction. The victim can still sue the perpetrator
for damages even if the person was pardoned.
