This is a really good question but you're not going to like the answer.

When you hear "a more scientific mind," what this generally means is
that such a person will only believe what they are hearing if it can be
proven scientifically.

God, who exists outside of time, space, and matter, can't be measured
scientifically.

So what someone with "a more scientific mind" will actually believe is
definitely in question.

However, if the person truly has a more scientific mind, they'll
understand the basics of the scientific method, which in essence tells
us that science is a search for causes. That's what scientists do: they
try to determine what caused what.

The Cosmological Argument is exactly that: a search for a cause for the
universe. It goes like this:

1.  Everything that has come into existence (or had a beginning) has a
    cause.
2.  The universe had a beginning.
3.  Therefore, the universe had a cause.

Premise 1 is the Law of Causality, one of the foundational laws of
science. Even the outspoken atheist David Hume said, "I never asserted
so absurd a proposition as that something should arise without a cause."
So Premise 1 is true.

Is Premise 2 true? We know from a tremendous amount of scientific
research that the universe (time, space, and matter) began at a single
point. We have colloquially called this the "Big Bang." There is a lot
of scientific data which supports the veracity of the Big Bang: the
second law of thermodynamics, the expanding (and accelerating) universe,
the radiation echo from the Big Bang, galaxy seeds, and the most
convincing of all, Einstein's Theory of General Relativity. All of this
data (and more) point unequivocally to the understanding that the
universe had a beginning.

Still, some deny that the Big Bang was actually the beginning of time,
space, and matter. Maybe matter began then, but time and space existed
before, they say without any evidence of this. And maybe they're right.
But when you have two maybe's, it's generally best to go with the
"maybe" that has the most proof. And right now, Einstein's Theory of
General Relativity (which has now been proven accurate to five decimal
places) states that *everything* began at a single point.

Einstein was an atheist, and he was greatly troubled by his own
findings, which were showing him that the universe was finite. In fact,
he was so troubled by this, that he introduced a *cosmological constant*
(think of it as a "fudge factor") into the theory, to show that the
universe was actually static and infinite.

However, his fudge factor didn't last long. In 1919, British cosmologist
Arthur Eddington conducted an experiment during a solar eclipse which
confirmed that the universe wasn't static, but indeed had a beginning.
Eddington, also an atheist, said of the discovery, "Philosophically, the
notion of the beginning of the present order of nature is repugnant to
me...I should like to find a genuine loophole." And by 1922, Russian
mathematician Alexander Friedmann had officially exposed Einstein's
fudge factor as a mathematical error. Einstein, in his haste to disprove
his own theory, *had actually divided by zero*.

Einstein was *so shook* by his own discovery that he became a theist! In
1929, he traveled to California to visit the Mount Wilson Observatory,
where he saw with his own eyes the red shift in the movement of
celestial objects indicative of them all moving away from a central
point. It was then that he knew: the universe must have a beginning, and
thus a Beginner. He subsequently described the cosmological constant as
"the greatest blunder of my life." He said that he wanted "to know how
God created the world. I am not interested in this or that phenomenon,
in the spectrum of this or that element. I want to know His thought, the
rest are details."

So we know that everything that had a beginning had a cause, and that
the universe had a beginning. So therefore, the universe must have a
cause.

But what (or Who) caused the universe? It must be someone who exists
outside of the universe (because He created the universe and is
therefore not bound by it). It also must be someone who is timeless (as
He exists outside of time and is also not bound by it). So we are
looking for an infinite being who exists outside of the universe.

What else can we tell about Him from His creation?

- He must be supernatural in nature (as He created time and space).
- He must be powerful (incredibly).
- He must be necessary (the maker must be self-explanatory).
- He must be omnipresent (He created space and is not limited by it).
- He must be immaterial because He transcends space/physical.
- He must be personal (the impersonal cannot create personality).
- He must be infinite and singular as you cannot have two infinites.
- He must be diverse yet have unity as unity and diversity exist
  simultaneously in nature.
- He must be intelligent (supremely). Only cognitive being can produce
  cognitive being.
- He must be purposeful as He deliberately created everything.
- He must be moral (no moral law can be had without a giver).
- He must be caring (or no moral laws would have been given).

That said, does any religion of the world describe such a Creator? The
answer is yes, the Abrahamic God of the Bible does in fact fit these
criteria completely.
