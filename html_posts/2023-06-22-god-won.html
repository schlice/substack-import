Well, if it were a Bible verse, it would be true.

But it's not.

There is a verse that is often cited out of context (as most Bible
verses are), and that verse is 1 Corinthians 10:13. It begins:

> God is faithful, and he will not let you be tempted beyond your
> ability (ESV)

This is where people get that pithy catch-phrase, "God won't give you
anything you can't handle." First of all, we're not talking about God
not giving you **anything** you can't handle, we're talking about God
not allowing you to be **tempted** beyond your ability, and that's what
that piece of verse mentions. But as usual, people miss the context, and
as I've said a million times on Quora: **text, without context, is just
pretext.**

The context in this case is the rest of the verse:

> God is faithful, and he will not let you be tempted beyond your
> ability, but with the temptation he will also provide the way of
> escape, that you may be able to endure it. (ESV)

So note the reason that you will not be tempted beyond your ability:
because God will provide you the ability to ***endure*** what you are
going through.

So if you need to ***endure*** what you are going through, will it be
more than you can handle on your own?

***YES!!! Yes it will be more than you can handle!***

But that's the point! God will indeed give you more than you can handle,
**because you're not supposed to handle it alone.** The point is
*whatever God gives you, regardless of your personal ability to handle
it,* ***you will be able to handle it*** *because HE WILL PROVIDE YOU
THE ABILITY TO HANDLE IT.*

So if you're thinking your temptations are simply too powerful, if
you're thinking that the "need for sex" is just too great and you have
to satisfy it with sinful things, if you're thinking that you just can't
handle it alone, **you're right. You can't handle it alone. WITH GOD,
YOU CAN.**

**TL;DR:** God will indeed give you more than you can handle, but He
also gives you the ability to handle anything you have been given.
