**Could Trump theoretically retain power if the final outcome is
genuinely too close to call?**

1.  I hate that term, "retain power." The head of the Executive Branch
    is not a king, nor is he a dictator. There is actually very little
    "power" in the office beyond the power of persuasion.
2.  No, "power" cannot be "retained" if the outcome is too close to call
    because a Presidential election is not "one big election," but 51
    separate state elections. Those 51 elections provide *electoral
    votes* which are counted to determine who wins the Presidency. The
    only time an election is "too close to call" is if one candidate
    does not achieve the required 270 electoral votes to win. Remember,
    the end of the previous President's term is 12:00 PM on January
    20, 2021. If the current President was not re-elected, that is
    officially when he leaves office.
3.  The Constitution is very clear about exactly what will happen in the
    event that one person does not achieve 270 electoral votes: a
    *contingent election* held in the House of Representatives:\
    \
    *"Pursuant to the 12th Amendment, the House of Representatives is
    required to go into session immediately after the counting of the
    electoral votes to vote for president if no candidate for the office
    receives a majority of the electoral votes. In this event, the House
    is limited to choosing from among the three candidates who received
    the most electoral votes. Each state delegation votes en bloc, with
    each state having a single vote. A candidate is required to receive
    an absolute majority of state delegation votes (currently 26 votes)
    in order for that candidate to become the president-elect. The House
    continues balloting until it elects a president. As a consequence of
    the state delegation voting method, the party that holds the
    majority in the House could still lose the contingent election if
    the minority party holds the majority of state
    delegations."*[\[1\]](#cqGfc){#cite-cqGfc .citation_link}
