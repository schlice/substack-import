**What will be the new rules for obtaining a citizenship in the USA if
Donald J. Trump\'s new plan is going to be implemented?**

Immigration and naturalization will not be changed.

**Birthright citizenship** will only be granted to children who have at
least one parent who is a citizen of the United States. City clerks will
be required to record the birth certificates of the parents and the
birth certificates of the children in order to prove birthright
citizenship, a simple one-time process which can be done any time,
either before or after the birth, but must be done before the child
enters public school.

Of course, we'd have to grandfather in all existing birth certificates
certified by the state.
