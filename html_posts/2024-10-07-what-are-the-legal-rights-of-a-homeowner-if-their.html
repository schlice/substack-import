Currently, in nearly every jurisdiction in the United States, there is
no easement for light or air. This means that you do not have a right to
have sunlight or free airflow on your property when adjacent properties,
built according to code, block that sunlight or airflow.

People still try to argue tort claims that construction of fences is
unlawful because they believe there is a natural right to sunlight.

But for the most part in almost every jurisdiction in the US, there is
no easement for light or airflow.

Therefore, as long as the fence is built to code, and (in one specific
instance) is not a "spite fence," then the fence is allowed and the
blocking of sunlight is incidental and, while regrettable, is not a
reason to block the construction.
