**What will President Trump do about these recent shootings? Not trying
to be inflammatory, just based off of his body language and press
conferences, I cannot tell what he actually feels.**

You don't need body language and press conferences. You have Twitter.

Trump stated that he wants to expand universal background checks and he
also wants to add more white supremacists to the terror watch lists.

Adding white supremacists to terror watch lists may be beneficial.
Universal background checks is just pandering to the left and won't stop
any mass shootings.
