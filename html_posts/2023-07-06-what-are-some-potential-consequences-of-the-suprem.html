Here's the *actual* potential consequences: **anyone who refuses service
to anyone for any legally-protected reason will generate new
opportunities for other people to offer those services.**

In other words, someone is going to open up a wedding website shop
*right next door to Lorie Smith* offering wedding websites to same-sex
couples.

Any time one service person refuses to engage in a service, there should
be another service person right next door who *will* engage in that
service. And since Lorie Smith is clear about what websites she will not
build, it would be stupid simple to set up shop right next door to her
and offer that service to those people who she will knowingly refuse.

This is what we call **free-market capitalism.** Rather than being
worried that Lorie Smith won't design one particular website, or that
Jack Phillips won't sell one design of cake, be glad that the
opportunities for other website designers or other bakers *have now been
created.* Jump in there and offer those services! And then thank them
for sending all that business your way! It's like free advertising! You
do know that there is a baker **on the same street as Masterpiece Cake
Shop in Colorado** who will bake cakes for same-sex weddings, right?

And if you say "well, what happens when there is no one else available
to perform service X," I'd say, "well, then you've missed your
opportunity to provide that service!"

And what happens when enough people get on Yelp and give Lorie Smith's
business a bad rating because she refused to service them? That's right,
people who she *would* do business with choose someone else.

What's the upshot of all of this? Yes, it's true that the Constitution
prevents the state from forcing vendors to create expressive designs
speaking messages with which the vendor disagrees. So what do you do?
**Let the free market decide whose business should profit.** Vote with
your words (the First Amendment works both ways, you know). Vote with
your feet. Vote with your wallet. If you don't like Lorie Smith's
criteria for choosing her clients, don't do business with her when you
need a website built. Eventually, if enough people don't do business
with her, she'll go out of business, and it will be her own decisions
which do it.

TL;DR: Everywhere you see a *victim*, I see an *opportunity*.
