The only thing you have determined through your screen peeking is that
you found someone who:

- perhaps likes guns
- perhaps is in the market for a new gun.
- perhaps is an artist and he wants to draw a gun.
- perhaps is an author and he needs facts for his story.

See all those bullets that start with "perhaps?" That means there is
***so much about this man that you know nothing about*,** that there is
no way you can form an opinion with any certainty, let alone have any
actionable knowledge that the man has done anything wrong.

At all.

If you like guns (which I'm going to go out on a limb and say that you
don't), maybe you can strike up a conversation with him and talk about
that new bullpup rifle that was just released.

If you don't like guns (which is my guess), it's probably best to simply
ignore it.

And stop looking at other people's screens.

It's rude.
