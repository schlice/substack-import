I'm totally not even going to go down the rabbit hole of
abortion-as-population control. That was an idea floated because the
founders of Planned Parenthood were card-carrying eugenicists. What
their motivations were, I can't be certain. But I can tell you that the
Supreme Court did not have eugenics in mind when they made their
decision.

As for world religions and abortion, first of all, you can't say that
"Christianity is against abortion." There are several sub-groups within
Christianity (and other sects and cults which identify as Christian)
which have widely diverging views on abortion.

For example, the Roman Catholic Church and the Southern Baptist
Convention are strictly against abortion, even though the public
position of the SBC allows abortion in the case of saving the life of
the mother. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (Mormons)
and the Assemblies of God also are against abortion. However, the United
Church of Christ and the Unitarian Universalist Association believe that
abortion is completely permitted. The National Baptist Convention (a
historically black Protestant denomination in the US) allows each
congregation to decide their view for themselves. The Episcopalians, the
Presbyterians, and the Methodists believe that abortion is allowed, but
they temper this support with the call for some limits on when a woman
can terminate her pregnancy. For instance, while the Episcopal Church
opposes statutory limits on abortion, it teaches that "it should be used
only in extreme situations."

Outside of Christianity, there are also many differences, and other
situations which are not clear-cut. Hinduism is generally opposed to
abortion, while Reform and Conservative Jews permit it with few
exceptions. Islam has a range of views and differences about when life
begins, and thus when abortion is morally acceptable, as they have no
centralized organizational authority. Orthodox Jews are still in
disagreement amongst themselves, with rabbis and scholars continuing to
debate the issue.
