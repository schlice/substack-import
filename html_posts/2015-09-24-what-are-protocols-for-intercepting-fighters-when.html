**Content:** [What happens in any given situation is up to the NCA
(National Command Authority) and is highly dependent on the situation.
Many factors will determine what will happen during a hijacking. What
are the hijacker\'s demands? Does he want safe passage? Is he
communicating? If he\'s communicating and he stays on course, he
probably won\'t be shot down. But he\'s not \"getting away\" as it were,
because even hijacked planes have limited fuel reserves and will
eventually have to stop for gas somewhere.]{.rendered_qtext}
