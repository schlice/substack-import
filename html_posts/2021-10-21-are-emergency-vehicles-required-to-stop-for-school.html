Legally, only motor vehicles have to stop for any stop sign or light.
Emergency vehicles are not subject to the same vehicle and traffic laws
as motor vehicles.

But what is not covered explicitly by the law is usually covered by
department policy.

Most department policies are going to require emergency vehicles to come
to a complete stop and ensure the way ahead is clear before proceeding.
Most even require this before vehicles proceed through red lights.

Some departments may allow emergency vehicles to pass buses after coming
to a complete stop and ensuring visually that there are no children
present before proceeding, while others may make those vehicles wait
until the bus driver signals to the emergency vehicle that it is safe to
proceed. It will differ by jurisdiction.
