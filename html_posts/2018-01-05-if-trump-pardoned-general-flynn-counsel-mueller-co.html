Since the President has the Constitutional authority to issue pardons,
they cannot be considered obstruction of justice.

However, Congress could consider them an abuse of power and choose to
impeach because of them, although they'd have a very tough hill to climb
to explain how a president using his Constitutionally-enumerated powers
amounts to an impeachable offense.
