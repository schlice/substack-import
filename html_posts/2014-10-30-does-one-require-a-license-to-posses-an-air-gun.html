**Content:** [In the United States, an \"air soft\" gun is a toy and
does not require a license or permit. However, to appease those who
don\'t like toy guns, these toys are not normally stocked on shelves
near toys. They are usually stocked on shelves near sporting goods and
outdoor gear.\
\
Toys such as these are required to have bright orange barrels so as to
distinguish them from real guns.]{.rendered_qtext}
