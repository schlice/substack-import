<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [In the United States, an \"air soft\" gun is a toy and<br>does not require a license or permit. However, to appease those who<br>don\'t like toy guns, these toys are not normally stocked on shelves<br>near toys. They are usually stocked on shelves near sporting goods and<br>outdoor gear.\<br>\<br>Toys such as these are required to have bright orange barrels so as to<br>distinguish them from real guns.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
