**In the USAF, can you tell when an officer has graduated from the Air
Force Academy?**

Unless you see a ring or the officer tells you, no. No differences in
the uniform.

Some others are going to say, "Yeah, it's the cocky bastards who are the
grads" because they had a bad experience with a grad. I can tell you
that the vast majority of grads are not cocky bastards.

added jump wings to the mix, and he's not wrong. If you see an officer
in most any career field (but especially in ones that wouldn't normally
be jumping from airplanes) who is wearing jump wings, there's a good
chance that officer is an Academy grad. The Air Force has very few
opportunities for members to earn jump wings, and the Academy is one of
those opportunities. In fact, the Academy's Airmanship 490 class is one
of only two free-fall jump programs in the Air Force, and one of a
handful throughout the entire military (most jumps are static line).
Jump wings is one of the few devices you can earn as a cadet that you
can wear once you graduate. So it's a pretty fair bet that if you see an
officer wearing jump wings, he or she is probably a grad.
