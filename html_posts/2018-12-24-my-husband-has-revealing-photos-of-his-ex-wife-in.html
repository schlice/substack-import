**My husband has revealing photos of his ex wife in his phone. I deleted
them when he left the room and he got upset. Wouldn\'t him getting upset
mean that he still has feelings for her?**

I'm sorry this happened to you.

HOW you were able to delete them (and how you saw them in the first
place) is a totally separate discussion. Additionally, whether or not he
has feelings for his ex is also probably not a productive discussion to
have.

If he's looking at the pictures, he's thinking about his ex and not you.
The fact of the matter is that if you don't agree with his retaining
those pictures, he shouldn't retain those pictures.

Maybe you have a very open marriage wherein you don't care whose
pictures are on his phone. Maybe you have some revealing pictures on
your own phone (whether or not they are of exes).

It doesn't matter.

The bottom line is that if you don't agree with his possession of the
pictures, he should not have them. Period.
