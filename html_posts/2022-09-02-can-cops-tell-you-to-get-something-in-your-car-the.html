There are plenty of people who will tell you that this is the stupidest
question they have ever seen in this space.

There are also plenty of people who will tell you of course this
happens, and then the cops fabricate the evidence to acquit themselves.

But I'll tell you something different.

**Yes it can happen, but not because of police malice.**

It happened in the Philando Castile case.

[[Bill Stein\'s answer to After watching the dashboard cam from the
shooting of Philando Castile by police officer Yanez, what could the
officer have done to avoid a
shooting?](/After-watching-the-dashboard-cam-from-the-shooting-of-Philando-Castile-by-police-officer-Yanez-what-could-the-officer-have-done-to-avoid-a-shooting/answer/Bill-Stein)]{.qlink_container}

Without re-hashing my previous answer, Yanez gave Castile two
conflicting commands: get your license, don't reach for your gun.

When Castile said he was legally carrying a gun, he was told not to
reach for it.

Castile was stupid for trying to reach for his license when his gun was
so close to his license. When he did, Yanez shot him. Yanez was only
acquitted of murder charges because he claimed he was in fear for his
life.

But the video evidence told a different story. The video evidence showed
clearly that it was Yanez who put Castile in the bad situation in the
first place.

Remember the old adage: "Never attribute to malice that which can easily
be explained by stupidity."
