I had a sore arm after my first Pfizer shot.

I felt like I had the flu after my second. I had my shot around noon,
and by 9 PM I felt like crap. Dull headache, general malaise and
listlessness, and low-grade fever. Persisted into the next day until
later that evening, when it finally broke and I felt better. Beyond
that, nothinig.

Were there any side effects for you if you already have lupus or
