<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [(This answer is specifically tailored towards the US; UK<br>rules may be different)\<br>\<br>Documents are classified by the document creator based on the nature of<br>the information in the document, and the classification is approved by<br>the classification approval authority (usually the commander of the<br>organization producing the data). There are three major levels of<br>classification\<br>\<br>Confidential (denoted by a blue cover sheet/sticker)\<br>Secret (denoted by a red cover sheet/sticker)\<br>Top Secret (denoted by an orange cover sheet/sticker)\<br>\<br>Each level has its own specific rules about protection, dissemination,<br>and destruction of the data in that level. At the Top Secret level,<br>there are further sublevels within there, called *compartments.*<br>Information is compartmentalized based on the source of the data. For<br>example, data generated by electronic intelligence-gathering equipment<br>is segregated from information generated by other offices or other<br>systems. In order to access a specific compartment, you have to be<br>cleared to view the information in that compartment, which is<br>essentially a documented need to know (i.e. because you work in an<br>organization that regularly creates, uses, or modifies that<br>information).\<br>To destroy a classified document, it has to be past its expiration date<br>and the same authority that classified the document must approve its<br>destruction. So no, the government can\'t come in and simply destroy<br>classified data.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
