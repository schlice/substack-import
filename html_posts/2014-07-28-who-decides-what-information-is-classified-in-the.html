**Content:** [(This answer is specifically tailored towards the US; UK
rules may be different)\
\
Documents are classified by the document creator based on the nature of
the information in the document, and the classification is approved by
the classification approval authority (usually the commander of the
organization producing the data). There are three major levels of
classification\
\
**Confidential** (denoted by a blue cover sheet/sticker)\
**Secret** (denoted by a red cover sheet/sticker)\
**Top Secret** (denoted by an orange cover sheet/sticker)\
\
Each level has its own specific rules about protection, dissemination,
and destruction of the data in that level. At the Top Secret level,
there are further sublevels within there, called ***compartments.***
Information is compartmentalized based on the source of the data. For
example, data generated by electronic intelligence-gathering equipment
is segregated from information generated by other offices or other
systems. In order to access a specific compartment, you have to be
cleared to view the information in that compartment, which is
essentially a documented need to know (i.e. because you work in an
organization that regularly creates, uses, or modifies that
information).\
To destroy a classified document, it has to be past its expiration date
and the same authority that classified the document must approve its
destruction. So no, the government can\'t come in and simply destroy
classified data.]{.rendered_qtext}
