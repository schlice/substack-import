**Content:** [Churches are allowed to discriminate in their hiring
practices and what they preach. That\'s what the First Amendment allows.
But let\'s look at the ramifications of today\'s decision. I\'ll break
down each one of your points.\
\
***Allowing marriage equality would lead to people marrying animals***\
\
That\'s not going to happen. No one can honestly equate an animal to a
person. Also, the argument that we\'ll be allowing adults to marry
children will equally not stand, as there are physieological differences
between men and boys, women and girls. And the decision-making centers
in the brain are not reasonably formed until at least age 25 in men,
possibly younger in women, but the age of majority has been set at 18 in
most states. So that\'s not happening either.\
\
However, there is a cogent argument to be made that laws banning
polyamory (polygamy and polygyny) are no more or less harmful than laws
that previously banned same-sex marriage. I see legal challenges to
those laws succeeding using today\'s same-sex marriage ruling as their
legal precedent. If we have the power to re-interpret what marriage has
exclusively been, there is no reason why any law restricting a
combination of spouses should also stand. Any argument that the
plaintiff in this same-sex marriage case would have made would be
equally applicable to any argument a plaintiff in a polyamory case could
make.\
\
That said, I think we can still reasonably draw the line at people.\
\
***Churches being forced to accept and even perform weddings for
gays***\
\
It could be argued that a church could not keep its tax-exempt status if
it failed to follow Federal law. And the new law-of-the-land is that
same-sex marriages are Constitutional. You could conceivably see the IRS
denying tax-exempt status to any church that fails to follow Federal law
and perform same-sex weddings. Doesn\'t matter what the church believes.
You can choose to bury your head in the sand, but this is the first time
that the law might actually be *applicable to a church*. Federal law
says that same-sex weddings are now Constitutional, so there is no
reason that a church, which is tax-exempt under Federal law, would be
allowed to violate Federal law and refuse to marry a same-sex couple.
Any church which thus refuses could lose its tax-exempt status. So I
think this may still be a concern, and churches should brace for a new
fight. Who does this new law apply to? State governments, or churches?
Are churches still protected by the First Amendment, or will the Federal
government try to force churches to perform same-sex weddings or lose
their tax-exempt status? I would think that the broad precedent
surrounding Federal law applying to churches would stand, but this court
has now, twice in two days, overlooked the precepts of law and have
ruled in favor of public opinion. So anything\'s fair game now.\
\
***Forced hiring of gay ministers to spread the gay gospel***\
\
While the Federal government may be able to direct churches to perform
same-sex weddings or face loss of tax-exempt status, the decision to
influence churchs\' hiring practices has been debated, and lost. The
government can only protect classes of people under the civil rights
act, and gays are not listed there. This law was not changed today. A
business can still only not discriminate based on race, color, creed,
sex, or national origin. A church which does not believe in
homosexuality can still choose to not hire a gay minister.\
\
***Marriages between males and females falling apart***\
\
This has been happening for a very long time, and the government is as
much a part of the problem then as it is now. The glamorization of the
single-parent household, the weakening of divorce and adultery laws,
states advocating no-fault divorce, etc. have all led to a culture that
shows marriage\'s *impermanence*. This decision doesn\'t really
contribute to that, other than to make marriage more about the *desires
of adults* than about the *needs of children*, which was the previous
focus of the marriage law. This decision won\'t have any bearing on what
happens in the bedroom between a man and a woman. Those marriages are no
more precarious today than they were yesterday. The decision does show
that the government is suddenly less interested in the needs of
children, and more interested in the desires of adults, to the detriment
of our nation\'s children.\
\
***Gays being allowed to teach young children in schools to be
homosexual***\
\
The ruling simply says that same-sex marriage is Constitutional. So if a
school is teaching a lesson on marriage, it can teach that male/female,
male/male, and female/female marriages are all legal. It doesn\'t
influence the curriculums of schools, other than to say what is legal.\
\
Does it pave the way for further erosion of the institute of marriage?
Certainly. It can be used as a springboard to introduce all sorts of
curricula into schools. Parents can still choose, as they always have,
that their personal limits on left-leaning curriculum have been
breached, and they can change their child\'s school to a private school,
or homeschool. This will mean changes for the family (I have thought of
buying a cheaper, smaller house in a worse part of town just so I\'d
have enough money to send my kids to a private school; thankfully I
didn\'t have to, but I would). But those choices still exist for
families who disapprove of the school curriculum. It doesn\'t really
hurt the school much. They lose PPOR (Per-Pupil Operating Revenue), but
in the grand scheme of things, they\'re not too concerned that they lost
one student. And overall, most families are just going to go along with
it anyway.]{.rendered_qtext}
