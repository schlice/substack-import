Rittenhouse had a justifiable case for self defense when he reasonably
believed that there was going to be "an unlawful interference with his
person" of another person.

He could only use deadly force if he reasonably believed that such force
was necessary to prevent *imminent death or great bodily harm* to
himself.

Under Wisconsin law, his belief had to be *reasonable*. This means that
there is a *reasonableness test* which must be applied to his use of
force.

To put it in another way, would a reasonable person, in the same
situation, believe that deadly force was necessary to prevent imminent
death or great bodily harm?

In my opinion, someone pointing a gun at me or swinging a skateboard at
my skull like a baseball bat definitely constitutes a threat of imminent
death or great bodily harm.

**TL;DR:** At the moment he believed he was facing a threat of imminent
death or great bodily harm, he had a legally justified case of
self-defense in Wisconsin.

Original question:

At what point did Rittenhouse have, or would he have had (if you believe
he didn\'t that night) a justifiable case of self-defense?
