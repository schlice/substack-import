<h2>Answer Comment</h2>

*We\'ve seen recent video that leaves the reasonable citizen to question
Police reason*

First of all, you've only seen a video, which is usually a little
snippet of time. It usually doesn't show the extent of the interaction.
It rarely shows the lead-up to the officer making the decision that
deadly force is authorized. The video is not the end-all, be-all of
evidence. The camera does not "see" everything, it only sees what is
right in front of the officer. There are still things that happen on the
sides, or behind, that you never see. Generally, you only see an officer
applying deadly force. That's it. You don't see anything that happened
before. Essentially, the camera does not tell the whole story.

*We were lucky to see these videos; Police certainly have shown no
initiative to turn over this type of evidence in asking for public
critique.*

Yes, you were lucky. Normally, that video is what we call **evidence**
and the only people who are *required* to see that video, who are
*supposed* to see that video, are a judge and a jury. Unless you're
sitting on the jury, **you have no right to see that video. YOU ARE NOT
THE JUDGE, NOR ARE YOU THE JURY!** While you may think that the "court
of public opinion" is a valid place to try an officer for his actions,
while this nation is still a nation of laws (barely), everyone in this
country, including police officers, is still afforded a trial by a jury
of their peers, not a trial by YouTube comments and upvotes.

Someone wanted their 15 seconds of fame, so they posted a snippet of a
video on YouTube. In the grand scheme of things, that video is
completely and totally **irrelevant**. It **might** get submitted as
evidence, but a defense attorney would have a field day tearing the
authenticity of the video apart. We don't know if it had been edited; we
don't know what parts of that video had been cut out to make it look
like the cop shot someone without provocation. That video could be
highly inflammatory, and may never be shown to a jury. But again, it's
irrelevant. All it does is spin people like you up, and goad them into
thinking that police are mindless killers that we've loosed onto an
unsuspecting society, while statistics tell us otherwise.

What's more important is that the district attorney has enough evidence
to review to make a decision about whether or not the officer committed
a crime. The video speaks to ***a very small part*** of that body of
evidence that the prosecutor uses to determine whether or not a crime
has been committed and whether or not he would seek to charge the
officer with one.

It's also clear that you believe officers are somehow above the law and
never face scrutiny for their actions. If you shot someone, your actions
would be reviewed by the District Attorney who would determine whether
or not you committed a crime. If a police officer shoots someone, not
only will his actions face the same scrutiny by the DA, the department
will conduct a "Use of Force Review" (UOF Review), as they do for
***every*** use of force by a police officer. Use of force could be
anything from application of hands to pepper spray, baton, TASER, or
deadly force applications such as baton or firearm. That UOF Review
panel is made up of department senior staff, the officer's chain of
command, the department's legal team, and the department's training
staff. The review will focus on the officer's use of force and determine
if it was correctly employed, and whether or not it met department
policy for application of force. If not, they will determine if the
officer needs re-training in any area of employment of force, or if the
officer should face disciplinary actions, up to and including
termination. Depending on department, there can be civilians present in
UOF Review Boards to observe the proceedings, or there may be a civilian
oversight committee appointed by the Mayor which reviews the facts and
determinations of the department's UOF Reviews, to ensure that
departments are conducting them fairly and not allowing officers to "get
away with murder," so to speak. Finally, officers may now face a third
avenue of investigations, which are becoming more and more common these
days: the US Department of Justice may also conduct an independent
review of officer actions to determine whether or not the suspect's
civil rights were violated.

So as you can see, not only are officers ***highly*** scrutinized any
time they employ force, but there are civilians present at every level
of that investigation (the DA, the civilians overseeing the UOF Review
Board, and the lawyers at the DOJ) who ensure that the police are not
ignoring bad officers or summarily excusing their actions.

It appears, based on the differences in investigations between civilians
and police, that many people have asked the same questions as you, over
many years. The high level of scrutiny applied to police officers, and
the presence of civilians at every level of those investigations, would
lead the "reasonable man" to believe that police actions are very well
reviewed, and police officers can get away with very little in today's
society. If officers lack the required training, they get re-trained. If
they willingly abuse the law, they are either arrested and charged, or
they are fired, or both.

*\[N\]ot only has this citizen seen these practices play out
\'unreasonably\' in real time, most troubling of all, he\'s seen Police
continuously absolve their own of \*wrongdoing (\*another vague and
highly subject concept).*

There are over 17,000 police departments in the United States, at both
the state and local level. Most departments have their shit together and
conduct themselves ethically. But there have been plenty of examples of
police departments that have grown so large and unwieldy that corruption
has seeped in, and they end up with two modes of operation: "the way
things are supposed to be done" and "the way things are done in real
life" and those two don't match up. Your own anecdotal evidence aside, I
don't find it surprising at all that some departments have issues.

But rather than me trying to tell you what *should* be done, I want you
to go fix it. How? I want you to take your issues to the civilian
governmental body which oversees that police department. If it's a city
police department, go to City Council or the Mayor. If it's a County, go
to the Board of Commissioners. If it's a state police department, speak
to your representative in your state's Congress. Get yourself on the
citizen review boards which review UOF cases. If they don't have one,
force them to make one. Get involved. ***Be the change you want to see
in the world.*** Don't just go out and prattle on about what needs to
change; that accomplishes little. Go out and *be the change!*
