Pretty much anyone can join the department beyond the classes you noted.
If you've ever been convicted of a felony, you're out. If you're not a
US citizen, you're out. But other than that, if you're over 18 and are a
high school graduate or have your GED, you can apply. In most cases you
must also possess a driver's license and you must also have an almost
clean driving record.

All department hiring practices are different, but most require you to
have certain physical skills (be able to lift a minimum amount of
weight, have a minimum level of aerobic fitness, etc), and pass numerous
other physical, psychological, and educational tests.

In our department, you start with a written test. You then move on to
oral boards, where you make a few extemporaneous presentations in front
of command staff. If you pass those two, you move into background
checks, physical tests, psychological tests (both paper and interview),
and a CVSA (Computer Voice Stress Analysis, similar to a polygraph). If
you pass all of these, you are offered a slot in the upcoming class.

State law requires a complete application from soup to nuts for each
class. So when the department decides to do a class, it opens up testing
about four months before the class is scheduled to start. By the time
the class is set to begin, they have developed a class list for that
class.
