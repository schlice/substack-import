**Content:** [The *legality* of food found in your fridge is not
necessarily what I would question. The *safety* and *origin* of such
food would probably be of a higher concern.\
\
I would think the rules of etiquette would have you advise the third
party that they left something in your fridge and that if they didn\'t
come back for it you were going to eat it.\
\
I think there aren\'t really legal issues unless this item in your
fridge was of particularly high value (i.e. Beluga caviar or
Cristal).]{.rendered_qtext}
