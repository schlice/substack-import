<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [The *legality* of food found in your fridge is not<br>necessarily what I would question. The *safety* and *origin* of such<br>food would probably be of a higher concern.\<br>\<br>I would think the rules of etiquette would have you advise the third<br>party that they left something in your fridge and that if they didn\'t<br>come back for it you were going to eat it.\<br>\<br>I think there aren\'t really legal issues unless this item in your<br>fridge was of particularly high value (i.e. Beluga caviar or<br>Cristal).]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
