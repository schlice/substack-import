You are referring to induced pluripotent *adult* stem cells and
embryonic stem cells.

What they have in common is that they can both become any cell in the
body.

But they have differences. The big difference: adult stem cells can be
harvested from several places in the body, and they are not tumorigenic
or immunogenic. Embryonic stem cells can only be harvested from human
embryos, and they are both immunogenic and tumorigenic. Additionally,
through the harvesting process, the embryo is destroyed. So there is a
very large issue regarding the destruction of human life involved.

Oh, and induced pluripotent adult stem cells have been treating people
successfully for years, while embryonic stem cells have yet to treat a
single person successfully.
