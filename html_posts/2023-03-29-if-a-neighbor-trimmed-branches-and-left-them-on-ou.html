You can sue anyone for anything. The question remains how likely you
would be to prevail.

If you can show clear monetary damages that you suffered by the trimming
(like if the "branches" were massive and you needed to hire a company to
come cut them down to size and haul them away), you might be able to
file suit in small claims court to recover what you had to spend in
order to clean up the mess.

But what's concerning to me is that the branches your neighbor trimmed
ended up in your property. Did the neighbor trim the branches and then
throw them on to your property, in a sort of twisted "they're from your
tree, you get them" thought process? Or did they cut branches which were
inside of your property lines, and those branches fell straight down?

If it's the latter, then the person trimming the tree was wrong for
doing the trimming. They should only be trimming the part of the tree
that is over their own property. If it was the former, the person is
guilty of littering. While you could make a case out of it, it's
probably not worth anyone's time to do so. Just realize that your
neighbor is a fool, throw the branches away, and leave it at that. File
that little tidbit away in the "Information I Know About My Neighbors"
file, and keep it so you can build a profile of who your neighbors truly
are. Then, you will know how to properly deal with them in the future.
