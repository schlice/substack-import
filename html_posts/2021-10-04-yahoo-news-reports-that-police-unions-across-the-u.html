At this point in time, no one should be disputing the fact that the
vaccine can protect a person against severe COVID-19 infection. In other
words, the vaccine can save your life.

However, [[people who have been vaccinated can still get
COVID-19](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=983422&url=https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/effectiveness/why-measure-effectiveness/breakthrough-cases.html){.external_link

vaccinated can transmit COVID-19 to
others](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=dd2687&url=https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated.html){.external_link

onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="cdc.gov"}]{.qlink_container}.

So this tells us two things:

1.  The vaccine only protects you from **severe COVID-19 infection**.
    This is the infection which can lead to your death. So it behooves
    you to get the vaccine to protect yourself.
2.  Even if you are fully vaccinated, you can still get **mild COVID-19
    infection**, and you can still pass it on to others. So the vaccine
    does not prevent you from infecting other people, So if you want to
    protect yourself, the only way to do that is to be vaccinated
    yourself.

The bottom line from those two facts: **the vaccine only protects you,
not the people around you**, and **the only way you can benefit from
vaccination is if you are vaccinated, not the people around you.**

Therefore, ***vaccine mandates are pointless.***

Additionally, they fail to take into account some other things:

1.  Some people have valid religious objections.
2.  Some people cannot take vaccines.
3.  Some people (you know, around 100 million or so) have already
    contracted COVID-19 and have recovered, and therefore have no *need*
    for a vaccine.

And I'm old enough to remember "my body, my choice." But that seems to
have fallen out of favor. I guess if we can mandate what you put in to
your body, we can mandate what you keep in your body until it naturally
comes out. Sound good? Sound like a valid compromise?

Original question:

Yahoo news reports that police unions across the United States look to
stop mandatory vaccinations amongst officers. If the Biden
administration does a mandate for the general population how enforceable
will it be if the police are disputing it?
