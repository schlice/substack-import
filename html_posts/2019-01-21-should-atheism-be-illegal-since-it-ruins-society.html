**Should atheism be illegal since it ruins society?**

First of all, good luck making atheism illegal in the United States, as
the First Amendment protects your right to practice whatever religion
you choose, or no religion at all. You'll need a constitutional
amendment to undo the First Amendment if you wanted to make atheism
illegal.

Secondly, your assertion that "atheism ruins society" is completely
unsupported by fact. At worst, atheism may have personal consequences.
Atheism has never been shown to have an impact on society.

You may be trying to assert that you think that religion is important to
a society. However, the United States was not founded on religion, it
was founded on freedom. Granted, the framers of the Constitution may
have been religious men (even this is unclear), but they chose to ensure
that no one could force religion on anyone. Freedom was more important
than belief.
