Great question! While it is extremely rare to be involved in a school
shooting, we don't prepare ourselves because we know it's coming. We
prepare ourselves *in case* it comes.

There are three rules that should be followed, in order, if you ever
find yourself in any mass terror situation: **Run, Hide, Fight.** Note
that these are to be done in order: run first; if you can't run, hide;
if your hiding spot is compromised, fight.

1.  **Run**. If you are in a location and you hear shots fired, run. Get
    out whatever way you can. Service doors, fire doors, windows if
    you're on a ground floor, etc. Get yourself out, and bring as many
    people with you as you can. If you're in a public area, head toward
    a private area (for example, if you're in the gym and an attacker
    comes in the main door, head for the locker rooms, not the main
    door, to find a service door). There is absolutely no reason to be
    anywhere near such an incident. Get about a block away and regroup.
    Gather as many people from the location together with you and call
    the police. Stay on the phone with the 911 operator until you are
    told to hang up.
2.  **Hide**. *If you can't run* (because perhaps your only exit is
    blocked), it's time to hole up for a while. Find cover. Find an area
    that you may potentially be able to barricade. It could be a
    classroom, a bathroom, or a closet. Assess the situation. Inventory
    your location, and find items that might be useful to use as
    defensive weapons, like fire extinguishers, office equipment,
    cleaning supplies, etc. Be silent, be patient, and let the police do
    their job. The police will come get you when the situation is clear.
    You can be on the phone with 911 as long as it is safe to do so.
    They will keep inventory of where people are holed up and will pass
    that on to responding officers.
3.  **Fight**. We never want it to come to this, but *if the attacker
    advances on your location*, or breaks in to your barricaded room,
    this is when you fight. Remember, you're fighting for your life, and
    it's his life or yours. Don't hold back, and don't stop until he's
    disarmed and not moving. Kick, punch, claw, do what you must to
    defend yourself. Don't be afraid of the fact that he may have a gun.
    It's the *person* that is the threat, not the *gun.* Don't focus on
    the gun, focus on neutralizing the person.

These rules are pretty interchangeable for any type of mass terror
attack situation.
