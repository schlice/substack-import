**What\'s a common medical condition that most people don\'t realize
they have?**

Hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism.

Either too little or too much hormone produced by the thyroid can cause
a myriad of symptoms which are not well understood. Additionally, what
most western doctors test for regarding thyroid function (TSH) is not
nearly adequate enough to diagnose thyroid issues, and they just end up
chasing symptoms. Consequently, many with thyroid dysfunctions go
undiagnosed.

According to the [[American Thyroid
Association](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=a86c5c&url=https://www.thyroid.org/){.external_link

are suffering from some form of thyroid dysfunction, and up to **60%**
of those with thyroid disease **have no idea that they have it.** The
causes of thyroid disease are largely unknown.

Here's some other disturbing facts about thyroid disease:

- One woman in eight will develop a thyroid disorder during her
  lifetime.
- Undiagnosed thyroid disease may put patients at risk for some serious
  conditions, such as cardiovascular diseases, osteoporosis and
  infertility.
- Pregnant women with undiagnosed or inadequately treated hypothyroidism
  have an increased risk of miscarriage, preterm delivery, and severe
  developmental problems in their children.

Most thyroid diseases are life-long conditions, but can be managed with
medical attention.

That little butterfly-shaped gland in your throat is far more important
than people give it credit for.
