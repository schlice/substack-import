**Content:** [Like I mentioned, it\'s a violation of law. These laws are
usually State-level laws that are enforced by the municipality in which
the infraction took place.\
\
For example, Colorado\'s traffic rules are codified in Colorado Revised
Statutes, Section 42-4. CRS 42-4-107 states \"No person shall willfully
fail or refuse to comply with any lawful order or direction of any
police officer invested by law with authority to direct, control, or
regulate traffic. Any person who violates any provision of this section
commits a class 2 misdemeanor traffic offense.\"\
\
If a traffic officer (any traffic officer would qualify under this
section) tells you to not move your car, moving your car in direct
violation of his lawful order constitutes a class 2 misdemeanor traffic
offense, in addition to the original violation. Doing so in an unsafe
manner (putting his safety at risk) would at least be an aggravating
condition, if not a separate charge altogether.\
\
That\'s just one example from Colorado state law. Each local area can
make their own laws which match the state statute.]{.rendered_qtext}
