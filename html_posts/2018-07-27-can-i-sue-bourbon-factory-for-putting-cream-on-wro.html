In the United States, you can sue anyone for anything. The question, as
always, is whether or not you have a chance of winning.

In suits like these, you have to be able to show some *harm* was caused
to you, and since the remedy here is money, generally the harm must have
been financial.

There may have been some harm here, but in this case, I fail to see it.
So it's unlikely that such a lawsuit would succeed. However, if you
think you have a case, I'd suggest you talk to a lawyer in your area.
