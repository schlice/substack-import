**Isn\'t the fact that the Secret Service doesn\'t allow guns to be
brought to NRA conventions when the President is speaking a glaring
hypocrisy, particularly when they always trot out the good guy with a
gun line?**

No.

The only way the Secret Service disallowing guns at any one place would
be hypocritical is if they arbitrarily allow concealed firearms at one
location but disallow them in another.

In this, the Secret Service is remarkably consistent: ***ANYWHERE*** a
protected individual will attend is turned into a sterile area and no
guns are allowed. It doesn't matter if it's an NRA convention or a
Catholic church. It is contained and sterilized. Period.

So therefore, no hypocrisy.
