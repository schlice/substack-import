**Can the president send someone to jail an or get someone out because
they are president?**

The president cannot "send anyone to jail."

The president does have the power of the pardon, as it is an enumerated
power in the Constitution under Article II Section 2:

> *\[The President\] shall have power to grant reprieves and pardons for
> offenses against the United States, except in cases of
> impeachment\[.\]*
>
> The U.S. Supreme Court has interpreted this language to include the
> power to grant pardons, conditional pardons, commutations of sentence,
> conditional commutations of sentence, remissions of fines and
> forfeitures, respites, and amnesties.[\[1\]](#MaAwB){#cite-MaAwB
