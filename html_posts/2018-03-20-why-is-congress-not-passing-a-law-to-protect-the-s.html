**Why is congress not passing a law to protect the special prosecutor?**

Ummm...because they already did?

Way back in Nixon's time, there was a special prosecutor appointed, but
there were no rules at all governing him, so when he requested the
tapes, Nixon fired him and said that he didn't have the authority to
request the tapes.

Congress then passed the Ethics in Government Act (EGA) in 1977 which
created a federal process to appoint a special investigator. It provided
a basic structure controlled by the Attorney General (AG). The Act was
rolled into the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Chapter 6, because
the EGA was not renewed in 1999. CFR Chapter 6 is the law which
currently governs the Special Counsel (or Special Prosecutor). This
process gives the AG the authority to appoint a SC, as well as authority
over the SC's work.

In this case, the AG recused himself, so the current SC is overseen by
the Deputy AG.
