**Are American gun rights advocates opposed to the use of the term
\"assault rifle\"?**

No.

"**Assault rifle**" is actually a term defined by the military, and it
indicates a **select-fire** rifle. Select-fire rifles can be switched
between a mode where one bullet is fired for each trigger pull, and a
mode where more than one bullet is fire per trigger pull. You should
note that these weapons are heavily regulated in the United States with
regard to civilian use.

The term that gun rights advocates are opposed to is the term "**assault
weapon**." Now, I know right now you're probably thinking, *what's the
difference*?

The difference is that while **assault rifles** have a very clear,
accepted legal definition and are highly controlled weapons, **assault
weapons** have no clear, accepted legal definition, and can rightly
encompass virtually every revolver and semi-automatic firearm ever
created.

Generally, **assault weapons** are loosely defined by their cosmetic
features, such as handles and stocks made of black composite materials,
foregrips, collapsible stocks, bayonet lugs, etc. These cosmetic
features do not make a weapon more or less deadly, they simply make it
"scary-looking."
