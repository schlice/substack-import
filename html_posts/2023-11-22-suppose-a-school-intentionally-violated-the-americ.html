The Americans with Disabilities Act is a law related to employment. So a
school violating the Act is one which would be denying a teacher
accommodations in employment, or rejecting an applicant to become a
teacher due to a disability.

Employers who knowingly violate the ADA can face the following
consequences:

- Fines: up to \$75,000 for the first violation, and up to \$150,000 for
  the second and subsequent violations.
- Lawsuits. The Department of Justice may sue employers who fail to
  comply with ADA.

(EDIT) You may be thinking of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act,
also known as the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA).
This section of law says that schools must provide an equal education to
all students, regardless of disability. Violations of this law could
result in fines up to \$10,000 and compensatory education funded by the
subject school.
