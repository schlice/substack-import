There seems to be a great deal of confusion surrounding the fact that
God is *omnipotent* but has also given you *free will.*

Here's the thing: **simply knowing that something will happen does not
mean that you have** ***directed*** **it to happen.**

For example, if I see a pencil rolling towards the edge of a table, I
know it's going to fall off. But that knowledge doesn't *make* it fall
off.

Even more so, God has seen all of our days, because God exists *outside
of* time, and is not constrained by it. We only have visibility into the
present, because we exist within the bounds of time and space. God is
present in all times, and in all places, so he has seen everything that
has happened, and everything that will happen. But this alone does not
alter your free will.

*Knowing* what you will choose does not equal *influencing* your
decision.

Original question:

Are we really in control of our lives, or does God make our decisions
for us? Aren\'t we supposed to make our own decisions?
