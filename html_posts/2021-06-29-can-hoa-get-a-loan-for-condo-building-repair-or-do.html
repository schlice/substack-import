How the HOA chooses to finance the repair is up to them.

But ultimately, the HOA will have to repay the loan, and to do that,
they may have to increase dues, or set up a special assessment.

So one way or another, the owners will pay. It likely will not be
"cash," but it will be repaid, and the owners will do the paying.
