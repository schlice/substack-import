Let's take these one at a time.

> Is access to free online internet porn a problem for children?

**Emphatically, yes**. Pornography use **can shape sexual practices**
and is associated with unsafe sexual health practices such as not using
condoms and unsafe anal and vaginal sex. Many studies have linked porn
usage to higher instances of depression, anxiety, sexual aggression,
sexual dysfunction, and other mental health conditions. Children receive
unhealthy sexual images from adult pornography, which normalizes sexual
harm by portraying a lack of emotional relationship between consensual
partners, unprotected sexual contact, and, in some instances, violence
and rape. For the mind of a child, which does not have the area of the
brain needed to rationally parse reality from fictionalized content on
the screen, this is developmentally bad.

While this seems like an easy fix, there are no easy fixes for this
problem. Removing free pornography just kicks the problem down the road.
Children can get access to money in a variety of ways. Simply relegating
all pornographic content behind a paywall is not the answer.
