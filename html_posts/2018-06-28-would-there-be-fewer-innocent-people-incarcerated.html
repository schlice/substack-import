**Would there be fewer innocent people incarcerated if DA\'s and police
were held accountable for their mistakes?**

Sure, but the question is *how many fewer*? And at what cost to find and
fix these mistakes? What is the ROI for this exercise?

- What "mistakes" are being routinely ignored by policy?
- Who is not being held accountable?
- Where is this happening?
- Why is the Justice Department not investigating these abuses?
