**Is it illegal to keep found phone? I lost my note 9 at the golf
course. A guy 2 months later says he has it. He bought a charger for it
the day he found it. He said he had my number but it would do no good
since he had my phone. Is this criminal?**

In the United States, this is most definitely criminal.

Before you can keep something you've found, you must make a good faith
effort to return it to its rightful owner. In some states, you must get
the police involved if the item is over a certain dollar amount; check
with your local laws before you just keep something you've found.

In this case, the "finder" knows he is not the rightful owner, did not
make a good faith effort to return the item, and has actually informed
the rightful owner that his philosophy is "finders keepers, losers
weepers." This is called *theft*.

**You need to contact your mobile phone carrier and report the handset
as stolen.** Not lost, stolen. The carrier will block the IMEI number of
the handset (basically the identification number of the hardware). That
way, even if the finder tries to apply a new SIM card or program the
handset to be used on another network, the IMEI will still be flagged as
stolen and the handset will be **useless**. He won't be able to sell it
to someone else to use on another network (unless he scams them too). He
won't be able to use it as a phone anymore. Best he could do would be to
sell it for parts.
