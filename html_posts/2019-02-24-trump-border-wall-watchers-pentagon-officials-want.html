**Trump Border Wall Watchers: Pentagon Officials want to move money from
other departments to cover the shortfall in the counterdrug funds
account that has been almost completely drained. Congress has promised
to disallow the move. What will Trump do?**

Congress may have promised to disallow the move, but just like they
promised not to let Trump declare a national emergency and use the
military, they can't stop this either.

Why? ***They already wrote it into the law.***

10 USC ยง2808(a) states (emphasis mine):

> In the event of a declaration of war or the declaration by the
> President of a national emergency in accordance with the National
> Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.) that requires use of the
> armed forces, the Secretary of Defense, without regard to any other
> provision of law, may undertake military construction projects, and
> **may authorize the Secretaries of the military departments to
> undertake military construction projects**, not otherwise authorized
> by law **that are necessary to support such use of the armed forces.**
> Such projects may be undertaken *o*nly within the total amount of
> funds that have been appropriated for military construction, including
> funds appropriated for family housing, that have not been obligated.

Nothing here says that your department must be engaged in the area
affected by the national emergency before your funds can be requested,
and if your department approves the use of those funds, they can be
used.

Also relevant is 10 USC ยง284, which allows the secretary of defense to

> provide support for the counterdrug activities or activities to
> counter transnational organized crime of any other department or
> agency of the Federal Government or of any State, local, tribal, or
> foreign law enforcement agency for the purposes set forth in the
> section if requested by another Federal agency or State, local, or
> tribal governments in support of law enforcement efforts.

Those purposes include, among other things,

> \[c\]onstruction of roads and fences and installation of lighting to
> block drug smuggling corridors across international boundaries of the
> United States,

as well as

> \[t\]he establishment (including an unspecified minor military
> construction project) and operation of bases of operations or training
> facilities for the purpose of facilitating counterdrug activities or
> activities to counter transnational organized crime of the Department
> of Defense or any Federal, State, local, or tribal law enforcement
> agency within or outside the United States.

Those are pretty broad allowances given to the president during a period
of national emergency. It appears that from a plain reading of the law,
the Secretary of Defense can request allocation of funds from other
departments for use during a national emergency, and those departments
can provide those funds.
