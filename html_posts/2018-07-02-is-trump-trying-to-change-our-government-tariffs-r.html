**Is Trump trying to change our government (tariffs, removing EPA
protections, etc.) as quickly as possible before Mueller, the emolument
clause or the T. Foundation indictments remove him from the office?**

No. Trump is moving quickly because *this is what efficient government
looks like.* I know it's unusual to see administrations actually
*accomplishing something*, but this is actually what it looks like.

Trump is doing exactly what he was elected to do, and he's not wasting
any time doing it.

The Mueller probe or any other cause of action you can think of won't
actually remove him from office. Only Congress has that power. The House
must pass Articles of Impeachment, and the Senate must hold a trial
where, if he is found guilty, he can be removed from office. This
process is in the Constitution and it is the only way a sitting
President can be removed from office.

None of the causes of action you have listed would even move the needle
in the House. Even when Clinton was impeached, it wasn't because he had
an affair or had sex in the Oval Office or any of it. It was because he
lied to Congress, under oath. None of the causes of action against Trump
comes close to rising to that level, so don't expect Articles of
Impeachment to come out of the House any time soon.

Additionally, what happens if Trump is impeached? Pence becomes
president. Do you think this frenetic pace or the Trump agenda is going
to cease under President Pence? Hardly. The only thing you'll notice is
fewer speeches without a speechwriter, and fewer tweets. Everything else
will stay the same.
