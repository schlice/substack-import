This is an excellent question!

An argument from authority, also known as an appeal to authority, is a
logical fallacy that occurs when someone uses an authority\'s words to
justify an argument instead of their reasoning. The logical flow of an
argument from authority would look like this:

- Person A is an authority on a given topic.
- Person A claims proposition P is true.
- P is within the topic that A is an authority on.
- Therefore, P is true

Notice that proposition P is not proven true using investigation or
empirical evidence. Proposition P is only deemed to be true because
Person A claims that Proposition P is true. The conclusion that
Proposition P is true only relies on the word of Person A, who happens
to be an authority within which Proposition P exists.

An example of an argument from authority is, "I have been a lawyer for
thirty years, and I am telling you that the fair use law is a sham."
Notice that I have provided no evidence that the fair use law is a sham.
You would have to rely on my word as an expert in the field of law if
you wanted to rely on the truth of my statement.

So is believing the Bible following an argument from authority?

In order to answer this, we must determine:

1.  if the Bible is an authority
2.  if the Bible tells you to believe it without evidence
3.  if people believe the Bible without investigation, only relying on
    its word as an authority.

Let's take a look at each of these and see if we can determine if the
action of belief in the Bible is following an argument from authority.

**1. Is the Bible an authority on a given topic?** I believe we have
strong evidence that the Bible is indeed an authority on the topic of
Christian belief. In fact, the Bible is the *only* source of authority
for a Christian. The Bible does indeed claim to be the inspired word of
God, in several places, but probably most directly telling is 2 Tim
3:16--17:

> *All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking,
> correcting and training in righteousness, so that the servant of God
> may be thoroughly equipped for every good work. (ESV)*

It doesn't get much clearer than that. **All** Scripture is God-breathed
("breathed out" by God). Therefore, it is not incorrect to claim that
the Bible is the inspired word of God, and is therefore an authority on
the same word of God, as well as being the authority on the topic of
Christian belief.

**2. Does the Bible tell you to believe it without evidence?** So this
is a tricky one to wrap our heads around, because it ties directly into
point 3. But let's stay focused on what the Bible says to do. The Bible,
in fact, does not tell you to believe it without evidence. In fact, it
commands believers to do exactly the opposite. Just look at this
exchange between Jesus and a lawyer:

> "Teacher, which is the great commandment in the Law?" And He said to
> him, "'You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with
> all your soul, and with all your mind.' This is the great and foremost
> commandment." --- Matthew 22:34--35 NASB

How exactly do you love the Lord your God *with all your mind*? You use
your mind! You think about what you believe. You investigate the truth
of what's being taught to you. Lest you think this is just me blathering
on to try to make a point (thus creating my own appeal to authority), it
is actually the Bible which talks about people questioning what is being
taught to them, and to test it against the Bible. The Bereans examined
what they heard by comparing it to the Old Testament Scriptures. The
fact that they honestly listened and conducted further personal research
led many Bereans to faith in Jesus as the Messiah. The Bereans are the
perfect Biblical example of testing what you hear.

Additionally, believing without evidence is what's called "blind faith."
The Bible talks about blind faith in Hebrews 11:1 and 6, the Bible
appears initially to define faith as blind belief, or believing in
things that are not seen. However, this verse is instead about believers
who *trusted in God\'s faithfulness based on His past actions*. They
reasoned that if God was faithful in the past, then they could trust Him
to be faithful in the future, including in the fulfillment of his
promises. Therefore, believers can trust the Bible based on God's
fulfillment of His past promises. If He was faithful before, you can
trust that He will be faithful again.

**3. Do people believe the Bible without investigation?** Sadly, many
Christians, knowing that the Bible, as a whole, is the inspired word of
God, trust it without question. While they arrive at the same place,
they do so without using their minds. They do so without investigation,
without question. The disciple Thomas would not believe that Jesus had
risen from the dead until he put his hand in Jesus' side (where the
spear pierced Him) and touched the nail holes in His hands. Fortunately
for Thomas, he had the opportunity to do just this, and he believed. But
as Jesus goes on to say, "Blessed are those who have not seen and yet
believed" (John 20:29). So while it's not the investigation, but the
belief, that matters, Jesus does not discount the investigation. He does
not tell Thomas that he is wrong for investigating before belief, only
that those who believe without investigation are also okay.

**ANALYSIS:** So what does all of this tell us? The Bible is indeed an
authority on God's word as well as on Christian theology. But the Bible
does not tell people to believe it without question. The Bible allows
for people to believe without investigation. The Bible does not condemn
those who believe without investigation, and therefore neither should
we.

**CONCLUSION:** Belief in the Bible without investigation cannot rightly
be categorized as part of the argument from authority fallacy, because
the Bible does not direct anyone to believe it without question or
investigation. While Christianity, and the teachings of Christ, allow
for this type of belief, it does not demand that it be believed without
investigation. Certainly, the Bible purports to be an authority on
Christianity. It purports to be God's word, and Christians are right to
trust it and to put their faith in it. But it does not demand that one
do this without question.

Therefore, belief in the Bible does not constitute following an argument
from authority.
