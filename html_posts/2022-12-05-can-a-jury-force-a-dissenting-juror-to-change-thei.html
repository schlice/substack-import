*Force?* No, a jury cannot *force* a dissenting juror to change their
mind. They may attempt to *pressure* the juror to do so, often bemoaning
the fact that if they continue to deliberate but continue on past the
end of the day, they may end up being sequestered for the night (but
more importantly, they have to come back the next day to keep going).
The jury foreman should prevent juries from devolving into pressuring
any one juror to change their mind. If the fact is that all of the
jurors are confident in their votes, and none of the jurors have any
questions about the facts as presented, then a non-unanimous decision
means that the jury is *deadlocked.* The foreman should make sure that
everyone's questions are answered, but should ensure that no one feels
pressured into changing their votes.

If the jury finds themselves hopelessly deadlocked, the jury is
considered ***hung***. This leads to a **mistrial**. No decision is
made. It is then up to the state to decide if they are going to re-try
the case in front of another jury, or the plaintiff or the state may
simply decide to not re-try the case and the case is dropped.
