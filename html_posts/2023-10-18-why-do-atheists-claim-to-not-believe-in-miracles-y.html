Before we can answer that question, we must discuss what a miracle is.

But before we can answer *that* question, we must discuss how God chose
to deliver His Word.

*(I apologize for the length of this answer, but the background is
exceedingly important to detail up front in order to fully grasp the
argument)*

\

We are all aware that God has communicated to us through His creation as
well as through our morality/conscience through what we call *general
revelation*. This informs us that He exists, and gives us basic ideas
about His existence, power, and moral requirements.

But how can He give us more details about Himself so that we can
understand His ultimate purpose for us?

He can't do face-to-face conversations, as His power would be so
awe-inspiring and overwhelming as to override our free will and coerce
us to love Him and believe in Him. He does not desire that.

So how else could He have given us information about Himself? Perhaps
God has manifested Himself in some way to a select group of people over
many centuries and inspired them to write down what they witnessed and
heard from Him. Written language is a precise medium of communication
that can easily be duplicated and passed on to succeeding generations,
yet it also can be easily ignored by those who freely decide that they
don't want to be bothered with God. So a book would work as a valid but
not overpowering means of communication from God. This fits with God
being able to deliver a concise message but still allow people the free
will to accept or reject it.

But whose book? Has God communicated through the book of the Jews, the
book of the Christians, or the book of the Muslims? How are we supposed
to tell whose book, if any, is really a message from God?

In the days before mass communications, kings would *authenticate* their
messages with a **seal**. The king would place a dollop of hot wax on
the scroll with his message, and he would press his seal into it. This
seal would be a sign to the recipient of the message that the message
was authentic---it really came from the king and not from someone just
posing as the king. Of course to make this system work, the seal needed
to be unusual or unique, easily recognizable, and it had to be something
only the king possessed.

So how did God authenticate His message?

**Miracles**.

Miracles are unusual and unique, easily recognizable, and only God can
do them. Even atheists, by demanding a sign from God, are implicitly
admitting that miracles would prove His existence.

Miracles are, by definition, a special act of God that interrupts the
normal course of events. Atheist Antony Flew put it well: "A miracle is
something which would never have happened had nature, as it were, been
left to its own devices." If God actually works in this way, then a
miracle confirms the message and the sign confirms the sermon. Or, to
put it another way, a miracle is an act of God to confirm the word of
God through a messenger of God.

So is the beginning of the universe a miracle? The outspoken atheist
David Hume said the following about why you shouldn't believe in
miracles, and his definition explains why he would not consider the Big
Bang a believable miracle:

1.  Natural law is by definition a description of a regular occurrence.
2.  A miracle is by definition a rare occurrence.
3.  The evidence for the regular is always greater than that for the
    rare.
4.  A wise man always bases his belief on the greater evidence.
5.  Therefore, a wise man should never believe in miracles.

If those first four premises are true, then the wise man should never
believe in miracles. *But are they true?* Not necessarily. Premise 3 is
not necessarily true. Here's some examples:

1.  **The origin of life happened only once.** It was a rare,
    unrepeatable event, yet every naturalist believes that life arose
    spontaneously from non-life somewhere on the earth or elsewhere in
    the universe.
2.  **The origin of new life forms also happened only once.** Those
    rare, unrepeatable events are nevertheless dogmatically believed by
    most naturalists, who say it all happened by unobserved (i.e., rare)
    macroevolutionary processes.
3.  In fact, **the entire history of the world is comprised of rare,
    unrepeatable events.** For example, David Hume's own birth happened
    only once, but he had no trouble believing it occurred!

In every one of those counterexamples, Hume's third premise must be
considered false. Therefore, Hume must disbelieve his own premise about
the origin of life and the origin of new life forms. He must also
disbelieve his own birth!

So the issue is not whether an event is regular or rare. The issue is
whether we have **good evidence** for the event. We must *weigh*
evidence for the event in question, not *add* evidence for all previous
events.

But as you rightly noted, atheists do not want to deal directly with the
flaws in Hume's argument, which tells us that their disbelief in
miracles is probably more a matter of the will than of the mind. It
seems as though some people uncritically cling to David Hume's argument
because **they simply don't want to admit that God exists.**

*But since we know that God exists, miracles are possible. Any argument
against miracles that can be concocted, including that of David Hume, is
destroyed by that one fact.* For if there is a God who can act, there
can be acts of God (miracles).
