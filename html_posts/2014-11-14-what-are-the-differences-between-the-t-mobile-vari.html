**Content:** [Hardware: No difference at all. The hardware runs on both
networks interchangeably.\
Software: Both carriers took Samsung\'s TouchWiz operating systems and
modified it, adding their own proprietary software to the OS which allow
it to work seamlessly with their specific networks. In addition, they
\"SIM-lock\" the devices to only allow SIMs for their specific networks.
Once the contract is up, the carriers will unlock the device so that
they can install a SIM from another GSM provider.]{.rendered_qtext}
