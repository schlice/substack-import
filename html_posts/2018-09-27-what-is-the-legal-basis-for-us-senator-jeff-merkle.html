**What is the legal basis for US Senator Jeff Merkley\'s request that a
Federal Court issue an injunction to stop the Senate from voting on the
confirmation of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh? Would the Senate
be bound by such an injunction?**

The courts have no legal authority to control the workings of the Senate
in exercising its authority under the Constitution. The Senate has the
right to conduct its duties in the manner in which it sees fit. If Sen.
Merkley has an issue with how the Judiciary Committee is conducting
itself, he can bring his complaint to the Rules Committee. But
ultimately, it has nothing to do with how the Senate does business; the
White House has decided what documents it is going to release, and what
documents it will retain under Executive Privilege. Sen. Merkley is
claiming that the Senate cannot perform its "advice and consent" role
without the documents, and anyone with half a brain knows that they
absolutely can. If the Senate feels they don't have enough information,
they can simply vote no. There, advice and consent given. Constitutional
question solved.

This is literally nothing more than a continuation of the Democrats'
grandstanding and doing everything in their power to delay the vote on
Judge Kavanaugh until after the mid-term elections. It's just that with
stupid stunts like this, they show their *desperation.*

Democrats know that if they can stop the vote, they have a path to win
the Senate. And if they win the Senate, they can prevent a second Trump
SCOTUS nominee from being seated, ***which is their ultimate goal.***
