**If the American constitution was amended to give Cabinet secretaries
and officials power to subpoena Congress, submit legislation to
Congress, even vote on legislation, along with long, fixed terms, what
might that look like?**

It would look like a further erosion of a government by and of the
people, and a further step towards a future of laws and policy being
enacted by the unelected bureaucracy, and control by a federal
dictatorship of hundreds of offices of unelected bureaucrats, further
sliding America towards bureaucratic despotism.

Cabinet secretaries are appointed positions by the President, not voted
on by the people. At least in the original construction of the
government, the House was elected by the people, so they had a voice
when legislation was proposed. Remember the rallying cry around the
Boston Tea Party? "No taxation without representation!" The House
provided that representation, with legislation proposed and written by
legislators directly elected by, and therefore directly accountable to,
the people.
