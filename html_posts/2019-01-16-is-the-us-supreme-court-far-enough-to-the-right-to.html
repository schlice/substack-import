**Is the US Supreme Court far enough to the right to allow mandatory
teaching of the Bible in public schools?**

The Supreme Court is not "left" or "right." They either are "strict
constructionists." wherein they interpret laws against the text of the
Constitution and its understanding at the time it was written, or they
are "living Constitutionalists," wherein the interpretation of the
Constitution changes with the times, since the Constitution is too
inflexible to change appropriately. It just so happens that those who
believe in the strict construction of the Constitution happen to be more
conservative in their views, and those who believe in the "living
Constitution" view tend to be more liberal in their views.

The problem that teaching the Bible presents is one of "separation of
church and state." It would be very difficult to teach the Bible without
it appearing that the state is sanctioning or endorsing a religion, in
violation of the First Amendment. I don't think that a state can
effectively teach the Bible without giving the appearance of state
sponsorship. Even if, as this Florida legislator would mandate, they
\"follow all state and federal laws and guidelines in maintaining
religious neutrality and accommodating the diverse religious views,
traditions, and perspectives of all students in the school.\" They may
do that, but they're still teaching the Bible, and that is the religious
text for only a few religions, but primarily Christian and Jewish
religions.
