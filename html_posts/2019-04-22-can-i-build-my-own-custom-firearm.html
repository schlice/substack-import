**Can I build my own custom firearm?**

My kids ask me, "can I have a cookie?" I answer them, "I'm certain you
can. Your hands work, and if you get a cookie, they will be able to
direct that cookie into your mouth, and last I checked, your mouth still
works."

At which point they roll their eyes at me and then grudgingly say,
"***may*** I have a cookie?" And then after a short pause, I'll say,
"yes you may."

Back to the question:

***Can*** **you build your own custom firearm?** The answer is it
depends on how much skill you have at gunsmithing. As [[Terry
Baird](https://www.quora.com/profile/Terry-Baird-9)]{.qlink_container}
mentioned, the AR platform is one of the most customizable rifle
platforms on the planet, and with all sorts of replacements and
attachments, you can build a really incredible custom firearm with a
limited amount of gunsmithing knowledge.

***May*** **you build your own custom firearm?** The answer is
generally-speaking, yes, depending on which state you live in. That
said, whether you buy or build, in the end, you will have a functioning
firearm, and that firearm is subject to all of the laws surrounding the
firearm in question where you live.

One thing you **cannot** do in any state is build a functioning
***automatic*** firearm, since that is restricted under federal law. An
automatic firearm is one which fires more than one bullet with one
trigger pull. No automatic firearms which have been built since 1986 can
be registered by civilians.
