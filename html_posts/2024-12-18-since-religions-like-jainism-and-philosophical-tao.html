They should. Atheism is indeed a religion, but of course, as with all
things, this depends on how you classify "religion."

Atheists tend to hold a very narrow definition of religion, saying that
the term only applies to groups who believe in some form of deity, be it
a monotheistic deity or a pantheistic deity.

However, I tend to hold a much broader definition of religion. I
consider Monotheism, Pantheism, and Atheism as the three major religious
worldviews. Clearly, only monotheism and pantheism believe in God, where
atheism specifically does not believe in God. However, all three are
very specific worldviews, and they all make mutually exclusive truth
claims. Many of those truth claims can be evaluated through scientific
and historical investigation.

For example, most monotheists say that the universe had a beginning,
while most atheists and pantheists say that it did not. These are
*mutually exclusive claims*: either the universe began to exist, or it
did not. They can't both be right. By investigating the history and the
nature of the universe, we can reasonably conclude that one answer is
right and the other one is wrong.

Religion is not the only area of inquiry attempting to solve that
particular problem: science attempts to solve that as well. So religion
and science often are looking at the same questions. The important thing
to note is that science and religion are not mutually exclusive as some
tend to claim.
