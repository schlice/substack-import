Whether or not you respect my bullshit views is your<br>business.\<br>\<br>My mom used to tell me that if I didn\'t have anything nice to say,<br>don\'t say anything at all. I\'m not going to tell you that. What I will<br>say is that on Quora, if you don\'t have anything constructive to say,<br>or if you are not contributing to the discussion in some meaningful way,<br>don\'t bother answering.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/The-Holy-Quran-said-2-62-Surely-those-who-believe-and-those-who-are-Jews-and-the-Christians-and-the-Sabians-whoever-believes-in-Allah-and-the-Last-day-and-does-good-they-shall-have-their-reward-from-their-Lord-and-there-is-no-fear-for-them-nor-shall-they-grieve-Any-comments/answer/Lee-Crocker-1<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
