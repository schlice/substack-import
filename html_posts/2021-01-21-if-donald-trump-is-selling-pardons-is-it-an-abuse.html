**If Donald Trump is selling pardons, is it an abuse of power, and is it
punishable or reversible?**

If credible evidence were presented to Federal law enforcement, it would
violate several Constitutional provisions and probably a few Federal
statutes as well. The person paying for a pardon would be charged with
Bribery of a Public Official (18 USC ยง 201), and the president could be
charged with Use of Public Office for Private Gain (CFR 5 ยง 2635.702).

The appropriate remedy is impeachment and removal from office, followed
by Federal indictment.

However, the pardons themselves are not reversible. You can't overturn a
valid pardon, so the only recourse would be to try to establish that the
pardon itself was invalid.

We already know that the DOJ in December uncovered [[a plot to try to
bribe the president into issuing
pardons](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=3bb7f3&url=https://time.com/5916954/justice-department-white-house-pardon-bribery/){.external_link

of a question as you may think.
