Hello [[Sijin
Mo](https://www.quora.com/profile/Sijin-Mo)]{.qlink_container}, thank
you for posting this question.

It is clear from your (very slim) profile that you are a supporter of
China and the CCP. Nothing wrong with that. You do you.

But it's also clear from your profile that you have some pretty
interesting thoughts about the future of the United States:

Yeah, you don't really know all that much about the United States if you
think that "the future of the United States" involves us removing states
from the Union.

Can you see what we might think if you declare your love for China and
the CCP...

and then ask "statements phrased like questions" about the future of the
United States?

Now, is it possible you're a troll? Yes. In fact, it's virtually
guaranteed that this is a fake troll account. But it's just as possible
that you're a real supporter of China and the CCP.

With that backdrop, should we even think to answer the question?

I can understand someone who embraces socialism would think that "giving
up personal safety" is a great way to ensure public safety.

But as you probably are already aware, *that's not us*. We are not a
nation of socialists. We do not believe in a government leading us to
common good. Ben Franklin said, "Those who would give up essential
Liberty, to purchase a little temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty
nor Safety." We live like that. We believe in *individuals* working
together to achieve more, and government being a "necessary evil" which
performs limited, well-defined functions and nothing more.

\

But anyway, I digress. I needed to answer the question, lest my answer
be collapsed for not actually answering the question.

Not that you really care. You're not really interested in my answer.
You're interested in making statements thinly veiled as questions.
