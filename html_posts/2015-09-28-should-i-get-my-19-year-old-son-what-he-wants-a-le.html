**Content:** [Depends on your parenting style.\
\
I know some people that make their kids buy their own cars. Some will
buy their kids a used but reasonable car. And others will buy their kids
better cars than they themselves own.\
\
I can\'t tell you what\'s right for you. What\'s right for you is up to
you as a parent. I can only tell you what I\'d do. What I\'d do is
almost certainly different than what you\'d do, which is why it\'s tough
to answer this question.\
\
I think from a practical perspective (not a parenting perspective),
buying your kids a luxury car costs more overall than buying your kids a
non-luxury car. Besides the cost of the car, the cost of maintenance,
the cost of insurance, and other incidental costs will all be higher. So
practically speaking, the luxury car will cost you *more* in the long
run than a cheaper car.\
\
What car he has will make no difference in his life whatsoever. He has
the freedom afforded by a car, and I can tell you from my own
perspective that kids will be thrilled with whatever car they have, and
they will baby the heck out of it (wash/wax, vacuumed floors, it will
look better than his room).\
\
I would probably add though that buying a luxury item brings with it a
whole host of associated worries. I had a friend who actually has a
\$8,000 watch (it was an inherited piece). He hated wearing it. Every
time his arm brushed up against something, he immediately thought, \"Oh
no, is the watch okay?\" He was totally self-conscious every time he
wore it. So he got a nice display case for it and bought a \$10 watch to
wear daily. Who knows, maybe he\'ll wear it on special occasions. Maybe
not. But he worries much less now.]{.rendered_qtext}
