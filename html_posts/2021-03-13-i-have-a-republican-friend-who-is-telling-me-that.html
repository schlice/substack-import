**I have a Republican friend who is telling me that the \$1,400 stimulus
check is not coming and that it is only democratic propaganda. Is he
right, or has my friend lost his marbles?**

Your friend may have lost his marbles.

I'm not sure about that. What I am sure about is that the latest
stimulus has indeed been approved, and checks should start coming out
this next week. The income limits for those to receive the maximum
amount will remain the same as the last stimulus checks, and it is all
based off or your adjusted gross income, or AGI. Individuals who earn up
to \$75,000 in adjusted gross income, heads of household up to
\$112,500, and married filing jointly with AGI up to \$150,000 will get
the full \$1,400 per person.

This time, however, the amount gets reduced much quicker. Payments will
be capped at \$80,000 per individual, \$120,000 for heads of household
and \$160,000 for married couples. People at those adjusted gross income
levels and above will not get a check.
