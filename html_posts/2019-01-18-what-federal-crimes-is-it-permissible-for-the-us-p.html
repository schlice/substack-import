**What federal crimes is it permissible for the US president to commit
while in office and not be indicted while in office? If any, what are
the applicable laws?**

You have some mixing of issues here.

The President is not *immune* from laws; he's not above the law. He's
still an American citizen. That said, the President cannot be *indicted*
**while he is in office**. He has to be out of office before he can be
indicted.

Therefore, if a president commits a "high crime or misdemeanor," the
Constitutional remedy would be impeachment, removal from office, and
*then* indictment for his crime.
