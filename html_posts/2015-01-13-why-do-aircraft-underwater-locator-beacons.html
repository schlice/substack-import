**Content:** [First part has been answered already:\

[[Why does an aircraft\'s underwater locator beacon only last for \~30
days after the plane crashes? How is the beacon\'s \"pinger\" powered?
What would be the technical difficulties with extending the lifetime of
the beacon\'s
pinger?](https://www.quora.com/Why-does-an-aircrafts-underwater-locator-beacon-only-last-for-30-days-after-the-plane-crashes-How-is-the-beacons-pinger-powered-What-would-be-the-technical-difficulties-with-extending-the-lifetime-of-the-beacons-pinger)]{.qlink_container}\
\
I am not certain about testing individual beacon brands, but I\'m
certain that any limitation on testing is due to cost.\
\
Based on their specifications, a 37.5 kHz (160.5 dB) ULB can be
detectable 1--2 kilometres (0.62--1.24 mi) from the surface in normal
conditions and 4--5 kilometres (2.5--3.1 mi) in good conditions. A 37.5
kHz (180 dB) beacon can be detected 4--5 kilometres (2.5--3.1 mi) in
normal conditions and 6--7 kilometres (3.7--4.3 mi) in good conditions.
A 10 kHz (180 dB) beacon can be detected 7--9 kilometres (4.3--5.6 mi)
in normal conditions and 17--22 kilometres (11--14 mi) in good
conditions.\
\
So even the shortest range beacon can be detected at almost 16,000 feet
under good ocean conditions.]{.rendered_qtext}
