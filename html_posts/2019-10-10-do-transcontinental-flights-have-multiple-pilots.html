**Do transcontinental flights have multiple pilots?**

No.

Transcontinental flights (meaning flights from one coast of the United
States to the other coast) are not in the air long enough to require
more than one pilot.

If you actually meant *intercontinental* flights, then yes, they not
only have multiple pilots, but they usually have two complete cabin
crews.
