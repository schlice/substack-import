**Do police take it seriously when someone they arrest says they are
going to kill them?**

They may not take the threat seriously at that moment, but communicating
a threat to a law enforcement officer is a crime (it may have a
different name in your jurisdiction), and the officers will gladly add
another line to the charging document, especially when the suspect is so
willing to add to his own list of charges. Sure, we'll be happy to
oblige!

Not to mention, if the suspect were literally stupid enough to actually
try something after he was released, it's important that the
communicated threat was documented to show the connection to the
previously charged crime.
