After the last Walmart robbery, is it time to close all the Walmarts?

After the last car crash, is it time to remove all the cars from all the
people?

Don't you think you might be focusing on the wrong thing? Isn't it just
as bad as "After the latest school shooting, is it time to make everyone
turn in their guns?"

I've said it a number of times today. Why did the shooter choose that
school over the others she had in mind? This one had no armed security.

Let that sink in. She specifically chose this school because it was the
softest target. She may have been mentally unstable, with a warped set
of values, but she wasn't stupid; she knew that going up against armed
resistance wouldn't allow her to kill all the people she planned on
killing before she gets taken out.

- Allow teachers to carry concealed firearms, like they do outside the
  school.
- Get armed school security. The school district should provide at least
  one armed guard for every school.
- Have school resource officers. Partner with local authorities to post
  up SROs at all schools.
- Tighten down weak points. Do full security audits on all facilities,
  and budget in security improvements.

***BUT ALL IN ALL, DO WHATEVER IT TAKES TO PROTECT OUR CHILDREN!***
