**What are some situations where you are legally permitted to resist
police arrest?**

There is no law in any state in which I am aware that allows you to
lawfully resist a lawful arrest.

Whether or not an arrest is deemed lawful is a determination made by the
court, not at the side of the road. Therefore, if the officer is
operating "under color of law," you must assume the arrest is lawful
until you can prove otherwise in court.

Therefore, you have no legal recourse to resist arrest, since you cannot
prove during the situation that an arrest is unlawful. You would have to
defend yourself against assault charges in court later on **(which is
very rarely successful)**, rather than allowing the arrest to take place
and then proving the arrest unlawful and having the entire arrest thrown
out.
