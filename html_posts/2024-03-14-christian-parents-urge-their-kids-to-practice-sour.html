Be wary of the logical fallacy called "hasty generalization." You're
taking what *some* Christian parents do and you are generalizing and
assuming that *all* Christian parents do this, when you have no evidence
of this.

I will absolutely agree with you that *some* Christian parents do this,
because they themselves never question the Bible.

There is an entire discipline within religion called ***apologetics.***
Apologetics is the practice of defending religious beliefs through
discourse and systematic argumentation. It\'s also a branch of Christian
theology that studies and defends Christianity (commonly referred to as
Christian Apologetics, for obvious reasons). Apologetics involves using
historical, evidential, and reasonable facts to defend Christian
theology. For example, apologetics might consider if the Bible is
trustworthy, if God exists, and how to know if Jesus died. In my own
apologetics studies, I have examined each of these topics.

Not every Christian studies apologetics, because **doing so is not
necessary for salvation.** Perhaps you think it to be intellectually
lazy, and you are entitled to that opinion. However, the truth that
apologetics are not required for salvation doesn't change based on your
opinion.
