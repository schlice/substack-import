In truth, the Bible is really unclear on exactly what happens in Heaven,
but it gives us a few clues.

Oddly enough, Pastor J.D. Greear *just talked about this* to The Summit
Church here in Raleigh, NC this past Sunday. His words answer your
question perfectly. Rather than me trying to distill down what he said,
let me reproduce it for you here (edited for clarity):

> Let's be honest: Some of us secretly are worried about heaven. We're
> afraid it's gonna be boring---endless days of purposeless leisure
> where we sit around in diapers on colorless clouds strumming our harps
> and sipping non-alcoholic piÃ±a coladas. Our only real activity is
> gathering twide a day for choir practice. And you think, "This doesn't
> sound fun."
>
> But the Bible describes heaven as a "renewed heavens and earth,"
> meaning that heaven is not so much a *replacement* of the old as it is
> a ***renewed version*** of it, with all the curse removed and now
> supercharged with the glory of God.
>
> That means EVERYTHING you loved down here---the mountains, the rivers,
> the oceans, animals, solar systems, and even extreme sports that I
> never got to experience here---is waiting for you there, in glorified
> form.
>
> In fact, the Apostle John goes so far as to say, Revelation 21:26,
> that God will "bring into heaven the glory and honor of the nations,"
> which means he'll bring into the new heavens and new earth the best of
> our cultures---the best Italian food, the best architecture, the best
> art, Mardi Gras (without the debauchery), Disney World (without the
> heat and the lines), the Jersey Shore (without the...Jersey).
>
> And that means *everything we missed out on here we'll get to
> experience (in abundance!) there.* You never got to go to Hawaii? No
> big deal, the heavenly version will be better. Never got to fly to the
> moon? No big deal, you'll probably be able to fly up on your own up
> there. Maybe you missed out on marriage here, or a good one---don't
> worry, something better is just around the corner. There's no marriage
> in heaven, but Scripture says whatever state we're in up there is
> better than marriage.
>
> So, ANYTHING you miss out on here---friends, good health,
> anything---you get in abundance there. (By the way---I can't prove
> this, but I'm pretty sure that in heaven all the foods that are bad
> for you here are good for you there, and vice versa. There, ice cream
> is good for the waistline, while cauliflower makes you gain weight.
> Like I said, I can't prove that, you know, but these things are
> spiritually discerned.)
>
> We don't know all that we'll be capable of physically in the
> resurrection, but Jesus' resurrection is supposed to give us some
> hints, and with His resurrected body, Jesus ate meat, could fly, and
> walked through walls.
>
> I've always wanted to climb Mt. Everest. My wife tells me it's off the
> table until my kids at least graduate college. And by that time, I may
> not be physically able and so I may never get the chance. But that's
> okay, because in heaven I'm confident I'll get to climb the renewed
> one, which will be a lot better anyway. And when I get to the top,
> I'll fly over to the heavenly Tuscany for dinner.
>
> Paul tells us, "What no eye has seen, no ear has heard, and no human
> heart has conceived---God has prepared these things for those who love
> him" (1 Corinthians 2:9). (In plain speak, that means that if you can
> think it, it's not awesome enough. That's pretty fantastic because I
> can think of some pretty cool things. Heaven likely will have all of
> them, plus a bunch of other stuff I can't even conceive of yet.)
>
> By the way, remind me---why do I need a bucket list? Whatever I miss
> out on here I've got eternity to enjoy up there. I seek a city with
> foundations, whose designer and builder is God.
>
> And of course, the greatest thing about heaven is that God himself,
> the source of all these beautiful things, is there and we get to be
> with him forever. That's the essence of heaven---being with
> God.[\[1\]](#pIHaY){#cite-pIHaY .citation_link}
