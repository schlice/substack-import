**Is a round more powerful coming from a light machine gun compared to
an assault rifle? For example, a 5.56 mm coming from an M249 SAW
compared to an M4 (using the exact same round).**

Barely, but so little so that it is hardly worth mentioning.

The muzzle velocity of the M249 SAW is 915 m/s (3001 fps). The muzzle
velocity of the M4 is 910 m/s (2970 fps). This difference is probably
attributable to the longer barrel in the SAW imparting more energy to
the round than the M4 can.

But not much.
