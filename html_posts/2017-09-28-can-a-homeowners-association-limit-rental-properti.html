In general, HOAs have broad latitude to control the activities that take
place within their area of control.

Check you Association documents (your Covenants, and especially your
PPR&R \[Policies, Procedures, Rules & Regulations\] Document) to
determine what specifically your HOA requires when it comes to renting
your property.
