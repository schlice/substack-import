**Can I be arrested for lying to the police if no other issues were
found?**

No, with caveats.

Lying to the police is not illegal. You cannot be arrested for lying to
the police. If the police can lie to you, you can lie to them. Some
people lie because they are embarrassed about what they did. Some don't
want the truth about what they did to come out. And some are trying to
conceal their own illegal actions. But the actual lie is not illegal.

For example, if you stole a bicycle, and the police ask you about it and
you say no, you wouldn't be arrested for lying to the police. If they
found evidence to show that you were the bike thief, you'd be arrested
for stealing the bike. Your testimony would be used in court if it was
admissible.

The exception is when you are lying *specifically to aid a criminal and
to misdirect the police.* If you do this, you are committing a crime
called being an *accessory after the fact*. You could also be cited for
*aiding and abetting,* or *filing a false statement,* depending on the
circumstances.

Finally, Federal investigators are protected by a different law, and
providing materially false information to a Federal investigator is, in
fact, a crime. Just ask Mike Flynn.
