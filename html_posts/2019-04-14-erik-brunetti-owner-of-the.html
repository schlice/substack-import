**Erik Brunetti, owner of the "FUCT" clothing brand, will appear before
the Supreme Court to challenge a federal trademarking law that allows
officials to refuse trademarks that they deem "scandalous" or "immoral."
Can he win?**

He should win, and it's the very nature of the way that trademarks are
reviewed that should cause him to win.

First of all, the trademark office has been inconsistent with its
application of its own policy, which speaks against the state's
interest. Because the restriction on scandalous/immoral marks has been
so haphazardly applied, then perhaps the restriction is not as narrowly
tailored as previously thought. The government attributes
inconsistencies to "changes in contemporary attitudes and organic
outcomes inherent in a federal agency in which individual trademark
examiners consider more than 400,000 applications each year. " However,
it is this very inconsistency which may ultimately torpedo the
government's claim that there is indeed a compelling government
interest. For example, FCUK, THE F WORD, FVCK STREET WEAR, and F'D were
approved, but F U, EFFU, or FVCKED were not. The volume of
inconsistencies indicates that the government's argument may not be
valid.

Additionally, denying the trademark only denies the protections afforded
to trademarked marks; it doesn't prevent the mark from actually being
used. So the denial also does not advance at least one of the compelling
government interest as stated by the government (protecting the
sensibilities of the general public).

Brunetti's defense also turns on another trademark case, *Matal v. Tam*,
which also dealt with failure to register a trademark, this time for
trademarks deemed disparaging. The court stated that because the
trademark law denied registration based on what a substantial composite
of the reference group deemed disparaging, the government was actually
discriminating based on viewpoint. The court stated, "Giving offense is
a viewpoint," thus affording 1A protection to that viewpoint. The court
also noted the "haphazard record of enforcement" of the disparagement
bar, and stated that a significant number of marks had been registered
"that many would regard as disparaging to racial and ethnic groups."

Similarly in this case, the government denied registration because a
substantial composite of the reference group deemed the mark to be
phonetically similar to a vulgar term. Brunetti argues that again,
strict scrutiny is the appropriate standard because, as the *Tam* court
stated, giving offense is a viewpoint. Under the strict scrutiny
standard, therefore, the haphazard and inconsistent way in which
phonetically similar marks have been either approved or denied will
likely work against the government's case, undermining their contention
that there is a compelling governmental interest in denying a mark.
