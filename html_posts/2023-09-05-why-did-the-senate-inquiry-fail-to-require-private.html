Because a Senate inquiry is not how you change law. The Hyde Amendment
is still the law of the land, and has been re-enacted every year since
1976. It is not a permanent law, but rather a temporary "rider" to the
Congressional appropriations bill. Congress has the opportunity to lift
the Hyde Amendment each year, but they have added it to the
appropriations bill every year.

The Hyde Amendment prohibits federal Medicaid funding for abortion
services. The only exceptions are when continuing the pregnancy will
endanger the patient\'s life, or when the pregnancy results from rape or
incest. These circumstances are considered medically necessary health
services.
