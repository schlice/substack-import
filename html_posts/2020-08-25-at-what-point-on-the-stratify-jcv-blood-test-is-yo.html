**At what point on the Stratify JCV blood test is your level too high to
start Tysabri?**

The answer is that there is no specific point at which Tysabri is
contraindicated.

The JCV test simply determines whether or not the patient has or has not
been exposed to the JC Virus. At readings of \<0.20, the test is
Negative. At readings of 0.20-0.40, the test is Indeterminate. And at
readings of \>0.40, the test is Positive.

Your neurologist will balance this finding with the benefits of Tysabri,
understanding that it carries a risk of PML. Also understand that for
those who are JC positive, the risk of PML increases over time taking
Tysabri; it is not static.

I know of plenty of people who were JC positive who took Tysabri. They
had to get off of it sooner than those who were JC negative.

Ultimately, you and your neurologist must weigh the risk of Tysabri
versus the reward: the medicine with the best efficacy of any MS therapy
drug today, period. It is well-tolerated, and only needs to be infused
once every 28 days, so it is also convenient.

Everyone's situation is different. Some people don't have any other good
choices because other medicines may be contraindicated. Taking Tysabri
while JC positive is not impossible. It simply must be done very
carefully and fully understanding the risks.
