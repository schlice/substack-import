**Do you think the new cars should come with inbuilt dashcams as a
standard? Especially since it's become inexpensive now?**

I like the idea, and I think it would be smart for auto makers to
install new cameras to do this.

*But they already have 360 degree cameras on these cars! Just set those
to always record!*

Those cameras are not designed for continuous recording:

- They are relatively low-res. You want something a lot higher
  resolution to make out things like license plates. Most of those
  cameras are installed for specific applications like lane departure
  warnings, parking space viewers, or backup cameras.
- They are not designed for continuous use. The optical sensors are not
  designed to such tolerances that they can be continuously operated for
  the entire time the vehicle is running. They work fine for brief
  periods of operation, but not all the time.

However, I do think that manufacturers should think about installing
front and rear cameras in vehicles which are designed for continuous
recording. An SD card slot in the dashboard somewhere would be all that
is required to enable the always-on recording.
