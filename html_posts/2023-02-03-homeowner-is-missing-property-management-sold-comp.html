First of all, **don't spend the rent money!** Once you work out the
issue of who owns the property and who will be accepting your rent
checks, they're going to want all that back rent (and they are owed it).
Don't screw yourself over by spending the rent money and then realize
you owe back rent.

If you want to investigate this yourself, go to your county's tax
assessor website. The real owner of every property is listed. Find the
real owner of the property and figure out who will be accepting the
rent. Keep all records of your transactions.

If you are unable to get answers through the county website, contact a
real estate attorney in your local area to help you.
