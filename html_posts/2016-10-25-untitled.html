I\'m reasonably certain that no one ever said the police were perfect.
Far from it, they are people, after all. We know that errors happen, and
police should be held accountable for those errors.

When I said that police never use respiratory neck restraints, I meant
that police departments do not permit their officers to use them. I
didn't mean that officers (who are fallible) don't sometimes do it
wrong, and turn a carotid control hold into a respiratory neck
restraint, in defiance of department policy.

In such a case, the department's Use of Force review should find the
officer violated department policy on control holds and should subject
the officer to retraining, or if they find that the officer
**intentionally** used an unauthorized control hold, disciplinary action
up to and including termination.
