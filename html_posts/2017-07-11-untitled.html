Some of the set top boxes have really great app environments like TiVO
from DirecTV. Others have very limited app support. My Hopper from Dish
runs Netflix, and that's it. That to me is disappointing. I would much
prefer to use my Hopper to run apps than my PS4, but the PS4 supports
everything, so I'm not at a loss for an OE to run an app.
