That, really, ultimately depends on the A1C (Airman First Class or E-3)
in question.

The Air Force requires A1Cs to have 28 months Time-in-Grade (TIG), or 36
months Time-in-Service (TIS) and 20 months TIG. The average active duty
time for A1Cs to advance to SrA (Senior Airman or E-4) is three years.

That said, Air Force unit commanders are authorized to promote 15
percent of their ***best*** A1C\'s to SrA six months ahead of the normal
TIS, often called \"early promotion,\" or colloquially known as "below
the zone" (BTZ) promotions. The commander will accomplish this \"early
promotion\" process through a promotion board. For large units, they
will hold their own board in-house. Smaller units combine all base
applicants from all Air Force units on the base into a single pool and
will hold a Central Base Board (CBB). They will then select the top 15%
from the entire base population for early promotion.

Remember that Senior Airman is the transition from a Journeyman rank to
Non-Commissioned Officer (NCO). The Senior Airman is supposed to be
working on his supervisory skills through PME and through real-world
supervisory experience. A1Cs are considered completely acclimated to Air
Force life and spend their time improving their job skills, as well as
taking leadership opportunities when they are offered. Those A1Cs who
show exceptional job skills, who mentor their subordinates well, and are
always looking for opportunities for leadership and professional, as
well as personal, improvement, are going to be the ones who are selected
for early promotion.

So how do you do it? Do your job, to the best of your ability, and then
ask what else you can do. Let your supervisor know that you are fully
capable of doing your job, and willing to go above and beyond.

Aim High!

Some notable quotes about duty from some leaders past (most of these are
from memory \-- I had to reference some of the authors; my memory isn\'t
what it used to be). These quotes served as inspiration during my
career.

**\"Duty, then, is the sublimest word in the English language. You
should do your duty in all things. You can never do more. You should
never wish to do less.\"** (General Robert E. Lee)

**\"If I do my full duty, the rest will take care of itself.\"**
(General George S. Patton, Jr.)

**\"No man is fit to command another that cannot command himself.\"**
(William Penn)

**\"Never tell your people** ***how*** **to do things. Tell them**
***what*** **to do, and they will surprise you with their ingenuity.\"**
(General George S. Patton, Jr. *War As I Knew It*)

**\"A man has integrity when his interest in the good of the service is
at all times greater than his personal pride, and when he holds himself
to the same line of duty when unobserved as he would follow if his
superiors were present.\"** (General S.L. A. Marshall, *Thoughts On
War*, 1941)

And probably the most famous and well-known duty quotes:

**\"Ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for
your country.\"** (President John F. Kennedy)
