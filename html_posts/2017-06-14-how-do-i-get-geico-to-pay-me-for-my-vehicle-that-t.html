Simplest way: get a lawyer.

Personal injury lawyers won't take your case unless you have one, and
you have a good chance of winning, because they get paid out of your
winnings. If you don't win, they don't get paid. They usually also offer
free consultation, to find out if you have a winning case.

So call a personal injury attorney in your neck of the woods. You
probably see their ads all over the place: "Hurt in a car wreck? Call
me!" Except you don't have to be physically hurt to have a case on which
they can collect.
