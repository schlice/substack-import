**Is the impeachment trial unconstitutional or are Republicans
misleading the American public on the issue? It seems that the only
party that can declare something unconstitutional is the Supreme Court -
not me, you, a Congressman or the entire Senate.**

The Constitution is very clear. The purpose of impeachment is removal
from office. Only secondarily is its purpose to vote to not allow
someone to ever hold political office ever again. The Article of
Impeachment, the one that the Senate will be trying, calls for removal
from office as the prime remedy. Except that Trump has already been
removed from office. The primary objective, therefore, of the
impeachment article, as written by the House, has already been met.

There is a concept in law called *mootness* wherein when you have
already achieved your goal, your case is dismissed.

Second, impeachments are designed for the President, the Vice President,
and other Federal office holders. Trump, however, is not a Federal
office holder. He is a *former* Federal office holder. He is a civilian.
The Constitution has a very specific provision against Congress passing
*Bills of Attainder* which are Congressional bills which apply
punishments to specific civilians without the protections of a judicial
trial. It's the equivalent of the Legislative branch assuming powers of
the Judicial branch, and this is patently unconstitutional. This trial
would, in fact, apply a punishment to a specific civilian, without the
protection of a judicial trial. This makes this proceeding the
processing of a Bill of Attainder, not an impeachment trial, as the
person "on trial" does not qualify for a trial in the Senate.

It is for those specific reasons that the trial is unconstitutional.
Republicans can say that it is unconstitutional, but it would only be
after the Senate actually imposed a punishment that Trump could bring
the case to Federal court and argue that the Senate trial was, in fact,
unconstitutional, and then the courts could decide.

Regardless of the constitutionality of the action, the Senate has, by
the narrowest of margins, voted itself the power to conduct the trial.

But rest assured, the vote to convict will fall along similar party
lines. There's no way you'll get the 2/3 majority you need to convict,
or to ban the President from ever holding office again.

So Trump will have been twice impeached and twice acquitted, and he will
declare himself "totally innocent" and he will have this kabuki theater
of a Senate trial to hold up as proof. In other words, they're giving
the President more credibility than he had before, and all because they
are hell-bent on hurting the President as much as they can, because they
hate him so much.

If you are simply commenting to tell me \"ackshually, you\'re wrong,\"
don\'t be surprised if I quietly delete your comment. Put anything
