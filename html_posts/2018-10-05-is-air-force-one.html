**Is Air Force One's cockpit door locked during flight?**

Unless something has changed significantly, Air Force One's cockpit door
is locked just the same as every other cockpit door on every other Air
Force transport aircraft. The door remains closed and locked in flight,
unless the flight crew is entering or exiting the cockpit. While the
flight crew can come out of the cockpit, they can only go so far as the
forward galley or the lav. Secret Service makes sure of that.

Primarily this is because, as a general practice, the flight crew does
not have the requisite clearance to interact directly with the
President.

If the President chooses to poke his head into the cockpit, that's his
choice, and Secret Service must adapt accordingly. But the flight crew
may not enter any of the areas where the President or his staff are
located.

To be fair, I flew on Air Force Two in the 90s, so like I said,
something may have changed.
