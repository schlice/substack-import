**What does it take for the government to revisit a previous supreme
court case?**

1.  **Standing**. Someone must do something legal but which challenges
    court precedent. Taking the current crop of state laws designed to
    challenge *Roe v. Wade*, a state can issue a law outlawing abortion
    when it decides that the baby is alive. This is technically in
    violation of *Roe*, so it will be challenged as unconstitutional
    because *Roe* found a constitutional right to an abortion.
2.  **Certiorari**. When appealing to an appeals court, a party has an
    inherent right to do so. However, no such right exists to appeal to
    the Supreme Court. Instead, the party must file a *writ of
    certiorari* to request the high court to hear the case. "Certiorari"
    is from Law Latin, and means "to be fully informed." If four
    Justices agree to hear the case, then they are said to have "granted
    certiorari," or "granted cert" for short. Certiorari is
    discretionary; SCOTUS does not have to grant it. If they do not, the
    lower court decision stands. But that does not necessarily mean that
    SCOTUS agrees with the lower court decision, it simply means that
    they could not get four Justices to agree to hear the case.
3.  Once the case is heard at the Supreme Court, they must review their
    earlier decision. They can either clarify it, modify it, or reverse
    it. It's unlikely that SCOTUS would grant cert just to re-affirm the
    lower court's decision, but they may do so in order to strengthen a
    confusing decision, or to clarify a previous decision.
