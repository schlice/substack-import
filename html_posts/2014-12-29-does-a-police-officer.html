**Content:** [New York gave Nassau County Police the option to get a
\"custom\" plate back in the 80\'s. My dad\'s plate was 93-NCP. Only
Nassau County police could get the NCP letter group on their New York
license plates. I\'m reasonably sure they did the same with Suffolk
County PD (SCP) and New York City PD (NYP), but I don\'t know beyond the
counties on Long Island and Manhattan if they offered something similar
to other New York law enforcement agencies (read: upstate).\
\
Personally, I don\'t want my car identified. I\'m a Reserve Deputy, when
I\'m not working, I\'m a civilian. I want a civilian car when I\'m not
working, and a police car when I am, and ne\'er the twain shall meet. I
don\'t even have a thin blue line sticker on my car. If I\'m doing
something unlawful in my car, and I get called out on it, I have to
identify it to my chain-of-command whether I get a ticket or not, so it
really makes no difference to me.]{.rendered_qtext}
