<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [New York gave Nassau County Police the option to get a<br>\"custom\" plate back in the 80\'s. My dad\'s plate was 93-NCP. Only<br>Nassau County police could get the NCP letter group on their New York<br>license plates. I\'m reasonably sure they did the same with Suffolk<br>County PD (SCP) and New York City PD (NYP), but I don\'t know beyond the<br>counties on Long Island and Manhattan if they offered something similar<br>to other New York law enforcement agencies (read: upstate).\<br>\<br>Personally, I don\'t want my car identified. I\'m a Reserve Deputy, when<br>I\'m not working, I\'m a civilian. I want a civilian car when I\'m not<br>working, and a police car when I am, and ne\'er the twain shall meet. I<br>don\'t even have a thin blue line sticker on my car. If I\'m doing<br>something unlawful in my car, and I get called out on it, I have to<br>identify it to my chain-of-command whether I get a ticket or not, so it<br>really makes no difference to me.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
