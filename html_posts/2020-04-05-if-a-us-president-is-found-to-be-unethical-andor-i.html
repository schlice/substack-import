**If a US President is found to be unethical and/or immoral during his
or her term and steps down as a result of that fact, shouldn\'t that
make every bill that he or she signed into law null and void by
default?**

No.

Here are the primary reasons why:

1.  There is no Constitutional requirement for a President to be
    "ethical" or "moral" while in office.
2.  There is no standard for "ethics" or "morality" in the United
    States. The only standard we have is the law and the Constitution.
3.  Even if a president acted unlawfully, while that president was duly
    elected and sworn in, and functioning in his elected role, as long
    as he signed legislation in accordance with the law, that
    legislation is still valid.
4.  There are separate remedies for presidents who act unlawfully, and
    even who act "unethically" and "immoraly," if found to have done so
    by Congress.
5.  Presidents who act unethically and/or immorally (by whatever
    standard they are judged) do not change the
    legality/ethicality/morality of the laws which they signed.
