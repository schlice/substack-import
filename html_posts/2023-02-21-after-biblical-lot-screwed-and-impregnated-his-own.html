The Bible is filled with flawed people. All kinds of evil people are
represented in the Bible: murderers, rapists, philanderers, misogynists,
prostitutes, gold-diggers, they're all in there.

I mean, just look at the people Jesus kept company with. Matthew was a
tax collector. Mary Magdeline was a prostitute. He kept company with
other tax collectors like Zaccheus. Heck, Saul (later Paul) was probably
the worst among them. Saul persecuted the early church, and he was
ruthless, breaking into homes and arresting not just the male
ringleaders, but the women too.

**But that's the point.**

The Bible is not full of saints and wonderful people, *because none of
us are saints or wonderful people.* We are all sinners. We have all
fallen short of God's grace.

*But these are exactly the people Jesus came to save*. A doctor doesn't
treat people who are well, he treats people who are sick.

And none of us have moral superiority. In fact, we are the worst of the
bunch, myself included. What I do have is *a Savior who has His own
moral superiority*. He is where I turn for salvation. I don't count
myself better than anyone else. I am only who I am *because of Him*.

And He can offer the same to you. **Just like the baddies in the Bible,
He can save anyone.**

The Bible is not the source of morality. **Jesus is**. And Jesus was
sinless and perfect, and He died to relieve us of the sin which infects
every one of us. If He can save the evil people in the Bible, He can
save me, and He can save you too.

All you have to do is ask.
