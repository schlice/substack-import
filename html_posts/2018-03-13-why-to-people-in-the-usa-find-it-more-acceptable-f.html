**Why to people in the USA find it more acceptable for their kids to get
killed in shootings in schools than to risk them having a Kinder Eggs
with small parts which may present a choking hazard?**

*Of course, this is a troll question, but I'll bite. If it's not a troll
question, it suffers from the logical fallacy of the excluded middle.
But anyway...*

No one in America finds either scenario acceptable.

Additionally, intellectually honest people in America disagree on how we
fix either issue.

There are several ways to fix the Kinder Eggs issue. You could make
parents aware of the small parts inside and the choking hazard, and then
hold the few irresponsible parents accountable when they allow small
children to eat the eggs without cautioning them or guiding them around
the toy inside. Or you could ban their sale in the United States.

Similarly, as you will find on many discussions on this very website,
there are several ways to fix the school shooting issue. You can get rid
of the soft target created by "gun-free zones," a tactic which works
successfully in other countries. You could focus on why shooters choose
schools and attack the issue of violent, mentally unstable people who
also have access to guns. You could address the issue of Federal and
state agencies which failed to do their jobs, after repeated warnings.
Or you could try to remove a right from millions of law-abiding citizens
under age 21 in order to shut down a sales channel that one mentally
unstable person used.

In one of these scenarios, a fundamental right in the United States is
at issue. The other is about Kinder Eggs.
