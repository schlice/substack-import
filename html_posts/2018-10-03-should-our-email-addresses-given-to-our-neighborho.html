**Should our email addresses given to our neighborhood homeowners
association be used to invite us to a political gathering or is this
crossing the line?**

The answer, as with all legal answers, is "it depends."

When you gave your email address to the HOA, they should have told you
why they needed it. There should have been a Privacy statement which was
given at the time they took your email. If you signed up using your
email on a website, the Terms of Use and the Privacy Policy on the
website should contain information relating to what the website can do
with your email address. Depending on what those documents say will
determine whether or not the HOA can give your email address to someone
else. According to the law, then when you receive one message from that
third party, you can opt-out of email and it should stop and they should
not further distribute your address anywhere else without your
permission.

More importantly to the HOA, if it is the HOA composing and sending the
message that is inviting you to the gathering (politics aside), the
message is legal because it is considered a "relationship" message under
the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003. You already have an existing relationship with
the HOA, so they are allowed to send you messages.

When it comes to politics, it actually has *extra* protections as
"non-commercial" email. Political and religious emails are universally
considered to have extra First Amendment protections, because they are
expressly non-commercial.

Therefore, while it may be an unwanted intrusion into your email inbox,
under the currently accepted rules, it doesn't cross any lines.

You might consider talking to the HOA and informing them that you would
like to opt-out of any non-HOA related marketing emails. The CAN-SPAM
Act (if they're in compliance) should allow you to do that.
