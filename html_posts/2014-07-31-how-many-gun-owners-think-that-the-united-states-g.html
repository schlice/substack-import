<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [There was a quote attributed to Norman Thomas, the famous<br>US socialist, but that attribution is dubious at best. Nevertheless, the<br>quote is salient and pertinent:\<br>\<br>"The American people will never knowingly adopt socialism. But under the<br>name of Liberalism, they will adopt every fragment of the socialist<br>program until one day America will be a socialist nation without knowing<br>how it happened."\<br>\<br>This is the only way the United States will ever become like Nazi<br>Germany: the expansion of Liberalism until we have become a fully<br>socialist nation. And without a single shot being fired.\<br>\<br>It has nothing to do with guns, as the implication in your question<br>states. Gun control advocates don\'t want the US to become like Nazi<br>Germany either. Perhaps it would be easier for them to control guns if<br>it was, but they don\'t want the US to become like Nazi Germany<br>either.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
