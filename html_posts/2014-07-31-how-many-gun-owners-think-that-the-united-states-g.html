**Content:** [There was a quote attributed to Norman Thomas, the famous
US socialist, but that attribution is dubious at best. Nevertheless, the
quote is salient and pertinent:\
\
"The American people will never knowingly adopt socialism. But under the
name of Liberalism, they will adopt every fragment of the socialist
program until one day America will be a socialist nation without knowing
how it happened."\
\
This is the only way the United States will ever become like Nazi
Germany: the expansion of Liberalism until we have become a fully
socialist nation. And without a single shot being fired.\
\
It has nothing to do with guns, as the implication in your question
states. Gun control advocates don\'t want the US to become like Nazi
Germany either. Perhaps it would be easier for them to control guns if
it was, but they don\'t want the US to become like Nazi Germany
either.]{.rendered_qtext}
