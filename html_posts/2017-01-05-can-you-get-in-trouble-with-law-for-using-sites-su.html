You can get in trouble using sites like Quora!

Remember this general rule: *It's not necessarily the site you visit,
but it's what you do with that site which may be illegal.*

*Could* you get in trouble for using sites like Putlocker and
Kisscartoon? Yes, it is conceivable that you could get in trouble.
Assuming that it is illegal in your jurisdiction, which it likely is.
Consuming improperly licensed content is a violation of the copyright of
that content, and so the distribution of that content is illegal, and
consuming that content is also illegal.

*Is it likely* that you will get in trouble? No, it's not likely. The
copyright holder will issue a DMCA takedown notice, and the distributor
of the content will be required to remove it from their site. Usually,
the online provider is indemnified themselves, under the DMCA's "Safe
Harbor" provisions. But the person who uploaded the content is most
definitely liable, and the online provider would be obligated to provide
all relevant information to law enforcement agencies regarding if a
subpoena is issued.
