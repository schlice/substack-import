Each state has its own requirements. Some states allow a valid license
from a foreign government only, some states require a valid license and
an **Internationlal Driving Permit (IDP)**. An IDP is really just an
international translation of your home country's driver's license which
is prepared and issued by your home country; therefore, both documents
are usually required. Check with the state department of motor vehicles
if you're a foreign national wishing to drive in the United States. In
order to rent a car, you may need both your license and an IDP.

However, tourists who do not have a driver's license at all may be able
to test and get a US driver's license which is valid during the time
that their visa is valid. However, not all states will issue driver's
licenses to tourists. For example, Florida and California will, but
Missouri will not.

Non-US residents (i.e. visitors on tourist visas) do not need to get a
US driver's license to drive in the US (see the above answer). Lawful
permanent residents (Non-US citizen residents) may be eligible to apply
for a driver's license in the state in which they live. If you're a
lawful permanent resident and you are eligible to apply for a driver's
license in your state, you must do so in order to lawfully drive in the
US. New residents in a state, regardless of their origin, generally have
60 to 90 days (depending on state) to get a state-issued driver's
license.[\[1\]](#KJyHF){#cite-KJyHF
