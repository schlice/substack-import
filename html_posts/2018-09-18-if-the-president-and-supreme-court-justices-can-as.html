**If the President and Supreme Court Justices can assault people, why
isn't it ok for everyone to do so?**

The President and Supreme Court justices cannot assault people. It's
illegal for anyone to assault anyone; I am unaware of any law which
provides special allowances for the President or for a Supreme Court
justice to assault anyone.
