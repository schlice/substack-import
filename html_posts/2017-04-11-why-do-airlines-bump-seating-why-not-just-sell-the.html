It is well known that around 10% of people who buy tickets to a flight
do not show up. Rather than flying the plane partially empty, the
airline oversells flights. It's also well known that profit margins are
thinner in the airline industry than in any other industry in America,
so anything that increases cost or decreases revenue is a Bad Thingâ„¢.

If you sell \*exactly\* the right number of tickets to exactly match the
number of seats in the plane, and 10% of the people don't show, you're
flying empty seats. Flying empty seats means less revenue, and when
revenue is tight already, anything that loses money causes trickle-down
decisions to be made.

For example, if a particular route costs you \$10/seat to run, but you
only make \$4/seat, you're losing money on that route. What can you do?
You can increase ticket prices (which nobody wants), you can cut out
some less-popular routes (which nobody wants either), or you can
oversell the flight and potentially inconvenience some passengers who
bought tickets.

The most cost-effective option is to oversell the flight.
