**Should passengers in cars be required by law to wear seatbelts?**

The answer is a solid "maybe."

In general, laws which protect you from yourself are bad laws. Seatbelt
laws do not make *me* safer from *your* stupidity. They make *you* safer
from *your* stupidity. And a law which does nothing but protect you from
you is a bad law. What public good does it advance to punish you for
being stupid? I know there is an incremental public burden when you
spend your time laid up in a hospital bed, but that belies our
pay-your-own-healthcare system in this country, and in most cases is
simply incorrect.

With all of that in mind, there is something to be said for not bouncing
around the inside of the cabin, distracting the driver further from
trying to control a car while in the middle of a crash, so I can't say
that no passenger should ever be forced by the state to wear a seatbelt.

Additionally, some parents are simply too stupid or uninformed to make
their children wear seatbelts, and since the state has a vested interest
in the wellbeing of children, forcing anyone under 18 in a car to wear a
seatbelt is also appropriate.
