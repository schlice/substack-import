**What is the best way to support a man who has been recently diagnosed
with Multiple sclerosis?**

Thanks for the A2A.

He is going through a lot right now. The diagnosis of a lifelong
incurable disease which has the potential (however slight) to leave you
wheelchair-bound at some unknown time in the future is pretty
frightening for anyone. The most frightening part about the whole thing
is the unknown aspect of it. So much about MS is unknown, but most
especially is the timing of everything. I still wake up in the morning
wondering which body part is going to quit working and when.

There are good things to hang on to though. First of all, *MS is not
fatal*. There are always complications, and yes there are some famous
people who have died from complications from MS, but those cases are
extremely rare. With modern medicine (which most of those people did not
have access to during the active portion of their disease), we should be
able to stave off the worst of the disease until you're literally "too
old to care." Lifespans for people who take one of the approved MS
medications nearly match those unaffected by the disease, so prognoses
for the disease are very good.

Also, *our medications have come about as far as they can without curing
this disease.* We can control the relapses: we can reduce the severity,
the duration, and the frequency of relapses. We can reduce the formation
of new lesions, which is the number one indicator of disease activity.
It would be great if medication could completely eradicate relapses, but
we're not quite there yet. It does come pretty darn close though. We can
monitor disease progression using modern tools like the MRI. We can see
if the disease is progressing, whether or not symptoms are present.
We've progressed from only injectable medication to a few oral pills,
and a few infusions done at infusion centers on a periodic basis. The
injectables are still available, and they're still pretty good, but
there are other options available too. Point is, as long as you get on
one of the approved MS therapy drugs, you can (somewhat) control aspects
of the disease, even if it's not cured.

So how best to support him? **Be there for him**. Take your cues from
him. He's going to be frightened about the future; we all were at some
point. Don't push him; let him work through his grief on his own time.
Make sure though that he keeps moving forward. He doesn't want to get
caught up in invalid thoughts or self-defeating thinking. Depression is
also very common at the onset of the disease, and the cause of part of
that depression is learning about having the disease. Being there for
him means working through his depression as well. This is really the
best thing you can do for him now.

If possible, you may want to look into support groups in your area. He's
not going to want to go on his own; you'll probably have to go with him.
But there are groups available to talk to. Contact [[your local MS
Society
chapter](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=2ebc99&url=https://www.nationalmssociety.org/Chapters){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="nationalmssociety.org"}]{.qlink_container} to find support
groups in your area. Of course, I just assumed you were in the US; if
you're somewhere else I can help you find resources in your local area.

Do make sure he has a neurologist who is well-versed in MS. Make sure
his diagnosis has been confirmed, and make sure he's planning on
starting one of the approved MS therapy drugs.

Good luck, and thanks for caring.
