If you're in Texas, you'll need to travel out of Texas to get an
abortion unless you qualify for an exception. Exceptions are very
limited and include:

- To save the pregnant person\'s life
- To prevent serious risk to the pregnant person\'s physical health.

It is legal, however, to travel outside of Texas in order to get an
abortion. You can visit the following site to find an abortion provider
in a nearby state:

Another option, while less appealing to someone seeking an abortion, is
carrying to term and using the Texas Safe Haven law (also known as the
Baby Moses law).
