Because everything in that question is wrong.

- Guns are not unnecessary.
- Guns do not impose a non-trivial risk, when properly secured.

Guns in the home keep me and my family safe. That sounds pretty
necessary to me. Perhaps you are unconcerned with your safety. I\'m
happy for you. As far as I\'m concerned, my family\'s safety is my
responsibility, along with how I effect that safety. But that\'s my
decision to make. Not yours. And it\'s not your place to tell me what my
responsibilities to my family are.

To that end, the risks in my home are my responsibility to mitigate. A
gun in my house does not add a non-trivial risk to anyone. I can access
my gun quickly enough, and no one unauthorized can get to it. And it\'s
not your responsibility to legislate the stupid out of people. If they
are too dumb to properly store their firearms, or to properly educate
their children on gun safety, or to properly secure a firearm from
unknown or visiting children, then they bear that liability on
themselves. And lest you think them heartless, they will also bear the
guilt from that decision for the rest of their lives, and it will likely
kill them too.
