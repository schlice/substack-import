Honestly, I don't think he's going to be acquitted.

He was charged with manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide. In
New York, manslaughter says that the defendant must cause the death of
another person (1) recklessly; (2) with intent to cause serious physical
injury or (3) with intent to cause death under the circumstances
evincing an extreme emotional disturbance. Criminally negligent homicide
is charged when a death is caused with criminal negligence. The
difference is *intent*. Criminal negligence does not require any intent,
while manslaughter requires some level of intent to cause injury or
intent to cause death.

Self-defense is definitely a defense here, and his stepping in to defend
another person qualifies. So the jury is going to have to decide if
defense of another (which falls under self-defense) is enough to
overcome the negligence claim.

In my opinion, he's either going to be acquitted, or he's going to be
convicted for criminally negligent homicide. I don't think they have
enough for manslaughter.
