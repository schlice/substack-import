The answer is "it depends."

It depends on where you got the hair.

If the person got their hair cut and then left the hair on the floor of
the salon, this is legally called "abandonment" and their former
property (which now has no owner) can legally be acquired by anyone.
Normally the property is no longer wanted and ends up in the trash. But
if you wanted to take possession of it after it has been abandoned by
its former owner, it is perfectly legal. You can then go on and resell
that item if you choose.

If the person got their hair cut and while it was being cut they said,
"I want to keep all the hair you cut from me," they are not abandoning
the hair. They are asking to keep it. You can't take it as that would be
theft of property. The value would be pretty low, but it's petty theft
nonetheless. It would be illegal to resell the hair at that point, as
you would be selling stolen property.

I also don't think Donald Trump is in the market for anyone's hair.
