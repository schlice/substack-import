Wishful thinking.

If neither candidate gets 270 electoral votes, the House votes for
President, and the Senate votes for VP. How that vote is handled is in
the Constitution, and it\'s not like a traditional vote in the House
either. Each state delegation in the House gets one vote for President.
You need to receive votes from a majority of states (26 votes) in order
to be elected President. Vice President is elected by the Senate. Each
Senator gets one vote, and you need 51 votes to be elected Vice
President.

So no, Nancy Pelosi would not become President on Election Day if
neither candidate is the clear winner.
