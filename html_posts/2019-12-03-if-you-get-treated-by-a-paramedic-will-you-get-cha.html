*(US Answer Only)*

The ambulance service will get your billing information from the
emergency room, including your insurance information. In this way, you
only need to provide all your information one time, and everyone who
needs to be paid will get the information from the one check-in.

Whether or not you get directly charged for any services you receive
depends on what insurance you have and how you pay for your portion of
the bill (i.e. copay, coinsurance, etc).

If you have insurance, the ambulance service will first bill your
insurance policy. If you have a copay structure for ambulance service in
your insurance policy, you will be charged the copay. If you have a
coinsurance structure for ambulance service, you will be charged your
portion of the total bill, adjusted to meet the insurance company's
billing agreement.

If you do not have insurance, the hospital will help you sign up for it
if you choose. They can assist you with signing up for Medicare or
Medicaid (if you qualify) or they can help you enroll in one of the
state-sponsored ACA exchanges (if they exist in your state).

If you choose not to enroll, or you do not qualify, you'll receive the
bill for all of your services.
