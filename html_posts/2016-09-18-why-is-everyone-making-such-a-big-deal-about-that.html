Since you asked, there actually is a law.

**4 USC Chapter 8:** "No disrespect should be shown to the flag of the
United States of America"

**36 USC Chapter 10, ยง171. Conduct during playing:** "During rendition
of the national anthem when the flag is displayed, all present except
those in uniform should stand at attention facing the flag with the
right hand over the heart. Men not in uniform should remove their
headdress with their right hand and hold it at the left shoulder, the
hand being over the heart. Persons in uniform should render the military
salute at the first note of the anthem and retain this position until
the last note. When the flag is not displayed, those present should face
toward the music and act in the same manner they would if the flag were
displayed there."

So did he break a law? Technically, yes. So why wasn't he arrested?

In recent times, people have exerted their First Amendment right to
freedom of speech, and people assert that their right to freedom of
expression makes these sections of United States Code unconstitutional.
While these particular laws were never tested, the portion of US Code
which talks about not burning the flag was found to be unconstitutional
in the case of [[Texas v.
Johnson](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=2d1c15&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_v._Johnson){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}. This invalidated any
laws which barred burning the flag, which were present in 48 of 50
states, and the section of US Code which also barred burning the flag.

Thus, it's fairly *common knowledge* that expressing oneself in any
manner, even if it violates a law, can be claimed to be protected under
the First Amendment. The "conduct during playing" laws can fairly easily
be equated to the prohibitions on burning the flag, and most would say
that his conduct was protected First Amendment expression.

In Kaepernick's case, the question is not the legality of the action.
The question is the intent and the motivation, and his reasoning behind
his decision to sit during the National Anthem.

\"I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that
oppresses black people and people of color,\" Kaepernick told NFL Media
in an exclusive interview after the game in which he sat during the
National Anthem. \"To me, this is bigger than football and it would be
selfish on my part to look the other way. There are bodies in the street
and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder.\" Note that
he is referring to police officers who, when involved in a shooting, are
placed on paid administrative leave pending the outcome of the
investigation, and he claims they are "getting away with murder."

Kaepernick is parroting tired tropes used by hate groups such as Black
Lives Matter, whose favorite conceit is that the most dangerous thing to
a young black man in America is a racist police officer. These are
simply **lies**, plain and simple. We've been over the facts which show
this organization is based on nothing more than vapid lies, I won't do
it again here. If you want specifics, ask a specific question about
them.

The **big problem** with his "protest" is that the flag represents **far
more** than black people, and people of color, and racist police
officers. Doesn't the flag represent all of the people who fought for
hundreds of years against black oppression? Doesn't the flag represent
patriots like President Abraham Lincoln? Doesn't it represent patriots
like Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.? Doesn't it represent every soldier,
sailor, and airman who donned a United States Armed Forces uniform and
served their country, some even making the ultimate sacrifice, so that
he can play a game and be paid to do it, that gave him this impressive
stage to parrot his lies?

The flag represents the *entire nation*. The nation is indeed flawed. We
have had our share of problems, from the mistreatment of the American
Indian, to the slave trade, Prohibition, the War on Drugs, and many
others. ***THESE*** are the real killers of the black man, NOT the
police!

And if Black Lives Mattered so much, why are they not doing more to
defend black lives *in the womb*? Truly, the most dangerous place in
America to be black is in the womb! Did you know that in New York City,
more black babies are *aborted* than are *born?* Did you know that
nationally, more black women have abortions than white or Hispanic
women? And when percentage of the population is added to the mix, blacks
are represented to a much higher degree in the abortion clinics than any
other race. Why isn't BLM promoting **fatherhood** instead of inciting
murdering police officers?

In summary, **Kaepernick chose the wrong platform to promote**. It's
stupid and wrong. And the league allows him to not only parrot these
cop-killing lies, but he gets to disrespect the entire heritage of our
nation in the name of "black lives" which he may care about, but the
organizations which purport to do the same, don't. And since the league
doesn't care, I will show the league how I feel with my wallet. I'm done
with the NFL. I'm back to NCAA Football. The Air Force Academy Falcons
would ***NEVER*** disrespect the flag, because they are training to be
military officers. They know the history of sacrifice, for **everyone**,
that the flag represents. Go Big Blue!
