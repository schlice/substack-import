**Content:** [Only if your cat is a vegetarian.\
\
And unless it is some evolved species of cat that can think and
communicate and make value judgments about eating meat, it\'s highly
unlikely that your cat is a vegetarian. It would only be so if you
imposed your values on your cat.\
\
This would be unethical, unhealthy for the cat, and morally the greater
wrong.]{.rendered_qtext}
