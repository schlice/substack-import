If we can never know for sure whether or not our surgeon is mentally
capable of performing our surgery, does it matter?

If we can never know for sure that our doctor has prescribed us the
exactly correct medication at the precise dosage, does it matter?

If we can never know for sure if the repair crew on our airliner has
really truly fixed the problem before we take off, does it matter?

If we can never know for sure that our pilot got his required 8 hours of
crew rest before flying our airplane, does it matter?

We expect the truth in so many areas of our lives. We expect to be told
the truth when we pick up a reference book, read an article, or watch a
news story; we want the truth from advertisers, teachers, and
politicians; we assume road signs, medicine bottles, and food labels are
actually telling us the truth. In fact, we demand the truth for almost
every facet of life that affects our money, relationships, safety, or
health.

On the other hand, despite our unwavering demands for truth in those
areas, many of us say we aren't interested in truth when it comes to
morality or religion.

There's a huge contradiction here. Why do we demand truth in everything
but morality and religion? Why do we say, "That's true for you but not
for me," when we're talking about morality or religion, but we never
even think of such nonsense when we're talking to a stock broker about
our money or a doctor about our health?

***Does the truth matter?***

Although few would admit it, our rejection of religious and moral truth
is often on volitional rather than intellectual grounds---we just don't
*want* to be held accountable to any moral standards or religious
doctrine. So we blindly accept the self-defeating truth claims of
politically correct intellectuals who tell us that truth does not exist;
everything is relative; there are no absolutes; it's all a matter of
opinion; you ought not judge; religion is about faith, not facts!
Perhaps Augustine was right when he said that we love the truth when it
enlightens us, but we hate it when it convicts us. Maybe we can't handle
the truth.

The **truth** is that absolute truth exists, it is knowable, and we can
know the truth about God. We may not be able to have 100% certainty, but
like our legal standards, we can be certain beyond *reasonable* doubt
(even if not beyond *all* doubt).
