**If the fetus cannot live alone without its host the mother, then with
what logic are pro lifers saying the baby\'s rights should trump the
mother's rights?**

Viability is not the determining factor in order to be eligible for
human rights. Human rights are available to everyone who is a human.

Fetuses are indeed human, just at an earlier stage of development. There
isn't a definable point during the development of a human at which it
becomes human, and it is not human before that. It is a member of the
human species for the entirety of its existence, from the moment it
develops unique DNA until it dies. Because it is human, it should have
the same rights which are endowed upon every human. This includes the
right to life.

That said, we can decide to abridge those rights through force of law.
We do it to death row inmates. We say that after "due process," the
state can abridge the right to life. We can do the same to a fetus if we
choose. We can say that the mother has control over the due process
rights of the fetus and can choose to abridge its right to life. This is
a more cogent argument than saying that a lack of viability makes it
something not human, which is simply not scientifically supportable.

The Supreme Court fouled this all up, instead of doing what we just
suggested, by finding a "right to privacy" in the "emanations and
penumbras," but not the text, of the Constitution (i.e. *Griswold v.
Connecticut*) and then using that non-existent-right as the basis to
determine that the mother's right to privacy extended to the life of her
infant child still in the womb (*Roe v. Wade*).

If we affirmatively stated that the baby has a right to life, but the
mother has the ability to abridge that right, that would legally be
fine. We could even define limits around when the mother is able to do
this. For example, we say every day that when we can't detect brain
waves, and there is no pulse and no heartbeat, a human is "dead." Why
can we not extend the same logic to a fetus? Why can't we say that when
we can detect brain waves, when we can detect a heartbeat and a pulse,
the human (in the mother's womb) is "alive?" Not "human" or "not human,"
not "viable" or "not viable," "alive" or "not alive." And at that point,
killing that human would not be permitted. Why can we not do this?

The upshot would be that abortion on demand would be allowed until the
tiny human is alive (which we can detect scientifically). Beyond that
point, abortion would only be allowed to save the life of the mother
(i.e. the mother would die if the pregnancy continued).

It's a hard discussion that no one wants to have. We **can** do this. We
**can** balance the rights of the mother to have an abortion on demand
with the rights of the tiny unborn human to live, while still protecting
the lives of both. It **can** be done. We
