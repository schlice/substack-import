**Do you think the Public Health Association\'s requirement for nude
swimming in high schools in the United States in the 1940\'s and 1950\'s
may have sparked the baby boom?**

Probably not.

It probably happened simply because, in post-war America, people finally
felt safe and confident in the future, and they were ready to start
families. Consumer goods were plentiful, manufacturing and labor jobs
were plentiful and stable, and people finally felt like they could
provide for their families in a way that they could not up to this
point.

If you're looking for a cause, this is the most likely one. Always
follow the money. When couples feel safe in their financial futures,
babies naturally follow.
