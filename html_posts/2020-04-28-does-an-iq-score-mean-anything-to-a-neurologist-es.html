**Does an IQ score mean anything to a Neurologist, especially when
treating a patient for a disease like Multiple sclerosis?**

Possibly.

IQ tests are designed to test \"intelligence.\" Since \"intelligence\"
is defined as \"one\'s capacity for logic, abstract thought,
understanding, self-awareness, communication, learning, emotional
knowledge, memory, planning, and problem
solving\"[\[1\]](#fBDQr){#cite-fBDQr .citation_link}, and MS can affect
all of those, by extension, MS can alter IQ.

So would a neurologist be interested in IQ? If they can show that IQ has
changed over the course of the disease, they may investigate what
changes in the brain may have caused that.
