**Content:** [Hardware keyloggers can be used in many instances. The key
is whether or not you intend on introducing the evidence obtained by the
keylogger in court. If you have no intention of using the information in
a legal case, then the permissibility of the evidence is irrelevant.\
\
First off, you should be cautious. Hardware keyloggers log every
keystroke, including usernames and passwords (which is what a keylogger
is ideal for capturing). If you\'re using a hardware keylogger to obtain
passwords to accounts that you do not control, and then you access those
accounts later using the information obtained through the keylogger,
this is most definitely illegal.\
\
In order to use a keylogger completely legally, you must\
]{.rendered_qtext}

- own the equipment and the network being logged
- fully notify any user using that equipment that their activities are
  being monitored and that by continuing to use that system, they
  consent to such monitoring. Usually, this is done through a \"login
  banner\" whereby the above information is displayed. Then, when the
  user clicks OK acknowledging the banner, they have agreed to consent
  to monitoring.\
- safeguard the logged keystrokes so that inadvertent release of
  username/password combinations does not occur. You\'re dealing with
  people\'s private information; by you performing monitoring, you
  shoulder the burden of protecting their account information equally as
  much as they do.\

Now, some flaws with your plan.\
\
You highlighted several reasons to use a keylogger. You wanted to:\

- See if your wife is cheating on you
- Monitor your children\'s activity to protect them from child abusers
- Gain top secret information
- Perform data mining

\
Let\'s break those down.\

- *Seeing if your wife is cheating* or *Monitoring your kids*: I put
  these two together because, as a general rule, keyloggers are not
  useful for this purpose. You are much better served installing
  \"parental monitoring software\" on your computer. Microsoft includes
  Family Safety products in their Windows software. You have to have a
  Microsoft account, as does each of your family members, but you alreay
  know that if you use Windows 8 or higher. If it is a Windows computer,
  this might be your best, easiest, and cheapest bet, since it is
  included. Check out [[this

  onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
  qt-tooltip="microsoft.com"}]{.qlink_container} for more information.
  If you\'d like a different, software-based solution, or if you\'re not
  using Windows, search for \"parental monitoring software\" on Google.
  These softwares log every website visited, how long the visits were,
  and in some cases will capture screenshots or allow you to remotely
  view the screen that your child/spouse is viewing. Much more in-depth
  analysis than a simple keylogger can provide.
- *Gaining top secret information:* I don\'t even think I need to
  address this one. Highly illegal, will likely land you in jail for the
  rest of your life. Don\'t bother.
- *Data mining*: Keyloggers are virtually useless for data mining, as
  the data that comes out of a keylogger is *unstructured* data. It\'s
  nothing more than a text file which captured the keystrokes on the
  keyboard. You need *structured* data to perform any sort of data
  mining. There are entire industries set up around data mining; they
  wouldn\'t have much of a business model if a \$20 keylogger could do
  it as effectively. If you need to do data mining for your business,
  check out some commercial solutions for data mining. [[EMC Data

  start. Not that I\'m biased or anything\...oh wait, I am.

Hope this helps.
