First, if the person's rule violations aren't harming your home's value
(i.e. they're not doing something that would cause a buyer to think
twice about buying your house), then just let it go.

Second, how do you know that the Board hasn't been pursuing action
against this person? Actions between the Board and a homeowner are kept
confidential. They may actually be pursuing violations, but have run
into legal roadblocks which you may be unaware of.

You can always ask the Board if they are doing anything. If the Board is
unresponsive to homeowners, bring it up in a Board meeting (they are
open to homeowners). If they are still unresponsive, perhaps you could
run for the Board yourself and make sure that they are doing what they
are supposed to be doing. I have noticed that this is a very unpopular
choice, despite how vocal some homeowners are about wanting change.
