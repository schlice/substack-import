Yes, in fact there is a correlation.

The low levels of sunlight results in a **vitamin D deficiency**, since
humans generate vitamin D when the skin is exposed to sunlight. Vitamin
D is known to be neuroprotective, and there has been a positive
correlation between people who have vitamin D deficiency and MS.

Even more tightly defined is people who grew up above 40° latitude
(where the sun's rays arrive at a greater angle). They have a higher
incidence of MS than people who grew up below 40° latitude. And we
believe the reason is the same: lower angle of sunlight produces less
vitamin D than higher.

Remember, this is just a correlation; this is not a causation (i.e. MS
is not caused by vitamin D deficiency, but it could be an exacerbating
factor)

The best way to potentially mitigate this problem would be to develop
appropriate levels of vitamin D as observed in the blood, but we don't
have that information yet. We do not know what an appropriate level of
vitamin D is for anyone, so work with your doctor on what is safe to
take.

Or if you can, try to get at least 15 minutes of sun a day, but be
careful to not overstay your welcome, especially in the hot summer.
