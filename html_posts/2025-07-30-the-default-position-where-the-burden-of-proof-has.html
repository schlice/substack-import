This is true.

This is a statement of opinion, not of fact.

It is irrational to believe Christianity is true if it is your opinion
that Christianity has not met its burden of proof.

So why would you believe that Christianity hasn't met its burden of
proof? It's because you don't know the difference between **proof** and
**evidence.**

There is indeed a great amount of **evidence** which proves that the
universe had a beginning, life on this planet had an intelligent cause,
and that the set of circumstances by which the universe and we came into
existence are best explained by the existence of an intelligent creator
rather than by random chance.

Proof is something different altogether. Evidence exists, but whether it
rises to the level of *proof* for you depends on whether you believe the
evidence leaves any ***reasonable*** doubt. I believe the evidence
suggests ***beyond a reasonable doubt*** the work of an intelligent
creator. You may not believe this.

The truth is that *this is by design*. The existence of free will proves
that we can both look at the same body of evidence and rationally
conclude that it either **does** or **does not** meet our burden of
proof.

But whether we believe it to be proof is on **us**, not on the
**evidence**. The evidence is what it is. If you choose to believe the
proposition which has **less evidence** behind it, you are indeed free
to do so. But if you actually examine the available evidence, you will
find that there is abundant evidence to show that the universe and
everything in it was created by an intelligent creator, and the idea
that the universe randomly sprang into existence out of sheer chance has
shockingly little actual evidence behind it.

By the way, that gap between what we can glean through evidence and what
we consider proof is what we call ***faith***. The less evidence we
have, the more faith we need to reach proof.

Therefore, the position that the universe randomly sprang into existence
without a cause, the position which has shockingly little evidence to
support it, requires more faith to believe.
