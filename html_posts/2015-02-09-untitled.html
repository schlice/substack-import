<h2>Answer Comment</h2>

**Content:** [I think someone saying \"I\'m looking to find out more
information about suicide\" is very different than someone saying \"I\'m
thinking about killing myself, does anyone know how to do it\".\
\
I think if someone expresses a desire to kill themselves, you have an
obligation to try to get them help. I also think the Internet is awash
with resources for people who want to kill themselves. I think that
anyone who is suicidal and knows how to use Google is a dangerous
combination.\
\
I think that you should probably be very cautious when recommending
anything to someone who may be suicidal. The only two places where
physician assisted suicide is legal are Oregon and Washington, and the
laws are very tightly controlled (i.e. the person has to be terminally
ill, has to be getting worse, requires independent doctor corroboration,
strict reporting guidelines, etc). It\'s illegal everywhere else, and
when you\'re talking to someone over the Internet, I would always
presume they are somewhere where assisted suicide is illegal.\
\
I think if you\'re going to give advice to someone, I would say
something along the lines of, \"If you are having suicidal thoughts,
please call the National Suicide Prevention Hotline at 800-273-TALK
right away. If you\'re not having suicidal thoughts but you want more
information for research or informational purposes only, check out some
books like Peaceful Pill or Final Exit.\"]{.rendered_qtext}
