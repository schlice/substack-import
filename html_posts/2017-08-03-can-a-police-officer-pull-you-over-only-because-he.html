I think *stopping a vehicle* ***because*** *an officer smelled marijuana
as you drove by* would be a pretty thin reason to establish reasonable
suspicion. It would have to be, like, *clouds* coming out of your car as
you rolled by an officer standing outside of his car.

I mean, it's theoretically possible that an officer could have smelled
pot as *you* drove by, but I find that highly suspect.

I would think my lawyer would be all over that one in court.
