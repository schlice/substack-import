Your question contains faulty logic. You are employing a logical fault
called ***generalization***.

Basically, you have a perception that a subset of a group behaves in a
certain way, and the logical fault of generalization allows you to
generalize and say that *all* of that group behaves in that way.

Is every one of our cops an evil bully? We will never know, since no one
person can know every one of our cops. There are simply too many of
them.

But I know (at least) one cop who is not an evil bully.

Therefore, your logic is simply flawed.

I suspect you are a victim of ***media bias***. Your source for the
subset of the group is the media (television, probably). You see
examples of bad cops on the news, and you never see examples of good
cops on the news. Therefore, you assume, all cops are bad. Or perhaps
you have had interactions with X cops in your local area, and you
perceive all of those interactions were bad. Therefore, you assume all
cops are bad.

All of these errors are logically unsound. They are flawed thinking on
your part, not a problem with \"every one of our cops.\"
