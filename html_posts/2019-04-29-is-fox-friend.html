**Is Fox & friend\'s Brian Kilmeade\'s statement, "I just think that all
churches and synagogues, mosques, you have to have somebody in there
that\'s armed these days" a solution you support?**

It's not a solution. It's a response.

A solution would be to find out why people feel the need to kill others
in houses of worship, and addressing that.

The response (and an appropriate one at that) to shootings in houses of
worship is to increase security at houses of worship, or any other place
where people congregate.
