**Can I be sued for selling a car privately and knowing it had issues
and didn't mention them but put sold as is in the ad? They seen the
check engine light on and even test drove it and still choose to buy it
and it overheated after they left**

Admittedly, this is a little bit of a legal gray area. What the law says
you absolutely c*annot* do is **misrepresent** the condition of the car.
If you said that it had no engine issues but it had an engine issue you
knew about, that could be considered fraud, and that's a big deal. You
could be forced to buy the car back and you might face other legal
consequences too. Basically, any false factual statement about the car
could be considered fraud.

For example, if the car was in an accident and it should have been
totaled, but you had a guy you know do the repairs without contacting
insurance, and then you sell the car and say it was never in an accident
because it has a clean CARFAX, that's fraud. However, if it just doesn't
run well, even if you say you think it runs well, that's not fraud.
Everyone has a different definition of "runs well." Opinions about the
car do not constitute fraud, only factual misrepresentation about the
condition of the car.

"As is" simply means you sell it in the condition it is in, you will not
warranty the car after it is sold, and it's up to the buyer to decide if
they want to accept it in that condition. It also means that once the
car is sold, that's it. Your obligation to the car ends at that moment,
so long as you didn't *lie* about the car and say that it was in a
condition other than it was.

In this case, the buyer was not unaware that there were issues. They saw
the "Check Engine" light before they bought the car, and I presume they
spoke to you about the light. Then after that, they bought the car
anyway. I have a feeling that's going to be on them, not on you.
