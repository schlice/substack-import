Short answer: no, pork projects should not be considered corruption.

Longer answer: The projects which get attached to other bills as
\"riders\" are valid projects. They provide meaningful funding to local
projects, albeit in the Congressman\'s district. But this is what
Congressmen are supposed to do: take care of their constituents. If that
means getting funding for projects that they need to have accomplished,
so be it.

**The problem**, as I see it, is that these projects are attached as
\"riders\" to other bills. Thus, when the main bill is approved, the
Congressman\'s pet spending bill is approved as well. Sometimes, many
pet projects get attached to bills coming out of Congress, especially
when there is little chance of the bill failing. If a Congressman would
never want to be seen voting \"no\" on an important piece of
legislation, riders can be safely attached, knowing that no one would
dare vote against the main legislation. Attaching riders to bills is
what causes \"pork barrel\" spending.

One way that the government attempted to fix this issue was by granting
the President the [[**line-item
veto**](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=fe8fd9&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line-item_veto){.external_link

the President to sign the bill but veto the riders. The Line Item Veto
Act of 1996 was ruled unconstitutional in 1998 when the Supreme Court
heard *Clinton v City of New York*. They found that the line-item veto
violates the Presentment Clause of the Constitution because the
President can use the line-item veto to selectively approve or veto
*parts* of bills, not a bill as a whole as required by the Constitution.

We still have not found a way to legislatively limit riders on bills, as
sometimes they are important parliamentary methods by which spending
bills get approved. Nevertheless, a President can veto a bill and return
it to Congress with comments like \"Vetoed because of excessive
riders\". The problem exists when the public looks at the President\'s
veto record and tries to understand why the President would veto a bill
just because he didn\'t like the riders, especially when the bill itself
is very important.
