Of course, if you take the power out of the hands of the parent, the
child could be influenced by *anyone*: school officials, classmates,
state health officials holding "vaccination rallies" in schools, etc.

While I feel for people who believe that children are so at risk that
they must be vaccinated (which, of course, flies in the face of the
science), even against the will of the parent, I don't think the right
answer is to remove the ability of a parent to make consequential
medical decisions for their children.

News flash: the state is not a better parent than the parent.
