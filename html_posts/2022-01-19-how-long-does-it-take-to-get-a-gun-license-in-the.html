Zero minutes.

You do not need to be licensed in order to own a gun in the United
States. Any citizen or lawful permanent resident who is not otherwise
legally prohibited from purchasing a gun can purchase one without any
additional licensing.

Your state may have other requirements, but in general, you do not need
a license to buy a gun in the United States.
