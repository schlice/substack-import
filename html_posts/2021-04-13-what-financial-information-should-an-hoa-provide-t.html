**What financial information should an HOA provide to owners?**

An HOA must maintain and provide financial information exactly as it is
stated in the laws of that state, or in the HOA's Governing Documents if
state or local law does not specify.

For example, here in Florida, state law lists the documents which are
considered to be "official records" of the HOA. These records must be
maintained by the HOA and must be produced to an owner for review upon
demand. They can either be maintained in paper form within the community
where an owner may view and photocopy or photograph them, or they may be
supplied to parcel owners on a website where they can be viewed and
downloaded.

We are required to keep the following financial information:

> \(j\) The financial and accounting records of the association, kept
> according to good accounting practices. All financial and accounting
> records must be maintained for a period of at least 7 years. The
> financial and accounting records must include:
>
> 1.窶アccurate, itemized, and detailed records of all receipts and
> expenditures.
>
> 2.窶ア current account and a periodic statement of the account for each
> member, designating the name and current address of each member who is
> obligated to pay assessments, the due date and amount of each
> assessment or other charge against the member, the date and amount of
> each payment on the account, and the balance due.
>
> 3.窶アll tax returns, financial statements, and financial reports of the
> association.
>
> 4.窶アny other records that identify, measure, record, or communicate
> financial information. --- Fl Stat 720.303(4)(j)
