Since this question was posted into the "Christians and Christianity"
Space, it's no surprise that you'll find that I am a Christian.

As for the second part of your question, you're going to have to define
"understanding and accepting" others' beliefs. Because in modern
parlance, the implications of what you are asking are different than
what the actual words mean.

So let me try to answer these questions and we'll see if we can answer
what you were trying to ask.

- Understanding other beliefs: I do try to understand what others
  believe. I've taken not only college-level courses on great religions
  of the world, but in my study of apologetics, I learned a great deal
  about what others believe. I'm always willing to hear them explain
  what they believe, though, as belief is a very powerful motivator in
  people\'s' lives.
- Accepting the beliefs of others: This is where the water gets muddied.
  Do you mean "accepting the fact that they believe something and
  allowing them to live as they choose, in their belief" or do you mean
  "accepting that their faith is just as valid as mine?" I have a
  feeling you mean the second, because I have no problem accepting that
  people don't all believe as I do, even though I do not accept their
  beliefs as valid. As a Christian, **I do not believe that everyone
  else's religion is right**. In other words, I do not believe that they
  will be able to gain salvation using their faith.

(As a Christian, I also recognize that there is a not-unfounded fear
that those who believe their religion is the right one will be
intolerant of other beliefs.)

The sort of "new-age, everyone sees the same god differently" mindset is
a favorite of Americans who want to be "inclusive." This sentiment is
often illustrated by a parable which has become a favorite amongst
university professors: the parable of the six blind men and the
elephant. Each blind man feels a different part of the elephant and
reaches a different conclusion about the object in front of him. One
grabs a tusk and says, "This is a spear!" Another grabs the tail and
says, "This is a rope!" Still another hugs the leg and says, "This is a
tree!" while another feels the ear and says "This is a fan!" The one who
grabbed the trunk says, "This is a snake!" while the one leaning against
the body says, "This is surely a wall!" The blind men are said to
represent the various religions of the world, as each man came to a
different conclusion about what they were sensing. No one religion, we
are therefore told, has *the* truth. Religions are all just "different
paths up the same mountain."

In America, we're all told that "truth in religion" is an oxymoron.
There is no one truth in religion. It's all just a matter of taste, or
opinion. I like Christianity, you like Islam. Perhaps Judaism works for
you, or Buddhism. Everybody plays, everybody wins! And you can't judge
me for what I believe!

But there are some problems with this approach.

Firstly, *they can't all be right* because *they all believe different
things, and some of those beliefs are mutually exclusive.* For example,
some religions believe that the universe had a beginning (Christians,
Jews, Muslims), while others believe the universe did not have a
beginning and is eternal (Hindus, New Age). But these two claims are
*mutually exclusive*; they can't both be true. Only one can be true.
Either the universe had a beginning, or it did not. By investigating the
history and the nature of the universe, we can determine which one is
most likely true, and which one is more likely false.

Secondly, *we have the capability to see the truth in religion.* Back to
the elephant parable, we were told that no one has the full perspective.
Like each blind man, no one religion has *the* truth. However, there is
one person who has a full view of the entire situation: ***the person
telling the parable.*** He appears to have a complete, objective
perspective of the entire situation, because he can see that the blind
men are actually touching an elephant. In other words, *he wouldn't know
that the blind men were wrong unless he had an objective perspective of
what was right.*

We, too, have the ability to see truth in religion, but often we are not
*actually blind;* we are *willfully* *blind.* We simply do not want to
see the truth, because the truth will convict us. But if we stop hiding
behind our fear and these self-defeating arguments like "truth cannot be
known," we can see the truth as well.

Original question:

What religion do you belong? And as a member of that particular
religion, how would you make yourself more open in terms of understading
and accepting the beliefs of other people?
