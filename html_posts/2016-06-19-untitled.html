<h2>Answer Comment</h2>
<div>

**Content:** [The problem is not with the depiction, or what is being
portrayed in the scene. Porn sites make a killing showing videos of
\"underage\" teens but they are not really underage. All of the actors
are actually at least 18 or older, but they appear younger.\
\
Using *actual* underage persons is the rub. Under the law, an underage
person cannot consent to sex. Depicting sex with an actual underage
person in a recorded medium run into problems related to production of
child pornography.]{.rendered_qtext}
