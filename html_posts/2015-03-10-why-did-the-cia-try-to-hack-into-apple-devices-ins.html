1.  Because passing laws is hard. Hacking software is easier. You\'d
    never get such a law passed. No one would go for it.\
2.  It lets everyone (even the bad guys) know what you\'re doing.
    Consequently, if the bad guys know you can listen in on their
    iPhones and iPads, they won\'t use them.
3.  If they have evidence that leads them to believe they need
    information from an iPhone, they can get a warrant. They don\'t need
    a new law.
4.  The CIA isn\'t chartered to be an intelligence agency within the US.
