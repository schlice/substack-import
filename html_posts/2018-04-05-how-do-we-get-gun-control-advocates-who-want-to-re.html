**How do we get gun control advocates who want to repeal the Second
Amendment to realize that its repeal would not remove the right of
citizens to own guns but would only remove the prohibition on the
government infringement on that right?**

I'm pretty sure this isn't the question we want to be asking.

I'm pretty sure the question you want to be asking is, "How do we get
gun rights supporters to understand that repeal of the Second Amendment
*automatically* implies that a gun prohibition is right around the
corner, followed immediately by either the dissolution of the United
States, or the next civil war?"

Gun rights supporters (myself included) should understand that repeal of
the Second Amendment, while *incredibly difficult* (despite what retired
Justice John Paul Stevens believes), is in fact possible, and would be
immediately followed by a national law banning guns to everyone but
police and military.

Clearly, if we were able to successfully repeal the Second Amendment,
then those in America who want civilians to be able to own guns have
fallen to *record low numbers*, since the numbers needed to ratify such
an Amendment do not exist today.

And if that happens, we know that Federal legislation which bans
possession of guns by anyone but the military or the police is not far
behind.
