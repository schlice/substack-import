**My boyfriends ex wife called DCFS on us. She had told them our house
environmentally unsafe (which was not true). Is there anyway I can
protect myself from her doing this again? Is there any legal recourse I
can take?**

After one incident? Probably not.

But if she continues, and you can establish a pattern of false
reporting, you can have a judge issue a Cease and Desist order or a
Restraining Order (depending on jurisdiction), or potentially, as

said, invite the District Attorney's office to take a look at misuse of
government services charges. This, of course, is dependent on location.

Your boyfriend's attorney may be able to help with some of this. If not,
you should retain one. This process becomes immensely easier with the
assistance of an attorney.
