The most straightforward verse about predestination is Romans 8:29--30:

> For those whom he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the
> image of his Son, in order that he might be the firstborn among many
> brothers. And those whom he predestined he also called, and those whom
> he called he also justified, and those whom he justified he also
> glorified. \-- Romans 8:29--30 ESV

According to that passage, God predetermined that certain individuals
would be conformed to the likeness of His Son, be called, justified, and
glorified. Numerous scriptures refer to believers in Christ being
chosen:

> And if those days had not been cut short, no human being would be
> saved. But for the sake of the elect those days will be cut short. \--
> Matthew 24:22 ESV
>
> And he will send out his angels with a loud trumpet call, and they
> will gather his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to
> the other. \-- Matthew 24:31 ESV
>
> And if the Lord had not cut short the days, no human being would be
> saved. But for the sake of the elect, whom he chose, he shortened the
> days. \-- Mark 13:20
>
> And then he will send out the angels and gather his elect from the

> Who shall bring any charge against God's elect? It is God who
