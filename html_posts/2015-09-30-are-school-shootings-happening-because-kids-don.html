**Content:** [Kids not respecting firearms is indeed a travesty, and
parents should be held responsible when their children
approach/touch/use firearms inappropriately, indicating that they have
not been taught a healthy respect for the firearm. The NRA did a kid\'s
public service video a number of years ago called \"Gun Safety with
Eddie Eagle.\" (You know it was a number of years ago because it was
hosted by [[Jason
Priestley](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=e18f9c&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Priestley){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"

qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}). It had a catchy little
tune and taught this key lesson to kids who see firearms without an
adult present:\

- Stop
- Don\'t Touch
- Leave the Area
- Tell an Adult

Clearly, it never caught on because the people that truly need it look
at it and say, \"Eww, the NRA made this\...\"\
\
However (and I\'m aware), I\'m off-topic.\
\
***THIS IS NOT WHY SCHOOL SHOOTINGS OCCUR!***\
\
Invariably, school shootings occur because of several factors, but
primarily they are mental illness and/or perceived injustices. The
mental illness allows the invalid thought that says that I can solve my
perceived injustice problems by killing others.\
\
Active shooters, almost to a person, know that their shooting is going
to be the last big hurrah, and they are going to go down and want to
take as many others with them as they can.
