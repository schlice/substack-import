**Content:** [*Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.*\
\
If you are not attempting to pass yourself off as someone else in order
to extract any form of gain, you should be protected under the first
amendment. Its no different than wearing a military uniform. If you\'re
not trying to extract any sort of gain from the wearing, you should be
protected.\
\
You should also remember that it is illegal to lie to a government
official about your identity. So your charade must cease when a police
officer or other government official asks you who you are. Passing
yourself off as someone else in that scenario could land you in jail for
the night, if not longer.]{.rendered_qtext}
