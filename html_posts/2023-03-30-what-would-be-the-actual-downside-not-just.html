*Literally nothing.*

Manufacturers will build a new style of semi automatic rifle that
doesn't have the prohibited features of the AR pattern rifle (since
that's all you'd be banning is prohibited cosmetic design, not
functionality). Since the AR platform is so versatile, there are
bzillions of attachments and add-ons to extend the functionality of this
versatile platform, so other manufacturers will create adapter kits
which will allow you to transition your previous accoutrements to the
new rifle platform.

And violent crime still won't care, because crime isn't caused by a
rifle. Mass shootings will not decrease. Shooters will pivot to a new
platform. Don't forget, the Nashville shooter had a Kel-Tec SUB2000
pistol along with a S&W M&P SHIELD 9mm pistol and a rifle manufactured
by Lead Star called the Grunt, and it shoots .300 Blackout. It is an
AR-pattern rifle, but again, that's just because it is the most popular
and most versatile medium-range rifle pattern out there. So one out of
three guns would be banned (and replaced by something else anyway) and
nothing would change.

This incessant focus on the AR pattern rifle because it is the most
popular is silly.

> Actual \"assault weapons\" with full auto features are already banned.

No they're not. You need extra background checks, a bunch of extra
steps, and *a whole helluva lot more money* to get them, but they're not
banned. You can't possess them in a handful of states, but everywhere
else you can have one if you can pass the background checks, jump
through the government hoops, and cough up the artificially inflated
prices for them.
