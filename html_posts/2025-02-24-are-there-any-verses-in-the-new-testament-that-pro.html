Before I answer your specific question, I need to explain what it is you
are referring to.

This is a movement known as **Prosperity Theology**. It is a belief that
financial and physical well-being is a gift of God, and that faith and
charitable donations will increase a believer's material wealth. **We
believe that this is an unbiblical, quite possibly heretical,
teaching.**

There are a number of verses that believers in the prosperity gospel
point to. I know you said New Testament, but believers also point to an
Old Testament passage:

> Bring the full tithe into the storehouse, that there may be food in my
> house. And thereby put me to the test, says the LORD of hosts, if I
> will not open the windows of heaven for you and pour down for you a
> blessing until there is no more need. \-- Malachi 3:10 ESV

But from the New Testament, we have the following:

> The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy. I came that they
> may have life and have it abundantly. \-- John 10:10 ESV
>
> And my God will supply every need of yours according to his riches in
> glory in Christ Jesus. \-- Phil 4:19 ESV
>
> Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in
> health, even as thy soul prospereth. --- 3 John 1:2 KJV
>
> Therefore I tell you, whatever you ask in prayer, believe that you
> have received it, and it will be yours. \-- Mark 11:24 ESV

The idea of the prosperity gospel is foundationally unbiblical, as it
promotes the idea of material blessings as being a sign of God's favor.
It promotes the idolatry of money, and we believe that Jesus\' teachings
indicate a focus away from material wealth, and towards spiritual
blessings.

Jesus spoke directly about this in the Sermon on the Mount:

> Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust
> destroy and where thieves break in and steal, but lay up for
> yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys
> and where thieves do not break in and steal. For where your treasure
> is, there your heart will be also. \-- Matthew 6:19--21 ESV

We believe that the "blessings" spoken of in the other passages refer to
spiritual blessings, not material blessings. Prosperity theology teaches
that God is a cosmic vending machine: put your prayers into the little
coin slot, and financial prosperity comes out the little door at the
bottom. Jesus specifically teaches against this.
