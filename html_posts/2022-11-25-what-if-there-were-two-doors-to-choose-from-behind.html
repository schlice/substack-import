This is an incomplete question.

You forgot to mention *the consequences of choosing each door.*

Adam and Eve were faced with this very choice in the Garden of Eden.
Except that they, too, had incomplete information. While they knew that
they were disobeying God by choosing the apple, I don't think they were
completely aware of the full ramifications of their choice.

So if the consequences are the same (choosing according to your own
preference is a sin against God), I'd choose God's will every time. It
may not look the way I want, but I gain something wonderful in my life,
and I don't sin through my choice.

Sounds like a good trade-off, no?
