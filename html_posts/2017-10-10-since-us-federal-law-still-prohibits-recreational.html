Colorado has done this, but they have done it in a way which does not
violate the 14th Amendment (Federal law applies to states). The way this
works is that the state Constitution provides an affirmative defense
against any state charges which might be related to possession of
marijuana for personal use. In other words, it's still illegal, and you
can still be charged, but because there is an affirmative defense in the
state Constitution, those charges will never stick, so effectively there
is no charge at the state level. There are still laws regarding selling
and distributing marijuana, so if you are caught with multiple kilos of
marijuana, this would be an intent to distribute, and you have to be
licensed by the state to do that, so you can still be charged there. You
can still be charged with lots of other crimes related to marijuana
also, but if you're simply a recreational user in possession of
recreational quantities of marijuana for personal use, you won't be
charged. The law limits how much marijuana you can possess for personal
use at any time.

Additionally, your question regarding interstate highways would be valid
only if you leave the state. The affirmative defense is only valid in
the state of Colorado, and highway laws are enforced by the state, not
the Federal government. Money from the Fed comes to the state first, and
the state then uses the money to pay for the highway system, so
technically (and technicalities matter), it's the state that pays for
the interstate highway within the state borders, but the interstate
nature of the highway necessitates assistance from the Federal
government to do it.

Anyone who intends to purchase marijuana in Colorado should acquaint
themselves with the laws here regarding how you can get it, where you
can use it, and how you can get it from where you buy it to where you
use it. Since Federal highway use is enforced at the state level within
the state, you would be protected by the state constitution within the
state. Those same state laws say you **cannot** leave the state with
marijuana under any circumstance. Once you leave the state, the issue
becomes a very clear *interstate commerce* issue, and you are clearly
under Federal jurisdiction, not state jurisdiction, so the state
protections vanish at the border.
