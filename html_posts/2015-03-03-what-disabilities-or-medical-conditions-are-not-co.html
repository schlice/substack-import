**Content:** [The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) is the law that
covers discrimination against people with disabilities in the United
States.\
\
In order to qualify as someone with a \"disability,\" you have to have a
disease or medical condition, or a physical or mental impairment, which
\"substantially limits one or more major life activities, has a record
of such an impairment, or is regarded as having such an impairment.\"\
\
Any disease or condition which meets that standard is considered a
\"disability\" under ADA. There isn\'t a specific list of diseases or
conditions that are called out as \"covered\" or \"not covered.\"\
\
Under ADA, you cannot be questioned to determine if you actually have a
disability. For example, if Multiple Sclerosis causes muscle weakness,
and you claim muscle weakness because you have Multiple Sclerosis, you
cannot be tested to determine whether or not you have muscle weakness
before receiving benefits under ADA.\
\
In employment, an employer is allowed to ask you whether or not you can
perform the essential functions of the job, with or without reasonable
accommodations. An employer is not allowed to discriminate against you
simply because you have a specific disease or condition. An employer is
allowed to test you to ensure you can perform the essential functions of
a job before you get the job, but if testing is done, then all new
applicants should be tested.\
\
You are also not required to disclose your disease or condition to your
employer if you do not need an accommodation. Your medical history and
current treatments are protected health information (PHI) and are only
allowed to be disclosed between you, your doctor, and your insurance
company.]{.rendered_qtext}
