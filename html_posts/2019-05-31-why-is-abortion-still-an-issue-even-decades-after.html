**Why is abortion still an issue even decades after Roe v. Wade?**

First, law, like science, is never "settled." Remember, *Plessy v.
Ferguson*, which made racial segregation legal, was "settled law" for 60
years before the Court overturned it.

Law is never settled. There is either "good law," or "bad law." Good law
welcomes challenges and easily overcomes them. Bad law is afraid of
challenges, and falls because it's...well...bad law.

*Roe v. Wade* is bad law.

*First, I want to note that this is* ***not*** *an answer about
abortion. You can ask questions about abortion separately. This is an
answer about law. Secondly, my personal opinions about abortion are
wholly irrelevant to a legal discussion. Don't be surprised if comments
about "abortion is murder" or "you don't respect women" get summarily
deleted.*

*Now, back to our regularly-scheduled legal discussion.*

*Roe v. Wade* is bad law because it is based on a precedent of bad law.
The decision in *Roe* came from a previous bad decision: *Griswold v.
Connecticut*. In this decision, the court magically "discovered" a right
that wasn't written into the Bill of Rights. Like the Court was an
explorer, poking through the sunken wreckage of the Constitution, and
discovered a right that no one knew was there. The right we are talking
about is the right to privacy. The Court said in *Griswold* that a right
to privacy exists in the Constitution, but it can only be found in the
"emanations and penumbras" of the Constitution, not actually in the
written words. Now I'm going to boil down the findings in *Griswold* to
something we can all easily understand, but know that *Griswold* was a
complex decision. Basically, if you look at certain rights, like the 5th
Amendment, the 4th Amendment, the 8th Amendment, and the 14th Amendment
(and even the 2nd Amendment), you can sorta see a trend. The trend in
those Amendments is that you have certain personal rights which are
protected. In general, a right to be free from government intrusion into
your life. Putting all of those trends together, the Court found that
there is an overall "right to privacy" in the Constitution.

The easiest way to describe what the court did is this way: Let's assume
a shopkeeper has a sign on his door which says "No Dogs or Cats
Allowed." A reasonable person would say that it's okay to bring a pet
ferret in, because the sign calls out dogs and cats. If the owner didn't
want ferrets, he would have stated that ferrets were not allowed. Those
who think like the progressives on the Court do would look at that sign
and say, "Oh, the owner doesn't want dogs or cats, he must mean that he
doesn't want any *pets* in, so you can't bring ferrets, snakes,
pot-bellied pigs, or any other pet either."

*Roe* built on the shaky, unreliable decision in *Griswold* and found
that if you have a right to privacy, you have a right to privacy with
what you do with your body, and found that you have a right to have an
abortion. *Roe* was also a terrible decision because they *completely
ignored* the issue of whether or not the baby is alive and therefore has
rights as a human. Not that they found that the baby did not have
rights. They *ignored the question*. Therefore, if any court, ever,
finds that the baby is alive and does have human rights, then *Roe*
literally goes out the window, and the writers of the *Roe* decision
openly acknowledged this.

This is the biggest problem that I have with *Roe*. Not that it was
built on shaky legal foundations; while that much is true, that's not my
big issue. My big issue is that they totally acknowledged that they were
ignoring whether or not the baby was alive, and thus had rights, and
they went ahead with their decision anyway. Some quotes from the
concurring opinion written by Justice Blackmun in *Roe:*

> *We need not resolve the difficult question of when life begins. When
> those trained in the respective disciplines of medicine, philosophy,
> and theology are unable to arrive at any consensus, the judiciary, at
> this point in the development of man\'s knowledge, is not in a
> position to speculate as to the answer...*

This is the most notable of the quotes that indicates just how badly
*Roe* was written. Instead of saying, "we can't figure out whether or
not the baby is alive, so we're going to proceed assuming the baby is
alive," they said, "we can't figure out whether or not the baby is
alive, so since they can't figure it out, we won't try either, and we'll
just ignore the whole thing." Just incredible.

Reading the opinion, you can see that if science ever determines that a
baby in the womb is alive, and therefore is to be afforded human rights,
then the whole foundation upon which *Roe* was built will crumble.

That's a terrible foundation on which to build a law.
