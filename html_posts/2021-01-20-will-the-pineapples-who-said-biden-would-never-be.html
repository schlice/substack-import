**Will the pineapples who said Biden would never be sworn in finally
accept him as President of the United States now?**

Sure, just as soon as the pineapples on the other side of the aisle who
spent the last four years saying that Trump was "not their President"
accept the fact that he *was* *actually* *President* for the last four
years.

If you weren't wont to accept someone you believe stole the election in
the first place, then there's really no point in time that your mind
will likely be changed. You're going to believe what you want to
believe, and a swearing-in ceremony isn't likely going to change that.
