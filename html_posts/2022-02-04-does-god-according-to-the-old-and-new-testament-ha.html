John 4:24 says, "God is spirit, and his worshipers must worship in the
Spirit and in truth." So it is clear that God is spirit.

In Luke 24:39, Jesus said, "Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I
myself. Handle me and see, for a spirit does not have flesh and bones as
you see I have." So he makes it clear that a spirit does not have flesh
and bones, and we know that God is spirit.

Paul frequently wrote about the "invisible" God (Romans 1:20, Colossians
1:15, 1 Timothy 1:17, 1 Timothy 6:16).

We also know that God acts as a spirit, so it is less of a physical
description, but a mode of action. John 6:63 says, " The Spirit gives
life; the flesh counts for nothing. The words I have spoken to
you---they are full of the Spirit and life."

I think there is ample evidence in the Bible that God is spirit, and a
spirit has no physical body.

Original question:

Does God, according to the Old and New Testament, have a body of bone
and flesh, or is he formless?
