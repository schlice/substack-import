Yes, but in most cases, it is unlikely.

First of all, these are all laws governed by the individual states, so
there are state dependencies here. But in the vast majority of cases, a
competent court will grant parental rights to biological parents unless
they are adjudicated to be unfit (which is a high bar to overcome), or
if the parents have acted in a way contrary to their constitutional
rights as parents.

Generally, courts try to keep children with their biological parents.,
but ultimately it's not about who makes a better parent. It's about
**the best interests of the child**.

Grandparents can petition the court to award them custody by proving the
parents are unfit, showing that they have a history of drug or alcohol
addiction, mental illness, neglect, or abuse. In these cases, the court
has options. They can grant temporary custody for up to a year, and if
the parents have not cleaned up their act in that timeframe (or made
significant steps towards recovery) that order could become permanent.

Other reasons that grandparents can be granted parental rights over
biological parents:

- Mutual consent. If the parents and grandparents agree that such a move
  is in the best interests of the children, the court can order it.
- Pre-existing habitation. If the children have been living with the
  grandparents for more than a year, the court may want to keep the
  children where they are to avoid causing unnecessary trauma.
