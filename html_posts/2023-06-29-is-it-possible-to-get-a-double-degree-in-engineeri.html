Probably not. You could double major in an engineering discipline and
then in another STEM field, but you probably wouldn't have the time in
your schedule to double-major in two engineering disciplines.

One of my classmates in my graduating squadron double majored in
Astronautical Engineering and Math. So I know that it is possible to do
it, but I just don't think you have enough time in the schedule to cram
two engineering disciplines in, with all of the other Academy
commitments on your time.
