**When Democrats subpoenaed Trump officials during his impeachment and
they didn\'t show up, can Obama officials refuse to show up on Lindsey
Graham\'s subpoenas?**

Lots of heavily politically tilted answers here, let's see if we can get
you a more neutral answer.

When Trump officials were subpoenaed by Congress, Trump did not allow
them to testify, citing Executive Privilege. This is a doctrine which
states that presidents can keep communications secret in order to
encourage communications between government officials, and the President
can protect that information when it relates specifically to
governmental functions.

In this case, there was no "compromise and mutual deference." Each side
bandied their arguments about and neither moved forward with any attempt
at compromise.

If Senator Graham subpoenas members of Obama's staff, could Obama order
them to not testify, citing executive privilege? No one knows, as it has
never happened before. If they did, it would then be up to Senator
Graham to bring his subpoena to the courts to determine which side has
priority: the Congressional subpoena, or the Executive claim of
privilege.
