**Content:** [You have to set boundaries in your life and your
relationship. You can\'t control him, you can\'t change him, but you can
control you, and you have the right to be comfortable with him. To do
that, you set boundaries for interaction with you.\
]{.rendered_qtext}

- He doesn\'t have to like jazz, but you can set a boundary that you
  won\'t be subjected to rap while you drive with him. He can either
  listen to jazz, or listen to nothing. It\'s not fair to you to force
  you to listen to something you find objectionable. (By the way, I
  totally agree about rap, most of it is very degrading towards women. I
  ***rarely*** hear rap \"songs\" that promote a positive image of
  women - they mostly talk about getting rich, drinking, smoking weed,
  and performing sexual acts with women, but never is the word \"woman\"
  used; it\'s always the word for a female dog. Don\'t get me wrong,
  some artists have some good songs, but by and large, the genre is
  filled with the aforementioned activities.)\
- You can have an intelligent conversation without interjecting personal
  anecdotes. He can choose to not be objective while having a
  conversation, but your boundary is that you will not have personal
  anecdotes injected into conversations. When he starts to do that, you
  can interrupt him and say, \"Remember, we agreed, no personal
  anecdotes.\"

You have to learn to take people as they are. You don\'t take a
boyfriend because you can fix him. An old quote I heard about marriage
was \"Women marry men hoping they will change, and they don\'t. Men
marry women hoping they won\'t change, and they do.\" If you\'re
expecting to \"make him better,\" you\'re in for a rude awakening: you
can\'t make anyone do anything they don\'t want to do, and usually if
you try you\'ll just get the opposite reaction. If you can\'t accept him
the way he is, it\'s time to move on.\
\
Remember, you can only control you. Try this mental exercise to help
you: Stand in one spot and draw a circle around your feet. Everything
inside the circle, you can change. Everything outside the circle, you
can\'t change. You can set boundaries at the circle for interacting with
you, but you can\'t change others outside the circle.
