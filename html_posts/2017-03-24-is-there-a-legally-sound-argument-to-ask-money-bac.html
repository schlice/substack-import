There is **not**.

The company's **reputation** **** is of no consequence. The company's
**deliverables** is what is most important.

If you have prepaid for a service, and the company delivers that service
within the timeframe agreed, then the reputation of the company is
inconsequential. It may personally characterize you in the future, but
that's not a reason to terminate a contract for which you've pre-paid.

I simply don't see how the company's reputation has any bearing on the
deliverables you have paid for.
