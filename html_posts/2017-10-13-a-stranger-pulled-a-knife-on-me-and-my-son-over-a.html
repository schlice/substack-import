The charge in most jurisdictions is "brandishing a weapon," but if you
didn't call the police right away, I doubt they will charge the
individual now. You can always feel free to call the police department
(non-emergency number, please) and ask to speak to an officer about the
situation.

You can also sue for assault, as brandishing a weapon is also an assault
in tort. Check with a lawyer on this one.
