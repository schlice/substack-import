**Is it illegal to threaten presidential candidates online?**

While intricacies always exist, the short answer is an emphatic **yes**.

certain other persons***

I'll skip the definition of "immediate family" and I'll skip the
definition of paragraph 4 since those weren't asked for. But the
definition in paragraph 3 of "a major candidate" is defined in Title 18
§ 3056(a)(7) as "those individuals identified as such by the Secretary
of Homeland Security after consultation with an advisory committee
consisting of the Speaker of the House of Representatives, the minority
leader of the House of Representatives, the majority and minority
leaders of the Senate, and one additional member selected by the other
members of the committee." In other words, once Congress recognizes that
a person is a major candidate and identifies them to the Secretary of
Homeland Security, they are covered under this section. Their spouses
are also covered within 120 days of the election as well.

The definition of "threaten" which matters in this context is
threatening to "kill, kidnap, or inflict bodily harm."

The medium is irrelevant. Threats anywhere are taken seriously.
