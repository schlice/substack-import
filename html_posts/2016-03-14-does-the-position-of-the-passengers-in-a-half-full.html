Short answer: yes.

Longer answer: It only really matters on smaller aircraft. I\'ve spent
many late nights flying the short hop from Denver to Colorado Springs.
The crews on those aircraft (usually Canadair regional jets) will
redistribute passengers throughout the cabin for weight and balance
purposes. I\'ve often been seated near the front of the plane and have
voluntarily moved to the last row for weight and balance requirements.
It\'s kinda fun back there. Plus the flight is only about 20 minutes; I
can stand on my head and spit nickels for 20 minutes. I don\'t mind
moving.
