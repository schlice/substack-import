**Do you agree or disagree with the American College of Pediatricians
when they say that human life starts at conception?**

Yes.

**But that doesn't mean that we can't destroy it.**

If we are all going to be honest with ourselves, then we must all also
be hones about the fact that a zygote is the *beginning* of a phase in a
human life. It is a unique human life form.

But we must also be honest with ourselves about the fact that it cannot
survive outside of the mother's womb.

Therefore, it is asinine silliness when we start talking about death
certificates for miscarriages and criminal charges for unlawful disposal
of a body after a miscarriage, or inability to do IVF because the zygote
is "legally alive" before it is inserted into the uterus.

We can say that the zygote represents a fully-realized life form *while
at the same time* recognizing that it is fully unviable outside of a
woman's womb and can't be protected as a human life until it is viable
outside of the womb.

We've shown that fetuses as young as 24 weeks are viable outside of the
womb.

Destroying life after that point should not be done lightly. Or out of
convenience.
