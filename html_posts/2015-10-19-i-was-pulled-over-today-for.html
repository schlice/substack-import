**Content:** [Laws are different in each state. Some states stipulate
that police vehicles must be perpendicular to the road. Colorado, for
example, stipulates that the radar must be captured from a marked police
vehicle (no unmarked cars clocking traffic), but does not dictate how
the vehicle must be positioned in order to capture speed. State laws
don\'t usually address the \"visibility\" of the car, as that is
subjective and is based on the position of the target vehicle in
relation to the police vehicle.\

If you were really speeding, and you got a ticket, just pay the fine and
do better next time.]{.rendered_qtext}
