There are a few realities that you are ignoring.

1\. There are 300,000,000 guns in the United States. How do you propose
enforcing such a ban on non-biometric weapons? Should the police go
door-to-door? Should they break down doors and dig up yards to find
hidden weapons caches? You have to repeal the 2nd, 4th, and 14th
Amendments before you can do this Should there be a buyback, and will
they pay fair market price, and where exactly will all that money come
from?

2\. The beauty of firearms is their simplicity and reliability. Taking a
firearm and making it inherently more complex and less reliable
hamstrings the weapon. Additionally, what will happen if the WiFi or the
biometrics fail exactly when you need to use them? You\'re dead. And
with a gun being such a simple mechanical device, it\'s an easy task to
bypass any such biometric locks.

3\. The Constitution does not grant you the right to self-defense. The
Constitution enjoins the government from restricting the right you
already had. Self-defense is a natural right. The state, therefore,
can\'t grant you the right to own weapons, you already have it as a
function of being a US citizen and a human being. The Constitution
simply says that the government cannot make any laws which infringe on
the right you already have. You\'d have to re-write the Second Amendment
to allow it to be restricted by government, which is antithetical to how
it was originally intended.

I like your ideas, but they are far more far away than you think, and
they have to get far more reliable before anyone will accept them.
