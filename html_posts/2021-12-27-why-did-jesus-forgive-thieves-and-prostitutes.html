Why do doctors only heal sick patients? Why don't they only heal people
who are well?

Why do churches allow anyone in? Why don't they only offer their
services to priests and deacons and other pastors and ministers?

Jesus offers salvation to everyone, but especially those who need it
most.

Jesus doesn't care what you did in the past. If you have repented of
your sins and you have accepted him as your savior, your past is
history.

If you would like to no longer be defined by your past, then come to
Jesus.
