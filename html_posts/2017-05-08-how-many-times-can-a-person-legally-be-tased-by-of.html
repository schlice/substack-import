The answer to both questions is "it depends."

> *How many times can a person legally be tased by officers?*

As far as I know, there isn't any legal limit to how many times a person
can be hit with a Taser. Clearly, there is no Federal statute that
mandates any limit; there may be state laws which apply. Mostly, this
will be covered by department policy, since a Taser is a
"less-than-lethal" device. How many times the Taser is activated will be
a matter of the department's "use of force" policy. Therefore, in almost
all departments, every Taser deployment, including how many times the
Taser was activated, will be reviewed by that department's internal
review team during a Use of Force (UOF) Review. These reviews are
conducted periodically or as-needed to review every use of force by an
officer. A use of force is anything from applying hands all the way up
the force continuum to application of deadly force.

> *How much training is required to actually operate one?*

Again, there is no Federal standard. States determine levels of training
required of officers who are certified peace officers in that state. A
state level department called POST (Peace Officer Standardization and
Training) reviews all training classes and certifies all officers
trained under those classes as peace officers.

In the vast majority of states, officers will take a training class
learning the functions of the device, how it works, and will have the
opportunity to deploy it. Additionally, in almost all states that I know
of (almost; I know of at least one state that does not require this), an
officer will be hit with a Taser. However, for sake of expediency,
officers are not hit with barbs; a training Taser with
permanently-attached wires and alligator clips is used.

In our department (though not true in every department), every item on
the duty belt will be approved by the department and the officer must
have been certified on the use of that item before it can be worn as
part of the uniform. The Taser is included in that requirement.
