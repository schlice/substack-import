We are a federation of independent states. Police enforce state law, and
since each state is independent, it can have its own laws. Those laws
are enforced by police in that state, who answer to the governor.

There is a national police force: the FBI. But they only enforce federal
law, not state law. Federal law is only concerned about actions which
are *interstate* actions (or at least, that's how it is in theory).
There is no "national police force" because there is no set of "national
laws" that applies to all states **intra-state**. Each state manages its
own laws, and has its own set of police forces to enforce state law.

As for order coming out of chaos, I think at some point, there would be
some form of order that would eventually take hold.

But if human history is to be any guide, it will be rule by the
strongest, or the most well-armed, who will rule over the weaker,
unarmed populace. Gangs will likely take over and will lord over their
territories.

That is, unless some organized, **armed** militia (such as the National
Guard) takes over so that the rule of law is maintained.

So stepping back, you must concede that at some point, if we are to have
order and a rule of law (which we do, rather than allowing the situation
to naturally devolve until some form of order is eventually reached), we
will have to have armed enforcement of that law. In a federation of
independent states, this is most appropriately accomplished at the state
level.
