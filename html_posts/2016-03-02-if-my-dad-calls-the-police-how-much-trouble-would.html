If you take the car and your dad calls the police and reports it stolen,
the car will get pulled over and you will be arrested and sent to jail.
The charge in most jurisdictions is \"grand theft auto.\" Yes, it is a
real charge, not just a video game. It is a felony. Assuming your dad
presses charges, you will spend a minimum of one year in jail, and pay a
minimum fine of \$1,000 (probably more depending on where you live).
