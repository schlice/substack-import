The trick is, you can. But it's harder.

For the purposes of this discussion, we'll lump Conservatives and
Republicans together and just call them "Republican," and we'll lump
Liberals, Progressives, and Democrats together and just call them
"Democrat."

Generally speaking, Republicans prefer smaller government and more
individual freedom, while Democrats prefer more governmental oversight
of society and the economy. Republicans argue for capitalism, which is
free (for the most part) from governmental control, while Democrats have
more socialistic tendencies in regards to the government's role. Neither
capitalism nor socialism is explicitly endorsed by the Bible. It is
believed that governments are endowed with the necessary authority to
execute their divinely-inspired responsibilities, which include
upholding justice and establishing order within society (Romans 13:1-7).
Therefore, with respect to the size and scope of government, Christians
can be libertarian, conservative, liberal, or progressive. None of those
political worldviews are inherently evil or ungodly. The thing which
should drive your choice, as a Christian, should be **which party best
allows government to fulfill its God-given role.**

While issues such as the size and scope of government or specifics about
economic systems are not explicitly addressed in the Bible, there
definitely are some political issues the Bible does address, such as
abortion (Genesis 1:26-27; 9:6; Exodus 21:22-25; Psalm 139:13-16;
Jeremiah 1:5), and homosexual sex (Leviticus 18:22; 20:13; 1 Corinthians
6:9; 1 Timothy 1:9--10. Romans 1:26--27). For the Bible-believing
Christian, abortion is not a matter of a woman's right to choose. It is
a matter of the life or death of a human being made in God's image.
Endorsing homosexual sex is giving approval to a lifestyle choice the
Bible condemns as immoral and unnatural. Whether these two issues should
trump all other issues is a matter of personal conviction.

Finally, and I think that many Christians fail on this point, we must
remember thar no matter who is in office, whether we voted for them or
not, whether they are of the political party we prefer or not, the Bible
commands us to respect and honor them (Romans 13:1-7; 1 Peter 2:13-17).
We should also be praying for those placed in authority over us
(Colossians 4:2; 1 Thessalonians 5:17). We do not have to agree with
them, or even like them, but we do have to honor and respect them.
Christians should *never* condone any "not my president" talk. If he or
she was duly elected, they *are* your president, and we are commanded to
support them, and respect and honor their position.
