**Content:** [It looks like they gave you what you were asking for: an
accounting of the debt they believe you owe. From here depends on a few
factors:\

1.  Did you ever have an account with them? If you never had an account
    with them, that is the basis for your reply.\
2.  Assuming you had an account with them, did you actually accrue the
    charges listed on their photocopy? If you didn\'t actually accrue
    the charges, then you are contesting their accounting of your
    service.\
3.  Assuming you did accrue the charges they showed you, did you pay the
    charges? If you did, you should be easily able to show them dates
    and amounts of your remissions.

I\'d probably show them whatever proof I had and then tell them to cease
and desist with further attempts to collect from you unless they choose
to pursue the matter in court.\
\
If they continue to attempt to collect after you have provided your
proof, you will have to fight them in court, and add harassment to the
list of charges. At this point, a lawyer\'s assistance will be needed.
