Not sure what you mean by "why did the US military change their process
for it," but the ASVAB is the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude
Battery. It replaced the AFQT (the Armed Forces Qualifying Test).

The military has been using qualification testing since World War I. The
Army first started testing people in 1917 (tests called the Army Alpha
and the Army Beta). These tests were standardized into the Army General
Classification Test (AGCT) and the Navy General Classification Test
(NGCT). The purpose of these tests was to ensure that military
applicants had specific aptitude to do specific jobs. It was used as a
placement test to place applicants into military jobs. By the end of
World War II, the services all had their own individual tests for
military selection.

But after WWII, the services moved back to a single aptitude test,
called the Armed Forces Qualifying Test (AFQT). The new AFQT was modeled
after the AGCT. However, the AFQT was specifically designed to be used
as a screening device. To that end, the AFQT was established to both
measure examinees' general ability to absorb military training within a
reasonable length of time, and provide a uniform measure of examinees'
potential usefulness in the military. The AFQT was used by all of the
Services through 1972. While the AFQT was used to identify military
applicants who had a reasonable probability of success in service, other
Service-specific tests were needed to classify them into jobs. The Army
Classification Battery, the Navy Basic Test Battery, and the Airman
Qualification Examination, just to name a few, were used for
classification purposes from the late 1950s to the mid 1970s.

The first ASVAB was introduced in 1968, and by 1975 all the services had
moved away from individual testing and were using the ASVAB for both
selection and classification of applicants. Combining selection and
classification testing made the testing process more efficient. It also
enabled the Services to improve the matching of applicants with
available job positions and allowed job guarantees for those qualified.
