As a Christian, I know that we are all sinners. We have all fallen short
of the glory of God (Romans 3:23). I am no better or worse than Trump in
that regard. You said that "\[Trump\] is not a good man." But *no one
is!* No one is righteous, not one (Romans 3:10).

Yes, he is a sinner. Yes, he has character flaws. Yes, I would beseech
him to seek repentance and forgiveness. But whether or not he does that
is between him and his Savior. While I would encourage him to do so, I
cannot force him to do so.

So it wouldn't be right to judge whether or not I should vote for him
based on his sins alone, because using that metric, I can't vote for
anyone. I could only vote for Jesus, because He is the only person who
was ever sinless.

So if I can't use their level of righteousness to determine whether or
not to vote for any one candidate, what do I use?

I use their potential for positive results for the country. Whose
policies will best promote the common good? As a Christian, we should
first turn to the Bible for answers.

> But seek the welfare of the city where I have sent you into exile, and
> pray to the LORD on its behalf, for in its welfare you will find your
> welfare. \-- Jeremiah 29:7 ESV

So it seems that the Bible agrees that we should vote in a way in which
we justifiably believe will promote the common good.

I personally follow the "Least Bad Option" strategy. Since it is quite
possible that either candidate will provide some "common good," and
neither candidate is perfect, I tend to vote for the candidate who is
the "lesser of two evils," which suggests that both candidates might be
detrimental to the common good. Nevertheless, I can still vote in good
conscience for the less harmful candidate when I am convinced that they
possess the necessary qualifications and suitability for the office, and
is the most likely to provide good outcomes for the country.

So yes, as a Christian, I can safely vote for Trump, knowing that his
presidency is the most likely to provide good outcomes for the largest
majority of the country.
