Consult with a marriage and family attorney in your area. If your dad is
so concerned about this, then perhaps he can pay for that attorney to
make the arrangements, or to advise you on how to proceed.

I would not do anything, including announcing to the world through the
court system who the father is, until you get the advice of an attorney
in your area.
