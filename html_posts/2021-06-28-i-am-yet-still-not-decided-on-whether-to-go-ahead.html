Make up your mind sooner rather than later.

Because being vaccinated with a *partially effective* vaccine is better
than not being vaccinated at all.

And the longer you go without a vaccine, the more chance you get of
either contracting COVID, or passing it on to someone else who can't
make up their mind.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not going to shame you if you choose to not get
the vaccine. That's your choice. You get to live with the consequences
of your choice, and so do all of the other unvaccinated people around
you, including those who, for one reason or another, may not be able to
be vaccinated.

But don't delay vaccination just because you can't decide which flavor
of vaccine you want. Flip a coin if you must. Believe it or not, that's
precisely what I did. I flipped a coin and ended up with the Pfizer
vaccine.

But seriously, just do it. And do it *soon*.

Original question:

I am yet still not decided on whether to go ahead and get the
Astrazeneca vaccination or not because I am not getting a satisfying
response on how helpful it is. What should I do?
