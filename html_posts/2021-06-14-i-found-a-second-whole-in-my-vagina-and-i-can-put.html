Sounds like it's your hymen.

Unless it is bleeding or painful, it's probably nothing to worry about.

If you are really concerned about it, talk to your parent or guardian
about it, and ask to see a doctor if they can't help you. If you don't
want to talk to them about it, you can talk to the school nurse.
