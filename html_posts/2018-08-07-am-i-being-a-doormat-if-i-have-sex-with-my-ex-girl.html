**Am I being a doormat if I have sex with my ex girlfriend when she
tells me she still loves me but can\'t be in a relationship? Is she
playing with me?**

You're not being a doormat unless you're pining for a relationship.

With your ex, it's all about a good roll in the hay, and that's it.
You're her sex toy. You mean nothing to her. She doesn't love you. She
loves having sex with you.

If you're okay with being her self-propelled dildo, if you're okay with
being her booty call, then there's nothing wrong with what you're doing,
and you're not a doormat.

If, however, you continue to have sex with her because, deep down in
your heart, you really think you can "win her back" and get her back as
a girlfriend, then yes sir, you are a doormat.

She's not interested in a relationship (which also is why she really
doesn't love you). She's interested in a fuck buddy, and that's it.

If you want something more out of a relationship, stop wasting your time
with her, and go find yourself a real relationship, and cut it off with
the booty call.
