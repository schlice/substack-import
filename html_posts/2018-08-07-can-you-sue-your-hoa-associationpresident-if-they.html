**Can you sue your HOA association/president if they caused a potential
buyer to back out of their contract on your home? The HOA president
confronted the new buyer for going over our 15 mph speed limit, and it
escalated to the point of no return.**

As we've often said here on Quora, you can sue anyone for anything.

The real kicker is whether or not you have a chance of winning.

In this case, you have little chance of prevailing.

First of all, there is no affirmative obligation for anyone to buy your
house. Even if there is an agreement to sign a contract, each individual
is free to choose, for whatever reason they want, to not enter into that
agreement. You may not be happy with the HOA president, but he incurs no
liability for causing someone to change their attitude about the
neighborhood and choose not to buy a home.

Secondly, if the HOA owns the roads (i.e. it's a gated community), then
the HOA is responsible for ensuring that the speed limit is enforced,
regardless of whether or not the person is a resident, a guest, or a
potential owner. The speed limits are presumably in place to keep people
safe, so if people are so flippant with them, perhaps they weren't the
right fit for the neighborhood anyway. The HOA president is completely
within his rights to confront speeders.

I'm sorry the contract fell through, and you might want to blame that
loss on the HOA president, and you might even be right to do so. But in
terms of liability, there isn't really any here that I can see.
