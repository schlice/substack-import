**How far will you go to get a desired seat on a flight?**

I will go exactly as far as the airlines allow me to go.

If we're talking about all the major carriers except for Southwest, that
means paying for an upgrade in the coach cabin, which I guess you'd now
consider a "premium coach seat."

If we're talking about Southwest, it either means setting alarms so I
can check in exactly 24 hours prior to boarding, or paying for Early
Bird check-in. I have only paid for Early Bird check in when I knew that
I was going to be out of coverage (i.e. at sea) when 24 hours rolled
around. I also paid for it on business flights where my seat was paid
for by the company. I can chip in a little to get a better seat
selection on-board.
