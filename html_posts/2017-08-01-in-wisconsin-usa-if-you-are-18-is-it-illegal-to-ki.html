Dating is not illegal.

Holding hands is not illegal.

Kissing is not illegal.

**Sexual intercourse** with someone under the age of 18 **is**
**illegal** in Wisconsin.

Also, Wisconsin does not have a "close in age" law, so if an 18 year old
has sex with a 16 year old, the 18 year old can be charged with
statutory rape.

Also in Wisconsin, if both participants are underage, they can **both**
be charged with statutory rape, although this would be the exception
rather than the rule.
