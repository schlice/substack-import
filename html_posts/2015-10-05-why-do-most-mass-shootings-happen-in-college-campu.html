**Content:** []{.rendered_qtext}

- Most college-campus shootings are perpetrated by college-campus
  students
- Most college-campus shooters have a ***perceived injustice*** which
  has taken place, and over many years, have developed a perception that
  life is not worth living\
- Most college-campus shooters have spent years developing their plan of
  revenge against those who have wronged them
- Most college-campus shooters have watched other college-campus
  shooters get their revenge and watched their perceived aggressors get
  their comeuppance, and have idolized or even emulated their
  \"bravery\"\
- Most college-campus shooters know that most colleges are fairly devoid
  of armed resistance, if not through policy than through developed
  distaste of guns by people who frequent college campuses, so their
  plans for revenge will go off without too much of a hitch
- Most college-campus shooters know that this is their \"last hurrah\"
  so they want to go out with a bang (no pun intended) and they want to
  take as many of their perceived aggressors with them before they go,
  so most college campus shooters will only stop shooting when they are
  done, or when they are confronted with armed resistance, at which
  point they end it through suicide or \"suicide-by-cop\".
