If it is, it is the largest mass delusion ever recorded, with over 3
billion people globally currently experiencing exactly the same
delusion, and hundreds of billions more historically.

Additionally, if it is a delusion, then everyone in history who ever had
a spiritual experience was delusional. While this is possible, given the
vast number of spiritual experiences, it does not seem likely. It is
difficult to believe that every great spiritual leader and thinker in
the history of humanity, including some of the most rational,
scientific, and critical minds ever, have all been completely wrong
about their spiritual experiences. This includes people like Abraham,
Moses, Isaiah, Kepler, Newton, Pascal, and Jesus Christ himself. *If
just one spiritual experience in the entire history of the world is
true, then believe in God cannot be a delusion.*
