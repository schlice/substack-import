You tried to malign too many groups all at once. You're bashing on
Republicans, pro-lifers, and whites (with your "brown baby" comment).
Honestly, if you wanted to craft a question hating on one group or the
other, you should have picked one.

For now, I'm going to ignore the "brown baby" comment and stick with
Republicans and pro-life people. These two groups are not the same. One
position is political, and the other is philosophical. Most Republicans
believe that abortion should be permitted up until about 15 to 20 weeks,
which would actually permit more than 90% of all abortions. Pro-life
people value all human life equally, and that value doesn't change based
on the circumstances of that child's conception.

So for Republican pro-life politicians, the view they hold should mirror
the majority of people in the district they represent. So if the
majority say that sensible limits on abortion (i.e. the aforementioned
15--20 weeks) are acceptable, then that's what they should support
legislatively.

But what they do *in their own homes*, with their own family, may be
different. And that's by design. Legislatively, they should support
whatever their constituents support; they may legislate in opposition to
their values because they are *representatives*. As such, they
*represent* the people who elected them. Good legislators set aside
their personal feelings and beliefs, and write laws that their people
want.

So a Republican who is also pro-life will probably live his pro-life
values in his *personal* life, not so much in his *legislative* life.
What that means is that he will ensure that his 12-year-old daughter
gets the best medical care available, and when the baby is born, he will
likely help her put it up for adoption.

You then asked another question:

> **What kind of a parent would let her die in childbirth?**

None. No parent would let their child die in childbirth. Neither will
any hospital in the United States. **Every** state in the United States
permits doctors to save the lives of mothers, regardless of any abortion
laws. The cases you hear in the news are actually examples of **medical
malpractice**. They are unrelated to abortion laws. No doctor would ever
fail to save the life of a mother because he can't perform an abortion.
Such a doctor would be sued for malpractice and would likely lose their
license.

You think that because the girl is 12 that childbirth will kill her?
Hardly. What kills pregnant women is a lack of competent prenatal care,
not the fact that she is pregnant. If her body allows her to carry a
child, her body will allow her to birth that child as well. So long as
she has good medical care (which a Congresscritter can likely afford),
she should be just fine.
