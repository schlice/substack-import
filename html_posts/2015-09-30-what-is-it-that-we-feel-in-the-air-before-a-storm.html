**Content:** [There are several things that could be causing that
phenomenon.\
\
You did specify pressure changes. You\'ll often hear older people say
that a body part \"aches\" right before a storm. The theory is that
pressure differences cause this.\
\
Electrical changes in the air cause another phenomenon: the creation of
*ozone* in the air. Ozone is O3 and is created through electrical
discharge in the atmosphere. It also has a very pungent odor, and can be
smelled at a very low concentration in the air. So electrical changes in
the air can produce ozone that you can smell.\
\
Sometimes, not only will barometric pressure, electrical charge and
ozone concentration change, but moisture content (humidity) will also
change before a storm. You can feel and smell that difference as
well.]{.rendered_qtext}
