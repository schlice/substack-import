**Content:** [The decades worth of psychological studies of rapes have
found them not motivated by sex at all. They are motivated by the
rapist\'s desire for power and control. They want to totally dominate
and control someone so fully that they can take the most precious and
closely guarded act (the sex act) and control that too. It\'s a need for
control, and to control whether or not someone has sex is complete and
total dominance.\
\
EDIT: I wouldn\'t use Wikipedia as my definitive source for decades
worth of psychological studies. Maybe I should write my own Wikipedia
page and then you can quote me as authoritatively as you do other Wiki
authors.\
\
The truth is that studies don\'t lie, and decades worth of studies have
shown and re-proven that rape is motivated by control and lust, but lust
for power, not sex.]{.rendered_qtext}
