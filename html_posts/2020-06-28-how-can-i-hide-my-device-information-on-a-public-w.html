**How can I hide my device information on a public WiFi?**

I'm going to assume by "device information" you mean your hardware specs
and your MAC address.

In most standard Android and iOS builds, you can't change your hardware
identifiers, and you can't spoof your MAC address. Under normal
circumstances, you must "jailbreak" or "root" your device and install
special software that allows you to "tweak" these values so that the
network sees them differently.

As for hiding your actual data traffic, use a VPN. VPN software is built
in to most devices these days, and Samsung actually has a VPN service
that it offers for a monthly subscription. It automatically engages when
you are on a public unsecured Wi-Fi.
