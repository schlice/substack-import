**Is providing content for defamation illegal?**

In general, providing content that is later used to defame someone is
not illegal.

There are some certain circumstances in which the content provider could
also be held responsible for defamation. Primarily, if the content
provider is providing content *knowingly*, that it's going to be used in
a defaming manner, then the content provider could also be held
responsible for defamation, and could become a party directly in a
defamation action.

Beyond that, it could be argued that merely providing non-confidential
unprotected information is a First Amendment protected act.
