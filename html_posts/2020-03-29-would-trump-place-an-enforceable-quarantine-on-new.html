**Would Trump place an enforceable quarantine on New York simply because
he doesn\'t want them to flee to Florida?**

The more important question: ***why should he have to?***

New York did not go as far as California, which issued a
shelter-in-place order. New York simply said stay inside as much as
possible, but they're not preventing people from traveling. They didn't
close the airports to non-essential travel. New York's rules are
targeted at businesses, gatherings, and people over 70. Other than that,
the governor told people to stay inside as much as possible.

Since New York is a "hotbed" of disease, or a "focal point" for
outbreak, they become a target for review. If New York is not doing
enough to curb non-essential travel, then the Federal government may be
forced to step in.
