Yes.

There are no requirements to run for president. There are requirements
to hold the office of the President, but not being under investigation
is not one of them.

Remember, in the US, you are innocent until proven guilty. And being
*accused* of a crime is not the same as being charged with a crime or
being indicted for a crime.
