**Regarding indictment of POTUS, is it possible for SCOTUS to rule that
it\'s possible to indict a sitting President AND that the statute of
limitations is tolled for the length of the presidency, so long as the
DOJ waives its right to indict?**

No, these are not both simultaneously possible.

If SCOTUS rules that it is possible to indict a sitting president, then
the statute of limitations cannot be tolled, because the president can
be indicted.

If SCOTUS rules that it is **not** possible to indict a sitting
president, then the statute of limitations *will be* tolled, since
indictment is not possible.

A SCOTUS decision would not be made based on implied or promised conduct
by the Department of Justice, which works for the President. A SCOTUS
decision is made based on interpretation of the Constitution. SCOTUS
would only rule on whether or not you can indict a sitting president.
And they would only do so if the President is indicted, and his
attorneys appeal the decision on the grounds that you cannot
Constitutionally indict the President.
