**Are there laws against indecent skywriting?**

While there isn't a specific law about skywriting, this would most
likely be covered under any indecent display law.

Additionally, since it's virtually certain that a child will see the
skywriting, the offender can also be hit with a "contributing to the
delinquency of a minor" charge as well.
