It depends on what about "Christianity" you "hate." Personally, I don't
like "Christian sects."

I get that the Christian sects are not all that attractive. It just
smacks of division within the house of God. Seventh-Day Adventists don't
believe like Methodists. Catholics don't believe like Episcopalians. But
somehow, we all believe in Jesus and the central message of the Bible?
Makes no sense to me.

There's a lot to dislike about modern-day Christian churches.

I would suggest you search for a **non-denominational Bible-based church
in your area** and take a Sunday to go visit. I bet you'll find that all
the unpleasantness you found in "Christianity" is gone.
