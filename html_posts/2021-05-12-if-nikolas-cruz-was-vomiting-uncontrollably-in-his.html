I am a Christian, so my viewpoint is informed by my religion. And
Christians have that silly little bracelet:

***What would Jesus do?***

We can easily look to the Bible to see what Jesus did in this case.

It wasn't Nikolas Cruz, but it was someone equally hated in society:
**tax collectors**. Everyone hated them. They often took way more taxes
than they had to, and kept the rest for themselves. They were spiteful,
hateful little people who had the backing of the government to do their
dirty work. But so long as the government got paid, they didn't really
care.

Zacchaeus was a tax collector, universally hated amongst the local
people, but he really didn't care. He was also a short man. Here's what
happened:

> Jesus entered Jericho and was passing through. A man was there by the
> name of Zacchaeus; he was a chief tax collector and was wealthy. He
> wanted to see who Jesus was, but being a short man he could not,
> because of the crowd. So he ran ahead and climbed a sycamore-fig tree
> to see him, since Jesus was coming that way. When Jesus reached the
> spot, he looked up and said to him, \"Zacchaeus, come down
> immediately. I must stay at your house today.\" So he came down at
> once and welcomed him gladly. All the people saw this and began to
> mutter, \"He has gone to be the guest of a \`sinner.\'"
>
> But Zacchaeus stood up and said to the Lord, \"Look, Lord! Here and
> now I give half of my possessions to the poor, and if I have cheated
> anybody out of anything, I will pay back four times the amount.\"
>
> Jesus said to him, \"Today salvation has come to this house, because
> this man, too, is a son of Abraham. For the Son of Man came to seek
> and to save what was lost.\" --- Luke 19:1--10 NIV

Jesus shows us what to do. We show kindness and compassion for those who
are sinners. It is not up to us to judge them; that's God's job. It is
our job to *love them*.

> "You have heard that it was said, 'Love your neighbor and hate your
> enemy.' But I tell you, love your enemies and pray for those who
> persecute you, that you may be children of your Father in heaven. He
> causes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the
> righteous and the unrighteous. If you love those who love you, what
> reward will you get? Are not even the tax collectors doing that? And
> if you greet only your own people, what are you doing more than
> others? Do not even pagans do that? Be perfect, therefore, as your
> heavenly Father is perfect. Matthew 5:43--48 NIV

Love your enemies. Pray for those who persecute you. It is what we are
commanded to do. Let God handle the judgments and the punishments.

And if I may, let me caution you the same way Jesus did:

> Jesus went to the Mount of Olives.
>
> At dawn he appeared again in the temple courts, where all the people
> gathered around him, and he sat down to teach them. The teachers of
> the law and the Pharisees brought in a woman caught in adultery. They
> made her stand before the group and said to Jesus, "Teacher, this
> woman was caught in the act of adultery. In the Law Moses commanded us
> to stone such women. Now what do you say?" They were using this
> question as a trap, in order to have a basis for accusing him.
>
> But Jesus bent down and started to write on the ground with his
> finger. When they kept on questioning him, he straightened up and said
> to them, "Let any one of you who is without sin be the first to throw
> a stone at her." Again he stooped down and wrote on the ground.
>
> At this, those who heard began to go away one at a time, the older
> ones first, until only Jesus was left, with the woman still standing
> there. Jesus straightened up and asked her, "Woman, where are they?
> Has no one condemned you?"
>
> "No one, sir," she said.
>
> "Then neither do I condemn you," Jesus declared. "Go now and leave
> your life of sin." --- John 8:1--11 NIV

What a powerful admonition! Let the one among you who is without sin
cast the first stone.

In other words, if you're going to judge others, you had better be
perfect. And in case you were unaware, none of us are sinless. None of
us are perfect. We are all sinners and have all fallen short of God's
grace. But he gives it to us anyway, and that's the beauty of
Christianity: **even while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.**

Don't judge others; that's God's job. Love others. Let God do the
judging.
