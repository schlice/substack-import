I re-read this which I also read (and commented) when you posted it
previously. I also read the conversation you had with
[[BP](https://www.quora.com/profile/BP-397)]{.qlink_container} regarding
hiring practices at jails, and my first thought was, "Sheesh, I'm glad
that our CJC (Criminal Justice Center) uses real deputies, not 'cop
wannabes that couldn't make the cut with the PD\[...\].'"

But then I thought, *but wait just a sec, your first assignment out of
the Sheriff's Academy, even before patrol, is CJC. Granted, it's not the
blind leading the blind, as there are many very good, well-qualified
deputies who run the show over there, but are we making the same
mistakes as some others do, but in a different form, by putting rookie
deputies in the jail?* I like to think that we're not because they are
supervised by some very good senior deputies, and my experience has been
nothing but stellar in there (as I previously detailed in my other
comment), but I can't help but wonder if we are setting ourselves up for
failure with this practice.

Re-reading this made me re-think my previous position. I'm going to do a
little research on this. Thanks for planting that seed again. Hopefully
this helps someone else who might be able to influence practices at a
jail do something a little bit better in the future.
