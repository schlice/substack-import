I don't think you have to worry yourself over making sure that scandal
insurance can never be offered, because I can't think of a scenario in
which it *could* be feasibly offered.

The insurance agency would essentially have to be an Adjustment Bureau,
essentially re-writing historical events such that what actually
happened didn't happen. And as you likely know, once something gets
posted to the Internet, it's *nearly impossible* to get rid of it.

So what would the terms be? You can do anything, and we will make it go
away? Sounds like science fiction to me.

I don't think you should worry yourself over this.
