**Is there a time limit after completing the questionnaire that you will
not be called for jury duty?**

Every jurisdiction is different. It is completely up to the jurisdiction
how they run their juror system.

Here in El Paso County (Colorado), we have a **one day, one trial**
system. If you are called for duty and you report, if you're not
selected to sit on a jury, you're done. Your obligation for the year is
over. If you are selected to sit on a jury, you will only sit on one
jury for that year. In this way, it's very clear how much time you'll
spend in the juror room.

On your day, we will often see all of the juries empaneled by about
10:30 am. If you haven't been called by then, you will normally be
released, and your service is over.

But that's just El Paso County. As I said, every county is different.

I suggest you contact the County Clerk's office for the county in which
you live and ask them these questions.
