**Why hasn't the 25th amendment not been applied in the removal of an
obviously incompetent incoherent and pathological liar?**

Becuase the 25th Amendment is only to be used when the President is
*incapable* of carrying out his duties.

It is not to be used when you don't like how the President does his job,
or if he does his job *badly*, or even if he does his job *illegally*.
That's what *impeachment* is for. Or, he finishes his term, and you
don't re-elect him.
