**If you accidentally scratched someone's car while parking, but no one
saw you do it, how big would the scratch have to be for you to leave a
note for the car's owner?**

*(US-only answer)*

There are many answers here, and most of them are wrong.

If you scratch someone's car with your car, that's an auto accident.
Doesn't matter if there's a dent, or a ding, or anything else. If there
was vehicle-to-vehicle contact and there is visible damage, an accident
has legally occurred. Even scratching the finish on the car constitutes
"visible damage." Interestingly, if your cars come in contact but there
is no damage, an accident has *not* occurred.

If you leave the scene *without leaving a note*, it's not only an auto
accident, but now it's a hit and run, or in more formal terms, *leaving
the scene of an accident*. This is a moving violation, and not only will
your insurance have to pay the damages, but if you commit a hit and run,
**your insurance rates will go up, guaranteed.** How much depends on how
much the damages cost to fix, but it will be *significant*.

Not only that, but it's likely that you were seen by someone or
something, somewhere. If not a person, potentially a security camera. If
you leave, and the police have to track you down, not only will you get
the moving violation, you'll get points on your license (which also
raises your insurance rates, and can cause you to lose work related to
driving), and it's likely that the *other guy's insurance* will also
come after you for costs associated with investigations. You could risk
running, but it's not a winning bet, and if you were seen, it will be
*far more costly than staying.*

So, what do you do?

1.  **Stay**. You have been involved in an accident, regardless of how
    small the damages are. As I said above, an automobile accident is
    legally classified as vehicle-to-vehicle contact which results in
    *any* visible damage. If you stay, it's literally no big deal. Your
    insurance will pay the damage to the car you scratched (your
    property damage liability coverage), and your car will be covered by
    your own collision insurance (after your deductible). As long as you
    haven't scratched many vehicles recently (and as long as you weren't
    ticketed for the accident), your rates will most likely not go up.
2.  **Look for witnesses**. Either take their contact information, or
    video record their statement along with a view of their
    identification.
3.  If the owner does not show up, or you can't locate the owner after
    "reasonable attempts" to do so, **leave a note**. Many states
    *require* that you leave a note in a "conspicuous place" if you
    cannot locate the owner. Under the wiper blade is the most common
    location. You must leave a note with your name, your address, a
    contact phone number, and an explanation of the accident (so that
    the victim can't claim that you crushed his car when you only
    scratched the paint). In some states, you are required to leave your
    insurance policy number if you know it, and your insurance carrier.
    Don't say anything else in your note, because any content you write
    in the note can be used against you in legal proceedings when the
    insurance companies are settling up the charges. And writing your
    note with a felt-tip marker so that it might "accidentally" smear
    out in the rain? I wouldn't. That's classified as not leaving a note
    at all, and in the states that require it, you could be fined for
    not doing so. Use a ball-point pen or a pencil.
4.  Also, to combat potential insurance fraud, **take pictures.** Ensure
    you capture the vehicle's license plate, as well as the damage to
    the car. Also, *take a picture of your note* before you stick it
    under the wiper. Again, this can help you combat insurance fraud.
5.  Finally, **call your insurance company.** Report the scratch. This
    will help to speed the claim process along, and they can help you
    with any other legal requirements you may have in your state
    regarding what to do.
