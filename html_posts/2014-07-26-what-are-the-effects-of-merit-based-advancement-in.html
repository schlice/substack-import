<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [On the positive side, the people who are promoted are the<br>ones who have earned it.\<br>\<br>On the negative side, implementing such a system would be problematic at<br>best, and next to impossible at worst. Every specialty in the military<br>requires a different type of person. Not all persons who perform all<br>specialties can be so easily \"tested\" to progress on in their ranks.\<br>\<br>That\'s why, in the US military, we use a combination of performance<br>reviews, time in grade, and successful completion of required training<br>(whatever that may be) to determine whether or not someone can advance<br>to the next higher grade. Switching to a completely merit-based<br>advancement system would not be a benefit to the<br>military.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
