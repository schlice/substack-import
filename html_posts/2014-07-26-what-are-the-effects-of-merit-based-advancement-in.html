**Content:** [On the positive side, the people who are promoted are the
ones who have **earned** it.\
\
On the negative side, implementing such a system would be problematic at
best, and next to impossible at worst. Every specialty in the military
requires a different type of person. Not all persons who perform all
specialties can be so easily \"tested\" to progress on in their ranks.\
\
That\'s why, in the US military, we use a combination of performance
reviews, time in grade, and successful completion of required training
(whatever that may be) to determine whether or not someone can advance
to the next higher grade. Switching to a completely merit-based
advancement system would not be a benefit to the
military.]{.rendered_qtext}
