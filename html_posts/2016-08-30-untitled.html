I can generally deconstruct the Young Earth theory using the Scopes
trial.

The Bible says that the earth was formed on the first, second, and third
days, but the Bible also says the sun was set in the sky on the fourth
day. Couldn't it be that those first three days lasted longer than 24
hours? There was no sun, no way to measure the day from the night, and
there is no indication how long the day and the night lasted. So
couldn't that first three days have taken 4 billion years? I personally
don't see why not.
