What "police" allow is up to their supervisors and chiefs of police and
mayors.

The other undeniable fact: ***policing is political***. Just look at the
decrease in assertive policing in New York City since the uptick in
resistance by groups like Black Lives Matter. Once a powerful political
bloc has denied the legitimacy of a specific policing technique, you
will see less of it. This is understandable, and if we're honest, is how
things should work.

Depending on the current political climate then, you will either see
more or less disruption of panhandlers by police. If the current
political climate was like the climate in NYC in 2012, they were
"cleaning up Times Square" and rousting the panhandlers and prostitutes,
cracking down on unwanted windshield cleaning, D&Ds, etc. (This, by the
way, goes back to "broken windows theory" of policing adopted by
Commissioner William Bratton, which led to "Compstat," the most
successful government program ever).

Since the mood has somewhat shifted, everyone from the Mayor on down has
softened on assertive policing (as is happening nationwide). As a
result, we are seeing now the first sustained spike in violent crime in
over two decades.

Eventually, people will get tired of seeing the increased crime and will
demand more loudly than the protesters, and things will swing back the
other way again.
