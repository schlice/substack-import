**Content:** [Spammers are all about volume. Clickthrough from their ad
campaigns is very very low. Clickthrough is the term which describes
when a user clicks on a link in a spam message.\
\
Since clickthrough is so low, they rely on volume. Even that one spam
message that makes it on to social media might generate a clickthrough,
even though they get kicked off of that site quickly. For that one spam
account, they have 50 more doing the same thing, and not all of them are
identified quite as quickly.]{.rendered_qtext}
