**Can you get military disability for COPD because of smoking?**

The Veterans Administration provides ongoing disability coverage and
health coverage for service connected disabilities. The VA must
therefore determine that the condition was caused by, or aggravated by,
military service. Service connection is determined in several ways:

- DIRECT -- Service medical records show that the disabling condition
  was diagnosed during military service and the condition has continued
  to affect the veteran.
- AGGRAVATION -- Evidence demonstrates that the disabling condition
  which existed prior to service was aggravated beyond normal
  progression during military service.
- PRESUMPTIVE -- Evidence demonstrates that the disability is one
  predetermined by the VA to be presumed for service connection by time,
  place and type of service.
- SECONDARY -- Evidence demonstrates that the disability developed as a
  result of, or residual of, another service connected disability.
- INJURY AS A RESULT OF VA MEDICAL TREATMENT -- This is a disability
  that the veteran incurred, had aggravated or died from because of
  medical treatment at a VA Facility.

It is unlikely that COPD from smoking will be considered a
service-connected disability, but only the VA can make that
determination. Your best option is to visit a VSO (Veterans Service
Office) near you in order to get help.
