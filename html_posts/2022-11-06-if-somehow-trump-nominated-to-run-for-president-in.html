It depends on if it's a Primary election, or the General election.

If it's a **Primary**, I'm going to be looking for someone "Trump-like."
That means I'm going to be looking for someone who has similar ideas to
Trump on how to repair the economy, and how to grow jobs, and how to
enact sensible limits on abortion nationwide, and how to reduce the
burden of unconstitutional laws on our right to keep and bear arms,
while still prosecuting criminals to the fullest extent of the laws we
do have. Hopefully, someone like that runs, and they'll get my vote. But
I'll be looking for someone without all the "baggage" of Trump. Trump's
biggest problem is Trump. He is his own worst enemy. His inarticulate
speech gets him into trouble. His brashness tends to overshadow the good
work that he tries to do. So in a Primary, I'm looking for someone who
is "Trump-like," but probably not Trump.

If it's a **General** and the party has seen fit to nominate Trump, I'm
voting for Trump. Better Trump than *any* Democrat. Every plank in the
Democrat party platform is evil. Every. One. Not a single one of them
does what they claim it will do, and they actually have proven that they
have ulterior motives which are actually evil. So if it's Trump or a
Democrat, it's Trump.

This is not really that difficult to understand.
