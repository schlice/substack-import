Short answer: no.

Longer answer: Lead has been phased out of most aircraft fuels. Some
aviation fuels still contain lead, as no suitable substitute has been
found to replace it yet.

Aircraft engines have to be designed to run on specific fuel types.
While commercial jet engines have been modified to run on "JET A," which
is basically a kerosene-like fuel which does not contain lead,
piston-based engines still use "avgas" which does contain low lead.

Lead levels in the atmosphere have been falling since leaded gas was
prohibited for cars. It was almost completely phased out by 1986. The
highest concentrations of airborne lead are now found in the areas
around airports where avgas is used.

of the health effects of repeated exposure to lead include damage to the
central nervous system, kidneys and red blood cells, and decreased
function in the cardiovascular and immune systems. Lower IQ levels and
learning disabilities can also result from lead exposure, especially in
children, whose young bodies are more sensitive than those of adults.
And scientists at the National Toxicology Program have concluded that
lead and lead compounds are 'reasonably anticipated to be human
carcinogens.'"[\[1\]](#dhEOW){#cite-dhEOW .citation_link}

So while lead is most definitely a carcinogen and harmful to health,
lead exposure is not directly linked to antisocial or criminal behavior.

The most likely cause of the decrease in crime rates through the 90s was
the newly-developed practice of policing which actually began with the
NYPD in 1994. The bosses there got around the then-radical idea that
police could actually stop crime before it started instead of merely
responding to crime. They analyzed crime statistics on a daily (and
later, hourly) basis, assigning officers to known hot-spots to prevent
crimes from taking place. As these efforts started paying off, they
spread nationwide. No other government program has had the levels of
success that data-driven policing has had.

Over the last two years, however, movements like Black Lives Matter have
caused officers to back off of data-driven policing. Sure, they still
respond to 911 calls where a victim has been identified, but the number
of discretionary traffic stops and preventative policing calls has
sharply fallen. And in its wake is the first sustained spike in violent
crime the United States has seen in 20 years. The "Ferguson Effect," as
it has been coined, has seen murders rise nearly 17 percent in the
nation's 15 largest cities last year alone, and cities with large black
populations have seen crime rise the most.[\[2\]](#WmhWJ){#cite-WmhWJ

So is aviation fuel responsible for more violent crime? Not likely. The
Ferguson Effect is a far more likely cause.
