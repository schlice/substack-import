**Should it be legal for a homeowner\'s association to require that
residents be Christian?**

The US Fair Housing Act prohibits housing discrimination on the basis of
race, color, religion, sex, national origin, disability, or familial
status. These housing protections apply to discrimination in the sale or
rental of housing, and also apply to the \"terms and conditions\" of the
sale or rental of housing.

The question is: *should it not be illegal?*

I can't see a valid reason to do so. Because opening the door to allow
small communities to discriminate based on religion opens the door to
*other communities* to also discriminate based on religion, and also
opens the door to *individuals* to harass their neighbors based on their
religion. Some cases which sound like harassment cases are actually Fair
Housing Act cases, so it's not true that all cases like this will be
tried as pure harassment cases.
