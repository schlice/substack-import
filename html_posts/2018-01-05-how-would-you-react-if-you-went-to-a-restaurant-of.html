**How would you react if you went to a restaurant of a nationality
different from yours and after you\'ve sat down, the manager says to you
\"sorry, but we do not wish to serve you in our restaurant.\"?**

1.  I would leave.
2.  I would write a ***scathing*** review on Yelp. One of those "I'd
    give it 0 stars if I could" reviews.
3.  I'd call my local news agency's "Call For Action" line and give them
    the scoop of the week.
