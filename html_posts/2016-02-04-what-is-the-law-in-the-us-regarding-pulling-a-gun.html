You will be arrested and charged with **brandishing a weapon**. If you
pointed the weapon at the person, you would have committed the civil
crime of **assault**. You could also be charged with **assault with a
deadly weapon** depending on the state. In order to draw your weapon,
you have to be in ***fear for your life***. You can\'t just \"feel
threatened\" because someone is \"bigger than you\" or \"louder than
you\" or \"generally intimidating.\" Even if they are harassing you, you
still can\'t draw your gun.

You can **only** meet force with equal force. You have to be in fear for
your life before you can draw your gun. And even then, if you\'re the
only person armed, expect that you will get **FAR** more attention than
your aggressor.

Your assertion that you were \"threatened\" could potentially be used as
a defense against the aforementioned charges, but the finding that you
were in fear for your life would be a point of fact for the jury to
decide. If they don\'t find you in fear for your life, then it\'s you
who was the actual aggressor.
