I can answer this from the perspective of someone who went through that
situation, and I turned out...well, we probably shouldn't use me as an
example here...

Anyway, what does it mean to "honor" your father and mother? Does this
mean you must love them? Does this mean you must always have a
relationship with them? Does this mean you have to like them? Does this
mean you always have to be best friends? In other words, *how* do you
honor your father and your mother?

Before you can answer, you have to understand what it took to get you to
the point at which you can even ask the question about what it means to
"honor" your parents. Despite their current level of abusiveness, they
still had to work hard to raise you. They likely had to make personal
sacrifices (giving up things they wanted to do, giving up things they
wanted to buy, etc) in order to provide for you.

In other words, despite how they treat you *now*, they did actually have
to care about you in order to *raise* you\*. ***THIS*** is what you
should honor. Honor the fact that they sacrificed to get you to where
you are today. Honor their commitment to raising you. Thank them for
providing a house where you could live (such that it may be) and food to
eat (also, such that it may be). That act alone takes personal
commitment and sacrifice, and it is this commitment and sacrifice that
you "honor." You do not have to appreciate how you are being treated.
You do not have to respect *how* they treat you (if you're under 18, you
still have to respect the fact that they are your parents and you still
have to listen to them, though). And you absolutely do not have to
respect them as people for their treatment. Respect is *earned*, not
*given*. They do not automatically command respect just because they are
your parents.

You can respect them as *parents* without respecting them as *people*.

Hopefully you can see the difference.

\*The truth is, they probably still do care about you, even though they
don't quite know how to express it.
