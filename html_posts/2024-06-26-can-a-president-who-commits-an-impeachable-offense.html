Yes, but probably not until after that president leaves office.

I say "probably" because it has never been tested before, and the
Constitution doesn't speak about it. The Department of Justice's Office
of Legal Council (OLC) published a memorandum in 1973 amidst the
Watergate scandal saying that it is unconstitutional to prosecute a
sitting president. Its arguments include that the president \"is the
symbolic head of the Nation. To wound him by a criminal proceeding is to
hamstring the operation of the whole governmental apparatus in both
foreign and domestic affairs.\" It says that the statute of limitations
should not be tolled while the president is in office, but suggests that
Congress could extend the statute of limitations specifically for
presidents.[\[1\]](#HqQTf){#cite-HqQTf .citation_link}

After *Clinton v. Jones* was decided, saying that presidential immunity
does not apply to crimes which are alleged to have occurred before the
president took office, the OLC once again issued a memorandum in 2000.
They said that it was still improper to prosecute a sitting president
due to the adverse affect it might have on his ability to govern.

These memorandums do not have the force of law. They merely govern how
the Department of Justice will operate.

So even if a president commits an impeachable offense which could also
be criminally charged, but is not removed from office, it is unlikely
that criminal charges will be filed while the president remains in
office.

(EDIT) Dateline, July 1, 2024: The Supreme Court has decided in *Trump
v. United States* that a president enjoys ***absolute immunity*** from
criminal prosecution for any **official act** performed while the
subject is president. It is the responsibility of the Court to determine
what acts are "official acts" and what acts are "unofficial acts."

The President enjoys **absolute immunity** when those acts relate to the
core powers granted to them by the Constitution -- for example, the
power to issue pardons, veto legislation, recognize ambassadors, and
make appointments. The President enjoys **presumptive immunity** when
the act is not "manifestly or palpably beyond \[the president's\]
authority." The President has **no immunity** when the act is determined
to be an "unofficial act."

Clearly, the Court said, determining what acts are "official" and what
acts are "unofficial" "...can be difficult," said Chief Justice John
Roberts. He emphasized that the immunity that the court recognizes takes
a broad view of what constitutes a president's "official
responsibilities," "covering actions so long as they are not manifestly
or palpably beyond his authority." In conducting the official/unofficial
inquiry, Roberts added, courts cannot consider the president's motives,
nor can they designate an act as unofficial simply because it allegedly
violates the law.
