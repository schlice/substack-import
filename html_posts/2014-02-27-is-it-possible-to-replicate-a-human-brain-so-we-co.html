There<br>are so many sub-problems that go along with them, that it\'s possible,<br>but it\'s very far away. Before a computer is considered to be<br>\"artificially intelligent,\" it has to be able to do a number of<br>things, and do them as well as, or better than, humans. A short list of<br>these things (from [[Artificial<br>intelligence](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=a33ead&url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container} on Wikipedia):\<br>\<br>Deduction, reasoning, problem solving\<br>Knowledge representation\<br>Planning\<br>Learning\<br>Natural language processing\<br>Motion and manipulation\<br>Perception\<br>Social intelligence\<br>Creativity\<br>\<br>These are all very complex and multi-faceted areas of study that will<br>require a machine to accomplish all of them together in order to be<br>considered \"generally intelligent.\"]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
