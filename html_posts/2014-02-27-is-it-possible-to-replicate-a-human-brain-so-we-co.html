**Content:** [This is the \"golden egg,\" the magic endpoint that
everyone who works in the field of artificial intelligence is after: a
\"brain\" that is infinitely adaptable and infinitely learning. There
are so many sub-problems that go along with them, that it\'s possible,
but it\'s very far away. Before a computer is considered to be
\"artificially intelligent,\" it has to be able to do a number of
things, and do them as well as, or better than, humans. A short list of
these things (from [[Artificial

\
Deduction, reasoning, problem solving\
Knowledge representation\
Planning\
Learning\
Natural language processing\
Motion and manipulation\

Social intelligence\
Creativity\
