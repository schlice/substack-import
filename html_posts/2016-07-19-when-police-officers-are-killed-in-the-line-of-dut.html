It's going to be a very low percentage of time. There are some police
duty assignments (usually in plain clothes) that do not require
ballistic vests be worn at all, but for most uniformed officers,
department policy requires ballistic vests be worn at all times while in
uniform.

Standard ballistic vests for normal duty wear are not designed to stop
rifle rounds, since the officers are required to wear them all day,
underneath their uniform shirts. It would be extremely uncomfortable and
obtrusive to wear metal plating as body armor all day, and it presents
that "intimidating" look that the President so dislikes. They therefore
wear Level IIIa ballistic vests, which is a soft body armor with
included trauma plates, usually rated to stop bullets up to .44 caliber
(.44 Mag) in size. Level IIIa ballistic vests will stop nearly all
handgun bullets. They won't stop rifle rounds.

When police go into tactical situations where they know they will face
gunfire, they wear Level III body armor. This is much bulkier, and is
worn over top of shirts and uniforms. It looks more like traditional
body armor, and is rated to stop rifle rounds up to 7.62 mm (.308 cal)
traveling up to 2780 ft/sec.

So officers who were killed in the line of duty:

- were hit in their ballistic vests using a caliber higher than what the
  vest is rated for (i.e. Dallas)
- were posted in an assignment not requiring a ballistic vest
- were hit in an area not protected by the vest and they succumbed to
  their injuries
