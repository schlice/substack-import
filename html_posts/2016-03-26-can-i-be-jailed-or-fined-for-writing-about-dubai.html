It depends on where you are writing. If you are writing in the United
States, as long as what you say is true (and you can defend it in a
court if you are sued for libel), you can write whatever you want.

You can\'t be \"jailed or fined\" in the United States for writing an
article. You can be sued for libel, which is an allegation that your
writing is a known falsehood that causes actual harm.

Beyond that, no, in the US, you cannot be jailed or fined for writing
something.
