title: "Why are the innocent victims of guns not being helped by smart lawyers? Lawyers should be parading researchers, gun control organisations, politicians and presidents in court as witnesses to testify on the power of guns to make people commit crimes?"

Because despite all of the entities you mentioned, *the statistics
simply do not support the notion that guns make people commit crime.*

And the most telling examples are "all the other first-world or advanced
economies around the world" which have little to no guns in public
hands.

***They all still have crime***.

And for those first-world/advanced economies *which have transitioned
away from general public ownership of firearms,* the statistics show
that the change induced negligible impact to overall crime rates. In
Australia, for example, their big gun buyback (which only removed about
1/3 of the guns from public hands) had virtually no impact on the
(already downward trending) rates of homicide.

Innocent victims of violence using a gun do not change the fact that
crime rates are not positively correlated to gun ownership. Those
innocent victims of violence can be more helpful in making the case that
**politicians at the state level need to get tougher on crime.** Gun
crimes need to attach mandatory sentences, and DAs should be forced to
charge gun crimes when guns are involved, and they should not be able to
plead gun crimes away.

But at the state level, *exactly the opposite* has been happening, and
California has been leading the charge. California has been converting
more high-level misdemeanors to low-level misdemeanors (so they can't
even detain for those crimes any longer). They have also eliminated cash
bail, meaning that an offender can walk free with no accountability,
increasing the chance that they will not return for their appointed
court dates. New York and Illinois are not far behind.

And don't forget, those states have some of the highest rates of gun
crimes out there, despite having some of the toughest laws on the books.

Guns don't make people commit crime any more than forks make people fat
and paint and brushes make people artists. *People commit crimes*. Guns
have no magical powers to induce people to commit crimes.

If your idea is that guns somehow entice people to "punch above their
weight," so to speak, then you might want to take a closer look at
"liquid courage," otherwise known as *alcohol*. Alcohol is the largest
external factor in domestic violence, and yet guns are not even the
number one or number two weapon used in those cases (first is knives and
second is fist/feet). Controlling alcohol is a much more productive way
to reduce crime. Plus, alcohol has no positive effects whatsoever, while
guns *prevent orders of magnitude more crimes than they cause.*

But you probably won't do that because you like alcohol and you don't
like guns.
