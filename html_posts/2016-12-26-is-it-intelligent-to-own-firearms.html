Actually, it is not only the most intelligent thing you can do, it is
the most civilized of actions you can undertake in a free society.

Interactions between people in a civilized society can happen in one of
two ways: reason or force. You can either use reason and oration to
convince me to exercise my free will and do what you want willingly, or
you can overpower me with force and compel me to do what you want
unwillingly.

The gun is the great equalizer. The gun is the only tool available which
sets the 105 pound octogenarian on equal footing with the 230 pound
assailant, the lone female on equal footing with her armed male
aggressor, or the homosexual on equal footing with the truckload of
drunken homophobes. Without the gun, we accept domination and control by
the strong, the armed, or the many. The gun removes these advantages and
sets everyone in society on equal footing. The advert from the mid 1800s
for Colt Arms said it best: "God made man, Sam Colt made them equal."

When carrying a gun, I force you to use reason, removing force as an
option for our interaction. In a utopian society, there is no force;
only reason is used to compel one person to do another person's bidding.
Carrying a gun forces you to interact with me in the way closest to what
a utopian society would provide.

Therefore, carrying a gun is the most civilized thing you can do in a
free society.
