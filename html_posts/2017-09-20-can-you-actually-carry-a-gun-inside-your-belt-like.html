*Can* you carry a gun like that? Sure you can. All you have to do is
stick it there, and you can carry it. It may not be lawful in your
jurisdiction to carry a firearm in this manner, but not every
jurisdiction has carry laws dictating how you must carry a firearm.

*Should* you do this? **Absolutely not**.

Modern firearms are designed to only discharge when the trigger is
pulled. Therefore, to prevent accidental discharge, you must protect the
trigger while the firearm is being carried.

***This means you have to carry that firearm in a holster.*** This is
the only way to safely carry a loaded firearm, if it's not in your hand
under positive control.

If you fail to do this, you risk accidental discharge. Here's just a few
stories of recent self-inflicted gunshot wounds caused by improper carry
of a firearm:

There are various scenarios here, but the root cause of all of these
accidental shootings is improper carry of a firearm.

The moral of the story: never believe anything you see on television,
Don't tuck a firearm into your waistband, ever. Always carry a firearm
in a holster. If you want to tuck the firearm inside your waistband, you
need an "inside-the-waistband" holster (otherwise known as an IWB
holster). Don't be lazy and stick it in a pocket or just shove it in
your pants. It's not like cell phones which went from waistband holsters
to pockets because it's cool. It's definitely not cool.
