**Am I right to blame the bad things that have happened to me on God?**

I dunno, let's see what you could actually be blaming God for, and
whether or not those arguments make sense.

I suppose you could make the argument that **since God created the
universe, he also created the conditions that allowed the bad things to
happen to you, so you could rightly blame God for creating a universe
which contains bad things.**

But what is good without bad? In order for something to be "good," it
needs to be better than something else, which you would objectively
quantify as "bad." It's really hard to have "good" when there is nothing
against which to compare it. Without bad, you don't have good.

Remember, God created a universe which allows you to exercise *free
will*. For example, how can you have real love without the possibility
of having evil? If God created love without evil, then you have no
choice in love. God knows that in a world where free will exists, there
will be evil. But that's also where you get real love. Real love
involves an active choice of love over evil. The same calculus is taken
when people ask the question, "why doesn't God just come down from
Heaven on a big cloud and make himself visible to everyone?" Well,
besides the fact that he already has done this in the person of Jesus,
if he were to make himself simply visible to everyone such that none
could deny his existence, anyone who did not follow him would simply be
stupid. I mean, *he's right there*. This, too, would virtually eliminate
free will. God wants you to *choose* to follow him, and in order to
*choose*, you have to have a choice between following him, or not.
Having him announce with neon signs his presence would eliminate not
following him as a viable choice, thus denying free will. Don't forget
the story of the disciple Thomas, who after the resurrection refused to
believe that Jesus was alive until he actually put his fingers through
the nail holes in his hands and put his hand into Jesus' side where the
centurion's sword pierced him. I know, a little morbid, but Thomas
required proof, just like those who believe that God should also remove
free will and get rid of anything bad in the world. Jesus obliged Thomas
(who did believe after he saw), but then he said, "blessed are those who
have not seen, and have believed." (John 20:29)

You could also blame God for **not preventing the bad things that happen
to you.** I mean, he is all powerful, right? Why didn't he walk along in
front of you with his great cosmic broom, sweeping away all of the bad
things that could possibly happen to you?

I answer that question with another question: *where in the world did
you get the idea that this is what God is supposed to do?* The Bible
doesn't say that Christians are guaranteed a carefree life. In fact, it
tells us exactly the opposite. "In this world, you will have trouble.
But take heart! I have overcome the world." (John 16:33)

While we don't have a handle on God's plan for us, or how our lives fit
God's plan for the world, we can rest assured that God keeps his
promises. The Bible is full of examples of God making promises and
fulfilling all of them. God has also promised us that if we love him and
follow him, he will raise us up on the last day and we will be with him
for all eternity. We have no reason to doubt that he will keep that
promise, either. He sent his son to die for our sins so that we have the
means to achieve that end. *That* is commitment to keeping your
promises, if you ask me.

So are you *right* to blame God for the bad things in your life? If you
are "blaming" God by saying that he created a universe which has bad in
it, go right ahead, blame him for that. That was his choice. The fact
that evil exists means that he gave you choices as well. If you're
blaming God for not *preventing* bad things from happening to you, I'd
say that's wrong. There is no basis for the belief that God would
prevent bad things from happening to you, so blaming him for not doing
something that no one ever said he would do just seems a little silly to
me.
