**Content:** [The problem is what happens to you at the point in time at
which you are frozen. Your metabolic functions cease, so a doctor could
legally declare you dead. Therefore, the cryo company would be complicit
in unlawfully ending your life, with forethought, but without malice.
This would be Murder 2 in most jurisdctions in the United States.\
\
As I understand it, the whole cryo idea assumes that at the point you
are \"thawed,\" science will be able to fix not only your incurable
disease, but also fix the damage caused by the freezing process (cell
walls burst as the plasma within them freezes and expands). They will
then be able to bring you back to life, perhaps in a new body, because
the old one will most surely be damaged beyond repair by the freezing
process.\
\
So what they do is get your body as soon as is humanly possible after
you die to provide you with the best chance of having some form of
viable tissue after you are thawed.\
\
Therefore, this scheme would only work in states in which assisted
suicide is legal, such as Washington, California, Oregon, or Vermont (as
of October, 2015). A doctor at the cryo facility would have to give you
the button which initiates the freezing process. He would then be giving
you the tools to take your own life.\
\
Currently, to the best of my knowledge, none of the assisted suicide
laws cover cryogenics. Additionally, I know that the law in some states
(such as Vermont) require that you have an incurable disease and less
than 6 months to live as diagnosed separately by at least two
doctors.]{.rendered_qtext}
