What Goodwill does with your donations does not determine whether or not
donations are tax-deductible.

If Goodwill is an approved organization for accepting charitable
donations (and as of today, they are), then if you itemize your
deductions, you can deduct what you donate to Goodwill.

See [[IRS Publication 526, Charitable
Contributions](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=b3794d&url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p526.pdf){.external_link

should get a receipt from Goodwill, which you should retain for your
records if you itemize your deductions.
