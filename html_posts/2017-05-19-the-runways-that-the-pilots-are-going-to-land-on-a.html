There is no such thing as instrument take-offs. If you can't see the
runway to take off, the airport is "socked in" and is inoperable. There
is a minimum visible distance which must exist around the airport in
order to take off or land there.

Runways are indeed assigned before takeoff, and ground control directs
you to your assigned runway in the same way your GPS directs you to get
somewhere (turn left on taxiway BB and taxi to runway 34R).
