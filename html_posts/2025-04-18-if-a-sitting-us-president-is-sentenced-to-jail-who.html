Before a President can be charged for a federal crime (let alone
sentenced), he has to be removed from office. Prosecuting a sitting
President is just a bad idea; it takes too much attention away from the
performance of his Constitutional duties.

So first, the President must be impeached (through Articles of
Impeachment passed by the House) and then tried in the Senate and "found
guilty" (even though it's not a legal process) and the Senate must vote
to remove him from office, at which point the Vice President becomes
President, and the President is no longer president.

Once that happens, a Federal prosecutor can file charges against the
former President, and with the cooperation of his Secret Service detail
(which he still has), he will be arrested, he will appear for
arraignment, and will likely be ROR (released on his own recognizance)
since his whereabouts are known 24/7, and he has a Secret Service
detail, which is now doing double duty protecting him and keeping tabs
on his location.

He will go to trial, and if he is convicted and sentenced to jail time,
he will be taken immediately from the courtroom and will be sent to a
Federal penitentiary to serve out his sentence. The ones where high
ranking government officials and celebrities are taken are actually more
lenient than most other prisons. They are colloquially called "Club
Fed," a play on [[Club

While they're certainly not vacation hotspots, they are a little nicer
and a little less strict than prisons for violent felons.
