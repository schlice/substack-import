I\'d like to recommend a movie to you. It\'s called \"Pleasure
Unwoven.\" It\'s available on Amazon, and there are abridged video clips
of the DVD on YouTube.

The problem is not the drug. The problem is the *addiction.* You have a
disease, and it is a real disease. It is a failure of the biofeedback
system that runs the pleasure center of the brain. The fact that you
don\'t want to stop is evidence of the disease action.

You are not a bad person. You are a *sick* person (in the disease
sense). You need help. I would strongly recommend you seek treatment.

If you won\'t, or can\'t, go to a treatment center, I would suggest
finding an NA meeting in your area. Check their website to find a
meeting near you:

[[Narcotics

rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="na.org"}]{.qlink_container}

The only way you\'re going to get out from under the drug is if you
choose to change yourself.
