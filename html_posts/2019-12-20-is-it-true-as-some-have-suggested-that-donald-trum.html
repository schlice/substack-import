**Is it true, as some have suggested, that President Trump is ineligible
for any future presidential pardons because he has now been impeached?**

A Presidential pardon affects a Federal criminal conviction.

Article II, section 2 of the Constitution says that presidents "shall
have Power to grant Reprieves and Pardons for Offences against the
United States, except in Cases of Impeachment."

This means pardons don't apply to impeachment. Since impeachment is a
political process, pardons don't apply to impeachment. The president
cannot pardon any other elected official who has been impeached, and he
can't pardon himself and nullify the impeachment.

He can, however, be pardoned by a future president if he is convicted of
a Federal crime. The fact that he has been impeached does not preclude
him being pardoned by another president in the future.
