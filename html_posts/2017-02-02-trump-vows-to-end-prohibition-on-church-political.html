First of all, Trump can't do this unilaterally. He can press Congress to
repeal the Johnson Amendment, which is something he may actually do.

Repealing the Johnson Amendment is a good thing, because it is utterly
unconstitutional.

Pastors have preached about political issues since the founding of the
country. Sermons were delivered opposing Thomas Jefferson because he was
a Deist. Sermons denounced William Howard Taft because he was a
Unitarian. Churches have led many of the significant social and
governmental changes in this country (segregation and civil rights come
to mind) until 1954, when the Johnson Amendment to the US tax code was
passed. The amendment states that non-profit tax exempt entities cannot
"participate in, or intervene in (including the publishing or
distributing of statements), any political campaign on behalf of or in
opposition to any candidate for public office." In essence, the IRS gets
to determine when a pastor's speech has become too "political," and that
church could lose its tax-exempt status.

This amendment should be repealed because it unconstitutional.

1.  It violates the Establishment Clause because it allows the
    government to determine when truly religious speech becomes
    "political." The government has no business making such
    determinations.
2.  It violates the Free Speech clause because it forces the government
    to discriminate against speech based only on the content of the
    speech. Some speech is allowed, and some speech is not. The Supreme
    Court has ruled against this type of discrimination of speech for
    many years.
3.  Additionally, it violates the Free Speech clause because it makes
    tax exemption a condition of speaking the "correct" words. So long
    as you use the "correct" speech, you can have a tax exemption.
4.  It is also well known that certain parts of Scripture would be seen
    as "political." This means that a church cannot preach the full
    Scripture for fear of losing their tax exemption, which is also a
    violation of the Free Exercise clause, because the government
    "substantially burdens" a church's exercise of religion without a
    compelling reason to do so.

Whether or not you think a church has such far-reaching power that
talking to its constituents could influence an election, the Johnson
Amendment should be repealed because it unconstitutionally restricts
churches from preaching their full beliefs.
