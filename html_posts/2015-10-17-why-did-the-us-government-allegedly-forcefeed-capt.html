**Content:** [Under the Geneva Convention, which we are holding to as
far as treatment of prisoners (even though the combatants do not fall
under the legally recognized criteria for inclusion), say that prisoners
of war must be provided full medical care while they are prisoners.\
\
Widespread hunger strikes have taken place at Gitmo, and when the chief
medical examiner determines that the body has fallen below healthy body
mass, he can order force feeding through a nasal tube. Many of the
prisoners accepted the force feeding, while others needed to be sedated
and/or restrained as they would induce vomiting to attempt to remove the
forced nutrition.\
\
Doctors cannot, in good conscience, \"let them die.\" We don\'t allow
anyone else in the world to starve themselves to the point of death; we
intervene and provide them with mental health counseling. However, when
counseling fails, and the person still refuses to eat, doctors can
intervene.\
\
Some have called force-feeding \"torture,\" alleging that the military
made the process unnecessarily painful and humiliating, a charge which
the United States vigorously denies. The US believes that failing to
intervene when a person becomes dangerously malnourished is torture, and
we may have to forcefully intervene to save that life.]{.rendered_qtext}
