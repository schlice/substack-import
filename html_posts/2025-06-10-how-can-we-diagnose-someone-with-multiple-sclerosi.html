There is absolutely no way to diagnose someone with MS without them
knowing. The good news: if you are experiencing symptoms you can't
diagnose, you'll be happy to do the testing to find out what it is.

MS is a diagnosis of *exclusion*, because there is no one marker or sign
which conclusively indicates MS. For example, if you have numbness in
your extremities, you need to exclude all other causes of numbness (like
peripheral neuropathy) before that numbness could be added to the body
of evidence indicating MS. If you have Optic Neuritis (ON), you need to
exclude all other potential causes of ON before you can conclude that
the ON could be a sign of MS.

Once you've done that, your neurologist will take a detailed history and
perform a full neurological exam. It's not going to be easy to explain
away a full neuro exam.

Once you've done *that*, you'll be sent for an MRI (which is also really
hard to do on someone without them knowing). If the areas of
demyelination which are hallmark markers of MS are seen, you *still*
need to rule out all of the known diseases, conditions, or history which
can cause little white spots on a MRI (a blood panel colloquially known
as the *little white spot panel*).

And even following all of that, you *still* may need to be sent for
other tests if the previous were inconclusive, and those are a bit
more...intrusive (i.e. lumbar puncture \[spinal tap\], visual evoked
potential test, etc).

When ***everything else which causes these signs and symptoms*** is
ruled out, then you and your neurologist can consider a diagnosis of MS.

**TL;DR:** A diagnosis of MS is not as simple as a blood test. The
involvement of the patient is 100% required.
