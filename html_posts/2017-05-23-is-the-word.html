Huh, nobody touched the "artillery gun" section?

You mean a cannon or a Howitzer?

Actually...wait for it...the Second Amendment doesn't ban those,
historically citizens have owned weapons of mass destruction, and if you
want, you can own one today.

***WHAT????????***

Yep, it's true. If you want a Howitzer or a cannon, you can own one. The
Constitution does not forbid it.

However, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives
(formerly and still colloquially known as the ATF) may have something to
say about that. See, they've put a whole slew of *regulations* on what
kinds of guns you can own and what you have to do in order to own one of
those guns.

The cannon, surprisingly, is ***not*** one of them. Muzzle-loading
cannons are *not* considered firearms in the US and are therefore not
regulated by the 1934 National Firearms Act (NFA). The ***shells***,
however, are regulated by the ATF. Cannon shells are classed as
destructive devices in the U.S. under the NFA. They must be registered
with the ATF and, though legal under federal law, are prohibited from
being owned by civilians in certain states.

Howitzers are *breech-loading* cannons, and are subject to much heavier
state restrictions. The shells are similarly regulated between the
cannon and the Howitzer. At a Federal level, the Howitzer is classified
as a destructive device under the NFA, so it would require a Federal
Firearms License, at a minimum, to own one, along with the tax stamp.
However, as I understand it, most states restrict breech-loading cannons
from citizen ownership. There are a few states where you can own a
firing Howitzer, but only a few.

As an aside, if either weapon were demilled (i.e. rendered inoperable),
it would be free to own without regulation.
