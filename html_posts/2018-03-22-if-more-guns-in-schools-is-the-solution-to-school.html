**If more guns in schools is the solution to school shootings, why
didn\'t the armed officer at the school in MD deter the shooter or even
stop him? The shooter knew there was an armed office there and he still
brought in a gun and shot two people.**

I know this is higher-level thinking, but perhaps the security guard was
not charged with "checking everyone's bags for weapons."

This case illustrates one piece of "defense in depth." The armed officer
turned this incident from another mass shooting into a single crazy guy
in a school who injured two people and then died. The difference? The
armed officer. The armed officer ended this situation.

But it sounds like you're asking why this was a situation at all.

Because the rest of the defense in depth strategy was not implemented.

- How many entrances were there that students could enter the school
  unchecked?
- Where were the magnetometers (metal detectors)?
- Where were the X-ray machines to check bags for weapons?
- Has a security plan been developed?
- Has the school practiced lockdown drills? (note: most have by now)
- Has the school practiced active shooter drills with the local police?

We can effectively keep guns out of courthouses, government buildings,
and airports. It's therefore easy and well known how to keep guns out of
schools. If "stopping school shootings" is a priority, then this is how
you do it.

So clearly, they implemented one piece (the armed guard) but they were
not interested in completely stopping school shootings, or they didn't
have the money yet for the magnetometer and the X-ray machine. There's a
piece of legislation moving through Congress that will provide money to
schools to increase security. Hopefully, schools will implement some of
this security.
