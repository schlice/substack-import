**What\'s the worst that can happen if I run for president at 31 years
old? Can I challenge the constitution?**

Perhaps you're unaware of what "run for president" means.

While it does involve a lot of public announcements that you're running
for president, in order to "officially" enter the race, you have to
register as a candidate with the Federal Election Commission.

When the FEC denies your registration because you don't meet the basic
Constitutional requirements, you can sue them claiming that the 35 year
age limit is unconstitutional (even though it's in the Constitution, but
I digress).

It will probably take years before your case fully makes it through the
court system, and by the time it's all said and done, you'll probably be
35 anyway, so you won't have standing any more.

Or you can just work on your personal brand for the next four years and
by the time you're 35, you'll be ready to roll.
