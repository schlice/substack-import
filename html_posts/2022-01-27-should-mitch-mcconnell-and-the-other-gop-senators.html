Their votes don't actually matter in the grand scheme of things, so
ultimately they are going to vote in the way the largest majority of
their support base wants them to vote.

Democrats have enough votes to push any nominee through with 0% of
Republicans voting in favor, so it doesn't matter how they vote.

Regardless, you're replacing a solid-left Breyer vote with another
solid-left Biden nominee, so it's a push at the Court level. Hardly
worth spending political capital over.
