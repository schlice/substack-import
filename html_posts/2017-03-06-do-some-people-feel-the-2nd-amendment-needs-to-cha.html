Some people do feel this way. However, the logic does not follow their
reasoning. Their reasoning is based on ***emotion***, not ***logic.***
Put simply, they are wrong.

Looking at the situation logically produces a different set of results.
At the time of the founding, there were indeed repeating rifles. There
were breechloading rifles. They were not vastly underpowered as compared
to modern-day rifles. Granted, modern technology and manufacturing
processes have made the firearm more accurate, easier to maintain, and
easier to use, but "more lethal?" I can't see that modern firearms are
"more lethal" because they are more accurate or easier to maintain. More
accurate rifles still require a decent shooter to put the round on
target. Rifles at the time of the founding also required a decent
shooter to operate the rifle. Not much different than today. Rifles then
and now still go boom, and the recipient becomes just as dead. They
aren't "deader" today than they were at the time of the founding. The
founders absolutely could have imagined more accurate rifles, or higher
capacity repeating rifles, because they already had that technology, so
envisioning improvements to that technology would not have been unheard
of.

As for some people who feel that the 2nd Amendment should change because
technology has changed, what other amendments should we change because
technology has changed? Perhaps the 1st Amendment? While firearms may
have improved but are basically the same technology that was available
at the nation's founding, the tools we use for speech have *vastly*
changed, and the Founders had no way of knowing we'd have anything like
radio, television, computers, or the Internet. Instant dissemination of
information was **witchcraft** back then. The Founders *never* could
have reasonably assumed we'd have such means of communication when they
wrote the 1st Amendment.

If any amendment needs to change because technology has changed, it's
the 1st Amendment, not the 2nd.
