**Can the US Congress override Trump\'s National Emergency to fund the
Border Wall?**

The National Emergencies Act requires a joint resolution of Congress to
terminate a national emergency declared by the President. The resolution
can be vetoed by the President, and that veto can be overridden by a 2/3
majority in both houses.
