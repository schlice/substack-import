Thanks for your question.

In order to attend one of the service academies, there are a few things
you have to do.

**Admission and Acceptance**. Like any university, you have to be
admitted. That means you have to meet the university's admissions
requirements. Of course, because this is a military academy and not a
purely academic university, the standards for admission go above and
beyond pure academics.

The general quantitative selection criteria (with an emphasis on USAFA)
includes the following:

- Academics. About 50% of your overall selection score in determining
  whether or not you can be accepted is based on your academic
  performance. Generally, applicants need to rank in the top 40% of
  their class to be eligible, but reviews of recent admissions to the
  academy found that most candidates rank in the top 3% of their
  respective classes. Your academic score consists of your SAT or ACT
  score combined with your Prior Academic Record (PAR).
- Athletics. A little over 95% of candidates who were accepted into the
  Air Force Academy played on some team sport in high school. About 80%
  of those earned a varsity letter in that sport. As you can tell from
  those numbers, athletics are very important. You will take a Candidate
  Fitness Test to determine your ability to complete the training.
- Extracurricular Activities. The academies are always looking to see
  your activities, both athletic and non-athletic, that you do outside
  the classroom. This includes activities in your school, in your
  community, and if you work, in your job.

Your packet also meets a Selection Panel, which will do a *qualitative*
review. This review addresses all of the "intangible" things which may
be present in a candidate's record.

Your combined score from the Weighted Composite (academic and
extracurricular scores) and the Selection Panel score forms your
Selection Composite, a single score which will allow you to be ranked
against all of the other candidates competing for admissions into the
Academy.

**Nomination**. What makes the Service Academies unique in admission
requirements is that, in order to be accepted, you must be nominated.
Nominations are granted by Congress, or by the Vice President.

Each Member of Congress (and the Vice President) can have up to five
cadets in any service academy at any one time. Those spots free up as a
cadet graduates or leaves the academy. Each nominator can nominate up to
ten candidates to fill any one open slot that they have. Each nominating
authority has its own process for seeking a nomination, but it generally
mirrors the Academy process, requiring a combination of academics,
athletics, and community service. Some nominating source selection
processes involve interviews, or board records reviews.

The President also has nominations, but these are reserved for children
of career military personnel. The President has 100 appointments per
year that can be made.

Children of deceased or 100% disabled military veterans also receive
automatic nominations, but they are limited to 65 cadets in the academy
at any one time.

There are a few other categories of military nominations which can also
be made.

By far, the largest number of nominations comes from Congress.

**Admissions Process:** As you can see, the process to be nominated and
accepted into a service academy is not easy. It takes perseverance and
commitment throughout your high school career to even be eligible to
attend one of these schools. It should be difficult; nothing worthwhile
is ever easy, or everyone would do it. Service academy graduates join an
elite group of people who are among the best and brightest leaders our
nation has ever produced.

Specifically for the Air Force Academy, [[a

which will walk you through the entire admissions and nomination
process. In addition, we have Admissions Liaison Officers (ALOs)
nationwide who will guide you through the admissions process and help to
make sure your admissions process is smooth and that you don't miss any
important steps or deadlines.

If you have specific questions regarding admissions into a service
academy, please ask, and good luck!
