They think this because *atheism is a religion,* and because a real
moderator does not agree or disagree with a debate participant; they do
not inject themselves into the debate.

Since the second part of that answer is self-explanatory, let me address
why being an atheist, all else being equal, is just as bad as being a
Christian, for a moderator.

When you say that atheism is a religion, the atheists start jumping
around, foaming at the mouth, and contending that there is no way that
atheism is a religion, because it specifically believes that there is no
god. But that rules out pantheistic religions like Buddhism and Jainism.
Unfortunately for the atheist, most nuanced definitions of religion
include atheism. But to understand this, we must first define what a
religion is. I think this definition probably fits the best:

> "A religion is a system of symbols which acts to establish powerful,
> pervasive and long-lasting moods in men by formulating conceptions of
> a general order of existence and clothing those conceptions with such
> an aura of factuality that the moods and motivations seem uniquely
> realistic." --- Clifford Geertz

While many have difficulty with the phrase "a system of symbols," the
rest of the definition is clear. Religion is a way of thinking that
helps people make sense of the world and becomes so embedded in them
that it makes other ways of thinking look foreign.

This definition of religion not only includes traditional religions, but
it also fits atheism perfectly. Atheism has "conceptions of a general
order of existence," and those generally consist of natural laws as
identified by science. Just like some of the basic tenets in other
religions, most atheists do not question these basic underlying
assumptions. They cannot bring themselves to question either natural
laws or the idea that life is based solely on natural laws, even when
those natural laws have been shown to be flawed and imperfect, and
unable to create the life we have today. When confronted with these
facts, atheists will do the same mental gymnastics to justify their
beliefs that they accuse Christians of doing when confronted with an
unpleasant Bible verse.

Atheism also fits the second part of the definition, too. They *so
deeply* believe that random chance caused life to form and that
macroevolution is fact, that their belief is "uniquely realistic." They
often say that believing in god is like believing in fairy tales, but
their belief in the power of natural laws creating irreducibly complex
physiological systems is the only rational belief one can have.

TL;DR: You are biased because atheism is as much of a religion as
Christianity, and an atheist moderator, all else being equal, is no
better than a Christian moderator.
