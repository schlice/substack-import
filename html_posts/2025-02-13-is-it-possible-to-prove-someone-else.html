Before you can answer that question, you must answer the question about
how we discover truth.

Buckle up, this is going to be a long one, but it is ***absolutely
necessary*** to learn why, in the vast majority of cases, you can't
***PROVE*** with 100% certainty that someone's opinion is true or false.

Skip down to the next section if you don't want to learn about the why's
behind the answer.

\

The process of discovering truth begins with what we call "First
Principles." They are "first" because there is nothing behind them. They
are self-evident because they are inherent in the nature of reality. You
don't "learn" First Principles, you just *know them*. Everyone
intuitively knows them, even if they haven't thought about them.

Two of these principles are the Law of Noncontradiction and the Law of
the Excluded Middle. The Law of Noncontradiction says that a statement
and its negation cannot both be true at the same time and in the same
sense. In simpler terms, something cannot be both A and Not-A
simultaneously. So if I say, "This is a cat," then I cannot say of the
same creature "This is **not** a cat."

The Law of the Excluded Middle tells us that something either *is* or
*is not,* and those are the only two possibilites for any one given
thing. So for example, a coin can be *either heads or tails*. There is
no middle position where a coin is not either heads or tails on any one
coin flip. It is either heads or tails. There is no third option. So I
can say "I am either wearing a blue jacket or I am not wearing a blue
jacket." There is no third option.

Those First Principles are the tools we use to help us discover truth.
But those principles alone cannot tell us whether or not a proposition
is true. Let's take a look at an example:

- All men are mortal.
- I am a man.
- Therefore, I am mortal.

The self-evident laws of logic tell us that the conclusion, *I am
mortal*, is a valid conclusion. It draws naturally from the premises.
This process is called **deduction**: lining up premises to come up with
a conclusion. But in order to provide a *valid* conclusion, deduction
relies on the fact that the individual premises are true. Therefore,
***IF*** all men are mortal and ***IF*** I am a man, then the conclusion
that I am mortal must be true. But the logic doesn't tell us whether or
not all men are mortal or whether or not I am a man. Logic by itself
can't tell us one way or the other. Let's use a valid argument that
isn't true to illustrate the point.

- All men are four-legged reptiles.
- I am a man.
- Therefore, I am a four-legged reptile.

In this case, the logic is correct; the conclusion draws naturally from
the premises, but the output is false because the premises themselves
are not true, because they do not correspond to reality.

So logic only gets us so far. Logic can tell us whether or not an
argument is true or false, but it can't tell us if the individual
premises are true. So how do we know that the premises are true?

We observe the specifics about the world around us, and we draw general
conclusions from those observations. When you observe something
repeatedly, you might conclude that some general principle about that
observation is true. This method of drawing general conclusions from
specific observations is what we call ***induction***.

Most of what we know, we know through induction. In fact, you probably
used induction to conclude that the first premise in the incorrect logic
above wasn't true, because every man you've ever observed has been a
two-legged mammal, not a four-legged reptile. You also used induction to
know that the first logic postulate was true, because every man you know
of who has ever existed has died, so you know they are all mortal. Those
two conclusions (the mammal and the mortal) are inductive conclusions.

Most importantly, ***what we learn through induction can never be 100%
certain.*** It can only be *highly probable.* For example, are you
absolutely, 100% sure that all men are mortal? No, because you haven't
seen all men die. Maybe someone in the past didn't die, or maybe someone
in the future may not die.

So if information we learn through induction is never 100% certain, can
we trust it? Yes, but to varying degrees of certainty. Since no human
being possesses infinite knowledge, most of our inductive conclusions
can be wrong¹. But even when we don't have complete or perfect
information, we can still be *certain enough* about most questions in
life to make reasonably certain conclusions. Since virtually everyone
has been observed to die, when we conclude that all men are mortal, we
can consider that conclusion true *beyond a reasonable doubt*. It's 99+%
certain, but not beyond *all* doubt. It does take a small amount of
faith to believe it (though not much).

\

If you followed along in the last section, good! Establishing the
background for the answer is extremely important. If you already know
all of that stuff, then that's good too! You have a great foundation in
logic and discernment of truth.

So now that we have the fundamentals out of the way, let's answer the
question. **Is it possible to prove someone else's opinion as true or
false?**

The answer is *it depends*. Is their opinion about something we can
observe and test? This is the basis of the scientific method. So if
their opinion is, "I believe that water at sea level can boil at 90
degrees F," we can observe and test that opinion. And in the vast
majority of cases, we would say that this opinion would be false beyond
a reasonable doubt². We still can't **prove** that the opinion is 100%
false, but it would be false beyond a reasonable doubt because it is
testable and observable.

If their opinion is about something which would be covered by a *perfect
induction*, then we can say with 100% certainty that it is true or
false. For example, if I held a baseball bat and I said, "I believe that
this baseball bat is made of Swiss cheese," we could dissect that
baseball bat from top to bottom and discern that it is made out of 100%
wood. In that case, we could **prove** that the opinion is 100% false,
but we can only do that in the case of the *perfect induction*, where
all the particulars are known.

But let's say that the person holds the opinion, "I believe that God
exists." If God exists, then He is *necessarily* immaterial, so our
normal tools of testing, observation and induction cannot be used to
test that opinion. So in that case, we would **not** be able to
**prove** that such an opinion was either true or false³.

\

¹ with the exception of the *perfect induction*, where we know all of
the particulars. For example, I could say "all of the letters on this
page of this book are black," and I could be 100% certain about that
because I can observe and verify that all letters on that page of that
book are indeed black.

² It's not *impossible;* at sea level, for water to boil at 90 degrees
Fahrenheit, a pressure of approximately 10.2 in Hg (or approximately
10.2 psi) would be required. Average air pressure at sea level is around
29.92 in Hg. So that would be an *incredibly* low air pressure; not
impossible, but highly unlikely.

³ We can use other tools, such as the tools in philosophy, to *point to*
whether such an opinion might be true, or even plausible. We still
cannot **prove with 100% certainty** that God exists, but we can at
least say that such an opinion might be **plausible**.
