**Do cameras at red lights really save lives or is that just a ruse and
a cover statement for the cities to be able to make money?**

Red light cameras do not save lives. Responsible drivers save lives.

The goal is to get people to stop running red lights. The way to do
that, cities reason, is to monitor the intersection 100% of the time.
Since we can't do that with people, we do it with technology. If there
is an intersection where red light runners are a problem, we install
cameras to try to stop people from running red lights. If we can get
people to change their behaviors, we might save lives.

Is this a flawed theory? Possibly.

answered that studies have shown that red light cameras do not increase
safety. This was from an anecdotal study in the 90's where drivers were
asked about red light cameras at intersections. They said that the
cameras increased their anxiety, causing them to speed up to get through
the light, or slam on their brakes to avoid a ticket. This was construed
to mean that safety in intersections was either unchanged, or made
worse, by the presence of the cameras. This prompted many cities to shut
off their cameras.

The IIHS (the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety) did its own study.

So do red light cameras really save lives? Apparently, it's still up for
debate.

Kurt was absolutely right about making money, though. In many cities,
the cameras cost nearly as much as the revenue made from them. The
programs are barely self-sustaining. They're certainly not the cash cow
that some people make them out to be.
