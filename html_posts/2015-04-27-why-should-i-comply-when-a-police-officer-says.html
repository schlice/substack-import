**Content:** [The law requires that you comply with the lawful
directives of a peace officer. There isn\'t one single jurisdiction I
know of that doesn\'t have a law which requires you to comply with the
lawful directives of the peace officers in that jurisdiction.\
\
So why should you comply? Because it\'s against the law to not comply.
That\'s the simplest reason. If you fail to comply, you can be charged
with a crime and you can go to jail. I think that\'s a pretty simple and
direct reason right there, and it alone should be reason enough.\
\
If you should need more reasons, here are some other reasons why it\'s
in your best interest to comply:\

1.  Officers would order you to the ground because there is an ongoing
    situation in which the officer determines he needs to place you in
    *the position of disadvantage.* In order to neutralize a perceived
    threat (and it only needs to be his perception of a threat, not
    yours), he can order you to move to a position in which you are no
    longer a threat. This can both eliminate you as a threat, and make
    obvious those who are still a threat (i.e. the ones still standing).
    So if you want to remain the focus of the officer\'s undivided
    attention, remain standing when you are told to get down.
2.  How quickly you comply determines your *level of compliance* in the
    eyes of the officer. I can guarantee you that for most peace
    officers, you will be treated with the same level of respect and
    compliance you show the officer. There are always exceptions, but
    for the vast majority of peace officers out there, you will be
    treated with the same level of respect that you show. Understand
    that these situations are volatile and require the highest level of
    compliance to ensure everyone\'s safety.
3.  If you have issues with the way an officer conducts himself/herself
    during an incident, you have many legal remedies to deal with that.
    NOT ONE of those remedies takes place at the scene. Your best rule
    of thumb: do what you are told to do and then report the officer\'s
    behavior later on.\

I just read an article in a police magazine (online) which posted a
video of an officer who hesitated when he was confronted with a
life-and-death situation. This officer could have been the most recent
death in an officer-involved shooting. In this particular situation, the
mentally-unstable individual suddenly and inexplicably became compliant
and was safely taken into custody. Would the officer have been
completely within his rights to shoot the suspect? Absolutely. Would the
officer have faced the numerous questions about whether or not he should
have? Most likely. Did the most recent uptick in scrutiny of
officer-involved shootings play into his decision to not shoot? We
don\'t know the answer to that. Will this indecision because of
increased scrutiny cost an officer his life in the future? Probably. And
that trend is worrying.\
\
This is why officers ***need*** your complete, immediate compliance with
their directives. ***It will save lives, and NOT just yours!***
