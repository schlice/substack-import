**If we have freedom of speech in the U.S., why is bullying illegal?**

**Bullying is a** ***behavior*, not a set of words.**

It's not illegal to speak the words, but if the words create a bullying
act, it may be illegal.

In California, bullying *behavior* has been made to violate education
laws. Sections 234.2 and 48900 of the Education Code were amended to add
*bullying acts.* The words themselves are protected, and the government
has not prohibited you from speaking the words. But if the words create
a *bullying act*, you have fallen afoul of the law. In just the same way
that you can say whatever you want about a person, but if it's a lie and
it harms them, you have *slandered* that person, and that's illegal.

Bullying is not illegal at the Federal level, but bullying behavior may
cross the line into *harassment*, which is a *behavior* which is illegal
at the Federal level.
