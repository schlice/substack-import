**How can I get a photo ID when the state of Oregon says I need to get a
new birth certificate from the state that I was born in, but the state I
was born in will not give me a copy without a photo ID?**

It does seem like a Catch-22, doesn't it? But at least one of these
should be able to happen: you should be able to get a new birth
certificate without a photo ID, or you should be able to get a photo ID
without a birth certificate.

You must check with each agency involved to see what the process is if
you don't have the one document or the other.

In my opinion, I would start with the birth certificate. Most states
have procedures for obtaining a birth certificate without a photo ID. It
does sometimes happen that vital documents are destroyed simultaneously
(think house fire). There must be a way to get a copy without a photo
ID. For example, some states allow you to submit a sworn notarized
statement in lieu of a photo ID. Some states allow your parents (who are
listed on your birth certificate) to submit a notarized letter and a
copy of their photo ID in lieu of your own.

But if your state absolutely will not give you a copy of your birth
certificate without a photo ID, then work on part 2: getting a
replacement photo ID without a birth certificate. Every state is
different when it comes to this, but just as in the case of vital
documents, there must be a procedure which permits you to get a
duplicate photo ID if you don't have a birth certificate. Usually you
can provide supporting information, like your checking account (your
checks show your name and address), a credit card statement, your water
or electric bill, or other locally-recognized documents which show who
you are. Some states even allow you to request a new photo ID online.
