In most states, when a landlord wants to access your apartment, he has
to have a reason. For example, Florida law lists a few reasons why a
landlord may want to access your apartment:

- in case of emergency, such as a fire or serious water leak
- to make needed inspections and repairs
- pursuant to a court order
- if the landlord has reasonable cause to believe the tenant has
  abandoned the premises
- when reasonably necessary during a tenant\'s extended absence, defined
  as one-half the time for periodic rental payments, given that that the
  tenant did not notify the landlord of the absence, or
- to show the property to prospective new tenants, purchasers or
  contractors.

If the landlord doesn't tell you why he needs access to your apartment,
you could rightly think that he could be not only violating the law
(accessing your apartment for a reason not permitted by law), which
would be considered trespassing, but violating your privacy and causing
you emotional distress. You would hate to misinterpret what he's doing
and begin legal action for the invasion of privacy and trespassing,
right? So he really ought to tell you why he's there.

Your lease should specify how much time your landlord must give you
before he accesses your apartment, and he can request that you not be
inside. But he treads on very thin ice (with warm boots) by doing this.
You have the right to have cameras in your apartment; put some small
cameras up and watch what he's doing.

If the landlord violates these terms in the lease, you should notify him
in writing of the violation of law, or the violation of the lease, if
he's not complying with the access requirements in the lease. The "big
stick" you have in your corner is that if the landlord is violating the
lease, you have the right to terminate the lease if he doesn't come into
compliance within seven days of the letter.
