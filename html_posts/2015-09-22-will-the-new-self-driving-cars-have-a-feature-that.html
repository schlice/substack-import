**Content:** [Autonomous vehicles still have to have a licensed driver
behind the wheel to take over in the event of system failure or other
unforseen circumstance. This licensed driver will take control of the
system and pull the car over. The car will not have a
self-stopping-for-police feature; it will be up to the driver to take
over for the car and stop it.\
\
Clearly, there will be fewer speeding violations with self-driving cars,
but vehicles can be stopped for any number of reasons. Self-driving cars
can still have tail lights out, or expired registration, or tint darker
than the legal limit in that jurisdiction.]{.rendered_qtext}
