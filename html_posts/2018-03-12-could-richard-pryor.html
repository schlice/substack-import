**Could Richard Pryor\'s long time substance abuse have contributed to
his multiple sclerosis diagnosis in 1986?**

The short answer is "we don't know."

Could my smoking in my early 20s have contributed to my own MS diagnosis
in 2005? We don't know.

We do know that there are factors which we can point to that do
contribute to making a person more or less likely to develop MS: sex,
ethnicity, geography of childhood, family history, and exposure to an
as-of-yet unidentified infectious trigger.

However, drug abuse (or smoking) has not been identified as having a
clear correlation to development of MS.
