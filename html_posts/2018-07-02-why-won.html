**Why doesn\'t Donald Trump have to show his taxes?**

Let's ask the opposite question of you:

*Why would Donald Trump have to show his taxes?* Is there a law which
would require him to do so? And if your answer includes something along
the lines of, "Well, every other politician who runs for office shows
their taxes, why can't he?"

The answer to that is: ***Politicians who release their taxes structure
them in such a way as to be presentable to the public.***

Politicians know that their taxes will eventually see the light of day,
despite there being no law which requires their release. However,
knowing that their taxes *will* become public, politicians work with tax
attorneys and CPAs to structure their finances *so that they look
acceptable on a 1040.*

Trump, being a political outsider, has *years* of taxes which don't look
good on a 1040. Nothing illegal (even though that would be within the
purview of the IRS to address), but certainly not things that look good.
What doesn't look good? Deductions the size of the GDP of many small
countries. Taking advantage of tax credits that the candidate may rail
against, but were necessary for the proper functioning of his business.
Other payments and credits that the candidate may not necessarily be
interested in explaining. In short, if one is not a career politician
performing this little tax dance for many years, structuring their
finances in such a way that their 1040s look squeaky clean, *releasing
taxes does not benefit you at all.*
