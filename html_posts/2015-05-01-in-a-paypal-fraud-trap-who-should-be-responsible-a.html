**Content:** [There is nothing you can do to stop this type of fraud,
except find a better way to verify who your clients are, if you are
\"C\" transacting C2C business. If you do business, you risk doing
business with a fraudster.\
\
PayPal should not be demanding the money back from you, because you
provided a legal, legitimate service to B. The loss is PayPal\'s, not
yours. It\'s not your responsibility to pay for PayPal\'s lack of fraud
prevention. The onus is on PayPal to correct the fraud situation and
stop B from transacting.]{.rendered_qtext}
