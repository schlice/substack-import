People would be testing their drinking water for foreign substances.

A Constitutional amendment is, *de facto*, Constitutional. A
Constitutional amendment cannot be unconstitutional.

A Constitutional amendment can be *repealed* by another Constitutional
amendment, but that doesn't make the original amendment
unconstitutional. It only makes it repealed. It still exists, but it has
no force.
