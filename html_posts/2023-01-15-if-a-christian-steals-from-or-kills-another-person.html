Let's make sure we are speaking as Christians, since you asked this
question in the Christians and Christianity Space, and you asked if a
Christian steals or kills and repents (and is thus forgiven) how is that
justice for the person sinned against?

First, let's just say that the Christian *sinned*, which includes any
and all sins, including stealing and killing.

Next, let's clarify that *the person sinned against is God.* It is God's
commands which are broken. The sin is against God, not against the
victim.

The sinner repents of his sin to God, and God, who is rich in **mercy**,
covers the transgression with the blood of Christ. Christ's death and
resurrection take the penalty for sin. The sin still happened, but
Christ's shed blood covers the sin.

So does the *victim* get justice? That depends on what the victim is
looking for when it comes to justice. The victim may get **legal**
justice, and that is entirely appropriate, as we all live in this
fallen, secular world. But should the victim expect *justice* for the
*sin*? Since the sin itself was committed against God, justice is not
due to the victim. The victim may therefore seek *retribution* or
*vengeance*, but those should not be confused for *justice*, as is
common in today's world. And those are also not due to the victim
either.

> Do not take revenge, my dear friends, but leave room for God's wrath,
> for it is written: "It is mine to avenge; I will repay," says the
> Lord. --- Romans 12:19 NIV

So how does God demand the victim respond? **Mercy!** The same mercy
that He shows to the sinner!

> "You have heard that it was said, 'An eye for an eye, a tooth for a
> tooth.' But I say to you, do not resist an evil person; but whoever
> slaps you on your right cheek, turn the other to him also.

> "If anyone wants to sue you and take your shirt, let him have your

God demands justice for sin against Him. Rest assured, because God is
just, someone will pay for the sin. For the Christian who repents,
however, that someone is Jesus. And that blessing is available to
everyone who repents and believes.

Look at it this way. What the sinner does to me is a reflection of him,
not of me. What I do in response to him is a reflection of me, not of
him. As a Christian who has been sinned against, how you respond is just
as important as the justice God demands of the sinner.
