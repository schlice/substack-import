The First Amendment says, as you said, \"Congress shall make no law
respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free
exercise thereof.\" This means the government cannot establish a state
religion, nor can it prevent you from practicing whatever religion you
choose. The First Amendment does **not** say that once you apply a
uniform to your body, you can no longer practice a religion.

The problem we run into is the unwritten \"separation of church and
state\" that has become so popular over the last 60 years. The First
Amendment simply says that the government can\'t endorse a religion,
which means that the government itself can\'t write a law endorsing a
religion. A military member (essentially an agent of the government)
practicing a religion (essentially endorsing it) is not a violation of
the First Amendment, because the very same statement which says that
Congress can\'t make a state religion ***ALSO*** says that the
government cannot prohibit the ***free exercise*** thereof. That means
that if an agent of the government wants to practice a religion, the
government is specifically enjoined from prohibiting that practice.

That\'s why Mikey Weinstein\'s Freedom From Religion Foundation is so
very dangerous. He claims that the First Amendment guarantees that you
can be free ***from*** religion, not just be free to practice whatever
religion you choose, or none at all. This implies that religion, and its
free exercise, can actually be prohibited in certain places, namely
anywhere where someone not of that religion is present. Therefore, the
religious practice of \"proselytizing\" would be prohibited based on
Weinstein\'s definition.

However, the Constitution does not read this way, nor has it ever been
interpreted in this way. The Constitution prohibits ***the government***
from making laws which endorse, or prohibit, religion, or its free
exercise. Government agents, such as military members, may practice a
religion, but they cannot write orders which \"order\" people to
participate in a religion, or to practice any particular religion.

Some commanders (military officers, not cadets) at the Academy would
tell their cadets, \"I\'m participating in \<religious_event\> this
Saturday. You are encouraged to go; you are not ordered to go.\"
Weinstein\'s contention is that constitutes a *de facto* order to go
because \"encouragement\" from a commander is tantamount to an unspoken
order (despite the fact that the same commander, in the same sentence,
said you are not ordered to go). His argument is that the military
climate would lead itself to believe that the \"not ordered to go\" part
would be ignored and the first part would be considered a de facto
order.

There is a religious culture at the Academy. And it is largely
Protestant. Look at the Cadet Chapel (if there was ever an indication
that military members could participate in religion without endorsing
it, the very existence of the Cadet Chapel proves that).

The upstairs area, the grandest area in the Chapel, is the Protestant
worship area, which holds 1200 people. Immediately below the upstairs
doors (down the steps below ground level) is the Catholic Chapel, which
holds 600 people. Behind the Catholic Chapel is the Jewish Chapel which
can hold 100. We then have two All-Faiths Rooms which can be set up in
any configuration. Currently, one of the rooms is set up for Buddhist
worship.

The desires of military members to practice their faith must be balanced
with the desires of those who choose to not exercise any faith, as the
Constitution allows. To that end, there can be no pressure to
participate in any religion. There can be no reprisals for not
participating in a religion. There can be no special treatment given to
anyone of any particular faith, and there can be no negative
consequences for failure to participate in any given faith. This leaves
you free to talk about your religion. You can \"proselytize:\" tell
people about the benefits of practicing your religion (none of which
have anything to do with your military career). Most sane people can
make this distinction in their minds quite easily.

This is the rule, and is abundantly clear, at the Academy. And even when
people try, wholeheartedly, to ensure this remains the order of the day,
misinterpretations and the few who fail to follow orders cause the
majority to look bad.

*(Full disclosure: I was Catholic at the time I attended the Academy
\[1990-1994\]. I am no longer Catholic; I am officially a
non-denominational Christian. My roommate was Protestant. One of my
roommates was Mormon. We\'re all still good friends.)*
