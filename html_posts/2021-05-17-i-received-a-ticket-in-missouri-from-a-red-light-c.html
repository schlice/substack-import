**I received a ticket in Missouri from a red light camera. It included
photos of my truck, my plates, and my friend in the driver seat. Since
my friend was operating my vehicle am I obligated to incriminate him if
I go to court to fight the ticket?**

No. You are only obligated to prove that you were not the driver. You
are not obligated to incriminate the actual driver; you are only
obligated to prove that the driver was not you.

And you are only obligated to prove that you were not the driver because
Missouri local laws surrounding red light cameras are all over the
place.

So whichever city or town gave you the red light ticket has an
unconstitutional system in place, because it has shifted the burden of
proof to you, requiring you to go to court and prove you were not the
driver of the car at the time it ran the red light.

If you want to ***truly*** fight this, get yourself an attorney and make
the claim that the locality where you got the ticket has an
unconstitutional red light camera ordinance in accordance with *Sarah
Tupper v. City of St. Louis.*
