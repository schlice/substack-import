No one will rule on Florida's abortion law.

That's because *Dobbs v. Jackson Women\'s Health Organization* is
pending decision at the Supreme Court right now. *Dobbs* is a case
dealing with the constitutionality of a 2018 Mississippi state law that
banned abortion after the first 15 weeks of pregnancy (much like
Florida's).

Tangentially, Georgia passed a law which banned abortions after six
weeks. That law was ruled unconstitutional under *Roe*, was appealed,
and is awaiting ruling by the 11th Circuit, **which has stayed its
ruling until** ***Dobbs*** **is decided.**

Since Florida is in the 11th Circuit, even if its law is challenged, any
ruling will be stayed until after *Dobbs* is decided.

*Dobbs* is the most important abortion case to be brought before the
Supreme Court since *Planned Parenthood v. Casey.*

commenting to tell me \"ackshually, you\'re wrong,\" don\'t be surprised
if I quietly delete your comment. Put anything vaguely harassing in
there, and your deletion will be followed by a block/mute, and a BNBR
