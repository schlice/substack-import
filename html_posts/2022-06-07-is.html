It's not a good pro-choice argument, because it is based on two flawed
premises:

1.  Many women died due to illegal abortions before *Roe.*
2.  The reason that women survive pregnancy in greater numbers since
    *Roe* is because of abortion.

As has been pointed out already, the main protagonists in the push to
legalize abortion intentionally lied to make the problem seem greater
than it was. People like Dr. Bernard Nathanson:

Yes, women will get illegal abortions, but there will be many fewer
deaths because we now have advanced technologies like abortifacient
drugs which will induce delivery of a nonviable fetus. However, risk in
doing something illegal isn't a reason to make it legal. Indeed, robbing
a bank is very dangerous, but we don't make it legal simply because of
the risk of death from doing it.

Ultimately, it was advances in medical technology and medical care which
caused maternal deaths to decrease, not abortion. Maternal deaths were
already declining well before *Roe.*

Original question:

Is "making abortions illegal will only make them more dangerous, because
women will get them illegally anyway" a good pro-choice argument? What
should I say when someone tells me that it's not?
