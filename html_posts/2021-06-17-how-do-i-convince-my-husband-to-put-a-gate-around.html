I know most of the answers already said this, but I really feel like I
need to add my voice to this discussion.

There are several big (really big) reasons why you need to have either a
fenced-in yard or a protective pool cover, and none of them have
anything to do with your kids. They help your kids incidentally, but
primarily those things are there for **your legal protection.**

A pool is known as an "attractive nuisance." In other words, pools, like
trampolines and big piles of dirt, attract kids. Like moths to a flame,
kids are naturally drawn to "attractive nuisances." And some of those
things can really hurt them, or even kill them if they're not careful.

When you have an attractive nuisance on your property, **the onus is on
you** to protect that nuisance from the kids (primarily, but others too)
who may seek to take advantage of that thing without your consent and
without adult supervision. Without this, you could be liable if someone
hurts themselves or dies when you were not watching your pool.

In fact, most states won't even certify your pool for use unless you
either have a fence or a locking gate around your pool. You should check
with your city or county's building permit department to see what the
laws are where you live. Also, you should check your homeowner's
insurance policy. Most will recommend you expand your homeowner's
insurance to include what is known as an "umbrella policy" to protect
you against lawsuits from people who may injure themselves while using
your pool, and of course, you can't get any homeowner's insurance (in
most cases) unless your pool is protected.

As far as your own toddler is concerned, Florida has that covered. Here,
you have one of two choices: a floating tip sensor in the water (with
interior signal), or audible sensors on every door and window which open
toward the pool, so that you can always be aware of a toddler opening a
door or window towards the pool.

Original question:

How do I convince my husband to put a gate around our in-ground pool? He
says gates are ugly and expensive and we should be watching our toddler
(says the previous owners had 5 kids, no gates and they were fine). What
can I say to change his mind?
