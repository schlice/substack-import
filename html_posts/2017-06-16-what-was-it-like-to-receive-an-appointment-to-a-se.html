Each Member of Congress can have up to 5 appointed cadets in any one of
the service academies. Once one of them leaves for any reason, the slots
re-open and that Congressman can appoint more cadets.

In the year that I applied, my Congressman had two slots. There were
roughly 100 applicants. Which meant that I had a roughly 2% chance of
getting an appointment.

But I approached it in exactly the same way I approached everything
while going through the Academy entrance process. There were forms,
essays, and interviews. Interviews were conducted by a panel of people
at the Congressman's office. I got my nomination from [[Congressman
Norman F.

representative at the time (New York's 5th Congressional District).

He announced his selections for appointment in a press conference at his
office on Long Island, which was also pretty cool.

I don't know how difficult it was for that team to make its choice. They
did have roughly 100 candidates to choose from. Was I a good candidate
by a little? A lot? I think that information may be lost to the ages.

I hope that answers your question. If there was something more specific
that you wanted to ask, please do.
