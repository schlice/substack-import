**In the US, can a homeowners\' association be found grossly negligent
for theft if it fails to install surveillance cameras to deter crime?**

In general, no.

It is common knowledge that cameras might *deter* crime, but they do not
*prevent* "grave injury or harm to persons, property, or both." Failure
to install cameras, therefore, is not gross negligence.

Additionally, from an HOA perspective, a camera must be *monitored 24x7*
if you want it to function to deter crime. Therefore, the HOA would have
to pay a monitoring company to monitor your cameras, which would likely
substantially raise your dues.

Now, if you're willing to pay substantially higher dues, let your HOA
know that you're willing to absorb the cost and you want security
cameras and the monitoring company which will be required to monitor
those cameras. I presume the HOA would poll the membership to ensure
that *everyone* is willing to pay the increased dues. Not only periodic
dues would increased, but their may be a capital improvement outlay that
may be necessary in order to facilitate the infrastructure changes
necessary for a complete camera system, and the HOA may need to budget
that in to another year's budget, especially if they don't have a
capital expenditure reserve available to spend against.

However, failure to install surveillance cameras is not conduct which
rises to the level of gross negligence.
