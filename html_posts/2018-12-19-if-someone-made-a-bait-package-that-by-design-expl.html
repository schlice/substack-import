**If someone made a bait package that, by design, exploded and killed a
package thief, how would such a case play out in court? Would the
package designer be guilty of murder?**

Yes. Booby traps are illegal for just this reason.

First of all, it is not the bait package designer's place to determine
that a thief deserves the death penalty when a court would never
prescribe such a remedy. Secondly, booby traps are *indiscriminate*.
They can harm good guys in just the same way that they can harm bad
guys. What if the thief's kid happened upon the stolen package and
triggered it?

The only way to make a real bait package is to ***over-engineer*** it.

One of the best lines I have heard spoken by anyone ever is Mark's line
in this video:

> Ultimately, when they open the package, I just wanted to celebrate
> their choice of profession with a cloud of glitter, because, I mean,
> who doesn't love glitter?

By the way, this particular Mark Rober video (who if you don't subscribe
to, I [[highly
recommend](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=fefd12&url=https://www.youtube.com/markrober){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="youtube.com"}]{.qlink_container}) is literally going
*viral*. It's getting picked up by mainstream media channels now. i
think I saw it on the Daily Wire this morning, and CNBC yesterday.
