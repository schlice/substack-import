There are a few organizations that the manufacturer will sell to, but
they want to make sure that the substances are actually used for
acceptable purposes. You will have to be ready to present an official
letter on company letterhead before they will sell to you.

Typically, outside of law enforcement, orders for scent training kits
are accepted from accredited dog trainers, training centers, and
academic or research institutions.
