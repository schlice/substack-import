**Content:** []{.rendered_qtext}

Article 19 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human
Rights](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=aeca24&url=http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="un.org"}]{.qlink_container} states (**emphasis** mine):

> Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this
> right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and **to
> seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media** and
> regardless of frontiers.

Clearly, the writers of this Article intended that any media sources are
protected, because it allows for the ability to seek (look for), receive
(get), and impart (pass on) information through any media. This covers
both the people looking for information, and the people providing it
(such as media outlets).

Remember, though, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights is not
legally binding on any nation-state. It is a "common standard" that all
member nations pledge to work towards. The individual nation-state is
still free to choose to incorporate these rights into their own state
actions, or not.
