**I was born with a disability and in order to have ssi I can\'t have
any money to my name. Well my grandma started something for mine and my
sisters college fund thats been growing. Since I legally can\'t have
money it would be a sin to use it right?**

First of all, it sounds like you're trying to connect doing something
which is legal and doing something which may be a sin.

It's important to remember that not all illegal things are sinful, and
not all sinful things are illegal.

Simply using money is not sinful. Using money you *know* you should not
be allowed to have, but doing it anyway, is an attempt to defraud, and
would indeed be sinful.

In order to qualify for SSI, you need to have less than \$2000 in
deemable assets. This is because these resources are calculated in order
to determine whether or not you qualify for SSI. However, not all
resources count towards SSI qualification. Some of the resources which
are exempt from SSI calculation include:

- The home you live in and the property it is on
- Burial spaces for you and your spouse
- Your household goods and personal effects
- Money set aside specifically for burial (up to \$1500 per person)
- Life insurance policies with a face value of \$1500 or less
- One vehicle, regardless of income, provided you use it to transport
  yourself or your spouse
- retroactive SSI or Social Security benefits for up to nine months
  after you receive them (including payments received in installments)
- grants, scholarships, fellowships, or **gifts set aside for
  educational expenses** for 9 months after receipt
- **up to \$100,000 of funds in an Achieving a Better Life Experience
  (ABLE) account established through a State ABLE
  program**[\[1\]](#lpDiT){#cite-lpDiT .citation_link}

So to answer your specific questions:

- It is legal for your grandmother to put money aside for you. You don't
  own the assets, so they do not count as deemable assets.
- It is legal for you to receive gifts from the money your grandmother
  set aside for you; so long as you spend the money on education and you
  spend it within 9 months of receiving it, it does not count toward
  your SSI calculation
- if your grandmother deposits her savings into a state ABLE account, it
  can be in your name and it can contain up to \$100,000 before being
  counted towards SSI.
