**If the second amendment protects the right to own a firearm then how
can it be justifiable for a police officer to shoot someone for having a
gun?**

Your question has a statement and then a question, and the two are
completely unrelated.

**the second amendment protects the right to own a firearm**

Yes, it does.

**how can it be justifiable for a police officer to shoot someone for
having a gun?**

It's not. Police officers don't shoot people *because they have a gun*.
Police officers shoot people because their lives were threatened with
deadly force, or they are trying to stop an act which might result in
death or grave bodily harm to the officer or bystanders.

Instead of "having a gun," perhaps the person in question didn't merely
just "have" the gun in his possession. Maybe he was "brandishing" the
gun, which is a crime. Maybe he was wildly waving it around, risking
death or grave bodily harm to people around him. Maybe he was acting
threatening. Maybe he wouldn't disarm when instructed to do so.

I think you misunderstood why the particular police officer shot the
particular person in question who you believe was shot "for having a
gun." You probably want to either present us with a little more
information to help you understand, or read up a little more on the case
you are citing.
