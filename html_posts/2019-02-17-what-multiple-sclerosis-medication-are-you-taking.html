**What multiple sclerosis medication are you taking, and what have been
the pros and cons?**

I am currently on Gilenya™ (fingolimod). This is my third MS medication.
I was originally on Copaxone™ (glatiramer acetate), and then I moved to
Tysabri™ (natalizumab).

Gilenya is a very good medication. It is an oral MS med, so I take a
pill every day. Easy peesey.

**Pros:**

- It's a once-daily pill. It's part of my morning routine; I very rarely
  forget to take it.
- It has a very low incidence of side effects.
- It has kept my disease from progressing for the entire time I have
  been taking it. No new lesions, no active lesions, no change in any of
  my existing lesions.

**Cons:**

- It is an immunosuppressant, so you are more prone to catching viruses.
  You must be careful over the winter to keep your hands clean and keep
  yourself otherwise healthy. I have a *lower* WBC (white blood cell)
  count, but not *dangerously* low, continuously monitored, and
  manageable (for now).
- It does produce some GI changes. However, if the latest study
  highlighted at ECTRIMS is any indication, *this may actually be part
  of the reason the medication is effective.*
- When you first start taking it, it can lower your pulse and blood
  pressure. You must monitor for this. Simply increasing your activity
  level is enough to counter this effect. I supplemented that with extra
  caffeine for the first few months (make sure you're drinking plenty of
  water as well), and I managed the symptoms.
