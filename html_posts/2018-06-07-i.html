**How many gun-related mass murders have occurred in the US in the last
50 years that have been perpetrated by a person or people who followed
gun laws?**

So let's step back understanding that murder is illegal so no one who
has committed a mass murder has actually followed all laws.

Let's look at *up until the point of the mass murder*, whether or not
all laws were followed.

The news is very clear about these while they're being reported, because
soon after you hear about a mass murder, the questions arise. Where did
the shooter get the gun? Was it legal for the shooter to possess a gun?
How did the shooter get the gun into a place where there shouldn't be
guns?

If we focus on school shootings, we can say that none of the shooters
were following gun laws, as schools (currently) are gun-free zones, and
private citizens, even fully licensed ones, cannot carry firearms into
school zones. Therefore, every school shooter violated the law.

**But the law did exactly what it was supposed to do.** Every one of the
school shooters (who was alive following the incident) was prosecuted
for violating the gun-free zone laws. And for murder too, but we're
stepping back from that for the moment.

*Wait, the law wasn't designed to stop shooters before they kill?*

**NO, it was not.**

In fact, the most shocking thing I think I can say is that **laws do not
stop people from doing bad things if they choose.**

I think people have a tremendous misconception about what laws are
supposed to do. Laws are designed to punish those who break them. They
are a *disincentive,* ***not*** *a preventative.* You would think that
putting a law in place would prevent 100% of people from doing that
particular bad thing, but it does not. It only prevents those who
**choose** to follow that law from receiving that consequence. People
can, in fact, choose to *not* follow that law, at which point the
consequence kicks in.

Notice that the law only prevented people who **chose** to follow it
from receiving consequences. People who **chose** not to follow it
received consequences.

Therefore, the law actually didn't prevent bad behavior. It only
prevented *the law-abiding* from receiving consequences from performing
said bad behavior. People who chose to not follow the law received the
consequences. **But they still performed the bad behavior before they
received the consequences. So the law did not keep anyone safe. It only
punished the law breaker** ***after the fact.***

*So if the law can't keep people safe, how do you stop a shooting before
it happens?*

**SECURITY.**

Security prevents bad things from happening in the first place. Laws
take the person *who has already performed a bad act* and gives them
consequences. Laws have their effect on the back side of the act (after
it happens); security has its effect on the front side of the act
(before it happens).

The challenge (should we have the courage to accept it) is making
security *ubiquitous* and *unobtrusive* but *effective*. This is our
challenge, and it will not be easy, but I am convinced that it is
possible.
