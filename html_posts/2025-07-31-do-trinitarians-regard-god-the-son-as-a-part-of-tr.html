In Trinitarian theology, God the Son (Jesus Christ) is considered fully
God, co-equal and co-eternal with the Father and the Holy Spirit, within
the divine being. While the Son is subordinate to the Father in terms of
**function** and **role**, especially due to the Incarnation, this
subordination is not one of *essence* or *inferiority*. It\'s a
**voluntary** submission for the purpose of *redemption*, not a
reflection of inherent *inequality*.

So yes, God the Son is indeed part of the Trinity. As a man, He has
access to everything that a man has, including free will.

He subordinates Himself below God the Father in terms of His *role* in
the Trinity.

Does He have the *right* to do something which God the Father would not
approve of? Yes, He does. He completely has free will. But whether He
*would* do something against the will of the Father is dependent on
perspective. While Jesus experienced limitations during His earthly
ministry due to His humanity, the doctrine of the Trinity suggests that
within the Godhead (Father, Son, and Holy Spirit), **there is perfect
unity of knowledge and will.** Therefore, while Jesus in His human form
may have limited knowledge, as God, He possesses all knowledge.

So Jesus the man had the *potential* to do something outside of the will
of God, but He never would (and He never did) because He was *sinless*,
which means He never missed the mark of God's glory. Jesus *as part of
the Godhead* **has perfect unity of knowledge and will** with the Father
and the Spirit, so everything that Jesus wants to do is **the same** as
what the Father and the Spirit want to do.
