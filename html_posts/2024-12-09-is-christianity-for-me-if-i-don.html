St. Augustine said, "Pray not for a lighter load, but for stronger
shoulders.\" This quote was echoed by Reverend Phillips Brooks (and
later by President John F. Kennedy, immortalized in the video game *Call
of Duty: Zombies*) (IYKYK\*) when he said, \"Do not pray for easy lives.
Pray to be stronger men! Do not pray for tasks equal to your powers.
Pray for powers equal to your tasks.\"

Life doesn't become easy whether you trust God or not. Life will be hard
even if you don't trust God.

At least God is honest with you about the fact that life is hard, and
believing in Him won't make it easy.

> *I have said these things to you, that in me you may have peace. In
> the world you will have tribulation. But take heart; I have overcome
> the world." \-- John 16:33 ESV*

Here, Jesus very clearly says that life will be hard. But the point of
religion isn't to give you an easy life. It's to give you a ***glorious
eternity.***

Secondly, trust doesn't require work. Learning requires work. Trust
requires a choice. Putting your faith (or you can call it "trust") in
God is nothing more than a choice. You choose to put your faith in God.

But God is easy to trust, because **He has a history of keeping His
promises.** He has never lied. He has never failed to be trustworthy. He
has been faithful since the beginning.

The hard part about trusting God is *letting go of your own control*.
None of us likes to give up control. It's human nature. It's hard to let
go and let God do the driving in your life. But He promises that if you
let Him, it may not be the path you expected, but it will get you to
somewhere wonderful, and you will be fulfilling your life's purpose.

Letting God take control of your life is the hard part. That's the scary
part. But you can do it. Billions around the world have done it already.
And the rewards *far exceed* the effort.

We'll be praying for you.
