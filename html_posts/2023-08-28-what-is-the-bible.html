First, it's important to understand the difference between global
warming and climate change. Climate change includes global warming, but
encompasses a whole host of changes to the planet.

According to NASA, climate change, "encompasses global warming, but
refers to the broader range of changes that are happening to our planet,
including rising sea levels; shrinking mountain glaciers; accelerating
ice melt in Greenland, Antarctica and the Arctic; and shifts in
flower/plant blooming times." Also according to NASA, global warming is
"the long-term heating of the Earth's climate system observed since the
pre-industrial period (between 1850 and 1900) due to human activities,
primarily fossil fuel burning, which increases heat-trapping greenhouse
gas levels in the Earth's atmosphere."[\[1\]](#LkFIf){#cite-LkFIf

From this definition, it is mankind's fault that we are experiencing
global warming. It is important to note that not everyone agrees on
whether it is mankind's fault, or if it is, to what degree, that we are
experiencing global warming. Many people deny we are experiencing global
warming at all.

While the Bible does not specifically address global warming or climate
change, it is important for people to take care of the environment,
since God has given us dominion over the earth (Genesis 1:26-28). Since
God has given us this great responsibility and privilege, we do need to
care about the way we treat the environment. All mankind is to be good
stewards of God's creation as the entire world is His, "The earth is the
Lord's, and everything in it, the world, and all who live in it;" (Psalm
24:1). It is important that we do our part to help protect the earth.
Activities such as recycling and smart usage of fossil fuels are small
ways to help take care of the environment. But everyone taking small
steps in their own spheres will eventually have a big impact.
