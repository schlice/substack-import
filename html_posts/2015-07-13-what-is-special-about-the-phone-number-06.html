**Content:** [Nothing special about it, other than it\'s the designation
that on most phones and using most programming will produce the IMEI
number of the phone without having to look on a sticker or underneath
the battery. When I type it on my phone, it produces the IMEI and the SN
of the phone, along with scannable bar codes to make entry easier. This
is especially important with modern phones which do not have removable
batteries, so the IMEI is generally not printed on the outside of the
phone anywhere. Having a software code which will produce it is
important.\
\
Note that on most modern smartphones, you can go into the \"About\...\"
section of your phone\'s Settings and also find the IMEI and the Serial
Number of the phone.\
\
These programming codes were developed alongside the original mobile
phones which only had a traditional \"ten-key\" keypad. Most of those
codes became obsolete when smart phones were introduced, but some of
them remained.]{.rendered_qtext}
