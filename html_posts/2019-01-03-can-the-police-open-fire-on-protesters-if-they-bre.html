**Can the police open fire on protesters if they break the law (for
example destroy private property or block a road)?**

To answer the question without snark, no one can use deadly force unless
a threat to life of a threat of grave bodily harm exists.

So the answer is no, police cannot use firearms against protesters for
simply breaking the law.

Police can use *non-lethal* rounds, like bean bag rounds, which are
fired from a shotgun, or rubber bullets. These rounds are fired from
actual firearms, so if the police are using these riot control methods,
it does appear that the police are actually shooting protesters when
they are not.

I'd prefer that the fire department use protesters blocking a road as
target practice for learning how to aim the truck-mounted fire
suppression system.
