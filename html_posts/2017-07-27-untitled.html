There's no way that someone with the wide array of businesses that Trump
has would ever be able to disentangle himself enough to avoid even the
appearance of potential conflicts of interest. And asking him to
liquidate all of his assets into a blind trust, in a buyer's market, is
something that no one would do. That would mean you'd be forcing Trump
to take a massive financial loss, and there is nothing in the
Constitution that requires blind trusts, nor requires business owners to
divest themselves of their businesses, nor requires them to lose
substantial sums of money, in order to become president.

I can't answer whether or not he would talk to his kids about his
businesses. None of us know that. And even if he did divest himself
completely from all of his businesses, liquidating them into a blind
trust, that trust would be run by his family. He'd never be able to
remove every shred of doubt that he would be completely out of the loop.

So for now, yes, you have to take him at his word. We elected him
president, so we should give him "enough rope to hang himself," as the
expression goes (relax, Secret Service, I didn't threaten the president,
nor did I suggest he hang himself. It's an expression, jeez).

And why didn't he provide his tax returns? Perhaps the question you
should be asking yourself is *why do other politicians provide theirs?*
Why are they so willing to provide tax returns? Is it because they're
"totally transparent" and want to show the American people just how
"honest" they are?

Ha, please.

How is it possible that Hillary can make a couple hundred thousand a
year from speaking engagements, but still have a personal net worth in
the millions? She's not supposed to be personally enriched by her
foundation, but yet there it is. Now I'm no Calculus teacher, but I
think someone isn't being completely honest. Not all of her assets are
accounted for.

In fact, politicians structure their personal finances so that they look
good on a 1040. They use tax-sheltered investments and other
non-reportable investment vehicles to "hide" their other sources of
income. They hire teams of tax attorneys and CPAs to assist them with
shuffling their assets so that the ultimate goal will be a squeaky-clean
1040. They provide just enough of their 1040 to satisfy the gullible
population. "See? I pay my taxes just like every other average
hard-working American."

Trump, being in business his whole life and not in politics, has never
done this. He has structured his finances to maximize profit and
minimize the amount of tax he was required to pay. Therefore, his tax
returns show all the cool tricks that rich people play to avoid paying
taxes. All perfectly legal, and when the IRS is asked, that's exactly
what they'll say (and they did). But not very flattering to your average
SJW out there. They already had enough ammo on him with the whole pussy
thing; did he really need to give them more when he was under no
obligation to do so? I think not. And so did a majority of states, since
they elected him without ever seeing his tax returns. Notice I didn't
say "a majority of people," because states elect the President, not
people.

He also shows things like hundreds of thousands of dollars of financial
losses, which also minimizes his tax burden (or on his one leaked 1040,
almost no tax at all). Even though that's the way the tax system works,
he was incorrectly accused of "dodging taxes," "not paying his fair
share," and worse, "being a bad businessman; I mean, look at those
losses!" There were explanations for the losses, and they checked out,
but that doesn't stop people from forming negative opinions based on
perfectly legal activity. Why would you intentionally inflict that on
yourself? He's going to have to live with the Orange Cheeto thing for
the rest of his life, and every reference to GHRITP will be associated
with him, and he underwent that willingly.

You gotta admit, the guy's got a pair if he's going to put himself
through that.
