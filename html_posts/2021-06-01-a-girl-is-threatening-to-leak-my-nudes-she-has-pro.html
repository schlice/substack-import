I'm going to assume you are both underage.

If you have your nudes, you have committed the crime of possession of
child pornography. But the girl who is threatening you is also in
possession of child pornography and is threatening to commit more crimes
(distribution of child pornography is also a crime). Depending on what
she wants from you, she may also be committing blackmail or extortion.

Tell her that you and she can go down to the police station to discuss
whose crimes are worse. If she doesn't agree to go with you, tell her
that you'll go by yourself and the police will probably come by to have
a chat with her.

If the nudes leak, you have evidence to show exactly who did it, so
those nudes better not get posted anywhere or the police will come find
her first.
