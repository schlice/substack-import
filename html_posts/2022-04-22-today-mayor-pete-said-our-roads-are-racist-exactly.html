I know this one.

Clearly, a road is not conscious, so it cannot be racist.

But a road (like a major thoroughfare) can be placed in a racist way, if
it is intentionally located in a way which favors one race over another.
Perhaps the road is near the white neighborhoods, and the people in the
black neighborhoods have to travel to get to the road, meaning that the
white neighborhoods prosper more from the economic growth around the
road than the black neighborhoods. If the road was intentionally placed
in order to favor one neighborhood over the other, it could mean that
the placement of that road was done in a racist way.

I\'m sure Mayor Pete has actual examples of road placement which he
believes is racist.

I don\'t think you can cure a road of its racism. I also don\'t really
think you can remedy the situation now that it has happened. It\'s
simply another example of what Mayor Pete would call "systemic racism,"
or racism that has been designed into the system.
