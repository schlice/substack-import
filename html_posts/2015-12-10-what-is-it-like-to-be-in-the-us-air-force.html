You are headed to a very exciting opportunity! And might I be the first
to thank you in advance for your service to our nation.

To add to [[Tom

excellent advice, let me offer you the following bits of advice:

1.  Keep an open mind. If you go into it with pre-conceived notions
    about what you think your military experience *should* be like, you
    will only be disappointed when it does not live up to your
    expectations, or it is different than you thought. It\'s an
    adventure! Live it like one! Deal with the challenges as they come
    (and they will, but challenging yourself is not a bad thing), and
    look for the positives when it seems like everything around you is
    negative.
2.  Basic Training is designed to tear you down as an individual and
    build you up as a team. Your individuality will be removed: you\'ll
    all dress the same, they will shave off all your hair (thus removing
    your hairstyle, another avenue of individuality), etc. Remember that
    everyone there is going through exactly the same thing, and everyone
    there feels the same way, even if they don\'t express it. Also
    remember that they can\'t legally kill you, so they\'re just trying
    to test you. It\'s not personal. It\'s training. And the logic of
    what they do will only make sense well after you leave. Just go with
    it.
3.  Tech school is much more chill, but remember that these are the
    foundational skills you will need in your job. The skills you learn
    in tech school probably won\'t be what you do day-to-day, but they
    provide the foundation of knowledge you will need to excel at your
    job. You\'ll learn more about your specific skills when you arrive
    at your first duty station.
4.  Tom said to be an expert in your field. He\'s absolutely right. Do
    everything you can to become the best you can be in your career
    field. Take extra training if it is offered, complete your PME as
    soon as you are able to apply, etc. These things only help come
    promotion time. Rather than just \"filling the squares,\" do your
    best, and the squares will fill themselves.

\"Duty, then, is the sublimest word in the English language. You should
do your duty in all things. You can never do more; you should never wish
to do less.\" \-- Gen. Robert E. Lee

\"If I do my full duty, the rest will take care of itself.\" \-- Gen.
George S. Patton, Jr.

\"The courage of a soldier is heightened by his knowledge of his
profession.\" \-- Vegetius; De Re Militari, i, 389

\"The true measure of a professional lies in his ability to adapt to new
situations.\" \-- Hon. Harold Brown, SecAF 1966

and the last training quote that springs to mind:

\"On the fields of friendly strife are sown the seeds that on other days
and other fields will bear the fruits of victory.\" - Gen. Douglas
MacArthur
