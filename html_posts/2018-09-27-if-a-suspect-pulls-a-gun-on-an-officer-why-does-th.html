**If a suspect pulls a gun on an officer why does the officer fire
lethal shots and many?**

Officers do not fire "lethal" shots as opposed to firing a shot which
would be "non-lethal." Even a shot to a leg could hit the femoral artery
and the suspect would be dead within minutes from exsanguination
(bleeding out). An implement of deadly force, by definition, cannot fire
"non-lethal" shots. All shots from a firearm are potentially lethal. It
is possible that you can be hit by a firearm and live. It happens all
the time. Even the dreaded "head shot" can be survived. One of our local
police officers was shot in the head and survived. He's still
recovering, but he's alive. Additionally, killing is not the goal. If it
was, then an officer would be in trouble for not doing his job if the
suspect survived, and that has never happened. Therefore, officers are
not shooting **to kill**.

Officers instead shoot **to stop a threat**, and they are trained to
continue shooting until the threat is stopped.
