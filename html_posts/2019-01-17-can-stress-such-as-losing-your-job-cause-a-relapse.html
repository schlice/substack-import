**Can stress such as losing your job cause a relapse in Multiple
sclerosis?**

Yes, stress can definitely trigger relapses.

Stress, studies have shown, [[causes inflammation in the
body](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=5d1eff&url=https://www.everydayhealth.com/wellness/united-states-of-stress/link-between-stress-inflammation/){.external_link

MS exacerbations (relapses) are caused by inflammation in the central
nervous system (CNS). The inflammation damages the myelin which slows or
disrupts the transmission of nerve impulses and causes the symptoms of
MS.[\[1\]](#tittr){#cite-tittr .citation_link}

Therefore, stress is a big trigger for exacerbations. It's not a
guarantee, but a trigger.
