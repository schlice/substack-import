**Trump could be using government shutdown to delay the emoluments
lawsuits against him. Do you think this is possible?**

To be honest, we're saying "Trump," but we really mean "Trump's
lawyers."

In order to provide the best possible defense, they will use every
procedural avenue open to them to either delay or nullify the case
before it ever has an opportunity to go to trial. That's a feature of
the system. Both sides get vigorous representation.

Trump's legal team is doing exactly what I would expect them to do in
the face of an inability by the prosecution to proceed.
