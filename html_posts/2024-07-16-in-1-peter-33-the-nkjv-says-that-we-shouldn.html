So if I were to summarize your question, it sounds like you're asking
about the quality of the KJV.

The main problem with the King James Version of the Bible is that the
manuscripts the translators were using were very few in number and
contained many copy errors.

We need to understand that while these translations were being created,
we were continually finding more manuscripts, and so our ability to
error-check them continually improved over time. This means that older
translations of the Bible contain more errors than newer ones, since we
had fewer manuscripts at the time that some translations of the Bible
were being written.

In short, ***older translations of the Bible contain more errors than
newer ones****.*

Since the production of the King James version, many more manuscripts
were discovered which allowed us to error-check the earlier manuscripts
and come to better consensus as to the original text. This lack of
abundant manuscripts at the time of KJV's creation has induced some
well-known issues with its translation, including the false inclusion of
[[1 John
5:7--8](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=342adb&url=https://ehrmanblog.org/problems-with-the-king-jame-version-what-were-the-translators-translating/){.external_link

qt-tooltip="ehrmanblog.org"}]{.qlink_container}, which ended up being
included in the Latin Vulgate, and the KJV, but not later translations.
Another well-known issue with KJV is [[the translation of the word rasah
in the Ten
Commandments](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=9da804&url=https://www.gotquestions.org/you-shall-not-kill-vs-murder.html){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="gotquestions.org"}]{.qlink_container}. KJV translates the
word as "kill" and renders the Sixth Commandment: "Thou shalt not kill,"
but this translation of that word does not match the context nor the
usage of the word throughout the rest of the Bible. Subsequent
translations correctly translate the word as "murder" and the
Commandment is rendered: "You shall not murder."

This issue with 1 Peter 3:3, which is only seen in KJV but not in later
translations, is yet another example of using fewer, more low-quality
manuscripts from which your translation is done. We know that as time
went on and we discovered more manuscripts, we were better able to
error-check the manuscripts we did have and we were able to produce New
Testaments which had greater fidelity to the source.
