CNN, just like every other major news outlet, has only one goal: **keep
your eyeballs glued to the screen for as long as they can.**

Their goal is not to bring you fair and balanced anything. Their goal
isn't even to deliver *news.* Their goal is to keep you watching, for as
long as they can do so, so that they can claim viewership numbers and
make more advertising revenue for their parent company.

This sometimes means that the stuff they put out may not necessarily be
fully true or complete. It may be inflammatory. It may be outrageous. It
may be from "anonymous sources" who are not simply protected from
disclosure by the news agency, but are anonymous *to the news agency* as
well, which also means *unverifiable* without second-hand corroboration,
which sometimes does not occur for the sake of, of course, keeping your
eyeballs glued to the screen.

So does this mean that CNN can make wild allegations that Paddock's
girlfriend was actually *complicit* in the killings? Of course it does!
Is there any evidence to support this claim? **NONE WHATSOEVER.** And if
there is such evidence, it is *protected from distribution* by the
people who actually know: law enforcement.

What they are doing is *speculating.* What they are doing that is
intellectually dishonest is *speculating and passing it off as truth*
without copious disclaimers that "this is just speculation" and "no
official statements have been made by law enforcement" and "this is just
my talking-head uninformed anchorman's opinion."

Television news has become partisan opinion, nothing more. You **must**
view everything you see on broadcast television and cable news shows as
opinion. You must now verify every "fact" you get from media sources,
because *they're not doing it anymore.*
