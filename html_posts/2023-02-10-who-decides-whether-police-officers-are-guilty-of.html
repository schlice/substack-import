Misconduct means a violation of department policy. It's not a violation
of law, because that's handled by the legal system (district attorney
and the courts). And it's not a violation of a person's civil rights,
because that's handled by the Department of Justice.

Misconduct means violating rules of conduct at the department level.
Therefore, it is the department that handles misconduct complaints.

It's different at every department, but there are some commonalities. In
most cases, police departments have an **Internal Affairs Division**
which is responsible for investigating allegations of officer
misconduct.

In general though, IA will perform an investigation and will turn over
their findings to the leadership chain to handle the disciplinary part
of the process. Leadership will usually convene a disciplinary board
consisting of, at a minimum, the officer's management, the department
leadership, and the department's training group. They will determine if
the officer did violate rules of conduct and whether or not the officer
was appropriately trained on those rules. They may recommend re-training
of the officer, or they could recommend other discipline, up to and
including termination.
