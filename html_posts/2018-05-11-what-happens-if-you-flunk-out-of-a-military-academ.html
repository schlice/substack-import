My esteemed colleagues here are correct, and the policies remain in
place today.

The first two years are freebies. You can complete two years of academic
study and leave the Academy and owe nothing. Generally with enough
credits that you only need one more year at a traditional college to
graduate with a BS.

Once you begin classes in your 2Â° (junior) year, you incur an Active
Duty Service Commitment (ADSC). Depending on how long you continue
before you leave will determine how much time (and in what grade) you
will be required to repay. As I understand it, there is an option to
repay that time not in service but in dollars as well. Off the top of my
head, I'm not sure what those amounts are, and I'm certain they change
frequently.
