First, you have to have *standing*. You either need to be the police
department, or you need to be the towing company. You can't file a
lawsuit to uphold the provisions of a contract on someone else's behalf.
If the parties to the contract won't uphold the contract, you can't
legally *make* them.

If you *are* the police department or the towing company, great! Get a
lawyer.

If you are *not* the police department or the towing company, you could
perhaps talk to one of those parties and have them enforce their
contract, but unless you're a party to the contract, you can't legally
force them to uphold their contractual obligations.
