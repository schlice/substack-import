> Overall, the teenagers in the sample had a median age at first sex of
> 16.9 years. Black males had the lowest observed median (15.0), and
> Asian American males the highest (18.1); white and Hispanic males, and
> white and black females, reported similar ages (about 16.5 years).
> Hispanic and Asian American females had rates of first sex about half
> that of white females, although these protective effects were
> explained by differences in family structure. Even after controlling
> for background characteristics, black males had rates of first sex
> that were about 3-5 times the rates of the other gender-and-ethnicity
> groups. In addition, Asian American males were less likely than
> Hispanic males to be sexually experienced, and Hispanic males had
> almost twice the rates of sexual activity of Hispanic females.
