**Not even close**.

In fact, the more we investigate neo-Darwinist "evolution," the more we
find that the mechanisms that Darwin and his progyny propose is
insufficient to account for the diversity of species. In other words,
the more information we learn about life, the less that Darwinism fits
the evidence.

**The (growing) mountain of evidence strongly argues against evolution
and argues for an intelligent creator.**

We don't say that intelligence created the first life because we lack
understanding of the natural cause. It's because we have *positive,
empirically-detectable* evidence of intelligence in the design of life.

First, a message (specified complexity) is empirically detectable. When
we detect a message like DNA, we know that it must come from an
intelligent being because all of our observational experience tells us
that messages come only from intelligent beings. Every time we observe a
message, it comes from an intelligent being. We couple this data with
the fact that we never observe natural laws creating messages, and we
know an intelligent being must be the cause. That's a valid scientific
conclusion based on observation and repetition. It's not an argument
from ignorance, nor is it based on any "gap" in our knowledge. Darwin
had no idea that DNA existed, and DNA poses an incredible problem for
Darwinistic evolution, in many ways. But for now, I'm limiting my
discussion to the "message" resident in DNA.

Second, Intelligent Design scientists are open to *both* natural and
intelligent causes. They are not opposed to continued research into a
natural explanation for the first life. They're simply observing that
all known natural explanations fail, and all empirically detectable
evidence points to an intelligent Designer. The neo-Darwinists deny *a
priori* that an intelligent cause is even possible, so they never even
consider it.

Third, the Intelligent Design conclusion is *falsifiable*. In other
words, ID could be disproven if natural laws were someday discovered to
create specified complexity. However, the same *cannot* be said about
the neo-Darwinist position. Neo-Darwinists don't allow falsification of
their "creation story" because, as I just mentioned, they don't allow
any other creation story to be considered. Their "science" is not
tentative or open to correction; it's more closed-minded than the most
dogmatic church doctrine the neo-Darwinists are so apt to criticize.

Finally, it's actually the neo-Darwinists who are committing a God-of
the-Gaps fallacy. Darwin himself was once accused of considering natural
selection "an active power or Deity" (see chapter 4 of *Origin of
Species*). But it seems that natural selection actually *is* the deity
or "God of the Gaps" for the neo-Darwinists of today. When they are
totally at a loss for how irreducibly complex, information-rich
biological systems came into existence, they simply cover their gap in
knowledge by claiming that natural selection, time, and chance did it.

The ability of such a mechanism to create information-rich biological
systems runs counter to the observational evidence. Mutations are nearly
always harmful, and time and chance do the neo-Darwinists no good. At
best, natural selection may be responsible for minor changes in living
species (what we call "microevolution"), but it cannot explain the
origin of the basic forms of life (what we call "macroevolution"). You
need a living thing to start with for any natural selection to take
place. Yet, despite the obvious problems with their mechanism,
neo-Darwinists insist that it covers any gap in their knowledge.
Moreover, they willfully ignore the positive, empirically detectable
evidence for an intelligent being. This is not science but the dogma of
a secular religion.
