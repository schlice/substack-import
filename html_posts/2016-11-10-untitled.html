I don't think we can compare the two. Maybe not "apples and bricks", but
"apples and oranges": both fruit, but vastly different. One protest at
one college campus does not compare to tens of thousands of rioters in
multiple cities across the country shouting "F\*ck Donald Trump" and
"He's Not My President."

This is **not** how democracy works. He is, in fact, everyone's
president.

I may not have agreed with Mr. Obama's policies, but I'm not so na√Øve to
believe that he's not my president. He is, indeed, my president. He was
democratically elected (whether or not you believe in the benefits of
the Electoral College), twice, no less. If I can claim that Obama was my
president even though I disagreed with the vast majority of his
political positions, then even if you didn't vote for him, those
protesting should also understand that Trump is their president, too.

There are lots of ways to make your feelings known to your government.
Working through your elected officials is probably the best way to do
it, but there are others. Rioting and protesting are **not** the best
ways to do it. You certainly get noticed, but not in the way you might
like.

Also, there is a **night and day difference** between disagreeing with
your president-elect, and calling people who *voted for him* racist,
sexist, misogynistic, xenophobic haters. Disagreeing with elected
officials is commonplace in society. Disparaging other citizens simply
because they have an *opinion* is **wrong**. It is not democracy at
work. It is simply evidence of exactly the hate you accuse others of
espousing. So, who is really the hater here?

Trump didn't win because he tapped into the "racist underbelly" of the
country. He won because he connected with the people who felt abandoned
by their government better than Clinton did. Remember, for every "I'm a
Hillary Deplorable" T-shirt at a Trump rally, there was a "Nasty Woman"
T-shirt at a Clinton rally. Both sides are culpable in that regard.
