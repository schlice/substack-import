**Someone is threatening to leak nudes online, but we are in different
states. What are the legal actions I can take against this to prevent it
from happening?**

None.

There is no legal action you can take that would prevent a bad person
from doing a bad thing.

The legal actions come after a bad person does a bad thing.

As of today, 38 states have laws against **revenge porn.** [[You should

state is one of them.

If they do post nude pictures of you with the intent of annoying or
harassing you without your consent, you should get a lawyer and the two
of you should get in contact with the district attorney's office in his
jurisdiction. Besides the revenge porn laws, there are other crimes that
the offender can be charged with, like cyber bullying and other cyber
crimes, depending on the jurisdiction.
