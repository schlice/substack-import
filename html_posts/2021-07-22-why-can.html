I want to expand on [[Thomas

and say that he's right, but "evidence" is going to be tough to come by.
It all depends on the specific type of evidence you're looking for.

Most people are looking for "evidence" in terms of what they can use
their five senses to determine. So they want something they can see,
hear, feel, smell, touch. And if we can't "produce such evidence," they
won't believe.

This type of doubt is not new. Thomas wouldn't believe that Jesus had
actually risen from the dead until he touched the nail holes in his
hands, and put his hand into Jesus' side (where the centurion pierced
him on the cross). Jesus did appear to Thomas, and he was able to get
his doubts alleviated. And Jesus said, "Because you have seen me, you
have believed; blessed are those who have not seen and yet have
believed." (John 20:29 NIV). Clearly, Jesus knew that this would be an
ongoing problem (people not believing if they don't see for themselves).
But God is pleased with us when we believe *despite* our doubts; when we
have not seen, but have yet believed.

Anyway, back to evidence. It's difficult to provide the type of evidence
that will satisfy the OP, since it's likely he or she is looking for
something which can be interpreted by the senses. But God exists outside
of the physical. He exists in the *supernatural*, not in the physical.
Thus, he cannot be sensed with your physical senses. He can't be proven
with science (which operates against the physical). So the type of
"evidence" the OP is presumably looking for won't be something we can
produce.

*But if he's so all-powerful, why doesn't he make himself visible to
us?*

Good question. But here's the trick: **he already did.**

God deigned to take human form and live on the earth for 33 years. The
"all-powerful," "all-knowing" God *willingly chose* to take on human
form.

*And then he allowed himself to be killed.*

Some all-powerful God, huh? He just starts getting the ball rolling on
his ministry on earth, and he goes and gets himself arrested and
crucified. But Christians know that *this was the point of his life*: to
be killed as the sacrificial lamb for our sins, paying for them all
(past, present, and future) with his blood, and then, as an added bonus,
**so that he could be resurrected and restore the path for man to return
to Heaven.**

Never has the life of one person been so consequential to everything in
existence as the life of Jesus.

People who ask for "evidence" like this are intentionally posing a
question which cannot be answered so that they can continue to deny the
existence of God with a clear (?) conscience. But if you look at the
logical and philosophical "evidence," rather than searching for physical
evidence which cannot be produced, you will find that it takes a larger
leap of faith to be an atheist than it does to be a theist. Former
atheist Lee Strobel, who arrived at this end result many years ago, has
commented: \"Essentially, I realized that to stay an atheist, I would
have to believe that nothing produces everything; non-life produces
life; randomness produces fine-tuning; chaos produces information;
unconsciousness produces consciousness; and non-reason produces reason.
Those leaps of faith were simply too big for me to take, especially in
light of the affirmative case for God\'s existence. In other words, in
my assessment the Christian worldview accounted for the totality of the
evidence much better than the atheistic worldview.\"

Original question:

Why can\'t Christians and Muslims provide evidence of their all-knowing
God\'s existence?
