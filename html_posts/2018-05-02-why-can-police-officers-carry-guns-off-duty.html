For full time police officers, their police powers never go away. They
are always police officers 24x7. Their duty to enforce state law and to
protect the public at large does not end at the end of the shift. To
that end, their bosses (police chiefs and city councils) want them to be
prepared to utilize that training and authority and to be ready to
intervene at any time, whether on duty or off duty. Those bosses will
*mandate* that those officers carry at a minimum their firearm and their
credentials at all times. State law usually indicates the same thing
(i.e. because a full-time police officer retains his police powers when
off duty, they can carry firearms at any time).

This is different from part-time officers (i.e. Reserves, Augmentees,
Auxiliary, etc). Part time officers only have police powers (depending
on agency) while they are on duty. Once off duty, they are civilians.
(Interesting note: our Sheriff still wanted us Reserves to carry while
off duty, so in order to be compliant with the law, on the back side of
our Sheriff's Office ID cards is printed a Concealed Weapons Permit.
Full time deputies do not require this extra step).
