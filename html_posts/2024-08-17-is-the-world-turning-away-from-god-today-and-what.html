The world has *always* turned away from God, ever since Eve was tricked
in the Garden.

It does *seem like* the world is turning further away from God than it
ever has, but that's not unexpected. The world is going to get ***much,
much worse*** before it gets better.

**You** can't do anything to change that. Only God can change the course
of the world.

The best you can do is to work on *people*, not the *world*.

Make sure that everyone you meet knows the love of Christ in their
lives. Make sure everyone you meet has the opportunity to hear the Good
News. Make sure everyone gets to use their free will to its fullest
extent.

You only get one shot at this life. Make it a good one.
