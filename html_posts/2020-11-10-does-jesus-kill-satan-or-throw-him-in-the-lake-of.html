You've got two questions in one, but i'll answer both. Let's split them
up:

**Does Jesus kill Satan or throw him in the lake of fire if he kills him
is that considered murder?**

I like how you're trying to apply human criminal law philosophy to the
actions of God. That's cute. Like God is subject to our laws.

Murder is a crime. But the basis of it is an unjustified killing. If
Jesus were to kill Satan, it would most certainly be justified.

**Will there be people left on earth when Jesus returns, could some of
them be nonbelievers will the non believers be able to stand Jesus
glory?**

There are plenty of Bible passages which talk about the difference
between those who are saved and those who are not saved. The upshot of
all of this is that some people will not be saved. These are the people
who reject Jesus' gift. If they are non-believers, then they will not be
saved. It has nothing to do with not standing his glory. It has
everything to do with whether or not they will accept Jesus as their
savior.
