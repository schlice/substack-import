Thank you for letting me write an answer, [[Corley

I know you're not my biggest fan, and I appreciate you giving me an
opportunity to answer your question, dispassionately, even though I rage
inside. For that, I thank you.

**Why is no one filing a temporary restraining order to stop the family
separation operation (at least for a brief time) at the border until the
issue can be adjudicated?**

A TRO can not direct any organization or agency to act unlawfully. A TRO
also cannot "restrain" a federal organization from following the law.

From the [[US Attorney's

The question will be asked whether or not there is adequate remedy at
law, and whether or not "irreparable injury" will occur if the
implementation of the law continues. We currently have a law on the
books which requires that children not be incarcerated for more than 20
days. It's difficult to argue that "irreparable injury" would result if
we allow the law to continue and we not incarcerate children with adults
for longer than 20 days.

*Even if the law is unjust.*

*Even if the law is morally questionable.*

*Even if the law says or does something you don't like.*

You cannot file a restraining order to prevent the government from
enforcing the law.

And there's nothing to adjudicate. The 9th Circuit already heard
arguments about the law (see the *Flores* decision) and they found that
*both accompanied and unaccompanied minors* are subject to the 20 day
restriction on incarceration.

What we had in the past was several administrations who flagrantly and
unconstitutionally disregarded the law and simply didn't enforce it.
What they did instead is to release the illegal immigrant and the child
*into the country* and telling them to come back for their immigration
hearing. Guess how many of them did that.

What we have *now* is a president who is determined to enforce the law
despite the cost.

**Neither approach is ideal, in my opinion.**
