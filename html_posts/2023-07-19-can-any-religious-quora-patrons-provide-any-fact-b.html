If that's what God wanted, He'd have His name in big flashing lights in
the sky and everyone would see it and no one would be dumb enough to
ignore Him.

But presuming that God exists, and He doesn't make His presence
*blaringly known*, then there clearly is a reason.

That reason: **free will**.

So if you're looking for that "smoking gun" that ***unequivocally,
beyond a shadow of a doubt, proves that God exists***, you're simply not
going to find it. Because if that existed, you'd be forced to love Him
because the evidence would be so overwhelming that it would overwhelm
our free will and eliminate any ability to reject Him.

But He only wants those who freely accept Him.
