This vote would be a perfect opportunity for any enterprising Senator to
play to his or her base and virtue signal like there\'s no tomorrow.

Why? Because even if they do pass a joint resolution to end the national
emergency, Trump will veto it, and Congress would need a 2/3 majority in
both Houses to override it.

They may get enough votes to pass a joint resolution, but they do not
have a veto-proof majority. So it\'s perfectly safe to pass a resolution
and play to your home crowd.

Nothing is going to change.
