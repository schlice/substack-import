**Content:** [Because it\'s in vogue these days to blame all bad black
outcomes on race. Everyone from the president on down is doing it.\
\
No one has open, honest conversations about what causes bad black
behavior. No one even admits that there is such a thing. It\'s
tantamount to racism to even admit something such as that, especially if
you\'re white.\
\
Plus, there are entire industries in the United States that capitalize
on racism, such as the NAACP, an organization which has made its
business monetizing white guilt. They have a vested interest in keeping
the narrative of \"racism\" causing all bad black outcomes going. They
even convince blacks that want to talk about the real issues that they
are nothing more than sell-outs.\
\
Some blacks even believe that other blacks who actually want to discuss
these issues are racist against blacks, which by definition, is
impossible (racism, by definition, is a state which believes that your
race is better than another race; since the two races in question are
the same, racism does not apply). They blame blacks talking about the
real issues on everything from \"groupthink\" to brainwashing by the
white community.\
\
C\'mon, people! When are you going to wake up and actually start to
address the real issues?\
\
For example, ***why do blacks commit a disproportionate amount of
crime?***\
\
Blacks make up about 14% of the population of the United States, yet
they commit more than half the violent crime in this country. The black
population of state prisons (where 90% of our prisoners are) is 37.5%.
37% of those prisoners are there because of violent crimes, not drugs.
Why is that? Why do blacks commit proportionately more crime than their
proportion of the population? If they committed a proportionate amount
of crime, then only 14% of violent crimes would be committed by blacks,
yet it\'s more than 50%. Why? Could it be because of social norms in
black society? Could it be that there is a culture that rejects good
behavior? Or is it all \"racism?\" Is it ol\' whitey keepin\' the black
man down, and all he can do is fight back? Is there some pockets of that
still around? Of course there is, and as long as people are people, it
will always exist. But is the leading cause? Is it the driving factor?\
\
If it were the leading factor, then racism would have to be far more
prevalent in society than it is. As it is, we don\'t tolerate racism
when we find it. Very few racist people actually exist out in the open.
When they are discovered, they are ostracized and marginalized. So is it
really so big a problem that it would drive these violent outcomes?\
\
The leading cause of death for young black men is homicide, and in 90%
of cases, the shooter is another young black man. How is racism part of
those stories? There\'s no other race involved in 90% of these cases.\
\
One narrative being bandied around is that racist cops are out there
killing blacks for no good reason. Except that it\'s not true. Cops are
six times more likely to be shot by a black man than the other way
around. Cops aren\'t even involved in 98% of black shootings.\
\
As I already said, racism exists. There will always be those who are
driven by a fear and hatred of things they don\'t understand or can\'t
appreciate. But to claim that it is the leading factor in all bad black
outcomes is to deny the evidence that is plainly there: there is a
\"learned helplessness\" that pervades the black culture that says that
all bad black outcomes are based on race, and that the black man is
continually and constantly being hounded by race issues, and that his
only recourse is violence. Is that really the truth, or is that the
story we tell ourselves to justify our behavior?\
\
If you have **constructive** points to share, please feel free. But
please don\'t call me a cracker racist, or try to insult me or shame or
guilt me. It won\'t work, so don\'t bother. Please limit your responses
to the question, and to the points raised.\
\
Again, just so we\'re clear: if your comment has merit, I\'ll respond.
If I don\'t respond\...you know why.]{.rendered_qtext}
