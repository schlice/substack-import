**How influential was the Columbine shooting in relation to today\'s
ever increasing mass shootings?**

Really? That's like asking, "How influential was Orville and Wilbur
Wright's flight at Kitty Hawk in relation to today's ever increasing
aviation industry?"

The answer is **someone is always the pioneer**. Someone has to be the
first to do something.

But in order for others to do it, someone has to be first, and then
*others have to hear about that first person, and believe that what they
did was a good idea that should be furthered.*

Columbine was a watershed moment for a lot of things. It changed
policing tactics and created entire new doctrines on active shooters
(look up "code red active shooter protocol" on YouTube sometime for more
information). It changed how we deal with bullying and the
disenfranchised in primary school.

But it also created a *movement* that others could rally behind. And
this movement has *martyrs,* which makes it akin to a *religious*
movement, which means that some people will follow it with religious
zeal. This, of course, was fueled by the 24/7 coverage of the event for
weeks following the shooting.

Columbine was the first, and the biggest, school shooting. Its founders
are martyrs to some, which means that some will follow that example like
a religion.
