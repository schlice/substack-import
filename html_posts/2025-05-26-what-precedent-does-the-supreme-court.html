Since none of the answers thus far are technically correct, let me help
clarify something very important. The SCOTUS delivered an ***unsigned
opinion***. This fact is ***VERY IMPORTANT***.

***UNSIGNED OPINIONS DO NOT SET PRECEDENT. This 4--4 vote SETS NO
PRECEDENT AT ALL.***

There was no reasoning. There was no research. There was no history.
There was no basis provided. The only information given: the Justices
voted, and they split 4--4 as Justice Barrett had recused herself.
That's all we know.

No precent was set. Precedent cannot be set on unsigned opinions. This
means that religious groups can bring these cases again if they choose,
and this decision ***CANNOT*** be used as nationwide case law.

The only place religious charter schools cannot be established, based on
this case, is Oklahoma, as the only ruling which carries precedent is
the one from the Oklahoma Supreme Court. Religious groups in 49 other
states still have standing to bring suit if they wish.
