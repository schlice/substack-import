Simple. No new women will be assigned to those frontline combat units.
The women currently in those positions will serve out their time and
rotate out, and will not be replaced by women.

However, if Hegseth was smart, instead of closing the door altogether to
women in frontline combat roles, he'd make the military adopt uniform
physical standards for all frontline combat roles, not just for
specialized units. While there currently are physical standards in the
military services, they are separate standards for men and women.

Frontline combat roles should have **ONE uniform** **physical standard**
for everyone, men and women included. Speciaized units already have
this. In the Army, Ranger school has one standard. The Special Forces
Qualification Course (SFQC) is one standard. In the Navy, BUD/S has one
standard. Women are welcome (and are even encouraged) to apply. There is
a female liaison officer attached to BUD/S to specifically serve women
applicants, but to date, no woman has ever successfully completed BUD/S.
And while only 143 women have ever completed the Ranger Assessment and
Selection Program, or RASP, and wear the Ranger tab, most are not
serving in deployed Ranger units. A few have been deployed during the
Global War on Terror (GWOT). In 2020, a woman passed SFQC and likely
served in ODA (Operational Detachment-Alpha). Women do successfully
serve in frontline combat roles when they can pass the physical
qualifications.

Frontline combat roles should be treated exactly the same way we treat
our specialized units.

Women are not the problem. Standards are.
