As with all legal answers, the answer is "it depends." And as always,
this is not intended to be legal advice, this is just general
information that anyone can find from insightful use of Google. If you
want legal advice, talk to a lawyer. Seems like common sense, but I have
to put it out there.

Just the simple fact that you are "inside your home" doesn't necessarily
alleviate you of liability. Some states are very strict when it comes to
indecent exposure. Illinois has some very strict rules around this.

Colorado...slightly less so.

Colorado's indecent exposure and public indecency laws center around
*lewd behavior*, not just simple exposure. From the statute (C.R.S.
18--7--301 and 302):

> ***Public Indecency***: When a person, in a public place in view of
> others, does any of the following:
>
> - Has sex
> - Exposes one\'s intimate parts except for genitals (i.e. the anus,
>   perineum, pubes, or breasts) in a lewd manner, if done to arouse a
>   sexual desire in anyone
> - Fondles or caresses another\'s body in a lewd manner
> - Knowingly exposes one\'s genitals to another person in a way likely
>   to alarm or offend the person
>
> ***Indecent Exposure***: When a person does any of the following:
>
> - Knowingly exposes one\'s genitals in view of another in a way likely
>   to cause alarm or offend with the intent to arouse or to satisfy the
>   sexual desires of anyone
> - Knowingly masturbates (real or simulated touching or rubbing one\'s
>   genitals or pubic area for sexual gratification whether covered or
>   exposed) in view of others in a manner likely to alarm or offend
>   them[\[1\]](#FczHa){#cite-FczHa .citation_link}

You can be naked in public in Colorado. What you ***cannot*** do is
expose yourself in a lewd manner, or in a way which would be deemed to
arouse sexual desire in anyone. Clearly from the statute, this is
different from simply being in a state of undress.

I think if you're in your home, you should at least try to avoid issues
by staying away from uncovered windows and maybe closing the blinds so
as not to cause issues. But legally, you have to be doing something
lewd, or exposing yourself in a lewd manner, in order to be eligible to
be charged under this statute.
