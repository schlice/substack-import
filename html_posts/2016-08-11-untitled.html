In order for this to be confirmation bias, I would have to be ignoring
the copious amount of news stories that *don't* claim that Trump was
alleging that Second Amendment supporters take radical action against
Hillary. I can produce many links to mainstream media stories showing
exactly what I am talking about. Can you produce the overwhelming
majority of links to stories that *don't* say this? Can you produce
*any* mainstream media stories at all? Maybe one or two, but to be
confirmation bias, I would have to be consciously ignoring the many many
news stories that go counter to my belief.

It's just not true.

So it's just not confirmation bias.

Thanks, we're done here.
