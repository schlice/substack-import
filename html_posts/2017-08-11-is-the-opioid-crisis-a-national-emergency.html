Short answer: **yes it is**.

Would it surprise you that the number of drug overdoses now outnumbers
the number of people killed by car crashes and gun homicides *combined*?

Would it surprise you to learn that 142 Americans die of drug overdoses,
**every day?**

Would it surprise you to learn that between 1999 and 2015, more than
560,000 people in this country died due to drug overdoses, a death toll
larger than the entire population of Atlanta?

Would it surprise you to know that the issue is not entirely related to
illegal drugs?

It probably would also surprise you that opioids are a prime contributor
to our addiction and overdose crisis.

- In 2015, nearly two-thirds of drug overdoses were linked to opioids
  like Percocet, OxyContin, heroin, and fentanyl, and **Americans
  consume more opioids than any other country in the world.**
- In that same year (2015), the amount of opioids prescribed in the U.S.
  was enough for every American to be medicated around the clock for
  three weeks.

It would probably also surprise you that of the 21 million people who
self-reported as having a substance use disorder, over 40% of them
*also* have a mental health disorder, **but less than half of them
receive treatment for either issue.** The reasons for these gaps include
shame and embarassment in seeking treatment, as well as lack of access
to care, and other reasons as well.

So yes, this most certainly qualifies as an epidemic. The moniker of
**national emergency** fits pretty well, as our current response to this
epidemic is nowhere near its actual magnitude.
