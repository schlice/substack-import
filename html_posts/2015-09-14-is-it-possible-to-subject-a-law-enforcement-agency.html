**Content:** [To what are you going to compare the services offered by
the police?\
\
In order to perform cost-benefit analysis, you have to put the cost of a
police force, and the benefits you receive from it, against other forms
of law enforcement. Currently, police are the only law enforcement
agents authorized to perform police activities.\
\
Since the police is the only game in town, you cannot put the police up
against any other alternatives, so CBA is not
warranted.]{.rendered_qtext}
