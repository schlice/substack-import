**Do 80% of Americans favor gun control as stated by the White House
press secretary?**

Remember the old phrase: *There's lies, damned lies, and statistics.*

So sure, 80% of Americans favor "gun control" depending on how you ask
them the question.

Most questions are related to background checks, and yes, most Americans
favor requiring background checks on all gun transfers. When asked just
this question, they usually respond yes.

It's easy to say "yes, I want that" but it's less easy to understand
*how* you go about implementing that (which is difficult), and *how to
pay for it* (as it will be very expensive).

So while we may "want" that, it certainly doesn't mean we want to do
everything possible in order to pay for it. And no universal background
check system has ever been implemented in a way in which anyone would
refer to as "smart." They simply state that **all gun transfers require
a background check, period.** But what does that functionally mean? If I
want to gift a gun to my wife, I have to get a background check done on
her. If I want to buy my 18 year old son a plinking rifle, I have to get
a background check on him. Laws in the four states which have them have
been reported to have no better than a 5% compliance rate because of how
unworkable they are in practice.

And are we really catching any criminals here? Are we really preventing
gun crime? Or are we really inconveniencing lawful gun owners more than
stopping crime?

And ***absolutely none of that has anything to do with what we really
feel about "gun control," whatever that means.***

So it's easy to distort statistics to make them say whatever you want.
