Hi
[[Rebecca](https://www.quora.com/profile/Rebecca-Felipe-Silva)]{.qlink_container},
thanks for asking!

Yes, there are indeed exchange programs. Under Title 10 of the United
States Code, USAFA can have 60 international students enrolled at any
one time. To that end, USAFA admits 15 international students every
year.

International students must meet the same standards as American
students, but the admissions process is a little different. For example:

- You will have to take the SAT or ACT and score acceptably well on it.
- You will need a nomination from your country. Nominations are
  processed through the Defense Attach√© Office (DAO) at the American
  Embassy in your country. Contact that office in order to get more
  details about processing a nomination in your country.

Working with the DAO at your country's US Embassy will be critical. And
the sooner, the better: your completed application must be received by
December 14th the year before you plan on entering USAFA. The process
should commence at least one year before you plan on entering. That
means if you want to enter in the class of 2024, you will need to start
planning now.

You should reference the [[USAFA Admissions website for international
students](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=f1f440&url=https://www.academyadmissions.com/admissions/advice-to-applicants/international-students/){.external_link

Good luck!
