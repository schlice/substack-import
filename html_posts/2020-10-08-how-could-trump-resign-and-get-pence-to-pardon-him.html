**How could Trump resign and get Pence to pardon him like people are
suggesting, if he has not been formally charged of any crimes yet? Can
Pence write a blanket pardon for any crimes Trump may have committed?**

Clearly, the people who are telling you this are *presuming* that Trump
committed a serious crime, is aware that he has done so, and is just
waiting until they catch up with him.

A presidential pardon can cover "unspecified crimes" over a period of
time. Gerald Ford pardoned Richard Nixon in this way after he resigned.
So people are looking at that bit of history and are saying that if
Trump did something serious, he should resign and allow Pence to pardon
him. In that way, he couldn't be prosecuted under Federal law.

*(Clearly, and it should go without saying, these people are actually
less interested in protecting Trump from Federal prosecution, and are
more interested in Trump resigning. Sounds like the frenzied hysteria of
a Never Trumper.)*

However, pardons are only at the Federal level. Trump could still be
prosecuted at the state level (and New York has shown that it is
completely willing to prosecute him).

Also, if it is shown that Pence engages in a corrupt bargain or bribery
in the pardoning of Trump, he could be impeached and removed from office
himself for that action. Remember, pardons are criminal, impeachments
are political.
