**Content:** [You\'re right, in most cases, you\'ll be able to go about
your day without ever needing your permit.\
\
But then that begs the question: why are you carrying a gun in the first
place? Is it like a pendant that you keep inside your shirt? Only you
know it\'s there? You\'ll never show it to anyone? No one will see it
unless they see you remove your shirt?\
\
If, on the other hand, you carry a gun because you are preparing for the
worst, being ready in case you may need it, then you may run into
trouble. Because once you do use it, or even take it out (brandish it),
you now face your own investigation into why you had concealed a weapon
in the first place. You will be investigated each and every time you
brandish and/or use your weapon, even if you were completely legal in
your action. Even if you potentially stopped a mass shooting with your
weapon, you would still face weapons charges for unlawfully concealing a
weapon. The only way you *might* avoid prosecution is if public opinion
was so far in your favor that the DA declined to press charges. Other
than that, if you ever hope to actually ***use*** your weapon for more
than just a lump in your waistband, in doing so, you subject yourself to
prosecution.\
\
It\'s a hollow victory when you save your life or the life of another,
only to be prosecuted on weapons charges.]{.rendered_qtext}
