Civilians can indeed be summoned before a military court-martial, if the
court determines that the civilian is a material witness and is subject
to the jurisdiction of the United States (foreign nationals can
participate with the approval of their host nation). Generally, that
summons is performed through a subpoena. A subpoena is the normal tool
used to bring a witness to trial. The subpoena is not necessary if the
witness attends voluntarily.

If a civilian witness refuses to appear at a court-martial to which he
has been subpoenaed, a warrant of attachment may be necessary to compel
the witness to appear. It may be issued only when you have probable
cause that the witness was actually served with a properly issued
subpoena, that fees and mileage were paid to the witness, that the
witness is material, that the witness refused or willingly neglected to
appear at the time and place specified on the subpoena, and that no
valid excuse is given for the witness' failure to appear. The warrant is
attached to the subpoena and any supporting documents, and is delivered
to the U.S. Marshals Service, who will take the witness into custody,
and present the witness to the court.

Civilian witnesses can be held in contempt of court should they refuse
to testify. The witness will be held by the Marshals Service until such
time as the person decides to cooperate.

There are likely reasons that a civilian would not want to testify, such
as the testimony might be self-incriminating. Remember that you retain
all of your Constitutional rights in a military court-martial. Granted,
you don't have Article 31 rights because you're not subject to the UCMJ,
but you do have 5th Amendment rights to not incriminate yourself. You
should work with the military counsel who subpoenaed you to secure
"testimonial immunity" so that you can testify without risking being
arrested for what you testified about. But once you get "testimonial
immunity," you have to testify.

Civilian witnesses have the same fears about testifying in a
court-martial that they would in a civilian court, so all of the same
remedies apply in a court-martial where you have been called to testify.
