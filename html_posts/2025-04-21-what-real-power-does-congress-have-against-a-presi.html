Congress always retains the power of impeachment if they believe that
"high crimes and misdemeanors" have been committed.

But no government agency has any power over any other agency simply
"doing their job poorly." Testing boundaries would be considered doing
your job, just doing it badly. It's not a crime.

**The correct way to resolve this Constitutionally is to not re-elect
that person.**

In the original design of the government, the President wasn't even
directly elected by the people. This is why we have the Electoral
College. The President is merely the head of the Executive branch, not a
representative office. In the original design, it was Congress that had
the power. Congress was supposed to be the strongest branch of
government, as they contained the direct representatives of the people.

The Representatives in the House were supposed to be directly elected by
the people every two years. In this way, the current thinking of the
population would always be present in Washington. The House was supposed
to represent "the hot passions of the day." That's literally why it was
called the "House of Representatives" because those are the people who
directly represent citizens.

The Senate was never supposed to be directly elected by the people. The
Senate was supposed to be appointed by the states, to represent the
interests of the state. The Senate was the "deliberative body," and
Senators had longer terms than Representatives in the House. Thus,
Congress was a delicate balance between the interests of the people and
the needs of the states.

That is until the 17th Amendment introduced direct election of Senators
and everything changed. Career politicians and the 17th Amendment ruined
the Congress. Congress began insulating themselves from anything that
could directly tie any accountability to themselves, so they built a
massive bureaucracy to actually run the government. They also delegated
a great deal of authority to the President, making that office far more
important that it was ever designed to be.

This isn't just an issue of "one rogue President testing boundaries."
This is a systemic issue which has been shaping up this way for decades.
If I were king for a day, I'd reset the government to the way it was
supposed to be, before we started putting our hands in it and mucking it
all about.
