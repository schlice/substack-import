**Would you feel safe in a country where everybody would have openly
carrying a firearm in public?**

So you said "everybody" would be open carrying. Therefore, this includes
you. So you already feel comfortable around firearms, because you open
carry as well. You did say "everybody," not "almost everyone," or
"anyone who wants to," you said "everybody."

Therefore, the sight of other people open carrying should also be no big
deal to you.

In fact, you'd probably be more likely to call out someone who is
carrying *improperly*, like in a holster not designed for the firearm in
it, or someone with an open thumb break, or someone using no holster at
all (i.e. waistbanding).

You'll have far fewer interpersonal confrontations in public (i.e.
people will be nicer). No one will be overly argumentative. People will
not be coerced into action. They can only be persuaded through
discussion. Force will be off the table because force will be equal
between any two people. Therefore, society becomes more polite. Crimes
against the person plummet precipitously.

Mass shootings virtually disappear, as they are stopped instantaneously.

So would I feel safe?

Absolutely.
