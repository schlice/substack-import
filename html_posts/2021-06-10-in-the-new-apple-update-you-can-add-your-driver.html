Not yet, but perhaps at some time in the future, you may. The question
is not one of whether or not the digital representation is your actual
license. The question is whether or not the state or a business will
accept it as a form of identification, and whether or not the police can
use it to say that you possess a valid driver's license on your person,
and those are a matter of state law.

Apple is following the "if you build it, they will come" philosophy of
placing the technology first, and allowing states to certify it.

Many states are already in the process of beta testing "digital driver's
licenses" through a dedicated state app. So while the addition to
Apple's digital wallet may be a good step, and one that states can
capitalize on, it does not automatically mean that you can add your
license to your Apple wallet today and expect it to be accepted when you
get pulled over.

**TL;DR: It's up to your state to certify the technology before they
will accept it in lieu of your physical license.**

Original question:

In the new Apple update, you can add your driver's license to your Apple
wallet which is digital. Can you show that to the police if you get
pulled over?
