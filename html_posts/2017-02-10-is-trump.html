***(PLEASE NOTE: This answer is in relation to President Trump's first
term.)***

The Executive Order on immigration is an order in three parts:

- A 90-day suspension on immigration from seven terrorist-riddled
  nations
- A 120-day suspension on refugees
- An indefinite suspension on refugees from Syria

There is also another piece to the order which says that once the bans
are lifted, persons who are of "minority religions" in their country of
origin who are escaping religious persecution may get priority in their
refugee status.

The Constitution gives the President the power to control foreign
relations. The Congress gave the President the power to determine who
gets to come into the country, refugee, immigrant and non-immigrant, and
to use any characteristic or grouping to do it, be it religion,
nationality, country of origin, etc. This was signed into law in 1952.

However, there are a few laws which at least one part of the executive
order may run afoul of. The strongest argument opponents have against
the order:

1.  The immigration order for the seven terrorist nations may violate a
    1965 federal statute which says that "No person shall receive any
    preference or priority or be discriminated against in the issuance
    of an immigrant visa because of nationality, place of birth, or
    place of residence." The 1965 law tightens the controls on the
    issuance of visas and says that discrimination based on nationality
    in the issuance of visas is illegal. So clearly, the 90-day
    suspension on immigrant visas from seven countries violates the 1965
    law, and will likely be struck down. As an aside, the Obama
    administration's ruling regarding these same seven countries only
    attached if you "visited" one of those countries before attempting
    to immigrate, which bypassed the 1965 prohibitions.

There are some Constitutional arguments surrounding the other two
provisions, but they are weaker and whether or not the courts uphold
those suspensions is questionable:

1.  At least two states are suing on the basis of a violation of the Due
    Process clause of the 14th Amendment, saying that the green card
    holders outside of the United States did not receive their due
    process before being denied re-entry into the country.\
    \
    However, the court has said that immigrants who are not citizens or
    green card holders have due process rights, **if and only if** they
    are physically present in the United States. If you are outside of
    the United States, and you are not a citizen, you do not
    automatically have the right to re-enter the United States at any
    time, so this argument is a bit shaky Constitutionally. The order
    therefore only applied to immigrants and green card holders outside
    the United States. Green card holders inside the United States still
    had due process rights.
2.  The second argument says that the "minority religion" clause
    violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment of the
    Constitution. The argument centers around the belief that the
    "minority religion" clause would favor Christians over other
    religions. The same argument also applies because the opponents
    believe that this is a "Muslim ban," a view partly caused by a
    mischaracterization of the seven countries as "predominantly Muslim"
    or "mostly Muslim," which is not why the countries were chosen in
    the first place. Trump's own statements may play against him here,
    as he has said on the campaign trail that he would institute a
    Muslim ban until we could sort out our immigration issues, and he
    also told a group of Christians that he intended to prioritize
    Christian refugees.\
    \
    The only reason that this may not be an issue is because, while it
    is true that he made those statements, the Justice Department has
    long held that what legislators or executives say about the
    motivations behind a law are not controlling. The courts are only
    responsible for determining whether or not a law, as it is written,
    is constitutional. The court does not make assumptions or
    speculations about the motivations behind a law. If the law has an
    otherwise bona fide purpose, courts tend to go with that. It is true
    that Trump may have held that view on the campaign trail, but courts
    do not use words spoken on the campaign trail as material evidence
    to reverse laws written while president. Even if Trump held this
    view at the time he ordered the law written, his team could still
    have come back with a law that is neutral of any specific religion,
    and as it is currently written, it is. And it is wholly true that in
    a majority non-Muslim nation, Muslims could be the minority
    religion, and could be persecuted for their Muslim religion, and
    under these criteria, they may be given priority.\
    \
    And we absolutely have the right to do that. By definition, a
    refugee is someone who is fleeing his country of origin and cannot
    return because of fear of persecution on the basis of religion (as
    well as other factors). So determining whether or not a person is a
    refugee includes determining whether or not they are actually in
    fear of being persecuted. Someone of minority religious status in
    their country of origin may rightly fear persecution.

It is entirely possible that the courts could strike down the first part
of the order (the immigration ban from the seven terrorist nations), but
may still leave the refugee suspensions in place, as well as the
minority religion clause.
