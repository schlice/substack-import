**If you could change the wording of the Second Amendment, how would you
change it?**

Understanding the differences between the English language at the time
the Constitution was written and today, I would either re-word the
prefatory clause, or remove it altogether.

So it would either say,

**Because a fully-functioning people's militia is necessary to preserve
the Union in time of war, as well as all other lawful reasons to have
them, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be
infringed.**

Or it would just say

**The right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be
infringed.**
