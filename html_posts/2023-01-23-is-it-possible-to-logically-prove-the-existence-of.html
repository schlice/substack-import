Of course it is!

Remember what you're asking though, you said "science." I hope you're
not thinking test tubes and experiments, because science is much more
than that.

Science is, at its core, a search for causes. In fact, Francis Bacon
(the father of modern science) said, "True knowledge is knowledge by
causes."

In order to prove that a creator God exists, we have to start by asking
the right question, using scientific principles to examine the evidence,
leading us to a right conclusion (or cause). And in this case, the right
question to ask first is:

**Why do we have something rather than nothing at all?**

In other words, how did you and everything around you get here? The
argument for God can be presented very simply:

- Something exists.
- You do not get something from nothing.
- Therefore, a necessary and eternal Being exists which caused something
  to exist.

You cannot deny you exist because you have to exist in order to deny
your own existence (which is self-defeating), so the first premise above
is true. Descartes said "I think, therefore I am." No one has ever
demonstrated that something can come from nothing unless they redefine
what 'nothing' is, so the second premise rings true. Self-creation is an
analytically false statement, because you would have to exist before you
existed in order to create yourself. Therefore, the conclusion naturally
follows---an eternal Being is responsible for everything that exists.

*This is a position no thinking atheist denies*; they just claim that
the universe is that eternal being. However, the problem with that
stance is that all scientific evidence points to the fact that the
universe had a beginning (the "Big Bang"). And everything that has a
beginning must have a cause; therefore, the universe had a cause and is
not eternal. This thought is the foundation of the Cosmological
Argument:

- Everything that had a beginning had a cause.
- The universe had a beginning.
- Therefore the universe had a cause.

Because the only two sources of eternality are an eternal universe
(denied by all current empirical evidence) or an eternal Creator, the
only logical conclusion is that God exists.
