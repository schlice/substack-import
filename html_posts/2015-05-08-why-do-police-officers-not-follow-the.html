**Content:** [[[Tim
Dees](https://www.quora.com/profile/Tim-Dees)]{.qlink_container} has a
great answer. He is right, this happens everywhere.\
\
I have seen it famously happen in the military. As told to me by a
former aircraft maintenance tech, he would be taught how to work on a
particular avionics component by first reading through the \"Dash 1\",
or the official maintenance manual. Once they did it \"by the book,\"
the supervisor would set the book aside and say, \"Okay, now here\'s how
we *really* do it,\" and the unapproved method would undoubtedly be
twice as fast, three times as simple, didn\'t make the component unsafe,
and was one of those head-scratchers, as in \"why doesn\'t the book have
you do it this way?\"\
\
In all things, I think, there is \"the way it is,\" and \"the way it
ought to be.\"\
\
I will disagree that police are more prone to this than others; police
not following the rules can, at best, get a charge dropped because
evidentiary procedures were not followed, or, at worst, get someone
killed. Tim pointed out a few ways cops \"don\'t follow the rules,\" but
I would say that the consequences for cops not following the rules are
much greater than someone not following the exact maintenance procedure
in the book. And someone will likely notice a cop not following the
rules, so I think today\'s ubiquitous cameras-everywhere society will
make it harder and harder for cops to step out of line at
all.]{.rendered_qtext}
