**Content:** [I\'m going to see if I can come up with a thoughtful
answer.\

I\'m not going to tell you to leave. I know leaving your country is
hard, and becoming a citizen of a new country is very, very hard. It\'s
a long, slow process. But it\'s avoidable, I think.\

is both wrong and right. You don\'t have to love your country, but
patriotism and nationalism are not inherently irrational. Extreme
nationalism is irrational, but loving your country (both its concept and
its ideals) is not. You may not love your country, but you should learn
to be happy living there. And there are a few ways you can do that.\
\
**Understand your anger.** It\'s not the country itself that you hate;
there has to be something about your country that you hate. Learn what
it is, and fully grasp the concept you don\'t like.\
\
**Work to change it.** No one lives in a vacuum. Everyone can have some
influence in making the world a better place. Even you, in your country,
can work to influence change.\
\
Unless you happen to live in a country that is Communist or
Totalitarian, you have the power to influence people and effect
change.]{.rendered_qtext}
