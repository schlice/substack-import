Easy.

*Define "protecting abortion rights."*

Does that mean "100% unfettered access to abortions throughout all nine
months of pregnancy"? Because that's what Democrats were asking for when
they tried to pass Federal abortion rights legislation. And most
Republicans do not support abortion for this length of time. In fact,
most Americans don't support abortion for this length of time.

Does that mean "Abortions restricted to the first 15 weeks of
pregnancy"? Because most Americans across the political spectrum
actually want that. Support for abortion past 15 weeks drops off
dramatically.

Even moderate pro-life Republicans support some level of abortion, just
limited to the first 15 weeks of pregnancy. In fact, 90% of all
abortions occur during the first 15 weeks of pregnancy. Therefore, this
is a fairly "centrist" position on abortion.
