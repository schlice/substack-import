So first of all, this comparison comes from the Gaza Media Office, so
you should already take it with a grain of salt.

That office reported on January 4th, 2024, that Israel had dropped
explosives with a *total weight* across everything dropped of over
65,000 tons, which "is more than the weight and power of three nuclear
bomb dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima (during World War II).\"
Since the comparison to Hiroshima was intended to be inflammatory rather
than informative, it can be pretty much ignored.

Besides, it's a false comparison. Totaling up the weight of all the
bombs across an entire campaign and comparing it to a single bomb
dropped on one city is a pointless comparison designed only to inflame
readers.

Next, they claimed that about \"two-thirds of the bombs and missiles
\... are unguided and imprecise, commonly known as dumb bombs.\" They
claimed that the use of such bombs indicates \"the deliberate targeting
of indiscriminate and unjustified killing by the occupation, a clear and
explicit violation of international law and various international
conventions.\"

Understand what they're trying to tell you here: the use of conventional
munitions violates international law and "various international
conventions."

It's interesting because the United Nations Office for Disarmament
Affairs actually has a Convention on "Certain Conventional Weapons,"
which is actually the shortened title for "The Convention on
Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons
Which May Be Deemed to Be Excessively Injurious or to Have
Indiscriminate Effects." Aha! This is exactly what Hamas is talking
about!

Except it doesn't ban dumb bombs.

There are four main categories of weapons considered to be excessively
injurious or to have indiscriminate effects:

- Protocol I: Prohibits the use of weapons that employ fragments not
  detectable in the human body by X-ray
- Protocol II: Regulates the use of landmines, booby-traps and similar
  devices
- Protocol III: Limits the use of incendiary weapons
- Protocol IV: Prohibits the use of laser weapons specifically designed
  to cause permanent blindness

As you can see, conventional munitions are not called out as a type of
weapon which produces "excessive injury or which have indiscriminate
effects."

Okay, but can't traditional, conventional weapons be used in a way which
causes "excessive injury" or used "indiscriminately?" Yes they can, but
this isn't what the Gaza Media Office is alleging. They are alleging
that the use of dumb bombs is violative of international treaties, and
clearly it is not. Regardless, let's be generous and look at whether or
not Israel's use of conventional bombs is "excessive" or
"indiscriminate." Even in late December, US President Joe Biden accused
Israel of using "indiscriminate" bombing. But is it really true?

Believe it or not, Politico summed up the truth:

The IDF is a professional fighting force. They use extensive planning to
minimize civilian casualties and achieve the greatest military
successes. Hamas is also keenly aware that they have no chance of
defeating Israel on the battlefield. For them, "shaping public opinion
in Israel, around the world and especially in America is their strongest
weapon --- and the West's greatest vulnerability. Losing a battalion of
the al-Qassim Brigade is a small price to pay for Hamas if worldwide
media can film the prisoners surrendering, stripped naked and
humiliated." This is why Hamas is so aggressive in using human shields
and deploying weapons in homes and hospitals. Every IDF military victory
they can paint as a human rights travesty (which is eagerly and blindly
accepted by Western media) is a "win" for Hamas.

In other words, Hamas' only hope of victory is in the court of public
opinion, delivered through half-truths and outright subterfuge.
