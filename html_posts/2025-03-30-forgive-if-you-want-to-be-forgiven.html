"Forgive if you want to be forgiven" is a re-telling of the Golden Rule:
"Do unto others as you would have them do unto you." It's actually in
the Bible:

> *"So whatever you wish that others would do to you, do also to them,
> for this is the Law and the Prophets. \-- Matthew 7:12 ESV*

One of the key points we need to understand about forgiveness is that
the real issue is not so much between you and the other person. **It's
between you and God.** As you can see in Matthew 7:12, God commands us
to forgive. Jesus reiterates this when Peter asks Him about forgiveness:

> *Then Peter came up and said to him, "Lord, how often will my brother
> sin against me, and I forgive him? As many as seven times?" Jesus said
> to him, "I do not say to you seven times, but seventy-seven times. \--
> Matthew 18:21--22 ESV*

So when we forgive, we are following God's command.

But, as you pointed out, what about being able to bring your worship to
church if someone has something against us?

- If you have offended that person, yes you should go to them, ask for
  forgiveness, and put things right, **as far as you are able**. *But
  your forgiveness is not contingent upon their acceptance of your
  apology.* Because as we just showed, forgiveness is between you and
  God, not you and the other person.
- But if someone has offended you, don't go to them. Go to God. Your
  need to forgive others is first and foremost an issue between you and
  God. That actually makes sense if you stop and think about it. Your
  forgiveness cannot be dependent on someone else, otherwise it wouldn't
  be guaranteed.

And after you have forgiven them, they may not accept it. And in this
case, they may not be sorry, or they may not admit any wrongdoing.
Whether or not they do is not up to you. But regardless, you forgiving
them removes Satan's ability to use that issue against you.

How do you move on? You forgive. And if you're still feeling pain, their
hook is still in you. You haven't removed it yet, you haven't forgiven
them. You haven't let them "off the hook." But you might be thinking,
"But you don't know what they did to me! You don't know how much they
hurt me!" ***Don't you see that by leaving that hook in you, they're
still hurting you?***

So how do you stop the pain? Remove the hook! **You need to forgive
them.** If you are still feeling the affects of that offense, you have
not forgiven them. Yes, forgiving them lets them off the hook. If you
choose to not forgive them, you stay hooked to that pain. Maybe you
choose to not forgive them because when you do, you know that you are
letting them off the hook, and you feel like they are getting away with
it. But if you *don't*, you are the one with the hook still in you. You
will continue to feel the pain of that hook until you remove it.

But here is the beautiful part: ***while you may let them off of your
hook, you don't let them off of God's hook.***

> *Beloved, never avenge yourselves, but leave it to the wrath of God,
> for it is written, "Vengeance is mine, I will repay, says the Lord."
> \-- Romans 12:19 ESV*

Vengeance is mine. I will repay, says God. You don't have to worry about
letting them off the hook, because God has promised that He will not let
them off of **His** hook. So it's time to truly forgive them, knowing
that in the fullness of time, God will judge them for what they have
done, and they will receive the due penalty for hurting you. When you
choose to forgive, you are taking a step of faith to trust God to be the
judge who will weigh what has been done on the scales of justice and
demand that the scales balance. Everyone who has sinned against you will
have to stand before the throne of God and explain themselves. And the
scales can only be balanced in one of two ways: the blood of Christ for
those who believe in Him, or that person will have to pay the penalty
themselves if they do not. "I will repay, says the Lord." God will
balance the scales. We have to choose to trust His promise.

Now it's time to hand over all of that pain and those demands for
justice and vengeance to Him. He has promised to repay. You can walk
free of that pain, safe in the knowledge of God's promise.
