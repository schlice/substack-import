It is Congress' job to write laws. This means that both Houses of
Congress (the House of Representatives and the Senate) must agree on a
bill before it can be sent to the President to become law.

There is no *requirement* for the Senate to act on every bill sent to
them by the House. Similarly, the Senate can propose legislation, and
there is no *requirement* for the House to take up that legislation.

But if there is currently a deficit in processing bills between the
houses, it is in the Senate. There are literally *hundreds of bills*
which are awaiting action by the Senate, but because of its current
level of dysfunction, it is simply not getting bills passed.

At some point, some serious rules changes will need to take place in the
Senate to get moving on some of this legislation.
