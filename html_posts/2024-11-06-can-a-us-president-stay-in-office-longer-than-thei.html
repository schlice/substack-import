No.

Everyone is here saying yes he can, but he cannot. Once his term is
over, he *de facto* has no more authority. He's a **former** president.
He cannot stay "in office" (meaning, still as President) longer than the
end of his term. Once his successor is sworn in, *he is no longer
President*. So he can't "hang on" to Presidential power because the
Constitution requires that the office of the President change to the
duly-elected, newly sworn-in President-Elect.

So at that moment, the previous President automatically becomes the
*former* President. He can't do anything to "stay in office." And that
process does not require his consent. It happens whether he likes it or
not.

Now, can he "stay in the *physical* office?" Sure, for a little while.
He can refuse to leave the *physical* office. But the Secret Service and
the Capitol Police may have something to say about a civilian remaining
in the White House after being ordered to leave. And that's just a bad
look for a former President.

Even when parties change, former presidents are at least cordial to
their replacements. I love the letter that George W. Bush left for
Obama:

**Dear Barack,**

**Congratulations on becoming our President. You have just begun a
fantastic chapter in your life.**

**Very few have had the honor of knowing the responsibility you now
feel. Very few know the excitement of the moment and the challenges you
will face.**

**There will be trying moments. The critics will rage. Your "friends"
will disappoint you. But, you will have an Almighty God to comfort you,
a family who loves you, and a country that is pulling for you, including
me. No matter what comes, you will be inspired by the character and
compassion of the people you now lead.**

**God bless you.**

**Sincerely,**

**GW**

And Bill Clinton's letter to George Bush is similarly gushing:

**Dear George,**

**Today you embark on the greatest venture, with the greatest honor,
that can come to an American citizen.**

**Like me, you are especially fortunate to lead our country in a time of
profound and largely positive change, when old questions, not just about
the role of government, but about the very nature of our nation, must be
answered anew.**

**You lead a proud, decent, good people. And from this day you are
President of all of us. I salute you and wish you success and much
happiness.**

**The burdens you now shoulder are great but often exaggerated. The
sheer joy of doing what you believe is right is inexpressible.**

**My prayers are with you and your family. Godspeed.**

**Sincerely,\
Bill**

*This* is what a cordial transition of power looks like. We can only
pray that the men (and hopefully soon, women) who hold this office will
forever follow suit.
