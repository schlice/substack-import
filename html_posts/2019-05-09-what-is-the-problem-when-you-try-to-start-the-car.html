**What is the problem when you try to start the car and you hear rapid
fire clicking and the battery has already been charged?**

The battery either can't hold a charge, or the battery hasn't been
charged *enough*.

Jump-start the car from another running car. Then drive down to your
local auto parts store and have the battery tested.
