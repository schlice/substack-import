**What would you do if you believe your significant other has a mental
illness but refuses to seek help?**

***NOTE: This is a tough answer to read, and it's even tougher to
suggest. But sometimes, tough love is exactly what is needed. I could
have used some tough love about ten years ago, and I didn't get it. I
nearly destroyed my family and myself because I didn't. Hopefully you
read and understand this in the context in which it was intended.***

*If the person will not help themselves, be prepared to help yourself.*

Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that you abandon your SO because they
won't seek help. Far from it. You should still do everything you can to
get them the help they need.

But

Current laws in the United States do not provide a mechanism to get
someone the help they may need, but refuse to get on their own,
**unless** they become a danger to themselves or to other people. That's
a fairly high bar to cross.

*If this does happen*, be prepared to call 911 to get that assistance.
Police officers and emergency room physicians can involuntarily commit a
person to 48 or 72 hour psychiatric holds (depending on your state), if
they feel it is necessary to assess the mental state of a patient, if
they become a danger to themselves or others.

*Short of this* (which is fairly extreme by any measure), what can you
do?

The answer: nothing.

You can do nothing to convince someone to get the help they need if they
choose not to (and they're not a danger to themselves or to others).

So in that scenario, the only thing you can do is to take care of
yourself. Be prepared to do what you need to do in order to take care of
yourself and your family members. Move out if you must. But if it comes
down to your own quality of life and your family's quality of life, you
may have to make the hard choice and leave if it becomes necessary. Your
safety and your family's safety is related to the first part, but you
must also be concerned with your own quality of life and that which you
may be providing for your children.

Let me leave you with some personal experience to answer the next
question: *your SO may not feel like he/she needs help*. I can attest to
this from personal experience. I needed help, but I couldn't see it. It
was only through what others told me that I realized that I was being
negatively affected by a particular combination of medications (even
though everything felt perfectly normal to me), and I needed to make a
change. I did it for their sakes, even though I didn't feel like I
needed to. It is true that sometimes, the chemical imbalance that drives
our mood isn't something we can personally sense. We may feel perfectly
normal, but others see our mood change, sometimes drastically.

Sometimes, it's up to us to emphatically say that they need help, even
if they can't tell themselves. And if they won't do what's necessary to
help themselves, it's up to us to do what's necessary to help
*ourselves*, and our families.
