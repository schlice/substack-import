**Content:** [Maybe its because I come from a different mindset that I
don\'t understand the question. Those of us who wear, or wore, the
uniform, have all at one point had to come to grips with the possibility
that they were going to carry out their sworn duty. This goes for the
military and the police as well. We all know when the uniform gets put
on that we may have to make that ultimate decision.\
\
This is not something that just comes up because of a contingency. We
have to be ready for this kind of thing all the time, so there should be
no surprises.\
\
Doesn\'t make the prospect any easier.\

The military is the \"barking dog on a leash\". Loosing the leash will
not change the demeanor of the dog; he\'s going to attack with the same
ferocity that he was attempting to do while on the leash. The military
is always either in war or preparing for war. That\'s our job. So
contingency or not, we have to be ready to make those decisions when our
country requires us to do so.]{.rendered_qtext}
