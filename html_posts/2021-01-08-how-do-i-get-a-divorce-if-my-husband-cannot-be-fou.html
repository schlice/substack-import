**How do I get a divorce when I don\'t know where my husband is?**

As with all legal answers, this one depends on where you live.

In the US. when you file for divorce, you have to serve your spouse with
the divorce papers. Generally you have a specific period of time to do
this. If you can't find your spouse, you can ask the court for an Order
of Notice by Publication. This allows you to serve your spouse by
running your notice of intent to divorce in the local newspaper in the
last known area where your spouse was.

You will probably have to file an affidavit of marshal service attesting
to the publication, and the publicized notice will also have to be
filed. Depending on your jurisdiction, you may also have to file an
affidavit of military service showing that your spouse is not in the
military and that you are trying to divorce him while he is deployed.

Keep records of everything. Keep records of everything you tried to do
to contact your spouse, and the responses. If you sent letters to his
last known address and they were returned, keep those too.

You can still divorce your spouse if you can't find him. The court can
perform all of the divorce proceedings without him, but you must show
that you have tried to locate him, and that you tried to get the notice
of divorce to him.

Engaging a qualified divorce attorney in your jurisdiction is strongly
encouraged.
