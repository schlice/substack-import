To reliably root your phone, you need to use a computer and Samsung\'s
software loading tool called "Odin."

There are sites that claim to be able to load a kernel to your phone
without a computer, but they are sketchy at best, and virus laden at
worst.

Once you are rooted, you can flash kernels to your phone from the phone
itself. But without root, the only way to do this reliably is with a
computer. Find a friend with a PC if you must, but that first root needs
a PC.

You should look into PingPongRoot which will avoid tripping Knox. If you
don\'t know what that is or why it\'s important, perhaps you should look
into why you want to root in the first place.
