As an *anyone,* atheist or otherwise, the answer is **never.** No one
consumes the blood of Christ.

*But, but, but, at the Last Supper, Jesus said take and drink for this
is the cup of my blood!*

However:

1.  **There is no indication that He meant that literally.** In fact, He
    says that the words He was speaking were spiritual words: "It is the
    Spirit who gives life; the flesh profits nothing; the words that I
    have spoken to you are spirit and are life," (John 6:63).
2.  **The elements were still referred to as bread and wine.** After
    Jesus said, "This is my blood," (Matt. 26:28), he said, "But I say
    to you, I will not drink of this fruit of the vine from now on until
    that day when I drink it new with you in My Fathers kingdom," (Matt.
    26:29). Why would Jesus speak figuratively of His blood as "the
    fruit of the vine" if it was his literal blood?\
    \
    We read the same thing in Paul's first letter to the Corinthians:
    "For I received from the Lord what I also delivered to you, that the
    Lord Jesus on the night when he was betrayed took bread, and when he
    had given thanks, he broke it, and said, "This is my body, which is
    for you. Do this in remembrance of me." In the same way also he took
    the cup, after supper, saying, "This cup is the new covenant in my
    blood. Do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of me." For
    as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the
    Lord\'s death until he comes.\
    "Whoever, therefore, eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in
    an unworthy manner will be guilty concerning the body and blood of
    the Lord. Let a person examine himself, then, and so eat of the
    bread and drink of the cup" (1 Cor 11:23--28 ESV). Why would Paul
    refer to the elements as "the bread and the cup" and simply *relate
    them to Jesus' broken body and shed blood* if they were Jesus'
    actual body and blood?
3.  **There is no indication that the disciples worshipped the
    elements.** While the practice exists in the Catholic mass, there is
    no indication that the disciples did the same. There's also no
    indication that the disciples, seated right there with Jesus,
    thought that the bread He was holding was actually His body, or that
    the cup He was holding actually contained His blood.
4.  **The Supper was instituted** ***before*** **Jesus died.** The Last
    Supper happened on the night before He was crucified. Are we to
    conclude that at the Last Supper, when they were all at the table,
    that when Jesus broke the bread, it actually became His sacrificial
    body, *even though the sacrifice had not yet happened?* And are we
    to conclude that the cup of wine became His actual sacrificial
    blood, *even though the sacrifice had not yet happened?*
5.  **It is a violation of the Hypostatic Union and the**
    ***Communicatio Idiomatum***. In what we call the "hypostatic
    union," Jesus became both *fully human* and *fully divine*. He is
    not 50% human and 50% God. He is fully 100% human and 100% God at
    the same time. And in what we call the "communicatio idiomatum," the
    divine does not influence the human, and the human does not limit
    the divine. So if Jesus was fully human, how then could His body
    literally be in every church everywhere in the world? To say that
    Jesus in His physical form is in more than one place at a time is to
    deny the incarnation. That is, it denies that Jesus is completely
    and totally a man -- since a man can only be in one place at one
    time.

So while we eat bread and drink wine or juice in remembrance of Jesus'
broken body and shed blood, and every time we do it we thus remember, we
do not actually eat Jesus' actual body, or drink Jesus' actual blood.

There's nothing special in the eating or drinking. There's something
special in the *remembering* and the *worshipping.*
