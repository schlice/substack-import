**How receptive do you think the Supreme Court majority in the census
case will be to any executive action or other efforts to circumvent the
decision when the citizenship question appears before the Court again?**

*If* the question appears before the Court again, they still won't care
about minutiae like that.

Because SCOTUS, like they said the first time, is in the business of
judging Constitutionality of laws.

This is the reason they kicked it back to the lower courts this time:
there were still questions of law which had not been answered. Since
it's not in SCOTUS' job description to answer questions of law, they
kicked the case back to the lower courts to hash out.

This means that the case is still in progress. No final decision has yet
been made except for the lower courts removing the citizenship question
from the census.
