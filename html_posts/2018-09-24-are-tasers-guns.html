**Are tasers guns?**

The answer it it depends on what state you're in.

In the vast majority of states, Tasers are considered to be personal
protection devices, and are not classified as firearms. Some states do
classify them in the same categories as firearms and control their use
similarly, but most states do not.

Be sure to check the state laws where you live before you purchase a
Taser. [[This quick

makes the Taser, should be a good starting point.

Technically speaking, Tasers use compressed gas to propel their darts,
so they are not classified as "firearms" which use gunpowder and primer.
