**If I do not qualify for the Pre Candidate Questionnaire for the Air
Force Academy, does that mean I am disqualified from applying or can I
still attempt to apply?**

In order to complete the Pre Candidate Questionnaire, you need the
following information:

- **Full legal name, birth date and Social Security number**
- **Mailing address, home phone and email address**
- **High school name, class size**
- **Class rank and grade point average (on a weighted 4.0 scale)**
- **\*One or more test scores: PSAT, PreACT, SAT and/or ACT**

I don't know which one of these you don't have, but let's just assume
for a moment that it's the standardized test, since that's the most
common one that candidates are missing. You must submit a standardized
test score in order to submit the Pre Candidate Questionnaire.

Unfortunately, if you have not taken the SAT, ACT, PSAT, or PreACT, you
cannot apply for the Air Force Academy. However, it's really easy to
take them. Just search "take the PSAT" in Google and you'll get all the
information you need to take it. You need to take one of those tests and
you need to have a competitive score in order to be accepted.
