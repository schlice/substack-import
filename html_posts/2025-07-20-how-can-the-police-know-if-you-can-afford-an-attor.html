They don't, and honestly, they don't really care.

If you show up in court for your arraignment and the judge asks you if
you can afford an attorney and you say "no," the court will go through a
process which has different names in different states, but are broadly
referred to as "indigency investigations" or "indigency hearings."

An indigency hearing, sometimes called an indigence determination or
indigence evaluation, is a process where a court assesses a defendant\'s
financial situation to see if they qualify for state-funded legal aid.
While commonly associated with criminal cases, indigency hearings can
also be relevant in civil matters, such as family law cases or when
seeking to appeal a court decision.

The Sixth Amendment guarantees the right to counsel for those charged
with a crime, but this right is often extended to civil cases as well.
If a defendant cannot afford an attorney, the court must provide one.
However, before the court will give out state-funded legal aid, the
defendant typically needs to demonstrate to the court that they lack the
financial resources to hire a private attorney. This may involve
completing a form detailing their income, assets, and expenses.

If the court finds the defendant "indigent," they will appoint a public
defender or other court-appointed attorney to represent them in the
legal case. The defendant may also be excused from paying certain court
fees.

Courts may consider various factors when determining indigency,
including income, assets (like savings, property, or other valuables),
outstanding debts, and the number of dependents.
