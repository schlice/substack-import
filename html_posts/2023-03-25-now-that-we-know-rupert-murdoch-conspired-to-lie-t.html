We don't know anything of the sort.

At best, we know that Murdoch knew that some of his on-air talent was
making claims that Dominion voting machines had altered votes, and he
didn't stop it. But "conspiracy to lie" isn't a crime.

But the release of the evidence today in preparation for trial also airs
some dirty Dominion laundry, too.

"Dominion has been caught red-handed using more distortions and
misinformation in their PR campaign to smear Fox News and trample on
free speech and freedom of the press," the company said in a statement
Tuesday, complaining that "to twist and even misattribute quotes to the
highest levels of our company is truly beyond the pale."

Will anyone be losing their "press passes" over this? Hardly. Fox,
better than any other legacy media, differentiates its news content from
its opinion content, and all of the on-air talent who made the
statements were opinion anchors, not news correspondents.
