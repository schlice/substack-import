**Is it legal for the US military in defending the US Constitution to
arrest and arrange for trial (civilian or military) for treason elected
officials who have passed laws that violate the Constitution?**

Wow.

1.  Treason is a specific crime which can only be committed during a
    time of war by giving aid and comfort to the enemy.
2.  The agency which addresses laws which violate the Constitution is
    the court, not the police or the military.
3.  Passing an unconstitutional law is not a crime. It may indicate a
    lack of ability as a legislator and may warrant that legislator not
    being re-elected, but passing a law which violates the Constitution
    is not a crime.
4.  Even if it was illegal, the military cannot enforce laws. They
    defend the country; they do not police the country.
