**Can prison guards actually lock you naked in a concrete strip cell as
punishment?**

Not in the United States. The Constitution (most of it, anyway) still
applies to those incarcerated, and the Eighth Amendment verbatim enjoins
the government from imposing "cruel and unusual punishment."

[[The 8th Amendment of the U.S.
Constitution](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=2e1714&url=https://constitutioncenter.org/interactive-constitution/amendments/amendment-viii){.external_link

To be more specific, a punishment is considered "cruel and unusual" if
it is "cruel in comparison with longstanding practices of the time." So
if locking you naked in a concrete strip cell is demonstrably more harsh
than existing punishments for the same offense, then it could reasonably
be considered cruel and unusual.
