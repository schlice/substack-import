**Content:** [No, most cops are not on a power trip.\
\
Some cops do act this way, it\'s true. Some cops are jerks. Some grocery
store clerks are jerks. Some garbage collectors are jerks. There\'s
jerks everywhere in society, and since police come from society,
sometimes police are jerks.\
\
Some cops think like they\'re God\'s Gift to Law Enforcement. News
flash: they\'re not. This sometimes happens with younger officers, less
so with older veterans. And generally it takes a few incidents to knock
them down a peg or two.\
\
If a police officer is ever abusive to you, or is rude or arrogant,
please take the time to go down to the station and report that officer.
You may not be able to prove your report, but 20 \"unprovable\" reports
still says something to a supervisor. If you don\'t take the time to
report inappropriate conduct, who will?]{.rendered_qtext}
