**What legal recourse do I have if my HOA says that my Airbnb in my home
where I live is considered commercial propery?**

The only recourse you have is to hire a real estate attorney in your
area. Make sure you hire a real estate attorney and that they specialize
in HOA litigation in your area, as laws surrounding HOA authority vary
wildly. While the legislature in most places gives broad authority to
HOAs, the judiciary in most places applies the most narrow construction
to HOA rulings that they can possibly get away with, so it's definitely
not a futile act.

As was already pointed out, it may actually end up being cheaper to sell
your existing home and to buy a home in an area not so tightly
controlled.
