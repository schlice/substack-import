<h2>Answer Comment</h2>

**Content:** [As for ignorance, what do you know that I don\'t? It\'s
likely that I know all the same information that you do; I\'m a pretty
knowledgeable person if I do say so myself. Is there some
earth-shattering knowledge that you possess that I do not?\
\
I would venture to say that there is not. I would also venture to say
that you and I have looked over the totality of the information and have
come to different conclusions. This is because humans have free will and
can make decisions. The basis of the decisions we make will determine
the outcome of that decision-making process. If you choose to only use
the scientific (and the current limits of scientific knowledge) you will
only reach one logical conclusion: God does not exist. I choose to not
limit my knowledge to the extent of human scientific endeavor, as there
is still much that scientists (admittedly) do not know. I choose to
include God\'s inspired word to guide my thoughts and actions in the way
He wants me to be. I determine that through my own introspection
following the reading and understanding of His word.]{.rendered_qtext}
