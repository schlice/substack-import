Sin is sin. All of us are sinners. We have all sinned and have fallen
short of the glory of God. We must all repent of our sins and turn
towards the grace of a loving God.

On the last day, when we all stand and face the throne of judgement, God
will judge us all the same way, regardless of our sin:

- Did we acknowledge our sin? Did we acknowledge what we did was wrong?
- Did we humbly ask God for forgiveness?
- Did we turn away from our sin?
- Did we accept Christ as our Lord and Savior?

That's it. If we've done those things, then Christ's sacrifice on the
cross redeems us. His sacrifice covers our sins. He took the punishment
we deserve so that we can be reunited with God. **Christ redeems us.**

So if you haven't repented of your sin, what are you waiting for? You
don't know when your last day will be. Only He knows. The time to look
inside and search your heart for the sin that convicts us is now.

And if you ***don't know*** the sin that is separating you from Him,
*ask Him to show you.* Don't be surprised if you're confronted with the
most awful movie you've ever seen, starring you (by the way, I did this,
and I already don't like scary movies, but this one was *awful*, because
I was the star. This was what separated me from God, and I did this and
God saved me). Yes it's awful, but watch it. Once you do it, you can
tell God you're sorry for all of that and you can humbly ask Him for
forgiveness.

What you **must** know is that *if you do this, with a contrite heart,*
*the answer to that prayer will NEVER be* ***no****.* God is infinitely
loving and is infinitely forgiving **when you ask**.

But it requires you to take the first step and ask for forgiveness.
