**Content:** [If your ultimate goal is to be part of NCIS, you have a
few options.\
\
As [[Al
Saibini](https://www.quora.com/profile/Al-Saibini)]{.qlink_container}
already told you, NCIS is mostly civilians. There really isn\'t a need
to have military members staff that organization, as it operates outside
of typical military channels (to maintain objectivity, this is
necessary). It reports up through the Director of NCIS, directly to the
Secretary of the Navy.\
\
You can get that real-world police experience in civilian law
enforcement. You can absolutely go to college, join a police department,
serve there for a few years, and if you\'re still interested, apply for
NCIS.\
\
You can also get that real-world experience in the military, which
allows you to combine some of your efforts. The military has a few
advantages here, as Al also mentioned. If you enlist, you can use your
GI Bill benefits to put you through college while you serve. If you
enlist in the Navy, you may be able to work somewhere in NCIS while
you\'re active duty, which would only bolster your chances of making it
in as an investigator.\
\
If you decide to enlist in the Air Force, you can be assigned as an Air
Force Office of Special Investigations (OSI) agent while on Active Duty.
The bulk of AFOSI agents are active duty. The second largest group of
AFOSI agents is civilians, just as in NCIS. AFOSI agents train at the
Federal Law Enforcement Training Center in Quantico,
VA.]{.rendered_qtext}
