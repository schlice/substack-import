**What is the best phone you have used that works with your tablet so
the phone itself just has the basics and your tablet is your primary
device?**

The answer is the BlackBerry, and BlackBerry's tablet, the BlackBerry
PlayBook.

The PlayBook and the BlackBerry device have proprietary software called
"BlackBerry Bridge." The whole idea was that your BlackBerry device
would simply use the security infrastructure already set up in the
phone, and just act as an extension of the phone.

The BlackBerry can be secured in an infrastructure called *BlackBerry
Enterprise Server (BES)*. This allowed corporations to control
*hundreds* of different settings on your device, making it exactly as
secure as they needed it to be, in order to conform with their security
requirements. In turn, the BES server was attached inside the corporate
network, allowing the BlackBerry to access intranet content, fully
encrypted and secured, from anywhere.

Remember that at the time, this was revolutionary. Other manufacturers
(Apple, Android) had *mobile device management* (MDM) setups, but none
were so comprehensive and end-to-end as BlackBerry's setup. Corporations
relied on BlackBerry for this, and it wasn't until MDM (as provided by
third parties) got good enough that corporations started allowing
employees to switch to Apple or Android offerings that they could then
secure properly.

Because of the necessity to secure the tablet in the same way that the
phone is secured, the PlayBook employed BlackBerry Bridge to connect to
the phone, and indirectly, it made using the PlayBook a seamless
extension to using the phone itself. Your email and other corporate apps
ran natively on the PlayBook, and the connectivity was directly through
the phone.

To date, there is no "tethering" solution that is as seamless or as
complete as what BlackBerry offers.
