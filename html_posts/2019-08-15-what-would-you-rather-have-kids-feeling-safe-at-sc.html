**What would you rather have: kids feeling safe at school or allow
anyone to buy a gun?**

You have committed the logical fallacy of the [[false
dilemma](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=7bb497&url=https://www.logicallyfallacious.com/tools/lp/Bo/LogicalFallacies/94/False-Dilemma){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="logicallyfallacious.com"}]{.qlink_container}.

Why is this a logical fallacy? You have presented the two choices as if
they were the only two choices available: **either** kids feel safe at
school **or** anyone can buy a gun, and you can only pick one.

However, this is not true at all. An entire spectrum of choices exists
here; there are far more than just two choices. Anyone *except for
violent felons or the mentally ill* can purchase guns, and kids can feel
safe at school *while still being vigilant and watching out for suspect
behavior*. There are far more choices here than you let on.

And that's why this is a terrible comparison.
