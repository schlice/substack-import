The short answer is that cops can't park "illegally."

Police vehicles are considered "emergency vehicles" in most states'
vehicle and traffic laws. This means that the traffic law doesn't apply
to them. A police car can't pull over another police car and charge him
with speeding. A police car technically can't be in excess of the speed
limit, because the speed limit technically does not apply to police
officers. Granted, there are always department policies that limit what
an officer can and cannot do with a police cruiser , but a police
vehicle cannot operate illegally as far as the law is concerned.

But like [[Christopher
Finch](https://www.quora.com/profile/Christopher-Finch-5)]{.qlink_container}
said, police officers often have to curtail their stops quickly and head
out to other emergency calls, so having their vehicle close by (which
sometimes means parking against a red curb, or on a sidewalk, or
someplace that you think might be otherwise illegal) is imperative.

Also, that cruiser is their office. It has all of their emergency
supplies, their police computer, and it is the temporary holding "cell"
for people being placed under arrest. It needs to be as close as
possible.
