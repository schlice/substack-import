**What is the actual process I need to follow if I\'m involved in a
non-injury auto accident? If my vehicle is drive-able, do I have to wait
for police? Do most insurance companies require a police report?**

The answer, as with all legal answers, is "it depends."

The rules vary by state.

The *easiest* way to determine what you have to do in a non-injury
accident:

1.  **DO THIS FIRST, WHILE STILL AT THE SCENE:** *Call your local
    non-emergency number (not 911)*, and follow their directions. Tell
    them no one is injured and the vehicles are driveable. The
    dispatchers will be more than happy to direct you on what to do,
    plus the call (and the fact that you did call) is recorded. If the
    vehicles are driveable, they will likely tell you to move out of
    traffic. If the police are required to be dispatched to your
    location, the dispatcher will handle that as well.\
    \
    Stay on the phone with your local dispatcher until they tell you
    that you can hang up.
2.  Once you hang up with the dispatcher, *call your insurance company.*
    Many insurance companies offer an app which will step you through
    what is required, what information to provide to the other driver,
    when you can leave, etc. The app will usually allow you to take
    photos of the damage as well, which also helps begin the claims
    process.
