The exact reason *Roe* was overturned was because it was built on a
faulty premise.

*Roe* was the case which established the precedent that there is a
Constitutional right to abortion. The Court examined *Roe*'s reasoning
and found that the Constitutional right which *Roe* claimed existed
really doesn't exist. Therefore, if there is no Constitutional right to
abortion, *Roe*'s legal foundations are gone. *Roe* (and *Casey*, which
mostly referenced the precedent of *Roe*) was overruled, and the power
to control abortion was returned to the states and to the people
respectively.

As for rape and incest, their presence or absence has absolutely nothing
to do with whether or not abortion is a Constitutional right. The only
thing that *Dobbs* decided was that abortion is not a Constitutional
right. The states can decide whether or not (and if so, when) abortion
will be allowed. Some states completely permit abortion with no
restrictions. Ohio just recently added a right to abortion into their
state constitution. Some states restrict abortion after a certain number
of weeks, but allow it in the case of rape or incest, or to save the
life of the mother. Some states completely restrict abortion, including
in the case of rape or incest. It comes down to the will of the people
in those states.
