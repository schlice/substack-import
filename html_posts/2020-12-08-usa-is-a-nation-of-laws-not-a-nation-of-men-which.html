**USA is a nation of laws, not a nation of men which meaning laws, not
people, rule. Everyone is to be governed by the same laws. If this is
true, why a pardon to convicted felons is consistent with a \'nation of
laws\'? Are we a nation of laws or men?**

The pardon power, which is part of the Constitution, was instituted to
provide a final protection of individual liberty against an overzealous
government. It was borne out of the great fear and distrust the founders
had of organized government becoming too powerful.

Presidential pardons are primarily designed to "temper justice with
mercy." They are designed, and have historically been used, to right
perceived injustice and to provide mercy in the face of uncaring
justice.

However, the idea that we are no longer a nation of laws because we have
a safety valve against overzealous prosecution is untrue. Today, even
though the President has the final say, pardons are reviewed by the
Office of Pardons, an office in the Department of Justice. In most
cases, before a pardon would be considered, you must be convicted or
released for at least five years.
