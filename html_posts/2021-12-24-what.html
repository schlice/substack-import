***Can*** we compare COVID-19 to the Spanish Flu? Sure we can. We can do
anything.

***Is it a worthwhile comparison?*** Well, that's for the reader to
decide.

In terms of the number of people killed, they are (today) about the
same. However:

- The population of the US was about 1/3 of what it is today, so that
  same number was much more significant than it is today. In other
  words, Spanish Flu still killed more people when we *normalize the two
  populations* by deaths per 100,000 instead of total deaths.
- The mean age of those who died from Spanish Flu was 28, whereas the
  mean age of those who died of COVID-19 was 78.
  - However, with modern medicines, we live much longer than they did,
    so if we didn't have the same population of elderly folks, would
    COVID have been as deadly as it was?

Speaking of modern medicine, we have tremendous interventions today
which did not exist in 1918. Therefore, we have no real idea what would
have happened in the COVID-19 case without any intervention whatsoever.

So while it's probably not a great comparison, you can make it.
