If your tenant is in violation of the law and you've already given your
tenant the opportunity to fix the situation, start the eviction process.

Oh, she threatened you, did she? I don't even recognize threats. People
are going to be upset that you called them out on their shit and they
can't put your reputation in jeopardy because they refuse to follow
state law.

Make sure you have your ducks in a row and file for eviction.

and she threatened me. She isn't supposed to live in an attic according
