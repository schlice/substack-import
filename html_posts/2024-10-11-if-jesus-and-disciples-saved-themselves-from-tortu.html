So a "savior" is a person who saves you from torture? Okay, let's say
this savior saves you from torture. You live a nice, comfortable life.
*But what happens when you die?*

Jesus saves us from **eternal** torment, not **earthly** torment. Jesus
saves and redeems your *soul*, not your *body.*

He even tells us that we **will** have trouble in this life.

> I have said these things to you, that in me you may have peace. In the
> world you will have tribulation. But take heart; I have overcome the
> world. --- John 16:33 ESV

There will be tough times in this world. *But Jesus overcame this
world.*

> So if the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed. \-- John 8:36
> ESV

Jesus doesn't promise you an easy life. Jesus promises you a ***glorious
eternity.***
