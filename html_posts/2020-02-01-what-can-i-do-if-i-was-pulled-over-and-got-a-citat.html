**What can I do if I was pulled over and got a citation for something I
didn\'t do? I was driving normally when suddenly a cop pulled me over
and told me I didn\'t stop at a stop sign. However, there was no stop
sign at all.**

Don't pay the ticket. Instead, go to court and argue that there was no
stop sign. Your ticket should have a court date, so go argue your case
to the judge.

Show photos of the road proving there was no sign. Make the state prove
you ran a sign and make them show you where it was and that it wasn't
obscured.
