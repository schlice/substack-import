In theory, pepper spray is nothing more than the oil from hot peppers
and propylene glycol (a food additive that helps to make the oil into an
aerosol), so in theory, you should be able to add it to your food.
However, the concentrations and the flavor are all wrong, so I wouldn't
advise doing this. Check YouTube for some Darwin Award nominees and
probably a few winners who have attempted this.

In practice, pepper spray is only useful for self-defense.
