First of all, as with all legal questions, there is not "one" answer.
Since vaccination requirements for schools are administered at the state
level, it is different for every state. There are broad categories of
exemptions available, however.

**Medical.** All 50 states have legislation requiring certain vaccines
for students. Although exemptions vary from state to state, all school
immunization laws grant exemptions to children for medical reasons.
Doctors write notes of medical exemption, which means that there is a
medical reason your child cannot receive the vaccine. If your doctor
would not give you a medical exemption, it is because your child is not
medically excluded from vaccination.

**Religious.** There are 44 states and Washington D.C. that grant
religious exemptions for people who have religious objections to
immunizations.

**Philosophical.** Currently, 15 states allow philosophical exemptions
for children whose parents object to immunizations because of personal,
moral or other beliefs.[\[1\]](#bzjUa){#cite-bzjUa .citation_link}

Check with your state's department of education to see what exemptions
are available and what you must do to apply for them.

You said you refuse to get him vaccinated since it doesn't work. That's
not a reason to not be vaccinated. That may be a reason to believe the
vaccine is pointless, but it's not a reason to not do it. If it doesn't
work, then there's no harm in getting him vaccinated, even though you
know it's not going to do anything. It may be a waste of your time, but
it's what the school requires, so if you want him to attend public
school in your state, you'll need to get him the vaccinations.

Original question:

My son\'s doctor refuses to write my son a letter of vaccination
exemption for school, how can I force our school district to let him
attend because I, his parent, refuse to get him vaccinated since it
doesn\'t work?
