Since we do not know the cause of MS, we also similarly don't have a
cure either. There is no effective cure, there is no functional cure,
there is only mitigation of MS symptoms.

The approved MS medications slow down the disease progression and reduce
the severity and duration of MS relapses. They do not "cure" MS.
