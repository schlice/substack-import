Sorry, you misunderstood me.

I never said that the 2nd Amendment was considered or even interpreted
as a letter of marque. I said that letters of marque are specifically
authorized by the Constitution.

*I assume you\'ve heard of letters of marque? These are authorized in
the Constitution, and they were issued to* ***private individuals***
*who happened to own warships.*

One of the enumerated powers of Congress in the Constitution (Article 1
Section 8) is to grant letters of marque and reprisal, along with the
power to tax and declare war.

The point was that in certain contexts, private citizens could act in
military operations or what would normally be considered the job of a
military.
