In the US, there is no paperwork required for someone to be able to
drive your car. If you give them permission, they can do so, and so long
as they hold a valid driver's license for that type of vehicle, they are
even covered by your car insurance¹.

However, if the driver does not have a valid driver's license, or if the
driver does not have permission to drive your car, your car insurance
will likely not cover any accidents or damage.

¹ Your mileage may vary (no pun intended). Most insurance companies do
cover drivers who you have authorized and who have valid licenses. But
there are some exceptions: for example, if the vehicle is being used for
business, your personal auto policy won't cover accidents.
