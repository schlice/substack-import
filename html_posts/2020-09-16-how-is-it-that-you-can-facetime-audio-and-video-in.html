Apple cleverly obfuscates the fact that FaceTime uses a different method
to communicate than cellular calls.

Cellular telephone calls ride on the Public Switched Telephone Network
(PSTN) after they arrive at a receiving station and are transferred to a
landline. PSTN is also colloquially called POTS (Plain Ol' Telephone
Service). Placing a call on the PSTN is more expensive because it relies
on interconnected switching telephone networks which have been in place
since the 1800's.

(Incidentally, there is an industry effort underway to replace the old
DC switched PSTN network with an x86-based network much closer in design
to the Internet.)

Because these switched networks are all independently and privately
owned (usually by governments), there are fees to access it.
Longer-distance calls incur more fees.

In contrast, the Internet was created in such a way that the only fees
to you are assessed at the point of entry into the network (i.e. your
Internet Service Provider). You are not charged interconnect fees based
on where your packets are routed. Your packets can go anywhere in the
world for one low price!

FaceTime calls ride on the Internet, while cellular telephone calls use
the PSTN. This is why there is a difference in fees.
