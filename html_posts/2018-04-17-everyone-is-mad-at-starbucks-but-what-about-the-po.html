**Everyone is mad at Starbucks, but what about the police? Did procedure
actually require an arrest? Couldn\'t they have just said, \"Get lost\"?
How, and why, did it end in handcuffs?**

In case you didn't know, the police don't just wander around looking for
random people to arrest.

The only reason they were present at that Starbuck's was because the
manager called them and reported two people trespassing.

The scenario played out like this:

- Two men sitting in a Starbuck's, not ordering anything, not using the
  Wi-Fi, etc. Just taking up space for paying customers.
- Manager asks them to order something or leave. They refuse.
- Manager calls the police and reports two men trespassing (refusing to
  leave).
- Police arrive. Police request the two leave voluntarily (in other
  words, police told them to "get lost.") They again refuse.
- Police forcibly remove the violators from the premises, and they each
  receive a shiny new pair of silver bracelets for their trouble.

Remember: Starbuck's is not public property. Starbuck's is a **private
establishment which is open to the public.** Owners (or owners'
representatives) can ask patrons to leave at any time for any
non-protected reason. In this case, the two didn't order anything and
were simply taking up prime real estate reserved for paying customers.
You can stay in Starbuck's to use the Wi-Fi for as long as you like, but
generally they want you to buy something. It's how they make money. So
buy a cup of coffee and then stay as long as you want.

But not buying anything and not leaving is not good for business.
Managers can ask anyone to leave in such a scenario.

Once you are asked by management to leave and you refuse, *you are
trespassing*. And as in this scenario, the police can be called to
remove you from the premises when you refuse.

The police simply enforced the wishes of the store manager. Do you think
it would have been more right for the police to say, "Well, we think
you're a racist, so we're not going to enforce the law today"? This
likely would have been worse, and it's not the police's job to determine
whether or not the manager is a racist. It's the police's job to enforce
the law.

The men can sue if they think their civil rights were violated by
Starbuck's. In fact, they probably will. We'll see how that turns out.

(EDIT) I think, after re-reading the question, the OP was asking if the
police could have refused to do anything at all. Perhaps the police
could have told the manager to "get lost," is perhaps what the OP was
asking.

What you're talking about is what's known as "discretion." I could
imagine a police officer at a lunch table taking a complaint between two
diners, with one saying, "He stole my fruit cup! I want him arrested for
theft!" In that scenario, could the police arrest the thief for petty
theft? Probably not, because the dollar value is too low. More likely,
the police will ask the two to work it out instead of resorting to law
enforcement to handle all interpersonal issues. That's a simple example
of discretion in enforcement. Another example would be a police officer
issuing a warning instead of a ticket to a driver who is compliant and
respectful, who admitted his driving error, and who otherwise has a
clean driving record.

So what about this scenario? Could the police simply have refused to
enforce the law here? Couldn't they have used "discretion" and told the
manager that the charge was silly and possibly racially-motivated? The
short answer here is **no**, the police probably could not have used
discretion in this case. The reason is that *the complaint was brought
by a third party, not by the police themselves.* If you have a
complainant who is willing to press charges, the police have a duty to
complete the processing of the charge if probable cause is found that a
law was violated. The police could have tried to convince the
complainant to drop the charge, but why would they? The complainant is a
business manager who is trying to run a business. Why would the police
tell that person to not press charges? They don't want the paperwork?
There's no real valid reason for the police to attempt to tell a private
citizen that they should not seek to enforce the laws already on the
books.

In this case, the manager called the police because of trespassers
(persons who refuse to leave and refuse to buy anything). You have a
complainant pressing charges, and upon further investigation, you have
suspects who are actively refusing to comply with the directives of the
management and the directives of law enforcement. The police, in this
case, have a duty to enforce the law.
