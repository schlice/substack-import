**Content:** []{.rendered_qtext}

Because that's His preferred pronoun.

Yes, God has no physical form (so He is not a male nor a female), but He
chooses to interact with us as a "father."

When Jesus was walking the earth, He chose to interact with God as a
"father." He called God "Abba" which means "father."

He orders not only His relationship to us that way, but He expects us to
order our relationship to our family structures similarly. As God the
Father exercises headship over His family (us), so too are we to do the
same, which is why there is a patriarchy which exists in the home (when
it comes to religious leadership) and in the church (when it comes to
preaching the word of God). God's design for kingdom in general is
unfolded via the establishment of His own kingdom in Scripture. He is a
father-king, and thus the people He requires to represent His rule are
men. This is true of the greatest King on his throne over his father's
house, to the least working-class man in his beat-up recliner over his
own house (see Ephesians 3:14--15).

**TL;DR:** *Father* was His choice, not ours. That's how He chooses to
present Himself to us, because that's how He expects us to order our own
families.
