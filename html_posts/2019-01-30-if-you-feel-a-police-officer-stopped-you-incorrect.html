**If you feel a police officer stopped you incorrectly can you put them
under citizens arrest?**

This question comes up on Quora in lots of different ways, all the time.
Can you physically resist a police officer if he violated the rules? Can
you shoot a police officer who is going to use deadly force against you?

Basically, the question boils down to: *can I take action against a
police officer* ***at the scene****?*

The answer to that very specific question is ***no.***

There is no circumstance under which a police officer, acting "under
color of law," is wrong when you are being arrested. You have **ZERO**
authority to stop a police officer from arresting you.

The old saying goes, "You may beat the rap, but you can't beat the
ride." In other words, you may prevail in court, and you may get your
charges dropped, but you're still going to be arrested, and there's
nothing you can do about that.

What this means in practical terms: if a police officer is arresting
you, you cannot stop that. The reason: **determining whether or not an
officer arrested you "incorrectly" is a matter of law to be decided by a
jury**. No one else can determine whether or not an arrest is lawful.
Not you, not another police officer, not someone recording the arrest,
not a bystander on the street, not even a lawyer who happens to show up.
It is not a matter of fact to be decided by you at the scene. **ONLY A
JUDGE AND/OR A JURY CAN DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT YOUR ARREST WAS
LAWFUL.** Therefore, you must operate under the assumption that the stop
is lawful, and proceed in that way.

Yes, that's right. This means *you must allow yourself to be arrested.*

Once you are arrested, you can contact an attorney who will work with
you in order to review the arrest and the charges. If the officer acted
"incorrectly" or unlawfully, your arrest will be thrown out in court,
and you and your attorney can seek to file suit against the department
for false arrest and kidnapping if you so choose.

But at the scene? The officer is presumed to be acting lawfully, since
it's only a jury who can determine whether or not the actions are
lawful.

*You may beat the rap, but you can't beat the ride.*
