**If a woman falsely accuses someone of rape should there be strong
punishment if she really believes her version of history?**

The problem is your word choice. "Falsely" simply implies that she is
wrong.

She could be wrong because she has faulty memory (but she strongly
believes that what she remembers is the truth). Or, she could be wrong
because she is *deliberately* speaking untruths in order to harm her
alleged offender.

In the first case, she should not be punished.

In the second case, she ***should*** be punished (strongly, as you
worded it), since in today's society, the accusation carries far more
weight than the actual factual findings in a legal sense. Therefore,
accusations should never be made lightly, and they should **absolutely
never** be made maliciously, or with deliberate lies.

Deliberately lying about sexual assault *should* be a criminal charge,
not just what the civil slander laws (and its attendant penalties) can
recover.
