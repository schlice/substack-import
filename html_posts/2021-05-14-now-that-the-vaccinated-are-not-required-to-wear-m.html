Let's take these one at a time:

> **Now that the vaccinated are not required to wear masks in many
> places, will you feel safe out in public, since some unvaccinated
> people will also be maskless;**

Of course. Why? **Because I protect myself; I don't count on anyone else
to protect me**. That means that I already got my vaccine. So I don't
care if someone else has COVID; that's their problem, not mine.

Look, while it is *possible* that a vaccinated person could still
contract COVID, it's highly unlikely, and even if you do, the disease
will be far more mild than if you were unvaccinated. Sure there are
exceptions to that, but there was already a seriously low chance I was
going to get it anyway; now that I'm vaccinated, that seriously low
chance turned into an extremely low chance.

> **are those who refuse to get vaccinated or wear a mask violating our
> rights?**

What right is that, exactly? The right to not catch a virus? I missed
that in the Bill of Rights, can you show me which Constitutional
amendment says that the Federal government cannot deny you the right to
be free from viruses?

Let me save you the Constitutional lookup: **there is none**. You have
no right to be free from harm in this country. You protect **yourself**.
It is no one else's responsibility to protect you but you.

Original question:

Now that the vaccinated are not required to wear masks in many places,
will you feel safe out in public, since some unvaccinated people will
also be maskless; are those who refuse to get vaccinated or wear a mask
violating our rights?
