**What are some false or misleading statistics cited in the debate on
racial disparities in police violence?**

Where do I start?

***Police routinely shoot unarmed black suspects.***

- A recent "deadly force" study by Washington State University
  researcher Lois James found that police officers were *less* likely to
  shoot unarmed black suspects than unarmed white or Hispanic ones in
  simulated threat scenarios.
- Harvard economics professor Roland Fryer analyzed more than 1,000
  officer-involved shootings across the country. He concluded that there
  is *zero* evidence of racial bias in police shootings. In Houston, he
  found that blacks were 24 percent *less* likely than whites to be shot
  by officers even though the suspects were armed or violent.
- An analysis of the Washington Post's Police Shooting Database and of
  Federal Crime Statistics reveals that fully 12 percent of all whites
  and Hispanics who die of homicide are killed by cops. By contrast,
  only four percent of black homicide victims are killed by cops.

***Blacks make up 26 percent of police-shooting victims, but only 13
percent of the national population. Therefore, blacks are killed twice
as often as others by police.***

- Police shootings occur more frequently where officers confront armed
  or violently resisting suspects. Those suspects are disproportionately
  black.
- According to the most recent study by the Department of Justice,
  although blacks were only about 15 percent of the population in the 75
  largest counties in the US, they were charged with 62 percent of all
  robberies, 57 percent of murders and 45 percent of assaults.
- In New York City, blacks commit over three-quarters of all shootings,
  though they are only 23 percent of the city's population. Whites, by
  contrast, commit under two percent of all shootings in the city,
  though they are 34 percent of the population. New York's crime
  disparities are repeated in virtually every racially diverse city in
  America.[\[1\]](#LWfYZ){#cite-LWfYZ .citation_link}

Suffice it to say that the real problem facing inner-city black
communities today is not the police, but the criminals.
