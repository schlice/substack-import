It is not in direct conflict with the First Amendment; in fact, it is
the First Amendment that allows Trump to make such a comment.

Whether or not it is ***true*** is another thing altogether.

Whether or not Trump can be held ***liable*** for the untruth is covered
by laws against *slander*. In order to prove slander, you have to show

- The statement is false
- The slanderer knew it was false
- The statement caused demonstrable harm, either monetarily or to a
  person's reputation where that person relies on their reputation for
  their livelihood.

So:

***Is the statement false?*** The statement says, "It's frankly
disgusting the way the press is able to write whatever they want to
write, and people should look into it." This is clearly a statement of
*opinion*, not a statement alleging some fact. And indeed, the press is
allowed to write whatever they want to write, also because of the same
aforementioned First Amendment. The press is subject to laws surrounding
*libel*, which is the same thing as slander, but for printed words.

***Did it cause harm?*** People have been saying that the press writes
whatever they want for a very long time, and it does not appear to have
caused them any harm, or at least not any harm they can demonstrate came
from this opinion.

Finally, the First Amendment only protects the right of the people to
speak out against the government.

So no, there are no First Amendment violations here.
