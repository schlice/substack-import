**How does Apple stop the iPhone XR from cannibalizing sales for the
iPhone XS?**

Literally no one who was going to buy an Xs would actually stop
themselves and say, "You know what, I really wanted an Xr." That's not
the customer they're going after.

Which means you asked the wrong question.

What you *meant* to ask was "How does Apple stop the iPhone Xr from
cannibalizing sales of the ***iPhone X***"?

Easy. Give it a 331 ppi LCD display.

Wanna know the last Apple device that had a display of this resolution?
**The iPhone 4.**

But LCD 1080p displays are so cheap to put on phones. If manufacturers
like Huawei and Xiaomi can do it, why can't Apple? I mean, I can't watch
Netflix or Hulu in 1080p on a phone released in 2018? No full HD
support? What's the deal?

The deal is that **Apple is trying not to compete with itself.**

If they release a phone running iOS 12 with an A12 Bionic chip *and* a
1080p display, who's going to bother to pay an extra \$250 just to get
an OLED screen?

That's right, no one in their right minds. So once they drop the Xr, no
one will buy an X, and they're not planning on stopping production on
the X just yet, even with an Xs and an Xs Max in production.

But just as phones differentiate themselves on the *high* end, phones
have to find their niche in the *lower* end, too.

And in this case, a phone with a lower-resolution LCD screen is
definitely going to feel less premium than a higher resolution OLED
screen. This leaves the three levels of device (Xr, X, and Xs) in clear
stratas of product.

That's what they were going for, and that's why they put the lower
resolution screen on the Xr.
