**Content:** [**Legally**, conspiracy to commit (or having intent to
commit) does not rise to the same level as the actual commission of the
crime. So even if someone was killed but then it is later learned that
the victim had plans to kill someone else that day, the crimes are
unequal. Also, the victim can\'t be charged with a crime because in
order to prove an \"attempted\" murder, you would have to make more than
plans. You would have to take a \"substantial step\" towards the
commission of that crime (i.e. driving to the victim\'s house). Here
again, the murder and the attempt do not match up.\
\
Additionally, we\'re talking about defending a murder because the victim
had plans to kill others. This is not a suitable line of reasoning to
satisfy the \"self-defense/defense of others\" defense, as there was no
one in fear for their lives when the first murder happened. The victim
was not in the throes of the commission of a murder, so there are no
grounds to satisfy a self-defense/defense of others claim.\
\
**Ethically/morally**, it may help to relieve some of the burden on the
original killer to know that he may have helped to save another life
through his actions. It may help the intended victim of the first
victim, and their family, to know that they are alive because the first
killer did what he did.\

But *justification*? Nope, not at all.]{.rendered_qtext}
