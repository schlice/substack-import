Of course, there are many comparable situations not in employment.

- Schools require students to be vaccinated
- The US military actually performs the vaccination themselves, so in
  addition to requiring troops to be vaccinated, they actually provide
  them as well.

I'm sure there are more, but I can't think of them off the top of my
head.

But I must interject a specific exception when it comes to the current
(as of 10 June 2021) COVID-19 vaccines:

**They are not yet fully approved by the FDA, so they cannot be
mandatory.** The military cannot force servicemembers to take them.
Schools cannot force students to be vaccinated with the COVID-19
vaccines.

The current COVID-19 vaccines are only approved under an Emergency Use
Authorization (EUA). When Congress created EUAs, they built into that
law the **requirement** that taking any drug approved under that law
must be **voluntary.** You cannot force someone to take the vaccine;
doing so would be a violation of federal law.

Therefore, currently, employers cannot legally force employees to take
the vaccine. They also cannot legally predicate your continued
employment upon taking the vaccine because this would constitute
**retaliation** wherein the employer takes an employment action based on
an employee's failure to violate federal law.

Don't misunderstand: they can *not hire* you if you are not vaccinated,
but they cannot *fire* you for failing to take the vaccine. They can
*strongly encourage* you to get the vaccine; indeed, many employers
today are *paying* employees to get the vaccine. But they cannot
*condition your continued employment* on your vaccination status.
