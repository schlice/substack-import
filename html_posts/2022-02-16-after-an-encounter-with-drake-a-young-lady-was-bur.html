The two causes of action that she could potentially pursue would be
**battery** and **negligence**. We can review each of these to see if
she might prevail in a lawsuit.

**Battery** requires the **intentional physical harmful and/or offensive
touching** of a person that **actually** and **proximately causes** an
**injury.**

- **INTENTIONALLY HARMFUL/OFFENSIVE PHYSICAL CONTACT**: There was
  physical contact between the woman and the hot sauce, but the contact
  was not intentional. The contact (not the injury) would need to be
  intentional. Drake presumably poured hot sauce in his condom in order
  to *prevent* someone from stealing his sperm and making contact, which
  shows his intent to *avoid* contact, not *make* contact.
- **CAUSE:**
  - **ACTUAL CAUSE**: The act of placing hot sauce in his used condom
    was the cause of the injury.
  - **PROXIMATE CAUSE:** The woman could argue that the contact would be
    reasonably foreseeable because Drake did in fact contemplate this
    scenario, hence his action. But Drake could argue that it wasn\'t
    reasonably foreseeable for a woman to not realize his condom was
    filled with hot sauce, which therefore breaks the chain of proximate
    cause.
- **INJURY:** Yes, the woman was, in fact, injured.

Therefore, given the proximate cause and the lack of intention in the
contact, it does not appear that the woman would prevail on a battery
charge.

**Negligence** has four elements: proving that Drake had a **duty** of
care, proving that he **breached** that duty, and then the actual and
proximate **cause** we talked about earlier, along with the resultant
**injury**.

- **DUTY:** In most cases, duty is determined using the "reasonable
  person" standard. It would be a challenge for the woman to show that a
  reasonable duty of care includes the duty to not pour hot sauce in a
  used condom.

Without a duty of care, there is no breach. And since we already
addressed the cause elements, it looks like negligence fails as well.

**TL;DR:** I don't think she has a case she can win.

Original question:

After an encounter with Drake, a young lady was burned after trying to
impregnate herself with the contents of his condom. Drake admitted to
pouring hot sauce in the condom to kill the sperm. She wants to sue him.
Does she have a valid case?
