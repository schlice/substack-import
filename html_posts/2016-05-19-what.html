I just want to point out that the issue some states have with the
transgender policy has **absolutely positively** **zero** to do with
transgender people. No one is saying that transgender people are
predators. No one.

The issue that it raises, however, has everything to do with the OP's
point.

**What\'s to stop a man from saying \"I identify as a woman today\" and
using a women\'s bathroom?**

*Nothing.*

Additionally, the problem is not really about bathrooms. It's more about
other gender-separated facilities, like ***locker rooms*** and
***showers***.

The problem is that a blanket policy applies to everyone, not just
transgender individuals. And with no way to determine whether or not
someone is truly transgender, the policy opens the door for countless
sexual predators to have free access to the very people upon whom they
prefer to prey, in the very places they prefer to do it.

You're probably not a parent. You probably don't have daughters. But try
to imagine you did. Would you want your daughter exposed to the naked
male form when they chose to be exposed to it, or when it was forced on
them? Yes, in most cases (and in the case of transgender individuals),
it will be the unaroused male form. But for the predator, it may not be.
This could be a very traumatic experience for a girl, and under this
policy, the predator has been given the all-access pass to the
all-you-can-abuse buffet. This doesn't make the behavior any more legal
or illegal than it already is. It simply makes it easier for the
predator to do his thing. I would think we would want to reduce the
ability of predators to access their targets, not make it easier and
accepted for them to do so. Opening up shower and locker room facilities
to all genders is what I like to call *inviting trouble.*

And women already know the struggle of being viewed as sex objects
instead of as people. Allowing men into womens' showers can only make
such objectification worse. What's to say that the male in your shower
or locker room isn't a straight male who has just been given the keys to
the kingdom? I'm not so sure women would have no issues showering with
men, considering how they are looked at when they are ***not*** naked.

I can understand that the transgender person may experience hurt
feelings by only being provided individual showers/locker rooms when a
facility provides gender-separated facilities. But I would rather hurt
the feelings of the small minority than to endanger the health and
safety of the vast majority to spare those feelings.

I'm sorry if this comes off as callous or uncaring to the transgender
individual. I do not mean it to be so. But I feel very strongly that
Spock was right: "The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few."
We have an ***obligation*** to protect our women and daughters (and I
use women and daughters because overwhelmingly they are the population
which are the victims of sex assaults). Until we can come up with a way
to objectively determine whether or not someone is transgender, policies
which would throw away that safety to satisfy the feelings of a very
small few are reckless and dangerous.
