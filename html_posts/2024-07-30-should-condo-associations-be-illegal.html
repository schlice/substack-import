**No.** Condo associations should not be illegal. People should be free
to enter into any business relationship they choose, provided that the
business itself is not doing illegal things. Condo associations,
however, should be *closely monitored* and *regulated* by the state.

Condo associations, like Homeowner's Associations, are **voluntary**
associations. No one is **forced** to join a HOA or a COA. Don't want to
join the Condo Association? Don't buy that condo. Simple.

But Condo Associations, even to a greater degree than HOAs, are
*necessary*. Without them, individual condo owners face liability when
someone sues. Without them, paying for **common amenities** becomes
problematic. Without the COA, **who owns the common areas?**

With the COA, it is the COA which owns the common areas and pays for the
maintenance and upkeep. It is the COA which pays for general liability
insurance on the same common areas so that condo owners are insulated
from those legal actions. It is the COA which handles nuisances which
are below the threshold for law enforcement, but above the threshold
where it could be easily ignored. It is the COA which enforces the rules
which keep the property attractive and livable, which in turn keeps your
property values as high as possible.

You certainly don't need to join that COA. You don't need any of those
benefits. You can live without them.

And if they were universally unliked, builders wouldn't attach them
before any of the units are sold. It would be a selling point that there
is no COA. I bet some condos in some areas do, in fact, sell without
COAs, and they are marketed that way.

But as Murphy's Law will tell you, it is of course the most desirable
units in the most desirable areas of town which will be part of a COA,
because the builder wants to keep the complex attractive and highly
valued.

**Regardless, in a free country, you should ALWAYS have the choice as to
whether or not you buy into one.**
