As with everything, the answer is "it depends."

If you are 18 or older, you absolutely can contact the website claiming
to be the person in the picture and stating you do not want to be found.
The website is under no obligation to remove your picture based on your
word alone. They may go back to the poster and tell them that you
contacted them and said you don't want to be found, and **ask** them to
take the photo down. But they are under no obligation to do so. As

said, if you took the picture, it's your property and can only be used
with your permission, and you can cite copyright law (DMCA) requesting
the photo be taken down.

If you are under 18, and you haven't been legally emancipated, your
parents or legal guardians are still legally responsible for you. They
can make decisions on your behalf. If you have left home without being
emancipated and you are simply on your own, your parents/guardians still
have legal responsibility for you.
