**Would future weapons such as phasers, laser guns and disrupters be
legal under the 2nd Amendment?**

The 2nd Amendment protects the right of the people to keep and bear
*arms*.

It does not define what those arms are.

The court in *DC v. Heller* found that there is an individual right to
possess "arms," which are any weapon which can be used for a law-abiding
purpose. They also carved out *Miller* as an exception, as items like
sawed-off shotguns cannot be used for any law-abiding purpose.
Therefore, they codified the law-abiding use test for weapons, stating
that weapons which cannot be used for law-abiding purposes would not be
subjected to 2nd Amendment protection.

So the answer to the question is: *if phasers, laser guns and disruptors
(or any future weapon, for that matter) can be used for law-abiding
purposes by law-abiding citizens, then they would be afforded protection
as "arms" under the 2nd Amendment.*
