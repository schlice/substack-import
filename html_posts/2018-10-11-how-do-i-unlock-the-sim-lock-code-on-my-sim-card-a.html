**How do I unlock the SIM lock code on my SIM card and phone?**

If you get a message that states your SIM card is locked, you will need
your Personal Unlocking Key (PUK) which is unique to your SIM card. Your
carrier will have this information in their Support section on their
website. Just go to your carrier's website and search for "SIM card
lock" and you should find where you can look in your online account (if
you have one) for your PUK. Your carrier's website should also have
detailed instructions for how to unlock your SIM card.

If you need any help with this, contact your carrier's Customer Service
department directly. You can get there directly by dialing 611 on your
phone, but I recommend finding their toll-free number and dialing it
from another phone, so you can work on yours while you speak to them.

If you are talking about "carrier-locks," where your phone is locked to
your carrier, whether or not you can unlock depends on whether or not
you have paid off your phone. Once you have paid off your phone (if you
have an equipment installment plan with your carrier), your carrier will
give you information on how to unlock your phone. Once it is unlocked,
you can use any compatible SIM card from any carrier in your phone.
