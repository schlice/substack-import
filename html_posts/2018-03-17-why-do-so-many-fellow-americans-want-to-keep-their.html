**Why do so many fellow Americans want to keep their guns? In the event
a hostile government arises, do they really think they could fight back
and not be annihilated?**

This has been answered so many times on Quora that I'm not going to give
you all the detailed answers again. I'll bullet them and leave it to you
to research this on Quora:

- Many in the military will not fight their own citizens
- Many in local law enforcement will not fight their own citizens
- [[Asymmetric
  warfare](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=3c3bcc&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymmetric_warfare){.external_link

- The government will not annihilate its own people. It needs people to
  make money for it, so it can't kill them all.

If we've gotten to the point where the government is willing to kill one
third of the population, we're no longer America. That would be a sad
day indeed.
