You\'re not comparing apples to apples here.

A correct comparison: "All of those plane crashes involve planes which
were loaded by jetways. When are we going to fix the problem of jetways
in this country?"

The reason: **aircraft crashes are as unrelated to the tool used to load
the plane as violence is unrelated to the tool used to commit the
crime.**

The gun doesn\'t cause violent behavior, just as the jetway doesn\'t
cause the plane to crash. Removing the gun won\'t stop crime (criminals
will use another tool) any more than removing the jetway will prevent
people from loading a plane (passengers will use a roll-up staircase).

Remember: guns don\'t make crime possible, only easier. Jetways don\'t
make loading planes possible, just easier.
