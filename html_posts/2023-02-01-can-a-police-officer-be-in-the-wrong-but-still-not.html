Absolutely.

But to do so, we'd need to define what it means to be "in the wrong."
There are different rules that are imposed on police officers, first and
foremost would be the law. Secondarily to the law, the officer works for
a police department, which has standards of conduct. Finally, there are
the civil rights of the victim to consider, because even if a police
officer did not commit a crime, he may have violated the victim's civil
rights.

Therefore, a police officer may not have committed a crime for which he
can go to jail, but he may still have violated the civil rights of the
victim, and he may have violated department policy.

That's why, when a police officer is involved in a shooting, there are
far more investigations taken against that officer then there are when a
citizen is involved in a shooting. When it's a citizen, the criminal
investigation happens, and that's about it. If the citizen is cleared of
criminal wrongdoing, it's nearly impossible to make a case for a civil
wrongful death action in most states, and that's where the investigation
ends.

For a police officer, that same criminal investigation takes place, but
simultaneously, the officer's department will review the case to see if
any department policies were violated. Violating those rules could get
an officer fired. At the same time as those investigations, the
Department of Justice may also review the incident to see if the civil
rights of the victim were violated, and may bring Federal civil rights
charges against the officer.
