**Why is PUBG Mobile struggling to run on HTC U Ultra (Qualcomm
Snapdragon 821, Adreno 530, 4GB RAM), it can still be considered a high
end phone sitting between S7 and S8?**

First of all, I dispute your claim that the HTC U Ultra sits "between"
the S7 and the S8.

In order to sit between them, it has to be demonstrably better than the
S7 in terms of functional specs. Even a casual statistical comparison
reveals that it is not.

While the S7 is only rocking a Snapdragon 820 and the U Ultra is rocking
an 821, the 820 in the S7 is running at 2200 MHz, while the U Ultra is
running at 2150. And while they are both rocking QHD (2560x1440), the S7
does it using S-AMOLED, while the U Ultra is still stuck on S-LCD.
Therefore, the S7 is more battery-friendly and easier on the graphics
card than the U Ultra.

They both have 4GB of RAM so if it plays well on the S7, it should play
well enough on the U Ultra. PUBG says that minimum specs are Android
5.1.1 or later and 2GB of RAM or more. So it should run fine.

Sounds like you may have some other apps interfering. If you're really
keen on playing PUBG, I'd try a phone wipe, and then try it out before
you re-install your apps. If it works with no problems, then you're
having an app contention issue.
