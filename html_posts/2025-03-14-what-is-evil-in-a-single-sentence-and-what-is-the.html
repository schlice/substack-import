In a single sentence, evil is the opposite of good.

Evil is not a *created thing*. Atheists love to say things like "Why did
God create evil?" He didn't *create* evil. Evil, in that context, is the
**absence** of good.

It's like a hole. You don't *create* a hole. You *remove* something, and
the void that is left is a hole. Evil is a hole created by the removal
of good. God is good, so the removal of God is the "hole" which is the
definition of evil. God is love, so the absence of love in a person is
un-Godlike, and is therefore evil. That absence of love manifests itself
as unloving behavior. The same can be said for God's other gifts: mercy,
patience, justice, etc. The absence of those qualities in a person
constitutes evil. That evil then manifests itself in behavior that is
unmerciful, unjust, impatient, etc.

The source of evil? It's *us*. We were given free will. We were given
the opportunity to choose good or to choose evil. With Satan's help, we
chose evil. When Adam sinned, mankind fell. Our bodies were now sinful,
and our world was fallen. We live in that fallen, sinful world today.
Our sinful world allows us to make sinful choices. We are held
accountable for our own sinful choices, and our choices alone.
