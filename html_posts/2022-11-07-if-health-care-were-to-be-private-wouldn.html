Necessary? Under what principle?

In the United States, as hard a pill as it is to swallow, *healthcare is
not a right*. Healthcare isn't even a privilege.

Healthcare is literally nothing more than a business transaction. Just
like going into the store and buying shoes.

A doctor is a practitioner who has spent *years* learning his skill, and
in most cases, investing his own money (usually through student loans)
to finance his education. He has a family. He gets a paycheck. You have
to purchase his services.

It is not "necessary" that we do anything.

What we *do* when healthcare is private is that we offer what is called
a "social safety net" wherein the poorest people qualify for
state-funded healthcare, through taxpayer dollars. In the United States,
there are several key programs which provide healthcare for the poor:
**Medicaid** and **CHIP** (the Children's Health Insurance Program),
which provide access to healthcare for millions of people, including
low-income workers, families and children, pregnant women, the elderly,
and people with disabilities.

So in a private system, where healthcare is a business transaction, the
state provides the backup funding for healthcare for the poorest and
neediest individuals.
