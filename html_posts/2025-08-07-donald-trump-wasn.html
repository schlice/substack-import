**Donald Trump wasn\'t legitimately elected but Joe Biden was. Why
can\'t Republicans see and accept it?**

The problem is that your premise is untrue. And neither assertion you
claim in your question is true (yet, as of December 2020).

What makes a legitimate election? When states certify their elections
and Congress certifies the Electoral College vote.

To that end, Trump was indeed legitimately elected, as the states all
certified their election results, and Congress certified the Electoral
College vote. Biden has not **yet** been legitimately elected, as
Congress has not yet certified the Electoral College vote. This happens
in January, right after the new Congress is sworn in.

When you discuss legitimacy, you must define what exactly you're
referring to. As far as most of us are concerned, a legitimately elected
president is one who was elected in accordance with the rules specified
in the Constitution.
