Julie's first sentence was thrown out on appeal because the trial court
had overestimated her role in the tax fraud scheme. Her case was
remanded back to the lower court, and her sentence was adjusted
properly.

While appeals were still in progress for Todd, Julie and Todd Chrisley
were pardoned by President Trump last week. So at this point, both the
conviction and the prison sentences were "thrown out."
