The US Constitution has as its strongest undercurrent liberty. It says
very little about "equality," with the first reference to the concept in
the Declaration of Independence, and only then to show that "all men are
created equal" so as to eliminate classes of society (such as "being
born into nobility") popular in Britain at the time.

Since the purpose of the Constitution is to control the power of the
government, the whole notion of it is to preserve personal liberty. If
you want to equate it to equality, it would be **equality of
opportunity**. The Constitution affords all citizens the same
opportunity to succeed.

The new American Progressives (meaning since the founding) conflate this
with **equality of outcome** and attempt to show that the Constitution
is unjust because it allows class distinctions and income distinctions.
In a truly free society, it is only your degree of personal ambition
which limits your income and class potential, so in a way, the
Constitution does permit inequality, because it does not regulate it.
This is in keeping with the purpose of the Constitution: to limit the
power of government, not to force equality of outcome on the people. The
Bill of Rights enshrines rights you already have as a citizen and a
human being; it does not "grant" rights. Since there is no "right" to
equality, it is not a factor. The only right to equality might be found
in the 14th Amendment's Equal Protection clause, which says that all
laws must be applied to all citizens equally. It is the overreach of the
14th Amendment which implies to Progressives that **all thngs and all
outcomes** should be equal, not just application of the law.

It is a Socialist concept that forces equality of outcome over equality
of opportunity.
