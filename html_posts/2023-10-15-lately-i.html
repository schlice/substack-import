First of all, **there are no perfect people**. The last time a perfect
person was on this planet, He was nailed to a cross.

Secondly, **God is not looking for perfection**. And if you're unsure of
the truth of that statement, see the first one I just made. There are no
perfect people, so God cannot be looking for perfection, because He
certainly would not find it among us.

**God is not looking for** ***perfection*, but** ***connection*.**

God wants to hear from you! He wants you to tell Him all about your day
and how you're feeling and what you're worried about, and He wants you
to recognize that *to fix all of that,* ***He is enough****.* He wants
you to lean on Him and ask Him to forgive you, and to protect you from
evil.

But if you are like me and you need to be a little more formulaic about
what you should include in your prayer, here are five elements of
prayer:

1.  Give His name *praise*
2.  Surrender to His *purposes*
3.  Request His *provisions*
4.  Ask for His *pardon*
5.  Seek *protection* from the enemy

Where did I get this? ***Jesus taught us!***

> One day Jesus was praying in a certain place. When he finished, one of
> his disciples said to him, "Lord, teach us to pray, just as John
> taught his disciples."
>
> He said to them, "When you pray, say:
>
> "'Father,\
> hallowed be your name,\
> your kingdom come.\
> Give us each day our daily bread.\
> Forgive us our sins,\
> for we also forgive everyone who sins against us.\
> And lead us not into temptation.'" --- Luke 11:1--4 NIV

Jesus says first, praise His name. "Father, hallowed be your name."
Then, Jesus says we are to surrender to His purposes. "Your kingdom
come." Then, Jesus tells us to request His provisions. "Give us each day
our daily bread." Next, Jesus tells us to ask for forgiveness. "Forgive
us our sins, for we also forgive everyone who sins against us." Finally,
Jesus tells us to seek protection from the enemy. "And lead us not into
temptation."

The five elements of prayer come straight out of Jesus' teaching. Jesus
taught us how to pray. There is no need to stress out about it. Just let
it flow naturally. Remember, God isn't looking for perfection, but
connection.
