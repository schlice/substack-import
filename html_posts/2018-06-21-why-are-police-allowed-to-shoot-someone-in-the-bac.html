There is, of course, one major exception to this: **the US Military.**

We *can* shoot someone in the back who is fleeing.

The military provides 8 scenarios in which deadly force is authorized:

1.  Self defense
2.  Defense of others (i.e. serious crimes against the person)
3.  **Protection of property or information vital to national security**
    (i.e. stopping someone escaping with Top Secret information)
4.  **Protection of property or information substantial to national
    security** (i.e. stopping someone escaping with Secret information)
5.  **Protection of property inherently dangerous to others** (i.e.
    stopping someone escaping with High Explosive ordnance or a
    thermonuclear detonator, or something similar).
6.  Apprehension
7.  **Prevention of prisoner escape**
8.  **Enforcement of a lawful order**

Note that five of those eight (I highlighted them above) could be
effected against someone who is running away.
