**A friend recently purchased a townhouse. Pooled rainwater in the
common walkway has caused a crack in the foundation. The estimate is
\$800 to fix the crack, another \$1,200 for the landscaping that caused
it. Under an HOA, who is responsible for what?**

In most townhome communities, the owner owns both the interior and the
exterior of the building, including driveways, roofs, and lawns. They do
not own common areas.

If this is the same as the townhome in question, the owner (or more
likely, the owner's homeowner's insurance company) is responsible for
fixing the damage, and then they will sue the Association because the
damage was caused by their negligence in ensuring proper drainage.

This may not be the case in this particular townhome. Most townhomes are
set up in this way, but not all. You will have to check the Association
documents to find out who owns what.
