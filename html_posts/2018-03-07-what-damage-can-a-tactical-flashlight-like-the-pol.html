**What damage can a tactical flashlight, like the police use, have on a
person\'s eyes if it is directed in the face for several minutes at less
than 3 feet away?**

Virtually none.

There have been some studies of long term exposure to bright lights
(i.e. less intense than directly staring into the sun, but brighter than
ambient light). [[It was
found](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=bf5752&url=https://www.brightfocus.org/macular/article/are-bright-lights-damaging-eye){.external_link

correlation (note: not causation) between increased exposure to bright
light and age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Basically, the study
found that chronic exposure over days or weeks to bright lights could
potentially increase the chance for long-term damage down the road.

I won't say that there is zero chance that there could be some damage
that presents itself, especially if pre-existing conditions are present.
However, under normal circumstances, bright light for a few minutes will
not cause any permanent damage.
