Two different laws.

HIPAA governs what people who have your personal medical information do
with it. They are required to protect it. They must notify you how they
are going to use it and who they are allowed to give it to without
additional permission from you. HIPAA governs how they are to protect
your information while they have it. It says nothing about what they are
allowed to *ask you* for.

ADA does not require that a service animal have any specific
documentation. It does not require animals to wear vests. A business
owner may only ask if it is a service animal specifically trained to
assist with a disability, and what is the animal trained to do. This is
all the law allows them to ask. The law says specifically that
documentation of training is not required. And no, the training of your
service animal is not private medical information.

Original question:

How is asking about someone\'s vaccine status not a violation of HIPPA,
but asking for documents for service animals is a violation of the ADA?
Aren\'t they both private medical information?
