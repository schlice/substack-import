Not at all. And the reason is that *no human actually interprets the
Bible.*

Correctly understanding the truth of God's word is never a matter of
personal opinion. The apostle Peter said the following:

> We also have the prophetic message as something completely reliable,
> and you will do well to pay attention to it, as to a light shining in
> a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your
> hearts. Above all, you must understand that no prophecy of Scripture
> came about by the prophet's own interpretation of things. For prophecy
> never had its origin in the human will, but prophets, though human,
> spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit. --- 2
> Peter 1:19--21 NIV

Peter is saying here that Scripture was not a product of the
interpretation of things by the writer. The Bible writers were "carried
along" by the Holy Spirit in their writings.

Similarly, when we read the Bible, it is the Spirit which gives us the
interpretation of what we are reading. We are not "self-referential"
when reading the Bible. God has the power to not only give us the Word,
but to ensure that we get the proper understanding of it when we read
it.

We would do well also to remember that our goal is not to gain an
understanding of the Bible. Our goal is to know God and grow in the
grace and knowledge of Jesus Christ through a study of His word.

The Bible is the most widely-translated and distributed work. As of
September 2022 all of the Bible has been translated into **724
languages**, the New Testament has been translated into an additional
1,617 languages, and smaller portions of the Bible have been translated
into 1,248 other languages according to Wycliffe Global Alliance. I am
grateful for godly men like John Wycliffe and William Tyndale, who put
their own lives on the line so that we could read God's Word in our own
native language. That was done for you, so that you could read the Bible
yourself, and you too can grow in a Spirit-inspired knowledge of God,
*through the reading of His word.*
