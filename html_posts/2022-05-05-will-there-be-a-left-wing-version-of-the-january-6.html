First of all, there was no "insurrection." No one tried to take over the
government and install their own. Don't believe what the antiquated
legacy media tells you.

Second, no, leftists will not storm the Capitol and disrupt proceedings.
Instead, they're going to go all "mostly peaceful protests" and burn
shit to the ground and loot stores because, you know, reasons.

Because they're adult-sized infants who throw temper tantrums when they
don't get their way.
