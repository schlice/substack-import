**Content:** [Churches and other organizations requesting police support
for their specific event pay for the time the officers provide to their
events. This is not a tax. This is a fee for service that is not
normally provided during the officer\'s normal shift. On-shift patrols
are not tasked to these assignments; these officers are off-duty (i.e.
not part of the on-duty crew). Therefore, since the duty falls outside
of the officer\'s normal shift time, the department charges a fee for
this service. Tax-exempt status does not apply.\
\
There are many \"pay assignments\" that officers have the option of
working. In our department, the ones that are not picked up by full-time
officers go to the Reserves. The organization will still pay, but any
monies received go into the Reserve operating fund, not to the Reserve
Deputies. In some rare cases, if a pay assignment has to be filled and
no one is biting, they may offer the Reserves the option to receive the
pay directly instead of having it funnel to the operating fund, but that
is the exception rather than the rule.]{.rendered_qtext}
