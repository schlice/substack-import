**What is guaranteed to happen to you, if you trespass on private
property and get caught?**

Nothing in life is guaranteed. What happens to you is very
situation-dependent.

Let's not forget that the definition of "trespassing" doesn't really
encompass the motivation behind that unlawful presence. Trespassing only
means that you are physically present in an area in which you don't
belong. Let's consider that these are also technically trespassing:

- You get invited to a friend's house for a party. You wander into an
  area in which you have not been granted permission to be.
- You are searching your favorite store for an employee to assist you,
  and you accidentally wander into an "Employees Only" area.

In these situations, you are also technically trespassing on private
property, and what happens to you then is certainly not guaranteed.
