**Is smoking cigarettes like another master in your life such as serving
both God and money? Is it a sin? Something a Christian should do and
which God approves of? Is it wrong for a Christian to smoke? Looking to
make God happy**

There's a lot to unpack here. Let's take it a little bit at a time.

**Is smoking cigarettes like another master in your life such as serving
both God and money?**

It can be.

The problem with having two masters is that only one of them is worthy
of being master. So for example, if your smoking is interfering with
your ability to be a good Christian, a good spouse, a good parent, a
good friend, then it's certainly possible that smoking could be another
master in your life.

**Is it a sin? Something a Christian should do and which God approves
of?**

No, smoking is not sinful, in the traditional way we think of sins. It's
a habit, and like all habits, some are less dangerous than others. It's
a dangerous habit. Nicotine is not an intoxicant (and the Bible
definitely talks about drunkenness), but too much smoking can shorten
your life, and that damaging your body this way is selfish to others. It
can cause you to sin, such as if you lie to others about your smoking,
or quitting smoking.

**Is it wrong for a Christian to smoke? Looking to make God happy**

God is happy when you love him and you trust him. He's happy when you
give your life to him and you let him drive, so to speak. He's happy
when you bring your troubles to him, even though he already knows your
troubles and just wants to hear it from you.

So instead of talking to us about making him happy, talk to him. Tell
him that you want to do what's right and you want to please him with
your actions, and let him tell you what you should do, and then do that.
