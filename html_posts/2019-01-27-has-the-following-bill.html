**Has the following bill,"Closing the pre-paid mobile device security
gap act of 2016, or HR 4886", become an official U.S federal law?**

No. The bill died in committee.

On April 28, 2016, the bill was referred to the Subcommittee on Crime,
Terrorism, Homeland Security, and
Investigations.[\[1\]](#AszSf){#cite-AszSf .citation_link} It never
left. The full House never took any action, and the Senate did not have
a similar bill in the works.
