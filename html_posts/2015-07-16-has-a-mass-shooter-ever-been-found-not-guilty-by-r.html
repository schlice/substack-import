**Content:** [Interesting you should ask now, because James Holmes (the
shooter in the Aurora theater shooting) is on trial for murder, he has
pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity, and the jury took just two
days to return a verdict.\
\
(EDIT) Holmes was indeed convicted of first-degree murder, the jury
finding that he was not insane during the shooting. I would add,
however, that there is no doubt that he is insane now.\
\
But to answer your question, yes, at least one mass shooter has been
found not guilty by reason of insanity.\

Many defendants are found to be sane enough to stand trial, so the
insanity defense cannot be used.]{.rendered_qtext}
