I think it would just save everyone a lot of time if your sign instead
read:

THERE ARE NO GUNS IN THIS HOME!\
PLEASE COME ROB US, YOU ARE GUARANTEED TO NOT GET SHOT.

The whole point of not knowing who is armed is that criminals don't
know, either. They could walk into a house and get away scot-free, or
they could walk into a house and get shot. Their job is to minimize that
risk so that they have the greatest chance of being able to get away
without getting killed.

Handing them exactly the information they need will not make you, your
neighbors, or anyone else, safer. It will simply make you *a bigger
target.*
