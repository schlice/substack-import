**As a matter of national security, why isn\'t Donald Trump stopped from
making calls on phones he knows aren\'t secure?**

You only need to be concerned about the phone you're using when you're
discussing things that are not unclassified.

Just because you have the capability of discussing classified things
doesn't mean you have to use secure phones 100% of the time.

It comes down to policing yourself and knowing you're on an unsecured
line and not discussing classified things on an unsecured line. You
can't police everyone, least of all the President. All you can do is
provide him the tools he needs to conduct classified discussions
securely while giving him all the tools he wants to make any kind of
call he needs.

Additionally, don't forget that a secured phone call requires secure
telephone devices ***on both ends*** or the call cannot be completed.

That said, the President has all of the tools available to him at all
times to make any classification of phone call he may need.
