**Can I trespass on a neighbor\'s property to make repairs?**

No.

Not only can you not trespass, but you cannot repair property that you
do not own or do not have rights to maintain.

Even if failing to repair that property causes damage to yours, you
still can't repair it. You can only repair your own property and then
press the owner to repay you for their negligence which caused damage to
you.
