**What do I do if I have a warrant for second degree assault? I\'m
turning myself in but what steps do I take before turning myself in?**

1.  Get a lawyer. If you don't already have one, now is the time. Don't
    wait until after you are arrested, because it will be much, much
    easier to do now. Pretty much all you'll need at this time is an
    attorney on retainer and a phone number to call should you need
    immediate assistance.
2.  Get prepared for incarceration, even though you should be granted
    bail on an assault 2. Make sure your home affairs are in order
3.  To that end, arrange for bail. If you don't have the cash available,
    visit the bail bondsman so you can be ready to post as soon as the
    judgement is handed down.
