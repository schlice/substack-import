**Content:** [The question is whether or not the victim posed a threat.
If the victim wasn\'t a threat to anyone, there\'s nothing that will
prevent the officer from being charged with murder. No different than
anyone else who walks into a shopping mall and shoots someone to death
in front of everyone. The officer would have to show that the person was
an imminent threat to the people around him.\
\
There may be a defense to that charge, such as temporary insanity. In
the absence of a threat to the officer\'s life, or the lives of others,
the officer simply lost touch with reality and saw the victim as a
three-headed space monster. The officer would be committed to a
psychiatric hospital and would lose his job.]{.rendered_qtext}
