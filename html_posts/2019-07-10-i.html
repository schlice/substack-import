Hi, thanks for the A2A.

There are many resources which can help you. [[Thomas

pretty much hit the nail on the head.

- Once you de-plane, you will find a gate agent nearby. You can ask that
  gate agent where you need to go and how to get there, and they will
  direct you.
- Most major airports have, on their websites, maps of the terminal
  which you can study beforehand.
- Technology can also help you while you are in the airport as well.
  Check out GateGuru on
  [[iOS](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=f93734&url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/gateguru-airport-info-flight/id326862399?mt%3D8){.external_link

  [[Android](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=8ed814&url=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id%3Dcom.gateguruapp.android){.external_link
  rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
  onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
  qt-tooltip="google.com"}]{.qlink_container}. It can help you navigate
  the airport as well as load in your itinerary and keep you on track.
  GateGuru has detailed information on over 204 airports across the
  United States, Canada, Europe, Asia and Australia.

Don't forget to ask airline employees for help if you are lost. Someone
will always be able to direct you to your gate.

Good luck, and don't be nervous. Enjoy the new places!
