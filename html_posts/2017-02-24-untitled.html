Thank you for sharing your story. It was indeed tough to read. No one
deserves that kind of treatment; I'm glad that I'm *from* New York, not
there anymore.

When we suspect an inmate is faking, we still take them to the hospital,
but we warn them ahead of time that if the doctor confirms that there is
nothing wrong, they will incur loss of privilege when they return. And
crying wolf doesn't bode well for future times when something may be
really wrong.

I will be sure to keep your story in mind in the future.
