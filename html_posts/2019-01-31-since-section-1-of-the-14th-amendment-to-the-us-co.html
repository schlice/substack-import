**Since Section 1 of the 14th Amendment to the US Constitution says a US
Citizen is any person "born or naturalized in the United States, does
that mean a fetus cannot be a US Citizen?**

Correct, a fetus is not yet "born" so it does not have the rights of
citizenship. It doesn't receive a Social Security Number until after it
is born. It doesn't receive any vital documentation (i.e. a government
birth certificate) until after it is born. So it is therefore not a
citizen until it is born.
