So you're asking if the Bible depicts real things that really happened.
Thankfully, there is little doubt that the events recorded in the Bible
actually happened.

We know that the New Testament is historically reliable. This is
evidenced by:

1.  Early testimony
2.  Eyewitness testimony
3.  Uninvented (authentic) testimony
4.  Eyewitnesses who were not deceived

**Early testimony.** This is *just one* piece of evidence that the Bible
writers talked about events which actually took place: *writings from
outside of the Bible.* There are ten known non-Christian writers who
mention Jesus within 150 years of his life. When you add those
non-Christian writings to the Christian sources over that same 150
years, there are about as many sources who mention Jesus as cite
Tiberius Caesar, the Roman emperor at the time of Jesus. In other words,
Jesus of Nazareth, who was not even a Roman official in the Roman
Empire, is mentioned in ancient writings about as much as the emperor at
that time!

Some of these non-Christian sources---such as Celsus, Tacitus, and the
Jewish Talmud---could be considered *anti-Christian* sources. While
these works do not have any eyewitness testimony that contradicts events
described in the New Testament documents, they are works written by
writers whose tone is decidedly anti-Christian. What can we learn from
them and the more neutral non-Christian sources? We learn that they
admit certain facts about early Christianity that help us piece together
a storyline that is surprisingly congruent with the New Testament.
Piecing together all ten non-Christian references, we see that:

1.  Jesus lived during time of Tiberius Caesar.
2.  He lived a virtuous life.
3.  He was a wonder-worker.
4.  He had a brother named James.
5.  He was acclaimed to be the Messiah.
6.  He was crucified under Pontius Pilate.
7.  He was crucified on the eve of the Jewish Passover.
8.  Darkness and an earthquake occurred when he died.
9.  His disciples believed he rose from the dead.
10. His disciples were willing to die for their belief.
11. Christianity spread rapidly as far as Rome.
12. His disciples denied the Roman gods and worshiped Jesus as God.

In light of these non-Christian references, the theory that Jesus never
existed is clearly unreasonable. How could non-Christian writers
collectively reveal a storyline congruent with the New Testament if
Jesus never existed?

**Eyewitness testimony.** Suppose someone wrote a book in 1980
describing your hometown as it was that year. In the book, the author
correctly describes: your town's politicians, its unique laws and penal
codes, the local industry, local weather patterns, local slang, the
town's roads and geography, its unusual topography, local houses of
worship, area hotels, town statutes and sculptures, the depth of the
water in the town harbor, and numerous other unique details about your
town that year. Question: If the author claimed he had visited your town
that year---or said he had gotten good information from people who had
been there---would you think he was telling the truth? Of course,
because he provides details that only an eyewitness could provide.
That's the type of testimony we have throughout much of the New
Testament.

Luke includes the most eyewitness details. (While Luke may not have been
an eyewitness to the Resurrection itself, he certainly was an eyewitness
to many New Testament events.) In the second half of Acts, for example,
Luke displays an incredible array of knowledge of local places, names,
environmental conditions, customs, and circumstances that befit only an
eyewitness contemporary of the time and events.

Classical scholar and historian Colin Hemer chronicles Luke's accuracy
in the book of Acts verse by verse. With painstaking detail, Hemer
identifies **84 facts in the last 16 chapters of Acts that have been
confirmed by historical and archaeological research.** It's a long list,
so I'm not going to reproduce it here, but the research has been done,
and the facts have been verified. Because of this, there should be
little doubt that Luke was an eyewitness to the events, or had direct
access to eyewitnesses.

Now, here's where skeptics get very uncomfortable. Luke reports a total
of 35 miracles in the same book in which he records all 84 of these
historically confirmed details. Several miracles of Paul are recorded in
the second half of Acts. For example, Luke records that Paul:
temporarily blinded a sorcerer (13:11); cured a man who was crippled
from birth (14:8); exorcized an evil spirit from a possessed girl
(16:18); "performed many miracles" that convinced many in the city of
Ephesus to turn from sorcery to Jesus (19:11-20); raised a man from the
dead who had died after falling out of a window during Paul's
long-winded lecture (20:9-10); healed Publius's father of dysentery, and
healed numerous others who were sick on Malta (28:8-9). All of these
miracles are included in the same historical narrative that has been
confirmed as authentic on 84 points. And the miracle accounts show no
signs of embellishment or extravagance---they are told with the same
levelheaded efficiency as the rest of the historical narrative.

Now, why would Luke be so accurate with trivial details like wind
directions, water depths, and peculiar town names, but not be accurate
when it comes to important events like miracles? In light of the fact
that Luke has proven accurate with so many trivial details, it is
nothing but pure anti-supernatural bias to say he's not telling the
truth about the miracles he records.

**Uninvented (authentic) testimony.** We know the New Testament writers
told the truth. We know this because:

1.  *They included embarrassing details about themselves.* Let's put it
    this way: If you and your friends were concocting a story that you
    wanted to pass off as the truth, would you make yourselves look like
    dim-witted, uncaring, rebuked, doubting cowards? Of course not. But
    that's exactly what we find in the New Testament. The people who
    wrote down much of the New Testament are characters (or friends of
    characters) in the story, and often they depict themselves as
    complete morons. People making up stories tend to not do this.
2.  *They included embarrassing details and difficult sayings of Jesus*.
    Similar to the first point, if you were trying to get people to
    believe in your fictitious god-man, would you include embarrassing
    details about him? If you were trying to depict Jesus as the
    perfect, sinless God-man, you would not do this. Nor are these
    qualities congruent with the Jewish expectation that the Messiah
    would come to free them from political oppression. In fact,
    according to their own Bible at the time (the Old Testament), Jesus
    was cursed by God for being hanged on a tree! The best explanation
    for these embarrassing details is that they actually occurred, and
    the New Testament writers are telling the truth.
3.  *The New Testament writers carefully distinguished Jesus' words from
    their own*. Even though quotation marks did not exist in
    first-century Greek, the New Testament writers distinguished Jesus'
    words very clearly. Most red letter editions of the Bibles are
    identical, illustrating how easy the New Testament writers made it
    to see what Jesus said and what he didn't say. Why do we cite this
    as evidence of their trustworthiness? Because it would have been
    very easy for the New Testament writers to solve first-century
    theological disputes by putting words into Jesus' mouth. After all,
    if you were making up the "Christianity story" and trying to pass it
    off as the truth, wouldn't you simply make up more quotes from Jesus
    to convince stubborn people to see things your way? Think how
    convenient it would have been for them to end all debate on
    controversial issues such as circumcision, obeying the Law of Moses,
    speaking in tongues, women in the church, and so forth by merely
    making up quotes from Jesus! Because they carefully distinguished
    Jesus' actual words from their own, literary archaeologists conclude
    that it is likely they recorded Jesus' actual words.

**Eyewitnesses who were not deceived.** The last possible out for the
skeptic is that the New Testament writers were deceived. In other words,
perhaps the New Testament writers simply were wrong about what they
thought they saw.

Given the characteristics of the New Testament that we have already
reviewed, it does not seem plausible that the New Testament writers were
deceived, given their level of accuracy about everyday, non-miraculous
events. They have been proven right about so many historical details.
Why doubt their observations about miraculous events when they got so
much other minutiae correct? Skeptics point to many different possible
theories, **but they do so without a shred of evidence**. Just because a
competing theory exists doesn't mean that that's how it happened. It
doesn't prove anything other than the vividness of the imagination.

And with so much the writers got right, does it make logical sense to
believe them on the non-miraculous events, but then discount their
testimony when it comes to the things that are less easy to believe?
Christians are used to "counter-punching" alternative theories to the
Resurrection. But that's not enough. While skeptics rightfully put the
burden of proof for the Resurrection on Christians (and, as we have
seen, Christians can meet that burden with good evidence), Christians
need to put the burden of proof on skeptics for their alternative
theories. In light of all the positive evidence for the Resurrection,
skeptics must offer positive, first-century evidence for their
alternative views.

It's one thing to concoct an alternative theory to the Resurrection, but
it's another thing to actually find first-century evidence for it. A
theory is not evidence. Reasonable people demand evidence, not just
theories. Anyone can concoct a theory to explain any historical event.
For example, if someone were to claim that all of the video footage from
the Holocaust concentration camps was staged and manufactured by Jews in
order to garner sympathy and support for a Jewish state, would you
believe that theory? Of course not, because it flies in the face of all
the known evidence. To be taken seriously, those who offer such a theory
must present credible, independent eyewitness reports and other
corroborating evidence to counter the numerous reports that say the
Holocaust was real and was actually carried out by the Nazis. But no
such counterevidence exists.

This is the case with the Resurrection. While skeptics have formulated
numerous alternative theories to explain away the Resurrection, there is
no evidence from any first-century source supporting any of them. No one
from the ancient world---not even the enemies of Christianity---has
offered a plausible alternative explanation for the Resurrection. Many
alternative theories formulated over the past 200 years are rooted in
anti-supernaturalism. Since modern scholars philosophically rule out
miracles in advance, they concoct ad hoc explanations to explain away
the Resurrection.

Those who have alternative theories for the Resurrection should be
asked, "What evidence do you have for your theory? Can you please name
three or four first-century sources that support your theory?" When
honest skeptics are presented with this question, they typically answer
with silence or a stuttering admission that they have no such evidence
because none exists.

And it's not just the Resurrection that the skeptics have to explain.
They also have to explain the other thirty-five miracles that
eyewitnesses have associated with Jesus. Are we to believe that the four
Gospel writers were all deceived about all of those miracles as well as
the Resurrection?

The bottom line is that there are too many miracles and too much
testimony to believe that all of the eyewitnesses got it wrong every
time. With regard to the Resurrection, all alternative theories have
fatal flaws, and we have strong eyewitness and circumstantial evidence
that Jesus actually rose from the dead. In other words, not only do we
lack a natural explanation for the empty tomb, we have positive evidence
*for* the Resurrection. The explanation that requires the *least* amount
of faith is that Jesus really did perform miracles and really did rise
from the dead as he predicted.
