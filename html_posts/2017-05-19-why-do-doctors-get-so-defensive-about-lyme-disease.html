Let me see if I can help de-mystify why some doctors get so weird about
Lyme.

Lyme disease is caused by a bacteria called *Borrelia burgdorferi* which
is usually transmitted by a bite from the deer tick. In the early stages
of infection (i.e. within one month of infection), antibiotics are
usually effective at eliminating the active bacterial infection.

And that's about the limit of effective knowledge we have about Lyme.

From this point, there are two schools of medical thought. The doctors
who follow the American Medical Association's guidance say that the
bacteria is only active for a month, and after that month, it is no
longer present or causing issues. They feel there is no such thing as
"late-stage Lyme disease" because the Western Blot and ELISA tests they
use to find Lyme disease come back negative.

There is another school of thought around Lyme disease, and it is
currently being spear-headed by an organization called the
[[International Lyme and Associated Disease Society
(ILADS)](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=e1eab2&url=http://www.ilads.org){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="ilads.org"}]{.qlink_container}. This organization is spread
across 22 countries and "promotes understanding of Lyme and its
associated diseases and strongly supports physicians and other health
care professionals dedicated to advancing the standard of care for Lyme
and its associated diseases."

Take these facts, for example:

> 1.  **Lyme disease is transmitted by the bite of a tick, and the
>     disease is prevalent across the United States and throughout the
>     world.** Ticks know no borders and respect no boundaries. A
>     patient\'s county of residence does not accurately reflect his or
>     her Lyme disease risk because people travel, pets travel, and
>     ticks travel. This creates a dynamic situation with many
>     opportunities for exposure to Lyme disease for each individual.
> 2.  **Lyme disease is a clinical diagnosis.** The disease is caused by
>     a spiral-shaped bacteria (spirochete) called *Borrelia
>     Burgdorferi*. The Lyme spirochete can cause infection of multiple
>     organs and produce a wide range of symptoms. Case reports in the
>     medical literature document the protean manifestations of Lyme
>     disease, and familiarity with its varied presentations is key to
>     recognizing disseminated disease.
> 3.  **Fewer than 50% of patients with Lyme disease recall a tick
>     bite.** In some studies this number is as low as 15% in
>     culture-proven infection with the Lyme spirochete.
> 4.  **Fewer than 50% of patients with Lyme disease recall any rash.**
>     Although the erythema migrans (EM) or "bull's-eye" rash is
>     considered classic, it is not the most common dermatologic
>     manifestation of early-localized Lyme infection. Atypical forms of
>     this rash are seen far more commonly. It is important to know that
>     the EM rash is pathognomonic of Lyme disease and requires no
>     further verification prior to starting an appropriate course of
>     antibiotic therapy.
> 5.  The Centers For Disease Control And Prevention (CDC) surveillance
>     criteria for Lyme disease were devised to track a narrow band of
>     cases for epidemiologic purposes. **As stated on the CDC website,
>     the surveillance criteria were never intended to be used as
>     diagnostic criteria**, nor were they meant to define the entire
>     scope of Lyme disease.
> 6.  **The ELISA screening test is unreliable. The test misses 35% of
>     culture proven Lyme disease (only 65% sensitivity)** and is
>     unacceptable as the first step of a two-step screening protocol.
>     By definition, a screening test should have at least 95%
>     sensitivity.
> 7.  **Of patients with acute culture-proven Lyme disease, 20--30%
>     remain seronegative on serial Western Blot sampling.** Antibody
>     titers also appear to decline over time; thus while the western
>     blot may remain positive for months, it may not always be
>     sensitive enough to detect chronic infection with the Lyme
>     spirochete. For "epidemiological purposes" the CDC eliminated from
>     the Western Blot analysis the reading of bands 31 and 34. These
>     bands are so specific to *Borrelia Burgdorferi* that they were
>     chosen for vaccine development. Since a vaccine for Lyme disease
>     is currently unavailable, however, a positive 31 or 34 band is
>     highly indicative of *Borrelia Burgdorferi* exposure. Yet these
>     bands are not reported in commercial Lyme tests.
> 8.  **When used as part of a diagnostic evaluation for Lyme disease,
>     the Western Blot should be performed by a laboratory that reads
>     and reports all of the bands related to** ***Borrelia
>     Burgdorferi*.** Laboratories that use FDA approved kits (for
>     instance, the Mardx MarblotÂ®) are restricted from reporting all of
>     the bands, as they must abide by the rules of the manufacturer.
>     These rules are set up in accordance with the CDC\'s surveillance
>     criteria and increase the risk of false-negative results. The
>     commercial kits may be useful for surveillance purposes, but they
>     offer too little information to be useful in patient management.
> 9.  **There are 5 subspecies of** ***Borrelia Burgdorferi*, over 100
>     strains in the USA, and 300 strains worldwide.** This diversity is
>     thought to contribute to the antigenic variability of the
>     spirochete and its ability to evade the immune system and
>     antibiotic therapy, leading to chronic infection.
> 10. **Testing for Babesia, Anaplasma, Ehrlichia and Bartonella (other
>     tick-transmitted organisms) should be performed.** The presence of
>     co-infection with these organisms points to probable infection
>     with the Lyme spirochete as well. If these coinfections are left
>     untreated, their continued presence increases morbidity and
>     prevents successful treatment of Lyme disease.
> 11. A preponderance of evidence indicates that active **ongoing
>     spirochetal infection with or without other tick-borne
>     coinfections is the cause of the persistent symptoms in chronic
>     Lyme disease**.
> 12. **There has never been a study demonstrating that 30 days of
>     antibiotic treatment cures chronic Lyme disease.** However there
>     is a plethora of documentation in the US and European medical
>     literature demonstrating by histology and culture techniques that
>     short courses of antibiotic treatment fail to eradicate the Lyme
>     spirochete. Short treatment courses have resulted in upwards of a
>     40% relapse rate, especially if treatment is delayed.
> 13. **Most cases of chronic Lyme disease require an extended course of
>     antibiotic therapy to achieve symptomatic relief.** The return of
>     symptoms and evidence of the continued presence of *Borrelia
>     Burgdorferi* indicates the need for further treatment. The very
>     real consequences of untreated chronic persistent Lyme infection
>     far outweigh the potential consequences of long-term antibiotic
>     therapy.
> 14. **Many patients with chronic Lyme disease require prolonged
>     treatment until the patient is symptom-free.** Relapses occur and
>     retreatment may be required. There are no tests currently
>     available to prove that the organism is eradicated or that the
>     patient with chronic Lyme disease is cured.
> 15. **Like Syphilis in the 19th century, Lyme disease has been called
>     the great imitator** and should be considered in the differential
>     diagnosis of rheumatologic and neurologic conditions, as well as
>     Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, Fibromyalgia, Somatization Disorder and
>     any difficult-to-diagnose multi-system
>     illness.[\[1\]](#mVQRH){#cite-mVQRH .citation_link}

Finally, the doctors who fall into the "medically acceptable" camp scoff
at the other doctors, shun and ostracize them for their "radical"
beliefs, and generally "poo-poo" their ideas and treatments.

That said, you can't argue with results. The AMA doesn't produce
consistent results. The ILADS doctors do. Eventually, when the science
catches up with the treatment, ILADS will be vindicated. For now, they
are villified.

Why do doctors get defensive about this? Maybe they feel like they know
that something is wrong with the way the AMA prescribes diagnosing and
treating Lyme, but they feel their hands are tied. Maybe they are afraid
of being called a quack for believing that there may be another way to
treat Lyme. Maybe all of the above.
