There are many, both ethical and medical.

Medically, there are a series of problems with embryonic stem cells
(ESCs):

1.  It's difficult to grow a pure sample of a single cell-type without
    growing other cell types. For example, if you're trying to grow
    heart cells, you may find some liver cells in your sample, which
    renders your sample impure and potentially unusable.
2.  ESCs are *immunogenic*, which means that they are genetically
    different from the patient, which virtually guarantees that the
    patient will reject the cells.
3.  ESCs are *tumorigenic.* Because of their ability for rapid
    proliferation, ESCs tend to grow uncontrollably and produce tumors.
4.  ESCs are derived from the inner cell mass of an early embryo,
    between 5 and 7 days old, or aborted fetal tissue from fetuses less
    than a few weeks old. Because a majority of embryos are reserved for
    in-vitro fertilization (IVF), there is a very limited amount of
    source material. Current law prevents selling aborted fetal tissue,
    so the only material available is from embryos harvested for IVF.

Finally, the largest medical issue relates to what we've found using
these cells. ESCs have yet to show proven success in treating a single
human being. Research with ESCs has primarily triggered tumor formation
and immune system reactions in animal studies.

Ethically, ESCs are fraught with challenges, but the largest one is the
fact that in order to harvest ESCs, the embryo must be destroyed.
