We've said this about a bzillion times on this platform (yes, that's a
real number, Toy Story said so):

**We don't have an** ***information*** **problem. We have a**
***trust*** **problem.**

The public health apparatus in the United States has decimated itself.
it politicized the vaccine. It politicized the virus. It has undermined
public trust in it. Rather than doing, oh I don't know, **the right
thing** and just giving people **all** the facts, they instead gave us
curated, little-bits-of-fact surrounded by hype and propaganda in order
to push an *a priori* objective. Now, they're fully committed to the
mandated vaccine, forced vaccination strategy, and that's what the whole
dust-up over the Delta variant is all about.

Forced vaccinations in the context of this vaccine and this pandemic are
going to be very, very bad for public health. It's a great way to
reinforce the belief that the government may just be lying to you and
you should ignore what you know is right and just toe the party line.
*If your aim is to drive the United States towards socialism, this is a
perfect way to do it.*

If the public health apparatus would just present us with the actual
numbers about for whom the vaccine is beneficial, and for whom it might
not make much sense, and then **treat people like adults and let them
make their own decisions**, that would be the right way to do public
health.

But instead, they've bought in to the whole forced vaccination plan
(wherein even Biden suggested we go door-to-door to "convince" people to
get vaccinated), but as I said, we don't have an information problem, we
have a trust problem.

People don't trust that the vaccine is needed for everyone. They don't
trust that natural immunity isn't just as good as vaccine-derived
immunity. And that's because the public health apparatus has failed in
its mission.

With more outbreaks of Delta continuing, will it be just a hard time for
