**Would you be happy for your son or daughter to become a police officer
or detective? Why or why not?**

I am facing this *today*, as my middle son wants to join the police
department.

Unlike my own father who supported me in everything *except becoming a
police officer*, I'm going to support my son in whatever field of
endeavor he chooses to enter.

That said, I'm going to spend a lot of time (as I already have) exposing
him to as many of the realities of police work as I can, not the
glossies on the public affairs website. I do this through trusted
friends who are active cops, as well as by explaining the process, the
environment, and the public perception, which is very important,
especially today. He knows what he can expect his life to look like for
the foreseeable future, and he knows the danger inherent in his choice
of career.

And he wants to do it anyway.

I won't stop him because it's not my life; it's his. But I will damn
well ensure that he goes in to it with eyes wide open, knowing exactly
what it is that he's getting himself into.

Now, will I be happy? Well, I'm happy for him, because he's chosen
something he's passionate about and is going to commit himself to
achieving. That's laudable in any day and age. Am I going to be happy
about his career choice? To be honest, there are other careers he could
have chosen which I would have been happier to see him pursue, but he
wouldn't have been as happy doing. But again, it's not about me, it's
about him. He has to be happy with his own career choice, not me.
