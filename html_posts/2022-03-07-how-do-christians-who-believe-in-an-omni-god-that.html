I was going to write a long diatribe about how justice and mercy work
together, how Christians should temper justice with mercy, but then I
found this piece over at
[[GotQuestions.org](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=336f59&url=https://www.gotquestions.org/mercy-justice.html){.external_link

share.

This post highlights that **Christianity is unique in world religions in
that God shows mercy** ***through*** **justice.** In all other world
religions, justice is *set aside* in favor of mercy. Christianity
teaches that God is just and does not set aside justice to be merciful.

*Justice was served at the cross. Jesus took the punishment for our
sins, so there was no setting aside of justice. God shows us mercy when
he accepts Jesus' punishment on our behalf.* And this is all
accomplished because of God's *grace*, which allowed us to get something
we did not deserve: *salvation.*
