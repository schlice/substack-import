**Was Apple's FaceTime security flaw a huge invasion of privacy?**

It could have been, if someone exploited it.

By the time the bug became widely known, Apple had already implemented a
server-side fix to obviate the problem, so it certainly wasn't
widespread.

Apple had a bug in their software, and as soon as they learned about it,
they crafted a fix and applied that fix. As a software vendor, you can't
ask for much more than that.

If you personally feel that Apple's actions constituted an invasion of
privacy, you're welcome to sell your Apple devices and buy a Samsung
Galaxy S10. We'll welcome you into the Android fold.

And if you still want to FaceTime with your friends on iPhones, you and
they can download Google Duo, which is a cross-platform video calling
app.
