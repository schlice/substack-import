**Content:** [In most neighborhoods, cities, and states, the owner of
the property (as far as the property is concerned) is still held
responsible for the conduct of tenants and guests in the property.\
\
This does not mean that the owner is responsible legally if someone
commits a murder in their house. What this means is that if a tenant
violates local neighborhood covenants, damages the property, etc., the
owner is still liable for that violation, even though his tenant
committed it. Therefore, any repairs/refurbishment that is required are
the responsibility of the property owner. Generally, owners will charge
\"deposits\" which are used to cover some of the costs should the owner
discover damage in the property which must be repaired. Deposits
generally cost one month\'s rent, and are provided by the tenant
up-front. The owner will retain the deposit once the tenant leaves to
cover damages.\
\
Under the terms of the lease agreement, the property owner must, on his
own, seek redress for all costs related to the tenant\'s behavior
directly from the tenant, as the tenant\'s use of the house is only
covered in a lease agreement. The owner is still responsible for the
house, and as I mentioned, is responsible for what the tenants of that
house do in it. The owner will have to file civil suit to reclaim the
costs of repairing the property, as well as reclaiming the lost revenue
while the home was being repaired.]{.rendered_qtext}
