**Armed service personnel take an oath to protect and defend the
Constitution . If our Government illegally revise the 2nd Amendment,
would the military personnel be obligated to follow their superior\'s
orders knowing the Constitution was violated?**

How do you "illegally revise" the 2nd Amendment? The only way to revise
the 2nd Amendment is through...you guessed it...the amendment process.
Amendments cannot be "revised" in any other way.

While I like hypotheticals as much as the next guy, this one simply
makes no sense. An amendment cannot be illegally revised. The only thing
the government could do is pass a law, and a law that is in violation of
the 2nd Amendment is, by definition, unconstitutional.
