It's not. The TLDR here is that it's not about what clothing matters to
God. It's about what clothing matters to **you** when you go to worship
a holy God.

Honestly, these days, we understand that a church is just a group of
people. The church building rarely is a traditional church building any
more. Heck, my church meets in the local high school auditorium.
Probably half of the men in attendance go in shorts.

I just never felt comfortable wearing shorts in church. I'm aware that's
just a function of my upbringing. I did it a few times in Florida, but I
always wore clean dress-style shorts with a polo shirt and clean
sneakers or deck shoes, and it was always on a weekend that I wasn't
serving. But Florida was the exception, and even when church got out at
10:30 am, it could be well over 90 degrees F. So I allowed myself to go
in shorts occasionally. Otherwise, I'll wear a polo shirt and
comfortable pants or jeans, and sneakers or Gatsbys or Ropers with them.
Our pastors very rarely wore slacks, they were usually in clean jeans
and Gatsbys or sneakers. If they were preaching, in my old church they'd
wear a sport coat or blazer, but that's about as dressed-up as they got.
Some women wore dresses and heels, and some wore slacks, and some wore
jeans and tennis shoes.

Honestly, no one cares what you wear. God certainly doesn't care what
you wear. Heck, even the Bible talks about not adorning yourself with
fancy clothes in order to attract attention, so it's more about making
yourself feel comfortable than about dressing in a specific way.

Look, there is nothing wrong with dressing up if it makes you feel
comfortable. These days though, if I'm wearing a button-down shirt, it's
a Hawaiian shirt.

(EDIT) I want to make sure I'm covering all the bases. There are solid
arguments on the other side for why we wear nice clothes to church, so I
wanted to add a more centrist opinion I found at one of my *absolute
favorite* sources for all things Christianity:

checked them out, you should. Anyway, here's what they said about the
subject, and it is a very balanced view:
