Nope.

Because there is always *that person* who won't participate.

And then *he's the only one with a gun, because you voluntarily decided
to disarm yourself.*

At this point, there is no one fix that will "solve the 'gun problem' in
America" (if you even believe that America has a "gun problem") because
there are simply too many guns out there. Literally, there are almost
400 million guns in the US alone. Just having you and I voluntarily
disarm won't solve anything.

It might make *you* feel better, but if that's all it takes, then *you*
can voluntarily choose to disarm yourself, and leave me to my choices,
since my choices don't impact you in the slightest.

Original question:

Would the gun problem in America be solved if I don\'t carry a gun and
you don\'t carry a gun?
