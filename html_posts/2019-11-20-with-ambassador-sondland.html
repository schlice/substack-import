**With Ambassador Sondland\'s confession, is it sure now that President
Trump would be impeached?**

Even without Ambassador Sondland testimony, it was *always* sure that
President Trump would be impeached. You only need a simple majority in
the House to pass Articles of Impeachment, and Democrats have a majority
in the House. So passing Articles of Impeachment was never a question.

I don't even need a crystal ball to tell you exactly what will happen:

- Trump **will** be impeached by a partisan vote in the House.
- Trump **will not** be found guilty in the Senate trial and **will
  not** be removed from office by a partisan vote in the Senate.

The testimony isn't telling anyone anything. The Representatives who
believe Trump is a criminal will be emboldened by this testimony. The
Representatives who believe this is all a big show will continue to see
that there is nothing here worthy of impeachment. I can bet you that no
one will change their votes after all of this testimony.

Which means that this testimony is for ***your benefit***, not the
benefit of Congress. Schiff is trying to make the case to ***you*** that
impeachment is warranted. He has enough votes in the House already to
pass Articles of Impeachment. However, he needs ***you*** to be on board
with impeachment, or he's in trouble.

*And on that front, he's failing, because he's changing minds, just not
in favor of impeachment.* Democrats who think he is guilty of something
impeachable still think he's guilty of something impeachable.
Republicans who think there's nothing impeachable here are not swayed by
this testimony. Independents, however, are slowly turning against the
impeachment, and every week that this inquiry continues, more and more
Independents are polling against impeachment instead of for it. Schiff
is losing the narrative, and it does not bode well for Democrats
retaining control of the House in 2020.

The American public is on investigation overload. These inquiries don't
even move the needle for them. After two years of Mueller investigations
that ended in a big nothingburger, now they're trying the Ukraine angle,
and people are weary. Democrats in Congress are literally grasping for
anything they can in order to try to make the case to get Trump
impeached before the election, so that they can hang that around his
neck and hopefully score some points for their eventual candidate. Do
you really see something so heinous here that the President must be
impeached before the election? Do you really think that the American
people aren't smart enough to handle this on their own in the 2020
elections? In other words, if there's something so bad that Trump
shouldn't be in office, you think the American people would still
re-elect him? There's only 11 months until the General election, but
Congress literally doesn't think you can handle it. They think they need
to handle this themselves, they don't think you are smart enough to
understand whether or not Trump should stay in office.

But people also see that nothing is being accomplished in Congress
except for endless investigations, and they are even more disappointed
with Congress' work than before.

Which is why Democrats in the House are losing this war. They may win
the battle and pass Articles of Impeachment, but I think ultimately they
will lose the war.
