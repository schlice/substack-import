Some preliminary studies have shown a positive correlation between early
treatment with MS and slower disease progression, and delayed onset of
SPMS. These are long-term longitudinal studies, so they literally take
decades to complete, but we're already seeing some of those results.

This makes sense, since the MS medications slow the progress of the
disease. They also slow the onset of secondary progressive MS (SPMS),
which without treatment, a person with relapsing remitting MS (RRMS) can
expect to move to within about 10 years.
