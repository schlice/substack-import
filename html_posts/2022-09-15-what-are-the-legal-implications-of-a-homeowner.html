Before we find out whether or not the fines are legal, you must be sure
that there is no possible justification at all in the Governing
Documents which would give the HOA the authority to levy that fine.

For example, my HOA includes a provision for their Architectural Review
Board indicating that they have the **exclusive right** to deny **any**
exterior change to your house. This means that it doesn't actually have
to be listed in the document for them to deny it. Since they have the
exclusive right to deny **any** exterior change to your home, if you
make a change which is specifically not called out in the document, the
ARB can still deny it.

It is your responsibility to make sure that your Governing Documents do
not have a "catch-all" phrase like this. There's a good chance that they
do, however, so look carefully. This is the clause which gives the ARB
the authority to control how the exterior of your house looks, and so
it's likely they have such a phrase.

If you have a real estate attorney in your area who specializes in HOA
law, and offers free consultations, you might run the Governing
Documents by him or her and ask about the HOA's authority, and ask if
you have a case. If he says you don't have a case, be prepared to pay
the fines or fix the issue on your home.
