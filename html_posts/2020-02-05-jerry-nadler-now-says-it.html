**Jerry Nadler now says it\'s \"likely\" that the House will subpoena
John Bolton. Given that Donald Trump\'s Senate impeachment trial is not
going to end with Trump\'s removal from office, why?**

Because they didn't get him, and they can't let it go. Also because
they're hoping that Bolton will live up to his promise and ignore
Trump's order of executive privilege and testify anyway.

They tried to get him with Russia, they tried to get him with Mueller,
and they tried to get him with Ukraine, and none of it worked. They've
been trying to get him since election day, and they failed.

Every time they take a swing at Trump, they miss and hit the American
people instead.

There's only so many times you take a punch before you swing back. House
Democrats would do well to recognize this.
