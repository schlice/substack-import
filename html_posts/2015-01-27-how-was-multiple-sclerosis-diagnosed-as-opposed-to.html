**Content:** [MS was, and still is, a diagnosis of \"exclusion.\" You
have to \"exclude\" all known causes of the symptoms being experienced
before you can conclude that the patient has MS. In the early days, this
diagnosis of exclusion was paramount in diagnosing MS.\
\
The diagnostic criteria formerly included two episodes in different
functional systems disseminated by space and time. This means that you
could not make a positive diagnosis of MS based on one symptom. You had
to have multiple symptoms over time to positively diagnose MS. This
meant that the disease had to progress before you could begin to
effectively treat it.\
\
Diagnostic testing pre-MRI was used in addition to excluding other known
conditions. One of the methods that was used was called the \"tub
test.\" As you may know, heat exacerbates MS symptoms. Removal of the
heat causes the symptoms to decline again. Doctors would put suspected
MS patients in a hot tub and see if their symptoms got worse, and then
see if they subsided once they were removed from the tub. If their
symptoms exhibited this property, doctors suspected MS.\
\
The LP (lumbar puncture or \"spinal tap\") was also used, looking for
the protein remnants from demyelination. LPs are still used today to add
to the \"body of evidence\" that suggests a person has a demyelinating
condition like MS. Today, however, the MRI is the primary visual
diagnostic test; so much so, that in 2010, the McDonald criteria for
diagnosis of MS were updated to include one positive symptom and a
positive MRI.]{.rendered_qtext}
