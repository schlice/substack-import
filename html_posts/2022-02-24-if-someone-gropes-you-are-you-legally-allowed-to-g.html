Self-defense is the use of appropriate force to stop the act.

Self-defense is *not* the ability to commit the same crime against your
assailant.

If you grope your groper, you are just as guilty as they are.

Defend yourself against a sexual assault in whatever way you must. *But
don\'t stoop to your attacker\'s level*.

Be better.
