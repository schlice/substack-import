You may be thinking of *Griswold v. Connecticut*. This was a case in
1965 in Connecticut. They had passed a law which prohibited any person
from using \"any drug, medicinal article or instrument for the purpose
of preventing conception\".

The *Griswold* Court held that the U.S. Constitution protects \"marital
privacy\" as a fundamental constitutional right, but it struggled to
identify a particular source for the right in the Constitution\'s text.
Instead, it reasoned that the marital privacy right was implied by the
specific provisions of the Bill of Rights, such as those in the First,
Third, Fourth, and Fifth Amendments.

Reasoning that the provisions of the Bill of Rights created
\"emanations\" of protection that created \"penumbras\" within which
rights could still be covered even if they were not explicitly written
in the Constitution, Justice William O. Douglas wrote that the right to
marital privacy fell within this scope.

Several follow-on cases then used this reasoning:

- [[*Eisenstadt v.
  Baird*](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=9c51d2&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eisenstadt_v._Baird){.external_link

  *Griswold's* holding to unmarried couples, whereas the \"right of
  privacy\" in *Griswold* was said to only apply to marital
  relationships.
- [[*Roe v.
  Wade*](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=06c4f2&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade){.external_link
  rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"

  qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}  (1973) said that the
  right to privacy extended to the right to have an abortion.
- [[*Carey v. Population Services
  International*](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=131704&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carey_v._Population_Services_International){.external_link
  rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"

  qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container} (1977) said that it was
  unconstitutional to prohibit juveniles at least 16 from getting
  contraceptives.
- [[*Lawrence v.
  Texas*](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=6a92b6&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_v._Texas){.external_link
  rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"

  qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container} (2003) said that it was
  unconstitutional to prohibit same-sex sexual activity.
- [[*Obergefell v.
  Hodges*](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=9d5bd2&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obergefell_v._Hodges){.external_link
  rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"

  qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}  (2015) said that it
  was unconstitutional to prohibit same-sex marriage.
