Most of the rules which cannot be enforced are rules that run afoul of
state or local laws. This often happens when a builder and their
property management company cover more than one state. Often they have
"boilerplate" rules that they then proceed to tailor for each state and
each neighborhood, but sometimes they miss a change in those rules
before the neighborhood is established. That rule would be
unenforceable.

*(And before you say, "Ha! That makes the whole thing illegal!" every
one of these contracts has a "severability" clause, which says that if
any one part of it is ruled illegal, then the rest of it is still in
force)*

For example, in Florida, you are permitted by state law to place alarm
company signs in front of your house. HOAs routinely try to control what
signs you can put in your yard, and some HOA rules prohibit signs when
the state permits them *and* the state law says specifically that no one
may restrict the placement of the signs. Florida law also similarly
permits all Floridians to fly American flags, and again, the law says
that no HOA may restrict those flags.

In other areas, HOAs can tell homeowners *how* they can install certain
things while not outright *restricting* those things. For example, HOAs
can tell homeowners where they can install solar panels, but they cannot
restrict homeowners from installing solar at all. Similarly, they can
tell you where you can install a satellite dish, but they cannot
restrict you from installing satellite dishes at all. The only issue
would occur if the approved locations for the satellite dish do not
permit usage of the service at all, in which case the HOA's rule would
be unenforceable.

Finally, there is a common misconception that HOAs cannot issue fines
when homeowners violate their parking rules, including parking on public
streets. This is a source of tremendous confusion for homeowners,
because most people conflate "parking fines" with "parking tickets."
HOAs do not issue "parking tickets" for public streets, but they can
issue you HOA fines for breaking HOA rules. You can break HOA rules
anywhere within the purview of the HOA: on private property, on
HOA-owned property, and even on public streets.

Remember that HOA rules are governed under state *contract law*. When
you sign your HOA covenants, you are essentially signing a contract and
agreeing to abide by the rules. Those rules may include where and when
you are allowed to park within the area of the HOA, including where and
when you may park on public streets.
