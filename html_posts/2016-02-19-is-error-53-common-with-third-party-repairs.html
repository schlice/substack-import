Yes, as you know the issue occurs when particular components which are
integrated into Apple\'s security model, such as the fingerprint sensor
or touchscreen, are replaced by third-party repairers.

However, after much public pressure over forcing users to repair their
devices through Apple rather than third-party maintainers, Apple
released [[a new
version](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=09bffd&url=https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT205628){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="apple.com"}]{.qlink_container} of iOS 9.2.1 over iTunes if
your device has been hit by Error 53. This version will not
automatically be pushed to all users; you can only get it if your device
has been affected by an Error 53.

Good luck!
