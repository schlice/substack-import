If your friend told you when they plan on committing suicide, you can
call 911 to report this attempt at self-harm. Understand what this will
do: your friend will be "arrested" for their own protection, and they
will be delivered to a hospital where they can be evaluated and can
hopefully get help. How that all happens and what the process looks like
will differ from state to state, but it will all take place looking
something like that.

Anyway, it doesn't hurt to call for help if you need it. If you believe
your friend was genuine with their statement, you really should call for
help.
