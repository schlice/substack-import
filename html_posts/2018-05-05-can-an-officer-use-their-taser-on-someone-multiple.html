**Can an officer use their taser on someone multiple times if they were
not charged with a crime?**

Yes. There is no requirement that a person must be charged with a crime
before a Taser can be deployed.

The Taser is a "pain compliance" device, so the only requirement is that
there is a directive given by police with which the suspect is failing
to comply. The Taser is used to "encourage" compliance with that
directive.
