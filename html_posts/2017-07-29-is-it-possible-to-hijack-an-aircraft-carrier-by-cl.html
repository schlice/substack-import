Is it possible? Sure, anything is possible. It\'s also possible that I
will be struck by lightning after I get bitten by a shark during a
nuclear holocaust.

Either of those scenarios are possible.

But are they *likely?*

No. Not in the slightest. The odds of either are so astronomically both
that they approach being impossible.
