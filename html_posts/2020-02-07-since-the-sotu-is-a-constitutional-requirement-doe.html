**Since the SOTU is a Constitutional requirement, does it need to be
accurate? Is the President allowed to lie to Congress?**

The Constitution does not specify the content of the State of the Union,
so the short answer is no.

Additionally, it's a political speech. This means it can be "accurate"
while still having factual inconsistencies. Both of those can be true.

Finally, can the President lie to Congress? Unless he's under oath in a
court of law, yes he can.
