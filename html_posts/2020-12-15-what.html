**What's next for the GOP now that Senator McConnell has publicly broken
away from President Trump by acknowledging Joe Biden as
president-elect?**

Call him what you like, but McConnell is a realist. Now that the
Electoral College has voted (even though those votes won't be certified
until the new Congress is sworn in in January), there's very, very
little chance that Biden won't be sworn in as scheduled. The only
remaining roadblocks are the stuff of conspiracy theorists.

In other words, most rational people understand at this point that Biden
is president-elect.
