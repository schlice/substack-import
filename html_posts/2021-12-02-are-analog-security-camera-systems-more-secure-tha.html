There's a few terms we need to compare and contrast:

- Wired vs Wireless
- Analog vs Digital

You can have any combination of either technology. You can have wired
digital cameras (using CAT5 Ethernet cable), or wired analog cameras
(using BNC, or "coaxial" cables). You can also have wireless versions of
both analog or digital cameras (which I'll discuss in a minute).

*Theoretically,* wired cameras are less prone to hacking or jamming
because they are wired. There isn't a wireless signal which can be
jammed.

However, there are two types of wireless cameras: *wireless*
***analog*** *cameras,* and *wireless digital cameras*. Older wireless
cameras communicated to their base station DVRs using wireless analog
signals. These wireless cameras used RF antennas to communicate with
their base stations. The RF signal was far less reliable than today's
cameras, as it was prone to interference from other wireless devices
like cordless phones or sometimes cell phones.

*Wireless digital cameras* communicate using Wi-Fi. This is an IP-based
network, not a radio transmission of an analog signal. Wi-Fi cameras are
just as secure as any other wireless device on your home wireless
network. They do not rely on a base station receiver to work; they
connect to your wireless access point (AP) on your home network. Usually
that is your Internet Service Provider's (ISP's) home router supplied to
you when you signed up for their service. It could also be a Google or
Netgear or eero or other mesh network device.

So these days, you don't have to run a wire to get secure, clear video
pictures. Wi-Fi cameras will do the job for you.

Original question:

Are analog security camera systems more secure than ones with antennas
for its DVR receiver through which they communicate. (lorex. com) How
secure they are and or what is needed to ensure they are not easily
jammed or hacked etc?
