There is some research around microchimerism and MS in twins.

[[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/\...](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=853b67&url=https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16843535/){.external_link

But the research hasn't gone far enough to suggest that chimerism is the
cause of MS.

And then I read this:

[[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/\...](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=55b643&url=https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17531842/){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="nih.gov"}]{.qlink_container}

And the abstract is telling (**emphasis** mine):

> Scientific advances have demonstrated that autoreactive cells are a

So the first thing we learned:

**Chimeric cells engraft in the host body, develop, proliferate, and are
accepted by the immune system as self.**

Therefore, your theory of microchimeric cells as viewed by the immune
system as invaders and thus as a trigger for disease process is
incorrect.

The next thing we learned:

**MC has been considered a risk factor in autoimmune disease induction.
However, today we know it is a natural phenomenon.**

It's even considered to be a "natural model" of successful
transplantation.

So microchimeric cells are indeed being studied, but not exactly in the
way you thought. They are definitely being studied in conjunction with
mesenchymal stem cells to investigate mostly if treatments like HSCT
might be beneficial for people with MS.
