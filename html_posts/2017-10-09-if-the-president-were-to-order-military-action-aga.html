Let's take the question a piece at a time:

**If the President were to order military action against North Korea,
would the military be obliged to carry it out**

Yes. Full stop. The President is the Commander-in-Chief. If the
President gives an order, you go. Period. Failure to do so is considered
insubordination and is prosecutable by court-martial and Article 15.
You'll be out on your ear, and so much for your pension.

**if there were no attacks or other hostile actions**

There are no rules that say what has to happen before the President may
order military action.

**with no resolution by an international body**

Thankfully, "international bodies" do not have sovereignty over a
sovereign nation. They can "resolve," they can "advise" and even
"denounce" actions, but they have no authority over what a sovereign
nation does in its own self-interest. Only the United States has
authority over what the United States does. International bodies can
"strongly disagree," but they don't determine when a sovereign nation
does things.

**and no declaration of war by Congress**

This one is covered under US law. The War Powers Act gives a president
90 days after he commits troops to a conflict to get an *AUMF* (an
Authorization for the Use of Military Force), or a declaration of war,
from Congress. If he fails to get such an authorization, the troops must
be withdrawn. Note that Congress does not need to declare war. Congress
needs only authorize the use of military force, which is basically a
recognition that while short of declaring war, the President has at
least justified what he did.

The conflict here is that according to the Constitution, Congress has
the power to declare war (Article I Section 8), but the President is the
Commander-in-Chief (Article II Section 2). This is where the War Powers
Act tries (unsuccessfully, but at least tries) to fill the void between
the two Constitutional directives.
