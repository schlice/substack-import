title: "How fast does a radar track your speed? I got a speeding ticket on the NJ Turn Pike. I am always aware of this one spot because if I was a cop I would hide there. I saw the unmarked police car right away spiked my brakes and moved to the slow lane."

The short answer: he had your speed before you saw him. He knows you
slowed down and moved over, but in your case, he already had you.

Acquisition speed of a typical radar unit is approximately 0.3 seconds.
So by the time your brain registered the fact that the car was there,
your speed was already up on the screen.
