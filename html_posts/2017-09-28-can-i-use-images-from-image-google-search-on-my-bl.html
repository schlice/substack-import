The answer is a definite *maybe.*

First, you have to determine what your blog post is about. Are you
reporting on the picture? Are you providing facts about the picture?
This may be considered *fair use* if you need the picture in order to
comment on the picture.

Is it just supposed to be a "stock photo" in your blog post? The picture
may be protected by copyright, and using it without permission may get
you a DMCA Takedown notice. Be sure you use Google's filter to show you
only "Free to Use" photos when you search. In Google Images, click on
Settings \> Advanced Search. Scroll down to the section titled, "Then
narrow your search by..." and look at the "Usage Rights" section. Be
sure to select a choice that includes "free to use or share."
