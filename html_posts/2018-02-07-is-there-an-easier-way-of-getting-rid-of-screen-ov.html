*Please Note: I have no affiliation with this app or its developer*

The app I use to overcome the "screen overlay" issue is called [[Install
Button
Unlocker](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=107890&url=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id%3Djp.sfapps.installbuttonunlocker%26hl%3Den){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="google.com"}]{.qlink_container} from SFApps. It will
forcibly push the button beneath the overlay. After you install and run
it, you'll see a small lock icon on the buttons which are affected by
the screen overlay issue.

The buttons which are affected:

- INSTALL button（From Android 4.1 to 7.1）\
  It will be displayed when you install the app from the apk file.
- VPN button（Android 4.3 or lator）\
  It will be displayed when you want to allow VPN.
- Accessibility button（From Android 5.0 to 7.1）\
  It will be displayed when you activate accessibility features.
- ALLOW button（Android 6.0）\
  It will be displayed when an app requests permissions. It is also
  effective for permission buttons on the \"App permissions\" screen in
  the settings.
- START NOW button（From Android 6.0 to 7.1）\
  It will be displayed when you start a screen capture.
- ACTIVATE button（From Android 6.0 to 7.1）\
  It will be displayed when you activate device administrator.

Note that the free version is ad-supported, so on random clicks of
buttons where screen overlay is bypassed, you will see an ad pop up, or
it will open the Play Store and show you all of the apps published by
SFApps. Performing an in-app purchase will prevent these ads.

I'm not a big fan of adware, but this software works. I've had great
success with it on several phones, so I live with the occasional ad.
