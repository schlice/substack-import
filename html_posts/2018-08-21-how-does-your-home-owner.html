**How does your home owner\'s association handle meetings?**

For our HOA (as is the norm for most moderately-sized HOAs), the meeting
date, time, and location is publicized to all the owners, usually on a
website or bulletin. Homeowners are all invited to attend the monthly
meetings. The Board can go into "executive session" if they are going to
discuss matters pertaining to individual homeowners, so as to maintain
privacy. Only Board members are allowed to attend executive session
portions of meetings.

Once a year, we hold an Annual Meeting and review the budget, priorities
for the year, and futures. We will also vote on new Board members. All
homeowners are invited to the Annual Meeting, which we usually hold in a
nearby school gymnasium or meeting area. We will send out proxy cards in
advance of the meeting if you can't attend but you want your vote to
count. You can proxy your vote to any Board member, or the Board
President by default.
