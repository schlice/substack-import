**Zero.**

No one who actually has MS has been cured of their MS.

This shouldn't be a controversial position. We don't know what causes
MS, so we don't have a cure for MS.

Some people *claim* that they have a cure for MS. But to date, every
cure someone believes they have has been shown to not work for everyone
with MS.

Therefore, *it's not a cure.*

There isn't a diet that cures MS yet. There isn't a treatment that cures
MS yet. There isn't a drug that cures MS yet.

Said another way, if you "had MS," and you did something (a drug, a
supplement, a treatment, a diet, etc) and it "cured your MS," you didn't
have MS. Period, full stop. You may have had a disease that mimicked MS
(lesions on an MRI and all), but it wasn't MS.
