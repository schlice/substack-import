For starters, like [[Luke
Hayter](https://www.quora.com/profile/Luke-Hayter)]{.qlink_container}
said, keep your nose clean. But just because you may have gotten
yourself into some minor teenage trouble, don\'t think you\'re
immediately disqualified. Everyone understands you\'re a teenager and
you\'ll do stupid teenage stuff. ***Consistently*** doing the same
stupid stuff would be a red flag. Doing something stupid *and learning
from it* is normal.

At your age, I\'d suggest you do the best you can in school, be involved
in sports teams or pursue a workout schedule to maintain physical
fitness, and be an example in your community and in your home life. Be a
leader.

If you go to college first, I\'d suggest a Criminal Justice degree or
something along those lines.
