Proving that God exists using logic an philosophy is the correct way to
prove God's existence. The proof is not complex at all.

We start with the fact that **we exist**. Life is not an illusion. We're
not a figment of imagination. We really, actually exist.

We exist inside of a universe which we have (largely) observed. And we
have used the scientific method (observation and repetition) to
determine some rules about the universe in which we live, and how it
works. We call these "laws." The laws of conservation of energy tell us
that you can't get something from nothing. And the law of causality
tells us that everything which has a beginning has a cause.

Yet, in a universe in which the laws of conservation of energy exist,
the universe itself was created out of nothing. We know this is true
thanks to Einstein's theory of General Relativity, which states that all
time, all matter, and all space began at a single point. General
Relativity has been proven accurate down to five decimal places.

So in a universe which is governed by physical laws, *the very existence
of this universe violates those laws*. We got something from nothing.

This means that there must be a ***supernatural*** (outside of the
natural) cause for the universe's existence. We know that the universe
had a beginning, and thus a cause. That cause must be outside of the
natural, because it existed before the universe did.

This forms the basis of the **Cosmological Argument** for God's
existence:

1.  The Law of Causality tells us that everything that has a beginning
    has a cause.
2.  The universe had a beginning.
3.  Therefore, the universe had a cause.

And since something undeniably exists today, then something must have
always existed. The only two choices are the universe, or something
which created the universe. And since the universe had a beginning, it
must have had a Beginner.

We also know that there was *intelligence in the design of the universe
and of life*. DNA proves that there was intelligence in the design of
life, and the myriad of [[anthropic
constants](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=ad1198&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropic_principle){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container} proves that there was
intelligence in the design of the universe.

This, by the way, leads us to the **Teleological Argument** for God's
existence:

1.  Every design had a designer.
2.  As verified by the Anthropic Principle, we know *beyond a reasonable
    doubt* that the universe was designed.
3.  Therefore, the universe had a Designer.

And if you want to get even more philosophical, try out the **Kalam
Argument** for why the universe had a beginning**:**

1.  An infinite number of days has no beginning and no end.
2.  But today is the end date of history (history being a collection of
    all days).
3.  Therefore, there were not an infinite number of days before today.

In other words, time had a beginning, which correlates well with
Einstein's findings.
