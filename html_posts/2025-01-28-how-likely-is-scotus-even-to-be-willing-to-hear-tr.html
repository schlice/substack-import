Thank you for the answer request,
[[Myname](https://www.quora.com/profile/Myname-271)]{.qlink_container}.

First, one circuit court judge cannot "strike down" an Executive Order
***permanently***, meaning that there is no avenue for appeal. Indeed, a
Circuit Court judge can issue a temporary injunction to delay the
implementation of the EO until appeals have been exhausted.

Secondly, Judge Coughenour is part of the Ninth Circus\...er\...Circuit,
which has traditionally held very progressive views not necessarily in
keeping with a more originalist Constitutional interpretation.

Now, on to the EO.

Many people have claimed that the EO is unconstitutional. I challenge
any one of those people to show me where "birthright citizenship" is
found in the 14th Amendment.

No case law which has come since has actually ruled on this issue.

Trump's EO did not actually "overrule" the 14th Amendment. It simply
codified the appropriate interpretation of the phrase "and subject to
the jurisdiction thereof". It stated that illegal immigrants are not
subject to the jurisdiction of the United States when it comes to
citizenship, and therefore their children are not automatically granted
US citizenship.

And as I predicted years ago, it was the 9th Circus that immediately
passed the temporary injunction on the EO. Therefore, (by design), the
Supreme Court will have the opportunity to rule on the 14th Amendment's
applicability to illegal immigrants.

**I believe that the 14th Amendment was never intended to grant
citizenship to the children of illegal immigrants.** Here's part of how
I came to this conclusion.

The people who wrote the 14th Amendment intended it to apply to recently
freed slaves, and they used it as part of the way to reverse some of the
injustices of the *Dred Scot* ruling. They never intended to imply that
anyone born on American soil immediately becomes an American citizen. At
the time of the writing of the Reconstruction Amendments, *the US
literally had no concept of "illegal immigration."*

The original authors recognized that citizens of foreign governments
were not "subject to the jurisdiction" of the United States, or at least
in the way that mattered to them. This is evident in the fact that they
presumed the Citizenship Clause of the 14th Amendment was similar to
what we had in the Civil Rights Act of 1866, that it excludes American
Indians who maintain their tribal ties and \"persons born in the United
States who are foreigners, aliens, who belong to the families of
ambassadors or foreign ministers". They all agreed that children of
ambassadors were not citizens, but children who were born in the United
States to legal immigrants (even if they were not citizens) were.

Senator Jacob Howard worked closely with Abraham Lincoln in drafting and
passing the 13th Amendment (which abolished slavery). He also served on
the Senate Joint Committee on Reconstruction, which drafted the 14th
Amendment. In 1866, Senator Howard clearly spelled out the intent of the
14th Amendment by writing (emphasis mine):

> Every person born within the limits of the United States, and subject
> to their jurisdiction, is by virtue of natural law and national law a
> citizen of the United States. **This will not, of course, include
> persons born in the United States who are foreigners, aliens, who
> belong to the families of ambassadors or foreign ministers accredited
> to the Government of the United States**, but will include every other
> class of persons. It settles the great question of citizenship and
> removes all doubt as to what persons are or are not citizens of the
> United States. This has long been a great desideratum in the
> jurisprudence and legislation of this country.

To me, from the plain wording of the writers of the 14th Amendment, it
was never intended to grant citizenship to children of illegals. For
one, how can a person be "born in the United States who \[is a\]
foreigner, \[or an\] alien" if the 14th Amendment grants citizenship to
*anyone* born on US soil? Those people would not exist if the current
understanding of the 14th Amendment stands. So by that reading, clearly
there were people who could be born on US soil who would not
automatically become US citizens. Perhaps we're using the wrong
interpretation of the phrase "subject to the jurisdiction thereof."
There would be no need to add "subject to the jurisdiction thereof" to
the Amendment if it was meant to apply to every person born on US soil
regardless of whether they were legally permitted to be there or not.
Therefore, the phrase "subject to the jurisdiction thereof" must mean
that there are additional qualifications to simply being "born" in the
United States.

In actuality, [[according to Ilya Shapiro of the CATO
Institute](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=0372f5&url=https://www.cato.org/blog/birthright-citizenship-constitutionally-required){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="cato.org"}]{.qlink_container}, that phrase was originally
written to exclude the children of Native American tribes from American
citizenship, since those children were "subject to the jurisdiction of"
Native American tribal government, and were citizens of their tribe, not
of the United States. If we apply the same reasoning to illegal
immigrants, the children born to parents who are subject to the
jurisdiction of *another* government **are not US citizens**. This is
why Howard expanded "foreigners" and "aliens" into the understanding of
those who would not be granted citizenship, because they were not
subject to the complete authority of the United States, as they had
allegiance to another government.

Additionally, there is no reason for Howard to say "foreigners, aliens,
who belong to the families of ambassadors or foreign ministers" if
"foreigners, aliens" only referred to babies "who belong to the families
of ambassadors or foreign ministers." If that was the case, then
"foreigners, aliens" would be superfluous. I believe that "foreigners,
aliens" intended to ***expand*** the set of people to whom citizenship
would not be granted. Indeed, I believe Howard meant that children of
"foreigners" and "aliens" should not get citizenship as we do today. So
I believe that the complete set of people to whom automatic citizenship
did not extend includes:

- foreigners
- aliens
- \[babies\] who belong to the families of ambassadors or foreign
  ministers accredited to the Government of the United States

While the original authors agreed that children of legal immigrants
would gain citizenship, that same concurrence in opinion does not
address the children of **illegal immigrants.** Indeed, the *Wong Kim
Ark* case only addressed the birth of children to people lawfully
present in the United States. Edward Erler argued that since the *Wong
Kim Ark* case dealt with someone whose parents were lawful permanent
residents (green card holders), there is no valid basis under the 14th
Amendment for the practice of granting citizenship to U.S.-born children
of illegal immigrants. He writes, \"Even if the logic is that Wong Kim
Ark became a citizen by birth with the permission of the United States
when it admitted his parents to the country, no such permission has been
given to those who enter illegally." According to law professor Lino
Graglia of the University of Texas, even if *Wong Kim Ark* settled the
status of children of legal residents, it did not do so for children of
illegal residents; [[Graglia
asserts](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=710ceb&url=https://law.utexas.edu/faculty/publications/2009-Birthright-Citizenship-for-Children-of-Illegal-Aliens-An-Irrational-Public-Policy/){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="utexas.edu"}]{.qlink_container} that the case weighs against
automatic birthright for illegal immigrants because the Court denied
such citizenship for an analogous group, namely \"children of alien
enemies, born during and within their hostile occupation\".

Therefore, because the Amendment does not address the question of
whether legal citizenship is granted to children of illegal immigrants,
it has been handled exclusively by *immigration policy.* If that is
true, and Congress has granted sole authority to the President to
administer immigration policy (which it has), the Executive Branch
implementation of that policy can be overridden with a simple Executive
Order. However, the broader Constitutional question of whether the 14th
Amendment conveys birthright citizenship to the children of illegal
immigrants has never been decided. SCOTUS now has an opportunity to take
a swing at that question.

The OAS agrees with this interpretation, despite the fact that nearly
every nation in the OAS recognizes birthright citizenship. The
[[American Convention on Human
Rights](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=56cc95&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Convention_on_Human_Rights){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container} clarifies (emphasis mine)
that "\[e\]very person has the right to the nationality of the state in
whose territory he was born **if he does not have the right to any other
nationality**."
