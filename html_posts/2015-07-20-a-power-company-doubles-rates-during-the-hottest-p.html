**Content:** [Depending on where you live, it may not necessarily be
legal. How they went about the rate change is probably what you\'re
looking at contesting. If the power company is going to impose new
rates, there are notification periods, city approvals, etc. Again it all
depends on where you live. Check out your city\'s regulations on the
power company and rate changes. Check to make sure that the rate change
was approved in accordance with local laws.\
\
***Why*** they are doing it, however, is no mystery. It\'s called
**supply and demand.**\
\
Supply and demand theory says (basically) the following:\

- All else being equal, if supply increases, price decreases.
- All else being equal, if demand increases, price increases.\

The power company increases the rates during the period of peak demand.
The power systems have to work the hardest during that peak period, and
so the production of energy costs more to the power company. So it\'s
not just that \"it\'s the hottest part of the day,\" but it\'s the part
of the day that the power company has the highest load on their
equipment, making it the costliest part of the day to produce energy.\
\
The increase in price during peak load times can serve several
functions: it helps to recoup the additional cost of producing energy
during those times, and it may also encourage people to conserve energy.
