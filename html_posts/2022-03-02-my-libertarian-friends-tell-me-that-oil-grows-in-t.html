No offense, but you need smarter friends.

Oil doesn't grow in the ground. While oil is formed in the ground, it
doesn't "grow" like a plant. And God may have created the world and set
the conditions under which oil can develop, but he doesn't make the oil
appear in the ground any more than he actually moves my muscles to make
me walk. He built the world and created the natural rules under which
the world operates, but he doesn't directly "cause the oil to appear
with magic."

Original question:

My Libertarian friends tell me that oil grows in the ground, and my
Christian friends tell me that God makes the oil appear in the ground
with magic. Who is right?
