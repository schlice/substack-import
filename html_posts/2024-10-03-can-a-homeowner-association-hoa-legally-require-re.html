As with all legal questions, the answer is "it depends," and in this
case it depends on the rules in the HOA's Governing Documents.

If the HOA needs to regulate who parks in the community's garage, the
HOA can issue parking permits to cars which are permitted to use the
garage. To issue parking permits, the car to which the permit is being
issued can be recorded, including the "ID numbers" (in the US, we call
them "license plates") assigned to the car.
