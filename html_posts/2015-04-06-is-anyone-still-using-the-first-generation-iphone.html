**Content:** [The problem you run into is that applications are
continually updated and enhanced to take advantage of newer hardware,
screen resolutions, and memory. Without upgrading the hardware, you\'ll
find it difficult to run newer applications.\
\
There will be older versions of applications available for some time
that you can run in some circumstances, but not all.\
\
So usability in terms of applications will be limited.\
\
Core functionality (telephone and SMS functionality) will still work
correctly, but any other application functionality will be severely
limited.]{.rendered_qtext}
