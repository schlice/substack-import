**Content:** [There is a heavy conservative tilt in the military, as
conservative values are very much in line with the core values of the
military services.\
\
That said, your political viewpoint is irrelevant in military service.
You cannot attend political functions as a representative of the
military; this is illegal under UCMJ. You cannot promote any one
political party while in uniform.\
\
So are there socialists/communists in the military? Possibly. We used to
have questions on our security clearance questionnaires that asked
whether or not you belonged to any Communist organizations. I\'m pretty
sure that one is out, and the question is simply now whether or not you
belong to any group that seeks to overthrow the government.\
\
So you can belong to whatever group you want, so long as you don\'t seek
to overthrow the government.]{.rendered_qtext}
