**Is it okay for your husband to be in a room with naked women without
you?**

There are a few circumstances in which your husband can be in a room
with naked women without you:

- Your husband is a doctor
- Your husband is a police officer and he is arresting the naked woman
- Your husband is a massage therapist, and the naked woman is under a
  sheet, and he only exposes the parts he needs to work on

Outside of these narrow exceptions, your husband should question his
need to be in a room with naked women without you there.
