Too late, we already have it. It's called the police.

I know what you're thinking. *The police will never arrest a police
officer.*

committed a crime, he goes to jail. Don't forget, police are under twice
or three times the scrutiny that civilians are under when they fire
their weapons. Not only is the district attorney investigating (just as
a civilian), but the police run their own internal investigation to
ensure the officer followed all department regulations and guidelines,
that his training was up to date, and that he didn't violate any
department policy. There could also be a third investigation by the US
Justice Department to ensure that there were no civil rights violations.

But to clarify your statement, police don't get arrested if they are
wrong. Actually, police are protected from honest mistakes by the law.
If they make honest mistakes of fact, fully believing they were
following the law and their department's policies, they are legally
indemnified against lawsuits.

Police get arrested if they break the law, just like anyone else.
