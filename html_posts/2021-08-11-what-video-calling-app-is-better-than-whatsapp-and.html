Better than WhatsApp and Facetime? Sure, I'll bite.

First, let's talk about whether or not WhatsApp and FaceTime are "bad"
and worthy of "finding something better."

WhatsApp is owned by Facebook. They collect a *long* list of data on
you, all linked to your identity. They collect way more information
about you than any other chat app. And we know why they do it: because
they sell that data. Remember, if a product is free, *you* are the
product. So it's not that they collect data, it's *how much* data they
collect. I am uncomfortable with that level of intrusion into my privacy
so I can make an end-to-end encrypted call which I can do elsewhere.

And FaceTime is a walled-garden. While Apple devices have a slight edge
in the United States (about 51% of smartphones in the US are Apple),
they lag in the rest of the world. And while FaceTime has opened up web
sessions which can be accessed elsewhere, it's a workaround, not a
seamless solution. There's no FaceTime client for Android. You cannot
*start* a FaceTime call on anything but an Apple device. If someone in a
FaceTime call creates a *join link* for you, you can join from a Web
browser on a PC or Android, but you can't start a FaceTime call unless
you're on an Apple device.

So, is there a better option? Most assuredly, yes.

That app?
