**Content:** [No, the arrest in and of itself is not a violation of the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights. You do not have a right to be
free from arrest for crimes which the State believes you have committed.
You have a right to be treated fairly and humanely while you are
incarcerated by the State. You have the right to food, clean water, and
medical care. You have the right to humane living conditions.\
\
If the State makes a law that says that simply being a \"thief in law\"
is illegal, not actually performing some other criminal act, then the
act of arresting you for being a thief in law is not a violation. It is
a law, and the State is carrying out the law. However, if the State
treats you inhumanely while you are incarcerated, that is a violation of
the Universal Declaration.]{.rendered_qtext}
