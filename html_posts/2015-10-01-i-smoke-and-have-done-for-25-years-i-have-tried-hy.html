**Content:** [You\'re never going to quit until you actually want to
quit, and right now, the nicotine is controlling you.\
\
You might think about e-cigarettes. I know you said you tried
\"substitutes,\" but e-cigarettes deliver all of the nicotine without
all the harmful toxins of tobacco smoke. You get a very similar
sensation when \"vaping\" that you do from a cigarette.\
\
Start out with a starter set and move on to more powerful sets if you
choose. You\'ll be able to gradually step down the dose of nicotine in
your vape oil until you\'re free of the drug
completely.]{.rendered_qtext}
