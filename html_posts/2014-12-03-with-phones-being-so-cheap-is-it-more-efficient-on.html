**Content:** [Is it more efficient? Certainly. One phone that does
nothing but GPS mapping and a second that just provides a Wi-Fi
hotspot.\
\
But is it more convenient? Not really. You have to start your Wi-Fi
hotspot instead of your mapping app, and you have to maintain two
devices.\
\
As far as efficiency, it is. But it is definitely less
convenient.]{.rendered_qtext}
