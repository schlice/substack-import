<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Is it more efficient? Certainly. One phone that does<br>nothing but GPS mapping and a second that just provides a Wi-Fi<br>hotspot.\<br>\<br>But is it more convenient? Not really. You have to start your Wi-Fi<br>hotspot instead of your mapping app, and you have to maintain two<br>devices.\<br>\<br>As far as efficiency, it is. But it is definitely less<br>convenient.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
