And after all that work:

- The rate of homicides continued to decline at exactly the same rate as
  before. There was absolutely no effect to the overall rate of gun
  homicides.
- There were no *gun* massacres, but there were plenty of *arsons*
  though, the new favorite tool of the criminal element. A few lengths
  of chain, a few padlocks, and a whole bunch of gasoline and, as the
  arsonists found out, you could easily put Port Arthur to shame.
  Additionally, the whole "there were no gun massacres" thing is pretty
  disingenuous. From
  [[Wikipedia](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=44de96&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_laws_in_Australia){.external_link
  rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
  onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
  qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}, "a 2016 study using
  data from the Australian National Injury Surveillance Unit reported
  that there were no mass firearm killings following the 1996 gun law
  reforms through May 2016. They also reported a more rapid decline in
  firearm deaths between 1997 and 2013 compared with between 1979 and
  1997, but there was also a decline in total non-firearm suicide and
  homicide deaths of a greater magnitude. Because of this, the
  investigators concluded it was not possible to conclude with any
  certainty that the change in firearm deaths could be attributed to the
  gun law reforms"
- The government expended *billions* of dollars and, as you rightly
  stated, there are still black market guns, and you're back to about
  the same number of guns you had before. Regulations or not, they are
  just as lethal. And criminals still have a thriving black market to
  choose from.
- Plus, you neglected to mention, there now exists a comfortable **gray
  market** of guns which were never turned in during the confiscation
  period. Indeed, many of the guns which were turned in were rusty old
  hunks of metal or old collector's pieces. There are still several
  hundred thousand gray market guns.

Maybe the gun laws reduced mass shootings, but did they at least reduce
gun-related ***homicides***? That is hotly disputed. University of
Melbourne researchers Wang-Sheng Lee and Sandy Suardi wrote a report in
[[2008 on this
issue.](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=6a1476&url=http://www.nationalreview.com/article/425021/australias-1996-gun-confiscation-didnt-work-and-it-wouldnt-work-america-mark-antonio){.external_link

]{.qlink_container}The closing statement in that report: "There is
little evidence to suggest that \[the Australian mandatory gun-buyback
program\] had any significant effects on firearm homicides...Although
gun buybacks appear to be a logical and sensible policy that helps to
placate the public's fears, the evidence so far suggests that in the
Australian context, the high expenditure incurred to fund the 1996 gun
buyback has not translated into any tangible reductions in terms of
firearm deaths."

So I submit that of everything you said, your last statement is the most
accurate: *There are still black market guns to be had by the
professional criminal. But the gun culture has changed.*

I submit to you: is changing a nation's culture worth the cost? I
believe you need to see some more tangible results before spending
billions of dollars to literally accomplish nothing more than to change
a nation's culture.

Thank you, but unless you're able to show ***real benefit***, I think
we'll pass.

And sorry for spoiling the whole Australia secret you had going there.
