**Content:** [Besides the tidbit that WTC7 is the first known steel
building that collapsed purely because of uncontrolled fire, most
Americans are ***far***, **far** more concerned about what happened to
WTC1 and WTC2 than what happened to WTC7.\
\
Regardless of what the conspiracy theorists claim, WTC7 would never have
collapsed if WTC1 and WTC2 did not collapse. So any objective analysis
of the collapse of WTC7 must state that it was caused by uncontrolled
fires ***triggered by the destruction of WTC1 and
WTC2.***]{.rendered_qtext}
