**How do I beat a no-camera traffic ticket for running a red light? The
light was yellow as I was driving under it.**

At least in Colorado, the light has to be red *before* you enter the
intersection. Your state may be different. You'll have to check the laws
in your state.

If the light was yellow when you entered the intersection, and your
state's laws specify that the light must be red before you cross the
stop line, you can challenge the officer's view of your tires with
respect to the stop line. Find the officer's position relative to your
car, and challenge the fact that he could clearly see your front tires
at the time that the light turned red.

If the officer had a clear view of your tires and he says you were not
across the stop line when the light turned red, it's his word against
yours. There's probably not much you can do other than pay the fine and
do better next time. Don't try to run yellow lights.
