**Can I trade in my Samsung Galaxy 8 with cracked screen and get credit
towards a new phone?**

Depends on what you mean by "trade in."

If you're literally talking about a trade-in program, some carriers
offer this service. You can turn in a phone which you own outright, in
any condition, and they will give you a certain amount of money for that
phone, depending on the amount of damage. You can immediately apply that
money towards the purchase of a new device, take it as bill credits,
etc.

If you don't own the phone (i.e. you're leasing it or making no-interest
payments on its purchase), before you can trade it in, you have to fix
it.
