Every organization is different, and every organization uses different
radios and different alerts. Most digital trunked radios have RD (Radio
Distress) buttons which send a signal to dispatch with the officer's
radio number. On some models, the mic is held open for 10--15 seconds
when the RD is activated.

Since every radio is different, I can't tell you where each and every RD
button is on the radio, nor would that be a wise thing to do, as it is
generally accepted to be "close-hold" information, so that you don't
spook a potential attacker by pressing what they know to be the RD
button.

*(This is an example of a RD button on an older digital radio; the last
agency I worked at where we had functioning RD buttons used one that
looked similar to this, including the mic extender)*

At one military base at which I worked, the RD button was on top of the
radio. It was recessed below the surface of the radio so that it could
not accidentally be bumped. It was off to the side of the upper part of
the handheld radio, next to the volume and channel knobs. You would have
to work pretty hard to push the button; it wasn't something you could
bump with your elbow. At the beginning of the shift, each post and
patrol would call out their status and then press their RD. This allowed
dispatch to record the RD number for each radio, since they were issued
at the beginning of the shift. We would let it broadcast for a few
seconds, then power-cycle the radio to stop it (that was the only way to
stop the RD from broadcasting). It took less than a second for the radio
number of the radio broadcasting the distress to appear on the display
in dispatch.
