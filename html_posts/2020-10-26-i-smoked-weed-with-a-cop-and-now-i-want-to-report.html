**I smoked weed with a cop and now I want to report him. Why should I
not do it?**

Your motives are suspect. You participated in this illegal act with the
person you are reporting. This places you in exactly the same legal
trouble that it places him. You realize that you must confess to
breaking the law in order to "out" this officer. If you are both
punished, who do you think will be treated better?

What are you hoping to gain from this? You think he will be fired? You
don't control that, only the department does. So you get convicted and
he doesn't lose his job. Maybe he gets a reprimand. If he gets enough of
those, it might impact his promotions, or maybe even his job, but not
necessarily for a one-time mistake. Some departments have a
zero-tolerance policy on marijuana, but some may not.

And it's your word against his. Many people wrongly blame the police
when they are caught after doing something wrong. People wrongly hold
grudges and try to "get back" at the police for having the audacity of
pointing out that actions have consequences. So the department may not
be likely to value your word over the word of their officer, who they
vetted and trust.
