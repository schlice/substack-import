First of all, the Bible is not a fortune teller. It's not a Farmer's
Almanac. It isn't designed to "tell you the future" any more than the
Farmer's Almanac is designed to tell you who's going to win the 2030
World Series.

***The Bible is designed to point YOU in the right direction for YOUR
future!***

And for those who persist and say that the Bible is accurately
predicting natural disasters and wars, I say that even a stopped clock
is right twice a day. Yeah, maybe the Bible gets some of these right,
but as I mentioned, the whole point of the Bible is not to predict
future events with startling accuracy. It's to help YOU reach YOUR
future.

> one is stronger.**

Really? You really think that GOD has to PROVE himself to *US*? Who does
she think God is? Who does she think *WE* are that we are somehow
ENTITLED to God's EXPLANATIONS and DEMONSTRATIONS of His power?

If that were the case and God was doing this to prove something to us,
why wouldn't he answer some even more basic questions, like *why does he
allow evil to persist in the world? What is the purpose of our
suffering? Why did Jesus have to suffer on the cross before He died?*

God is not obligated to answer ANY of our questions, and even claiming
that he need to "showcase" His power to us for some reason is almost
blasphemous to utter!

> *"For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my
> ways," declares the Lord. "As the heavens are higher than the earth,
> so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your
> thoughts."*
>
> - Isaiah 55:8--9 (NIV)

Even if He *wanted* to answer our questions and showcase His power and
reveal His plans, it's very likely, according to this, that ***we
probably wouldn't even understand, because we're simply incapable of
understanding.***

As Christians, we must rely on God's Word, and rely on the fact that He
always keeps His promises. He has promised to return; you must believe
that He will keep that promise and return. He has promised that ***all
who believe in Him*** will have eternal life (John 3:16). You must
believe that.

This is the basis of *faith*. But faith is not ungrounded. Faith is
founded in truth and logic. There is evidence to show that He has kept
His promises, so we have faith that He will continue to do so.
