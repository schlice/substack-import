Let's unpack your question.

> **Is it proper to require a disabled new member of a group to use a
> provided wheelchair**

A venue can require that a wheelchair-bound person transfer into a
provided wheelchair. This may be for important reasons, like standard
wheelchair widths may not fit the aisles, or the wheelchair may have
special adaptations for the venue. The venue should specify, at the
door, that **wheelchair-bound participants must transfer**. This is the
verbiage used across the industry to indicate that a wheelchair-bound
person transfer from his own chair to a provided chair. The venue must
have a valid reason for requiring wheelchair-bound patrons to transfer.
The venue can then deny entrance to wheelchair-bound patrons who cannot
transfer, if the reason precludes entirely having a personal wheelchair
in the venue.

> **\[A\]nd then seat that person in a special wheelchair area of an
> arena away from the other members of the group he had joined?**

Some venues have specially-designated sections for wheelchairs only. The
sections would normally have seats, but instead have seats removed, and
provide direct access for wheelchairs. You normally find accommodations
like this in stadiums and in other places where there are fixed seats.
The benefit of wheelchair sections is that they are designed so that
wheelchair-bound patrons have a good view of the venue even if people in
seats in front of them are standing.

Most venues which have wheelchair seating areas also have nearby seats
into which they can re-locate other members of the party, but **this is
not required**. The venue is under no obligation to provide seating for
members of the disabled person's party.

Places of public accommodation are required to provide reasonable
accommodations to disabled persons. They do not have to provide
accommodation to the disabled person's party, or to anyone else.
Anything else above what is required by the ADA is a **convenience,**
not a **requirement**.

In theory, the traveling party would have purchased tickets in seats
near the wheelchair area if keeping the entire group together was a goal
of the party.
