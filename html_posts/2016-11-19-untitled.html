For a nation as large as ours, a national popular vote would never work.
Especially with popular votes as close as ours, could you imagine how
painful recounts and charges of voter fraud would be, especially when
every vote counts so much? We wouldn\'t know who the winner is for
months!

And yes, a national popular vote would encourage voter fraud; all you
would need to do to influence the election is to concentrate on one
place where it is easy to get away with it, and you could easily cause a
several hundred thousand point swing.

The EC also helps to narrow down the field to just two candidates who
have a realistic chance of making it to 270. Could you imagine if you
had six or seven candidates with significant amounts of votes? You could
have a fringe candidate win by a very small percentage (like 5% or
less), and you\'d be right back into recounts and challenges. The EC
keeps the fringe on the fringe. With enough candidates receiving votes,
you could have a candidate win by the slimmest margin, which makes it
possible for a fringe candidate to actually win.

The only reason Hillary won the popular vote was California. Without
them, she would have lost by over a million votes. Do you really want
California alone determining who the next president is? Without the EC,
candidates would spend all of their time in New York and Texas and
California so they could get the most votes, and the rest of the country
would be ignored. Any state with a small population would become
invisible. The Founders put the EC in place to prevent exactly this from
happening. The EC did exactly what it was supposed to do: ensure that
the candidate has the widest acceptance across the country. Hillary did
not do that, which is why she lost.

So hate it you may, but it is the fairest system you can come up with.
It\'s not going away without a constitutional amendment anyway, and you
won\'t get 75% of states to agree to that.
