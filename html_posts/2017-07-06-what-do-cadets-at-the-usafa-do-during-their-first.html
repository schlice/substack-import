*Probably not much.*

It's such a whirlwind while you go through your first week that it's
really hard to process anything. You're woken up at oh-dark-thirty (you
don't know because you have no watches or clocks) to screaming and
banging and telling you you're late before you even had a chance to be
on time. You're shuttled around to lots of different activities and you
basically just *go along* and don't think a whole heck of a lot.

Thinking comes later, not during the first week.

Before you can be a good *leader*, you have to be a good *follower*. And
to be a good follower, you need to learn how to follow.
