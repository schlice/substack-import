I think \"clearly a victim\" is a matter of perspective. And I don\'t
really see a problem here. If she was \"clearly a victim,\" she should
be shellacking the department with lawsuits and taking them for all
they\'re worth.

The problem here is *perception bias*. There are usually three sides to
every story. In this case, there\'s *her* side, there\'s the
*officer\'s* side, and there\'s the *truth*, which usually lies
somewhere in between the two stories. Our experiences are colored by our
life histories, and so we often frame what we see by what we know. It is
an assistive measure that helps our brains fill in the minor gaps in
space and time in our memories. So her version of the story is accurate
as far as her brain interpreted the events and recorded them in her
memory. In other words, as far as she knows, everything happened exactly
as she said.

Only there\'s a really good chance that it didn\'t.

Don\'t misunderstand. I\'m not saying she intentionally misrepresented
the truth. I believe that she truly believes the entire incident went
down exactly as she said it did. But our perception is biased in favor
of our beliefs, so while she truly believes everything happened exactly
as she said, it\'s likely that it did not.

And don\'t forget, every time you point at someone, there are three
fingers pointing back at you. So while you call others \"the problem,\"
you may be nearly as much of \"the problem\" as others are.
