**Is it legal to fire someone because they testified in court?**

For the most part, yes.

Unless you are reporting a Federal agency for some form of impropriety,
and you are testifying in court for that reason (and thus protected by
the Whistleblower Protection Act), employers can generally take any
action that is not prohibited by law. Some states also have
whistleblower protections for select state employees, but most do not.

Some companies protect their own employees against reprisals, but not
all do. Additionally, if the testimony is not related to the company in
question, reprisal protections do not apply.
