It depends on whether the money has actually been transferred to the US
Treasury and whether the victims have been compensated.

If the Treasury has already received the funds, and if the victims have
already been paid, then the pardon generally doesn't grant a right to
refund.

If the Treasury hasn't yet received the funds, they can be reimbursed so
long as the pardon details don't preclude a refund.

But *should* they? I think that the current setup is appropriate. If the
funds have already been transferred, they should be considered
unrecoverable, but if the funds haven't been transferred, they should be
considered beyond the reach of the Treasury or the victims.
