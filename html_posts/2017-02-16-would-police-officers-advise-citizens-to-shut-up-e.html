has got it nailed. The problem we have in society today is that people
believe they can be judge and jury at the side of the road.

Doing that abrogates a function of the courts onto yourself.

Only the court can tell whether or not a law enforcement action is in
violation of your rights. They are the only entity authorized to do so.
You are not authorized to do this at the scene.

Doing so, and the quotes you have posted in your article links,
reference what cops like to call "resisting." There are several types of
resisting, but most of them are related to resisting arrest. You can
also resist commands given by an officer. You have to know that an
officer is in charge, right or wrong, at the scene. You are not. If you
are viewed as hostile and resistant, the officer will immediately start
to treat you differently, and the pressure at the scene goes up.

The time to argue about whether or not your rights were violated is when
you talk to your lawyer, NOT at the side of the road. We've said this
many times on this forum. No one wants your rights violated, but by the
same token, you cannot resist an officer's directives during the lawful
course of his duty. What's lawful? Not for you to decide at the scene!
It's only the court that can decide what's lawful! Resist, and the
officer may have to resort to using force to bring you into compliance.

**When it comes to a battle of force, the officer will win. Every.
Single. Time.**

Therefore, you have no choice but to assume, at the scene, that the
officer is acting lawfully. Once you get the opportunity to talk to a
lawyer, you can relay everything that happened and your lawyer and the
courts get to determine what is lawful and what is not.
