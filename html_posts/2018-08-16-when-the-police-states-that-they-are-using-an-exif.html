**When the police states that they are using an EXIF Viewer to analyze a
video then report the data, how accurate is the information as it is
presented in a criminal case and can it be questioned?**

To answer this question, you have to know what EXIF data is. EXIF is
Exchangeable Information File Format and is what we refer to as
"metadata." Metadata is "data about data."

There are two types of video EXIF data:

> 1.  Automatically collected video metadata from software or a device
>     like your video camera. It stores camera-created information such
>     as aperture, shutter speed, GPS coordinates and more in the video
>     file. Most EXIF data cannot be \[easily\] edited after capture.
>     Two exceptions are correcting a camera's date/time setting and
>     adding GPS data.
> 2.  Manually written video metadata which provides information about
>     the video content. This can be transcripts of dialogue or
>     conversations and other text
>     descriptions.[\[1\]](#IDSdW){#cite-IDSdW .citation_link}

The EXIF data is exactly as accurate as it was when the police saw it.
Unless they're using digital forensic specialists, they would not know
whether or not the EXIF data was altered.

Any evidence can be questioned. The defense attorney would want the
video data examined by his or her own digital forensic specialist to
look for signs that the EXIF data (or the video itself) was tampered
with or edited.
