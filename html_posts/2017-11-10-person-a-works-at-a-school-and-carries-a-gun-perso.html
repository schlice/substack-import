The short answer is **it depends.** It would have to be determined if
Person A was lawfully carrying a gun on school property.

Most school districts only allow armed people who are not the police in
the school if they are registered security guards with the district.

Some school districts allow *teachers* to volunteer to take the training
and become registered security guards. This allows them to legally carry
a gun on school property. These same teachers also have to apply and be
granted a concealed carry permit from the local police department. This
is all **on their own time, with their own funds.** They are not paid to
carry a firearm, nor are they paid to be a security guard.

Assuming this is the case (or assuming this particular school district
allows properly registered and armed teachers on school property),
Person A (who works at a school and carries a gun lawfully) would not
likely be charged with any crime.

**In any other case**, Person A would not likely be permitted to carry a
gun onto school grounds, *even if they have a concealed carry permit
from the local police or Sheriff*. If Person A shoots Person B in self
defense, they will probably not face any criminal charges, but they may
face charges for unlawfully concealing a firearm on school property.
