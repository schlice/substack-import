**Are small caliber handguns a practical way of killing mice and rats?
How problematic can the damage from over penetration and noise be?**

Handguns *might be* useful, but there are better choices.

There are indeed some subsonic 22 ammunitions that produce a report much
quieter than others. For example, the [[CCI
Quiet-22](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=b44308&url=https://www.americanhunter.org/articles/2013/5/23/cci-quiet-22/){.external_link

a .22 caliber bullet at 710 feet per second but still only produces an
astonishing **68 decibels** at the shooter's ear. For comparison, a loud
conversation is 65 decibels. City traffic is 85 decibels. Standard
gunshots (as other answers have noted) can be 140 decibels or above
(that's in the hearing damage range). You could shoot a Quiet-22 in your
apartment and your neighbors probably wouldn't even know you fired a gun
(even though doing so is ***extremely unwise and most likely
illegal***). Even better, one of the flavors of Quiet-22 offered is a
*segmented hollow point* which is designed to expand slightly and then
break into three segments on impact. This can potentially do more damage
than a single round-nose bullet.

The downside: you can't use this type of ammunition in a semi-auto
handgun or gas-operated rifle. The ammunition is not powerful enough to
cycle the action. Of course, you can manually cycle the action, but that
kinda defeats the purpose of a semi-auto mechanism. It would be most
useful in a single-action rifle or a revolver. But with a shorter barrel
comes slower muzzle velocity. Testing with handguns produces much slower
muzzle velocity (in the 500 ft/sec range), resulting in the segmented HP
not even separating on impact.

Nevertheless, the point of my (way too long) description of quiet .22
ammo is that you can indeed shoot it indoors, without hearing
protection, without disturbing the neighbors, without the fear of
over-penetration, and it might be effective for mice and rats.

But my point was that there are better choices.

Pellet guns, for example, can achieve much higher muzzle velocities than
the Quiet-22, without the fear of over-penetration or ricochet, and they
are virtually silent in operation. I keep a pellet gun for pest
management and it is extremely effective. A pellet rifle firing .177
pellets will still kill pests quite effectively (literally drops them
where they stand) and you won't run afoul of most city ordinances which
state that you can't fire a "firearm" within city limits.
