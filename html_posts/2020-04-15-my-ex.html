**My ex's stimulus money was deposited into my bank. What legal trouble
could I get in if I don't give it back?**

Stimulus checks are distributed based on your filing status from your
last tax return. Your current marital status (which clearly changed
since you filed your last tax return) is not taken into consideration.

Money you are required to give to your ex is directly related to your
divorce decree. If you don't know, I suggest you contact your lawyer and
ask what to do.
