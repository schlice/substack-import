**Content:** [To date, there is very limited research showing a benefit
for MS patients. There have been some studies done overseas regarding
marijuana\'s effects on pain in MS patients.\
\
Marijuana\'s active ingredient (THC) attaches to cannabinoid receptors
on nerve cells, which has a positive effect on neurological pain. It is
said to reduce pain better than analgesics or other man-made pain meds.\
\
Regardless, there is no conclusive research which shows the long-term
impacts of marijuana use, nor is the any safety of efficacy data on its
use. While some states allow medical marijuana use, the drug is still
illegal under US Federal law.]{.rendered_qtext}
