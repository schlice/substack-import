**Is it illegal to screen record healthcareÂ·gov and share it to YouTube
to help individuals find health coverage?**

*(Note that for this answer, we are considering that the website in
question is copyrighted. If it is not, then there is no need to worry
about fair use)*

In general, ***IF*** you are capturing your interaction with the website
while narrating on top of it for the expressed purpose of *training,* or
teaching people how to use the website, this would most likely be
considered *fair use*.

> Fair use is a doctrine that permits limited use of copyrighted
> material without acquiring permission from the rights holders.
> Examples of fair use include commentary, search engines, criticism,
> news reporting, research, teaching, library archiving and scholarship.
> It provides for the legal, non licensed citation or incorporation of
> copyrighted material in another author's work under a four-factor
> balancing test.[\[1\]](#hzJUZ){#cite-hzJUZ .citation_link}

The Wikipedia entry discusses a "four-factor balancing test" for
determining whether or not your work is covered by fair use:

1.  The purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is
    of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes;
2.  The nature of the copyrighted work;
3.  The amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the
    copyrighted work as a whole; and
4.  The effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the
    copyrighted work.

**Purpose of use**. This is pretty easy to define, but the gist of it is
related to whether or not your use of the copyrighted material is for
*commercial* or *non-profit educational purposes*. The more money you
try to make from your use of the copyrighted material, the less likely
it will be considered fair use.

**Nature of the copyrighted work**. The more factual the copyrighted
work is (as opposed to creative), the more likely it will be considered
fair use to use it yourself.

**Amount and Substantiality**. There's no hard and fast limit on how
much of a copyrighted work you can use before you are no longer under
the fair use doctrine. But as a general rule, the more you use, the more
potential you have for being denied protection under fair use.

**Effect upon Works Value**. You shouldn't have to worry about this one,
because it is the federal government that runs the website in question,
so it is not selling its work. However, if you seek to gain from your
work, you may run into a fair use problem. In general, if you use your
screen capture to educate, you're likely okay. But the more money you
stand to make from your project, the more likely you run into a fair use
problem.

Good luck!
