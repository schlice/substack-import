**Since the Vatican is an independent country with its own laws, and its
also filled with priests, is raping little boys legal there?**

No.

The Holy See adopted most of its laws directly from Italian law. It also
includes several United Nations Resolutions and some other additions and
edits. It was most recently updated in 2013, when they clarified the
laws on crimes against children, in response to some of the latest
issues they were facing.
