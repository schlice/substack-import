**Why do so many people think it's okay to park in a handicapped spot
when they have no designation to do so? For instance, non-disabled
parents using the spots as a pick up or drop off zone at a school using
the spots for a non-disabled child.**

"Parking" has a legal definition which involves stopping your car,
disengaging the transmission, getting out of the car, and walking away.

"Standing" has another legal definition which involves stopping the car,
disengaging the transmission, but remaining in the driver's position in
the vehicle.

"Stopping" has yet another legal definition which involves stopping the
forward motion of the car.

Generally, stopping or standing in a handicapped spot is okay. Parking
in a handicapped spot when you are not authorized to do so is not okay.
