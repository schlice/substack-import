**Why is the phrase BLM and not minority lives matter or human lives
matter? Other minorities have been screwed over too. Only focusing on
one minority takes away the spotlight from other minorities.**

1.  Black Lives Matter is an organization that was created from a lie.
2.  Its usefulness as a movement has absolutely nothing to do with black
    lives.

Black Lives Matter has as its impetus the lie that Michael Brown was
killed by white police officer Darren Wilson in cold blood, while he was
surrendering, with his hands up. This lie has been completely and
utterly disproven, and even the "witness" who reported seeing this not
only did not see anything, but wasn't even anywhere near the incident.
Forensics actually match Wilson's account of the situation, that Brown
was actually struggling with him to get control of his firearm, and
Wilson shot him to stop the attack.

Nevertheless, drawing on Winston Churchill's legacy, when he said,
"Never let a good crisis go to waste," Black Lives Matter was born.

The movement was co-founded by Patrisse Cullors, who freely admits that
she is a trained Marxist.

They are entirely disinterested in protecting or enhancing black lives.
The are far more interested in destroying the current system and
replacing it with a Marxist and socialist paradise. And violence is just
one way they intend to be heard.

But it might surprise you to learn that \"what they want\" isn\'t an end
to police brutality or racism. It\'s an end to freedom, speech,
religion, and true equality.

This is an organization which actually supports:

So why doesn't BLM say "all lives matter" or "all minority lives matter"
or "human lives matter" or something similarly inclusive? Because while
those statements are all true, they don't play off of the "fear" that
these people have instilled in the minority community that white police
officers are roaming the streets just looking for little n\*\*\*\*rs to
kill.

Never let a good crisis go to waste. And BLM has hijacked the "race
crisis" to instill their vision of a new America on the backs of people
that they deliberately lied to in order to convince them that there is
far more of an issue than there actually is. Don't get me wrong, racism
exists, and it drives the interactions of some people. But does racism
exist *to the extent that BLM would like you to believe?* Not even
close.

*Sorry, no comments on this one. It's just too hot-button of an issue to
allow comments.*

*If you don\'t like what I wrote, tough shit. If my answer is
grammatically low-quality or is un-cited opinion masquerading as fact,
downvote it. If you think I\'m wrong, write your own answer. But Quora
is a question-and-answer site, not a debate site. If you were simply
going to comment to tell me \"ackshually, you\'re wrong,\" then you're
the reason why I disable comments. Well done, Karen. You ruined it for
everyone.*
