I'm relieved. It's about time that someone decided to protect the
integrity of women's sports.

If the problem with transgender women competing in men's sports is
biological, the fix needs to be biological. And make no mistake,
biologically-speaking, transgender women are men.

You can see how having men competing in women's sports might be
problematic, no? How that might be problematic to biological women?

I'm glad the NCAA is finally making this change. But it's long overdue,
and the only reason they are doing it now is because of the President's
Executive Order. Without strong leadership on this issue from the White
House, this never would have happened. The NCAA would have continued to
allow gender activists to dictate policy from the sidelines.
