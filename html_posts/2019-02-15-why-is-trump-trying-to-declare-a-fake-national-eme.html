**Why is trump trying to declare a fake national emergency when there is
no national emergency at the border?**

Whether or not a national emergency exists at the southern border is
entirely up to the President to decide. Congress gave the President that
authority when they wrote the National Emergencies Act in 1976. Let's
not misunderstand: it's not for anyone but the President to decide if a
national emergency exists. It is a power that has been delegated to the
President by Congress to invoke certain provisions of Federal law. There
are about 470 provisions of Federal law that a President can invoke by
declaring a national emergency.

If the President declares a national emergency at the southern border in
order to secure military funding to build a border barrier, Congress may
perceive this as an abuse of the national emergency authority he
currently has, and they may impeach him for what would be considered an
abuse of power.
