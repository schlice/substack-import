Short answer: No.

There would be more evidence for the police to use as justification for
their actions in court if every officer were required to wear body
cameras., but the presence of a body camera won't change how an officer
responds to any given situations.

Police shootings of unarmed citizens will continue as long as unarmed
citizens continue to violate the law and fail to follow lawful
instructions by law enforcement. Remember (we all seem to forget this):
*unarmed* does not equal *not dangerous*.

Cops aren't going to suddenly stop doing their jobs because there's a
camera there. Heck, you don't have to buy any cameras for officers;
there's already ten cell phone cameras recording every officer during
any given traffic stop.

But again, the problem is not getting body cameras for every officer.
The biggest monetary hurdle is the storage and management of the
***petabytes*** of data that will routinely be recorded.

And how long do you store discretionary video? Three months? Six months?
Every day longer you store your videos, the more the costs go up.

And when do you require officers to have video rolling? Surely every
interaction an officer has with the public, right? What about when he's
interviewing a rape victim? What about when someone may have been
partially complicit? You think they will be \*more\* forthcoming or
\*less\* forthcoming? What if the person did do something wrong? What if
he was in an inappropriate relationship with a woman? What if he was
cheating on his wife? You think he'd want that recorded and released
under a FOIA request?
