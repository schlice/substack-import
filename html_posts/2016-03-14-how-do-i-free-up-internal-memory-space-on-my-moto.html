Easiest way: download a program to do it for you. I strongly recommend
[[DU Speed
Booster](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=edf1d4&url=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id%3Dcom.limsky.speedbooster){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="google.com"}]{.qlink_container} (note that I do not work for
DU, nor have I been compensated to recommend them) for Android devices.
This program will free up some of the hidden files that consume memory
space. For example, your photo app generates \"thumbnail\" images and
caches them. These can be deleted to free up space. DU Speed Booster
will do this for you. Many of your apps cache Internet data to make them
run faster, at the cost of disk space. These can be safely cleaned with
the app.
