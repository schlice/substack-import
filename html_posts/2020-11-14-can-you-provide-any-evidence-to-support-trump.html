**Can you provide any evidence to support Trump's claim that there was
cheating in the election? None of the authorities in our country can
find any evidence of cheating, the courts are throwing out lawsuits, so
where is this alleged cheating?**

There is a pervasive media narrative which happens to be flat-out wrong:

***Evidence*** **is not** ***proof*.**

Evidence *can* be proof, but it is not *always* proof. For example,
there may be evidence that a crime has taken place, but upon
investigation, proof of the allegation is sometimes not found. That
doesn't negate the evidence. It also doesn't mean the allegation was
incorrect, or wrong to bring. For example, there may be evidence that
you killed your spouse. Your neighbors overheard you having a fight. You
took a late-night fishing trip in your boat. And the next day, your
spouse is gone, never to be seen again. That evidence is
*circumstantial*, but it is still evidence. Is it *proof* of your guilt?
Maybe. It's up to the judge to decide if it proves your guilt.

Contrary to what the mainstream media is trying to feed you (which is
disinformation), there is indeed evidence of voter fraud. That evidence
must be investigated. If it is found to be lacking sufficiency, then the
allegation is rejected. But the evidence is there. The investigation
into the evidence follows, and if the allegation is proven, then the
case moves forward.

In at least a few cases, some of the allegations have merit, and their
investigations are moving forward. In others, the allegations were found
to be without merit and are tossed.

A court would not allow a claim in the door without some evidence to
merit its reason for existence. If there was no evidence at all, the
case would have been tossed at the door. Perhaps the evidence was
investigated and found to be insufficient to support the charge. In many
cases, this is what happened. In some, there was sufficient evidence to
move forward. If the case was allowed to be heard and there was no
evidence, the defense would request *summary judgement* and would make
the claim that the petitioner did not present sufficient evidence to
meet the *evidentiary requirement* to bring the charge in the first
place.

Regardless, this is how we ensure that the election is fair and legal.
This process must continue.

*Sorry, no comments on this one.*

*If you don\'t like what I wrote, tough shit. If my answer is
grammatically low-quality or is un-cited opinion masquerading as fact,
downvote it. If you think I\'m wrong, write your own answer. But Quora
is a question-and-answer site, not a debate site. If you were simply
going to comment to tell me \"ackshually, you\'re wrong,\" then you're
the reason why I disable comments. Well done, Karen. You ruined it for
everyone.*
