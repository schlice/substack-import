**Can an amendment become law without the presidential consent?**

Amendments do not become law. They become amendments to the
Constitution, and the President is not involved in that process.

Bills can become law without the President signing them. If the bill is
presented to the President and he does not sign it, the bill
automatically becomes law after 10 days, assuming Congress is in
session.
