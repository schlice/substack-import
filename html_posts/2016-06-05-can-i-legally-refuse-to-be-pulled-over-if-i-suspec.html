Legally, there is no provision in the law to allow you to "refuse" to
pull over. Therefore, any reasoning you may have for not stopping (i.e.
I thought the officer was not real) would be a defense in court to the
charge of failing to stop.

You really only have two possibilities:

1.  When you are illuminated by a car which you believe is not a real
    police officer, your first course of action would be to immediately
    get out your cell phone and call 911. Inform the dispatcher that
    there is a car behind you with red and blue lights but it doesn't
    look like a police officer. They will be able to tell you if it is a
    real police officer behind you. If the dispatcher tells you it is a
    real police officer, **you must stop immediately.** By the way, if
    you live in a state where it is illegal to talk on the phone while
    you drive, this emergency situation would be a perfect example of an
    affirmative defense to that charge.
2.  If you cannot call 911 because your cell phone is not working, your
    only other viable option is to drive (safely, do not speed) to the
    nearest police station, and go inside. Tell the desk officer that
    there is a car following you and you are unsure whether or not it is
    a police officer. If it is, the officer will come inside and you
    will sort it all out together. If not, the car will likely drive
    away and you will be safe.

Beyond these two options, there really is no other way to fail to stop.
If you have any other reasoning (I tried to drive to a more
populated/safer/better lit, I didn't think he was real but I didn't do
anything about it, etc), your decision will be weighed against the
reason the officer was stopping you when and where he was, and the judge
or jury will decide if your excuse was reasonable enough. If you don't
do the things that a reasonable person would do if they suspect the
officer behind them is not real (see the numbered list above), your
decision will not be looked upon favorably.
