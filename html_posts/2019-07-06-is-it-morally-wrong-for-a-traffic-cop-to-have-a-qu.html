**Is it morally wrong for a traffic cop to have a quota to fill every
month?**

I'm reasonably sure that department policies regarding how many tickets
you have to write has little to do with morals.

Quotas are a bad idea. Officers shouldn't be judged against a pre-set
number of tickets, but should be judged on the quality, as well as the
quantity, of tickets written. By quantity here, it means that if an
officer is supposed to write traffic tickets, a very low quantity could
be an indication that he's not doing his job effectively and requires
further review. Similarly, a very high number of tickets may also
indicate an overzealous traffic officer who maybe needs to settle back a
bit. This is why workers have supervisors: to keep them on the right
track. A pre-set number you have to "hit" is a poor way to motivate
someone to write tickets, because it leads to poor tickets.

The only time that any sort of measurement of quantity should ever come
into play is for specialized enforcement units, such as a traffic detail
specifically deployed to a problem area.
