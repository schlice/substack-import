You take a firearm, place it someplace on your body or on your carried
objects in which it cannot be seen, and you leave your house. BOOM,
you're a concealed carrier! People do this every single day in the
United States, and it's not difficult at all.

Oh, were you asking how to become a *legal* concealed carrier of a
firearm in the United States? Well, that's a far different question. The
answer depends on what state you are living in. In some states, you need
no special certification or license to conceal a firearm. If you are not
prohibited from owning a firearm, you can conceal one in public. These
states are called "permitless carry" states. Not all permitless carry
states also allow *open carry* (unconcealed carry, such as a pistol in a
visible holster on your belt). Permitless carry states which also permit
open carry as well as concealed carry are known as "Constitutional
Carry" states. Some states require you to get a Concealed Carry Permit
(CCP) or a Concealed Weapons Permit (CWP) before you may conceal a
firearm. These states are called "permit carry" states. "Permit carry"
states may or may not permit open carry, whether or not you have a CCP
or CWP. As of the *NYRPA v. Breun* case, there are no more "no carry"
states. There used to be a number of states which were either "may
issue" (and it was really hard to do so) or "no issue" but that was
found to be unconstitutional.

Therefore, it is up to you to check the laws in the state in which you
live to determine what you must do in order to conceal a firearm on your
person. In states which require you to get a concealed weapons permit,
you may have to take classes and demonstrate proficiency with a firearm
before the state will grant you a permit.
