**What can I do legally if my HOA declines a TV antenna installation
(everyone else has satellite)?**

Today's modern HDTV antennas work as well inside an attic as they do on
your roof, considering it's a digital signal.

Install your HDTV antenna in your attic and run the wire down to your
TV.

You could also buy a powered HDTV antenna and plug it in right behind
your TV. It should work just as well.

The HOA can regulate the placement of the antenna so long as it is able
to receive the signal in both areas. If your installer tells you the
only place you can conceivably get the signal is on the roof, then it
has to go there. If there are multiple places on your roof that the
signal can still be received, the HOA can help you decide which area to
place the antenna.
