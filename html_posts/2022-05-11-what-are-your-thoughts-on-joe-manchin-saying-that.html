The bill, as written, permits abortion up until birth.

The simple fact is that most people don't want that. As we get up past
20 weeks, most people want *more* protection for life rather than
*less*.

So if Democrats were actually interested in *passing something* rather
than just putting out garbage to try to score political points, they'd
enshrine abortion up to 20 weeks, and then allow the states to decide
beyond that. But as many others have already stated, that requires a
desire to actually pass something that might stick.

Manchin knows his voters don't want unfettered abortion until birth. So
he votes as his constituents want.
