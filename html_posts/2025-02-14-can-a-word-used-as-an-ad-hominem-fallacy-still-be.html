Part of the misunderstanding is misunderstanding what an *ad hominem*
is.

*Ad hominem* is Latin for "to the man." In other words, instead of
responding to the question at hand, you instead attack the person.
Recent example: rather than attacking JD Vance's words, internet trolls
love to talk about his eye liner. Another recent example: rather than
attacking the things that Elon Musk is finding, they are attacking him
personally.

These are *ad hominem* attacks.

An ad hominem is what it is because it is used in an attempt to deflect
from the lack of a valid response to the argument made.

So to answer your question, **yes, an** ***ad hominem*** **attack is
still considered** ***ad hominem*** **even if the attack itself is based
in truth.**
