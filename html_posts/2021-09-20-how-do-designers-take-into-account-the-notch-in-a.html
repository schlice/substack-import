In addition to the other answers, the ejection of a shell does not
involve the movement of enough mass to make a difference against the
inertia imparted by the firearm itself and your holding of it.
Therefore, the kinetic energy of the shell casing would be pushing
against both the mass of the firearm and your mass. Therefore, the
action of ejecting a cartridge should not impart enough kinetic energy
to cause a large enough motion in the firearm (or you) to need to worry
about.

Original question:

How do designers take into account the notch in a handgun where spent
shells are ejected, as it relates to throwing the barrel offline during
recoil? Is the firearm weighted to a side for balance or is it a matter
of gripping and handling?
