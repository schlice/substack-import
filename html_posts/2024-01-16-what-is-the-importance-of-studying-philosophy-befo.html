Philosophy undergirds science, and philosophy undergirds theology. You
can't truly understand science or theology without understanding
philosophy.

Why?

Science and theology ***rely*** on philosophy. Bad philosophy results in
bad science, and good science requires good philosophy. Why? Because:

**1. Science cannot be done without philosophy.** Philosophical
assumptions are utilized in the search for causes, and, therefore,
cannot be the result of them. For example, scientists assume (by faith)
that reason and the scientific method allow us to accurately understand
the world around us. That cannot be proven by science itself. You can't
prove the tools of science---the laws of logic, the Law of Causality,
the Principle of Uniformity, or the reliability of observation---by
running some kind of experiment. You have to assume those things are
true in order to *do* the experiment! So science is built on philosophy.
Unfortunately, many so-called scientists are very poor philosophers.

**2. Philosophical assumptions can dramatically impact scientific
conclusions.** If a scientist assumes beforehand that only natural
causes are possible, then probably no amount of evidence will convince
him that intelligence created the first one-celled amoeba or any other
designed entity. When Darwinists *presuppose* that intelligent causes
are impossible, then natural laws are the only game in town. Likewise,
if a creationist rules out natural causes beforehand (and we don't know
of any who do), then he also risks missing the right answer. But a
scientist who is *open-minded* to both natural and intelligent causes
can follow the evidence wherever it leads. In other words, scientists
who are poor philosophers will also be poor scientists.

**3.** ***Science*** **doesn't really say anything---*scientists***
**do.** Data are always interpreted by scientists. When those scientists
let their personal preferences or unproven philosophical assumptions
dictate their interpretation of the evidence, they do exactly what they
accuse religious people of doing---they let their ideology dictate their
conclusions. When that's the case, their conclusions should be
questioned, because they may be nothing more than philosophical
presuppositions passed off as scientific facts.

\

In the same way, the study of theology implies the study of things which
cannot be proven by science. An invisible, immaterial God cannot be
scientifically proven, because He exists outside of the physical.
Science can never prove the existence of God.

The only way we can have any understanding of God is through logic and
reason, not through testing or observation. Therefore, a good study of
theology requires a good foundation in philosophy. Now, does this mean
you can't know God or love God without studying philosophy? Not at all.
But we're talking about *studying* theology, not knowing or loving God.
