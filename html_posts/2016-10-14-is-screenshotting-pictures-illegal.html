The act of screenshotting a picture, in and of itself, is not illegal.

However, what you do with the picture after that may be.

If you re-post it or somehow republish it, you may be in trouble.
Copyright is always held by the content creator, and they define what
you can or cannot do with it.

If you just keep it as a screensaver for your own use, you will probably
be fine.
