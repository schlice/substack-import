**Will the walk-out chant by school children, "hey, hey NRA" embolden
Congress to reconsider restrictions on guns?**

No, and I would hope that it does not.

We don't take the advice of children on 401(k) investing, and we don't
take the advice of children on repairing small engines. We certainly
don't allow children to give us advice on enacting nationwide
legislation, either.

Guns are a very regionalized issue. The needs of a community in Bozeman,
Montana shouldn't be dictated by the needs of a community in San
Francisco or Washington or Seattle or Denver or anywhere else.

But school security is universal. The passage of the STOP School
Violence Act is a good start. Speaker Ryan said the following of the
bill:

> *If there is any place our children can feel safe, it should be our
> schools. The* STOP School Violence Act *takes a multi-faceted approach
> that will help prevent school violence before it takes place. It gives
> law enforcement, school officials, and students the training,
> technology, and resources they need to identify and prevent threats.
> This is a common-sense approach to combatting senseless violence.*

This is the right start to make students in schools safe. But it is not
enough. We need to go further. We need to mandate school safety. If the
TSA can make airports safe, the Department of Education can similarly
make schools safe.
