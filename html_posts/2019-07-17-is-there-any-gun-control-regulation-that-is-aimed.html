**Is there any gun control regulation that is aimed at the people
committing the crimes rather than someone who lawfully owns a gun? If
so, what is it?**

No, there isn't. There isn't because it's not politically expedient to
do so. It's much easier to curtail lawful gun owners than it is to
target criminals. You can write new laws to curtail gun owners; you
can't really write new laws to curtail criminals, because we already
have laws against committing crimes. That's why they are criminals: they
have broken existing laws.

To that end, ***all*** laws are targeted at people committing crimes,
because you have to commit a crime before the law's effects are felt by
you. Lawful gun owners get upset when *new laws* target them and *create
crimes* where there was no crime previously (i.e. banning a certain
design of firearm).

You've probably already heard something along the lines of, "we don't
need new laws, we should be enforcing the laws we already have." Well,
that's a convenient trope, but what does it mean?

Here's an example of what it means: **gun crimes are prosecuted far less
than other crimes.**

Why is this? Because gun crimes are often used as bargaining chips in
negotiations over what to charge. Prosecutors will often negotiate down
or completely waive the gun charges in order to get a guilty plea on
another charge. "Take a guilty plea on the robbery 2 and I'll plead the
gun charge down to a misdemeanor menacing charge." Criminals do this
too: "Drop the gun charge and I'll plead to the robbery and give you my
boss and his boss."

This kind of thing happens ALL. THE. TIME. And this results in criminals
knowing that using a gun in the commission of a crime means nothing to
the police or to prosecutors. Laws are only as strong as their
enforcement.

So the first thing we need is **mandatory charging of all gun crimes.**
If you commit a crime with a gun, you must be charged with that gun
crime. No plea bargaining of gun crimes.

Secondly, we need to remove the incentive for judges and juries to
lessen the sentences on people convicted of using a gun in a crime. If
we are to get tough on **criminals** using guns to commit crimes, we
need to show it. We need **mandatory sentences for using guns as part of
the commission of a crime.**

Right now, there is very little disincentive to criminals for using a
gun in the commission of a crime. They know that even if they do get
caught, they won't likely face much time for using a gun. They can even
likely plead it away themselves.Once criminals start learning that if
you are caught using a gun in a crime, you're automatically going to
jail for X years, do not pass Go, do not collect \$200, then criminals
will be far less likely to use a gun to commit a crime.

And it is up to states to do this, as most are prosecuted under state
law. It's up to states to actually start *being tough* on gun crime
instead of just *talking tough*.
