There is a very dedicated team who works at the jail in an area known as
\"Intake and Release.\" This is the place where new inmates are
processed in when they arrive, and where they are processed out when
they depart. They are **very** good at their jobs. I have tremendous
respect for the I&R team.

During the intake portion of the incarceration, the inmate will be asked
to empty his or her pockets completely and remove all jewelry and
accouterments that can physically come off. Some prisons make the inmate
flip his/her pockets inside out. They will normally dump all personal
effects into a plastic bin. This includes all money, wallets, purses,
pocket knives, mobile phones, rings, earrings, necklaces, etc. The
inmate will then change out of his/her street clothes (the clothing they
were wearing at the time of intake) into a prison uniform. The I&R staff
will catalog all of these items and they will be stored in separate
pouches (clothing and personal effects). These items are then placed in
one larger bag or box, depending on the particular prison. The box is
sealed and is placed into secure storage. The box/bag is only unsealed
for one of two reasons:

1.  The inmate is being released.
2.  The contents of the box are needed for a legal discovery proceeding
    or a warrant.

The inmate will review the contents listed on the form, and will sign
acknowledging that he/she reviewed the inventory of the box when it was
sealed. Chain of custody is maintained, so if the DA\'s office needs the
contents of the inmate\'s personal effects, they must sign them out.

When the inmate is released, the form is brought out, and the box/bag is
unsealed. Each item on the list is checked and returned to the inmate.
The inmate signs the form acknowledging receipt of his personal effects.

(Question details added) As for the person\'s affairs at home, hopefully
the new inmate has a friend or family member who can gather up his stuff
and move it into storage. And feed his fish. The police are not
responsible for your personal affairs while you are in prison.
