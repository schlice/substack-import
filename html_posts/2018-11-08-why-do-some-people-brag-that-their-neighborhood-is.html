**Why do some people brag that their neighborhood is so safe they don't
lock their doors? Regardless of the crime rate in a particular area,
isn't it foolish not to keep your doors locked at most times?**

Back in the day, people talked about not ever thinking about locking
doors because their neighborhoods were "so safe." So some people today,
trying to hearken back to the "good old days when people weren't bad"
will still say that they don't lock their doors because their
neighborhood is just so safe and just doesn't have crime.

Meh.

When it comes to my house, I fastidiously secure it. I want no one in my
house, ever, and I'm not going to take the chance, even though I live in
a relatively crime-free area of town when it comes to home invasion.

On my car, though, I actually have the opposite opinion. *I keep my car
doors unlocked* ***because there is so much smash-and-grab crime in my
neighborhood.***

I would much prefer that a thief open my car doors and root around in my
car for anything they may want to steal, rather than breaking my windows
and having me go through the hassle of the insurance claim and getting
new windows.

I can only do this for a few reasons:

1.  There is literally nothing in my car worth stealing. I removed
    anything of value from my car long ago.
2.  I don't have a garage door remote in my car, another item of value
    that thieves want to steal from cars parked in your driveway. If you
    routinely park a car in your driveway, *remove your garage door
    remote.* It's like leaving a key to your garage door in plain sight
    in your car.
3.  My registration doesn't have my address on it. So that's not even
    worth stealing.
4.  My car has Lo-Jack. Go ahead, steal my car. We'll see just how far
    you get with it before we catch you.
