Dell has a buyback program for enterprise equipment. They do not have a
buyback program for commercial laptops.

Dell will help you trade in your laptop and will give you a Dell gift
card for doing so, but they will not buy back or exchange old laptops.

If you want to get more significant money for your laptop, I suggest
selling it yourself on eBay or some other marketplace.

If you're more interested in simply recycling the old laptop and getting
a little money for your trouble, [[Dell will help you with
that](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=38988b&url=http://www.dell.com/learn/us/en/19/campaigns/trade-in-program){.external_link

almost any electronics in the same place and earn Dell gift cards.
