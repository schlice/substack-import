Each agency will use whichever technique they believe is more reliable
and effective at determining whether or not someone is being deceptive.
Most agencies do use some form of deception analysis, along with
traditional questioning.

Our agency locally uses a system called **CVSA** or "Computer Voice
Stress Analysis." It's not as detailed or complex as a polygraph
machine. It uses a sensitive microphone which records the respondent's
voice while answering questions, and is supposed to detect micro-tremors
in the respondent's voice when they are being deceptive.

These tools are investigative aids only. They contribute to the body of
evidence which is used to determine whether or not a person is
employable by the particular agency for which they are applying. Neither
the CVSA nor the polygraph can actually determine whether or not someone
is being truthful. They simply provide additional evidence which can be
used in making an employment determination.
