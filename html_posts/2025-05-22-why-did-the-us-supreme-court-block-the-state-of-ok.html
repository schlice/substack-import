SCOTUS did not "block" the state of Oklahoma from funding a Catholic
charter school. The Supreme Court left a lower court ruling in place
which did so, because the SCOTUS deadlocked.

First off, the school is not private. It is a **charter** school.
Charter schools, which are privately-run but publicly funded, serve
about 3.8 million students in the US. They offer an alternative to
traditional public schools, offering an educational model intended to be
more innovative and less bound by state regulations. The concept took
off in the 1990s and, by the 2023 school year, there were some
8,000â€¯charter schools operating nationwide. The law in Oklahoma, as in
most states, says that charter schools are public, not private. States
have been split on whether they excluded charter schools (even religious
ones) from public funding.

Nevertheless, in this case, the Justices issued a brief, **unsigned
order** noting only that it had split 4-4. The votes are not recorded in
an unsigned order, so we don't know how the Justices voted, but the
split means that the lower court decisions stand.

Unsigned decisions do not set precedent, so the religious groups
involved in the case will be able to bring another case in the future if
they choose.

\

(EDIT) Adding just a little more detail about the case itself, with the
understanding that this case does not set nationwide precedent; it only
applies to Oklahoma and this particular charter school.

**BACKGROUND:**

The Archdiocese of Oklahoma City and the Diocese of Tulsa applied to
establish St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School ("St. Isidore")
as an online charter school. St. Isidore is a religious institution and
planned to structure its activities as a "genuine instrument of the
\[Catholic C\]hurch." **In essence, St. Isidore's purpose was to operate
as a public Catholic school, supported by state funding.** In 2023, the
Oklahoma Charter School Board (the "Board"), in a three-to-two vote,
chartered St. Isidore.

After the Board approved St. Isidore's application to become a charter
school, but before the contract's execution, the **Republican** Oklahoma
Attorney General, Genter Drummond, filed suit against it and the Board.
Drummond filed a mandamus action in the Oklahoma Supreme Court seeking
an order directing the Board to rescind St. Isidore's charter school
contract. Drummond alleged that the contract violated both the Oklahoma
and U.S. Constitutions.

In the case *Oklahoma Statewide Charter School Board v. Drummond,* the
Oklahoma Supreme Court ruled in favor of Drummond and directed the Board
to rescind the charter school's contract, finding that it violated two
state constitutional provisions, the Charter Act, and the federal
Establishment Clause.

- **OK Constitution.** The Court found the contract violative of
  Oklahoma's constitutional prohibition on appropriating public money to
  religious organizations. Accordingly, the Court rejected St. Isidore's
  argument against state action; instead, it determined that St. Isidore
  was a public school by way of the state charter, and thus a state
  actor.
- **The Charter Act.** The Court found St. Isidore's charter violative
  of both the state constitutional mandate to establish public schools
  "free from sectarian control," and the Charter Act's related
  nonsectarian requirement.
- **The Establishment Clause.** The Court held that the First
  Amendment's Establishment Clause prohibits the charter because it uses
  public money for the establishment of a religious institution. St.
  Isidore, which fully integrates Catholic teachings in its curriculum
  and co-curricular activities, was ruled by the Court as a "religious
  institution."
- **The Free Exercise Clause.** The Court rejected St. Isidore's Free
  Exercise claim: it held that even if denying St. Isidore's charter on
  the basis of its religious status implicated free exercise rights, it
  is nevertheless permissible because the charter itself violates the
  Establishment Clause.

\

So the issue in this case is specifically related to Oklahoma and its
Constitutional prohibitions against appropriating public money to
religious organizations.

This case does not set national precedent. The SCOTUS was divided, so
the OK SC ruling stands, and they submitted an unsigned opinion, which
does not set precedent.
