First, let me start by saying that Ocrevus (ocrelizumab) has recently
been approved by the FDA for treating both relapsing and primary
progressive MS. Ocrevus is a humanized monoclonal antibody that targets
CD20 positive B lymphocytes ( a type of white blood cell), which
contribute to nerve damage in MS. This is notable because up to a few
moths ago, we didn't have any treatments for primary progressive MS.

Secondary Progressive MS is the form of the disease which someone who
was previously diagnosed with a relapsing form of the disease eventually
transitions into. The last statistic I knew said that *untreated*,
relapsing MS would transition to SPMS within 10 years for 50% of
relapsing patients, and 85% within 20 years. That was before effective
treatments to slow the disease progression. We still have relapsing
patients who have been on effective medications who have gone well over
20 years and have not yet transitioned, so the evidence is mounting that
getting on one of the therapy drugs as early as possible can contribute
to delaying the onset of SPMS.

That said, if the SPMS patient still shows signs of disease activity on
an MRI, or is still having relapses, the same drugs which were used for
relapsing MS will still be somewhat effective for SPMS.

From the MS Society (**emphasis** mine):

As you can see, not only are the relapsing drugs helpful for some SPMS
patients, Novantrone has been approved by the FDA specifically for SPMS.
