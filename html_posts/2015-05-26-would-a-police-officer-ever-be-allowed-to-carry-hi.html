**Content:** [Our agency only allows items on your duty belt on which
you have been trained and certified to carry. This implies that the
training division has a complete training manual on the item, and that
you have completed that curriculum.\
\
Some of those items can be privately purchased, such as your impact
weapon (i.e. baton). But most of those items are
department-issued.]{.rendered_qtext}
