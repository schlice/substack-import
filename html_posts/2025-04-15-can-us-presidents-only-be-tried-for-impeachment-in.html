**Content:** []{.rendered_qtext}

**Impeachment is a** ***political*** **function, not a** ***judicial***
**one.** This is why only the House can draft Articles of Impeachment,
and only the Senate can hold a trial.

I know the Constitution calls it a "trial" and that sounds a lot like
what happens in a courtroom, and I know that the Chief Justice of the
Supreme Court presides in the case of the trial of a president, but it
is not a judicial proceeding, period. It is a political proceeding.

Therefore, it takes place in the hallowed halls of politics (Congress),
not in the hallowed halls of a courtroom.
