**Are we morally accountable for potential humans?**

It depends on your moral code. As you may know, morality is individual.
There is no "collective morality" that the world ascribes to. I'd be
interested to hear someone's argument claiming that there is without
grounding that belief in something.

Anyway, since morals are not universal (each person could conceivably
have their own moral code), the answer is that you may or may not be
morally accountable for potential humans (fetuses).
