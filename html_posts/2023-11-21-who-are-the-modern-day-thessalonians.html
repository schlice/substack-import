Thessalonica is now the city of Thessaloniki in northern Greece. It\'s
located on the Chalcidice peninsula, at the head of the Gulf of
Salonika, in the foothills of Mount Khorti√°tis.

Unless you're asking who today is *acting* like the Thessalonians of the
Bible's day.

If that's the case, I don't think we have a *city* like Thessalonica, a
church in a city surrounded by non-Christian peoples hostile to
Christianity. I think we have believers *embedded in cultures hostile to
Christianity,* such as you would find in Afghanistan or North Korea or
Somalia. Life is brutally hard for them.
