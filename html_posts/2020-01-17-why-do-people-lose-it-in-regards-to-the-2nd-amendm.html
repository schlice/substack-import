**Why do people lose it in regards to the 2nd amendment? Wasn\'t it
meant for other times and circumstances?**

Questions like this seem to revolve around the basic idea that a
particular amendment is no longer needed so there should be no problem
getting rid of it.

The problem is that *the Constitution doesn't grant rights. It only
prevents government from infringing on the rights you already have.*

This means you already have the right to defend your life, because you
have the natural right to self-defense, not because of the Constitution.
The Constitution only ensures that the government can't infringe on the
rights you already have.

Looking at the list of rights which the government cannot infringe and
then deciding that the government actually can infringe on those rights
breaks the basic compact which the states agreed to when they joined the
union. They joined with the understanding that rights existed prior to
the Constitution and the government would never infringe on those
rights. Saying now that the government can infringe on those rights is a
complete abdication of the government's responsibility to the states to
maintain the treaties they signed when they joined.

It actually throws the question of state secession back into the fore.
If the government can modify the agreement made with the states, then
the basis upon which the states entered the union is no longer intact.
It's like re-writing the contract after it's been signed. Yes, the Bill
of Rights was signed after the Constitution, but the Union was only
agreed to with the understanding that the Bill of Rights was going to be
signed.

Note that the Bill of Rights is a different animal than the other
seventeen Amendments that follow it. The Bill of Rights details the
natural rights which the government cannot infringe. If you now say that
the government can restrict your rights, then what good is the
Constitution at all? Breaking up the Bill of Rights could have
disastrous consequences for the entirety of the Union.

Under this view, it's hard to see how a state would ever agree to a
repeal of any of the Amendments in the Bill of Rights.
