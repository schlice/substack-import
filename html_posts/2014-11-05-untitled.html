<h2>Answer Comment</h2>

**Content:** [Here\'s a hypothetical.\
\
Suppose Hitler, as some have claimed, on his deathbed, confessed his
sins and became a Christian. Would he be saved?\
\
Surely not, as he has spent a lifetime in the task of wiping out entire
cultures. Right? He wouldn\'t go to heaven? Right?\
\
The Bible teaches that everyone is worthy of grace, and anyone who
confesses his sins and turns to God and confesses that Jesus is his
savior will be saved.\
\
So to answer the question, if Hitler converted on his deathbed, then he
would be saved.\
\
But let\'s assume that you already know this, and you continue in your
\"fucked\" ways. Does this mean you can spend your life this way and
then confess on your deathbed? No, it doesn\'t work that way.\
\
Someone with God in his heart can\'t act in that way and sleep at night.
There is an inherent contradiction between God\'s law and man\'s
actions, and the knowledge of that dichotomy is something that will
cause you to stop and think before you act.]{.rendered_qtext}
