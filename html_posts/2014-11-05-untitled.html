<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: [Here\'s a hypothetical.\<br>\<br>Suppose Hitler, as some have claimed, on his deathbed, confessed his<br>sins and became a Christian. Would he be saved?\<br>\<br>Surely not, as he has spent a lifetime in the task of wiping out entire<br>cultures. Right? He wouldn\'t go to heaven? Right?\<br>\<br>The Bible teaches that everyone is worthy of grace, and anyone who<br>confesses his sins and turns to God and confesses that Jesus is his<br>savior will be saved.\<br>\<br>So to answer the question, if Hitler converted on his deathbed, then he<br>would be saved.\<br>\<br>But let\'s assume that you already know this, and you continue in your<br>\"fucked\" ways. Does this mean you can spend your life this way and<br>then confess on your deathbed? No, it doesn\'t work that way.\<br>\<br>Someone with God in his heart can\'t act in that way and sleep at night.<br>There is an inherent contradiction between God\'s law and man\'s<br>actions, and the knowledge of that dichotomy is something that will<br>cause you to stop and think before you act.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/The-Holy-Quran-said-2-62-Surely-those-who-believe-and-those-who-are-Jews-and-the-Christians-and-the-Sabians-whoever-believes-in-Allah-and-the-Last-day-and-does-good-they-shall-have-their-reward-from-their-Lord-and-there-is-no-fear-for-them-nor-shall-they-grieve-Any-comments/answer/Lee-Crocker-1<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
