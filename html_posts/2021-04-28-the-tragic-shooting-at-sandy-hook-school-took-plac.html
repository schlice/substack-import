**The tragic shooting at Sandy Hook school took place in March of 2012.
I saw a claim that between then & March of 2018, 1,166.6 kids had been
killed by "gun violence" per year: How could anyone claim that this
figure is possible?**

Simple. Include a very broad range of definitions in the term "gun
violence." Namely, anyone who has died through the use of a gun.

This includes anyone who committed suicide, and anyone under the age of
18 involved in gang violence (not innocent victims, but gang members
under the age of 18). This will get you numbers similar to this.
