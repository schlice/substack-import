**Content:** [As the other posters alluded to, Ampyra is a medicine, the
first of its kind, designed specifically to treat a symptom of MS; that
is, foot drop. Ampyra is an option for people who experience moderate to
severe foot drop, and it does not work for everyone as Christine
attested to. However, it is a relatively new treatment for MS foot
drop.\
\
Several MS medications have fairly recently been approved, such as
fingolimod (marketed as Gilenya), which is an oral MS medication, the
first to be approved. More oral medications for MS are in the approval
pipeline today.\
\
Also recently, Tysabri (natalizumab) was approved for use, but under
strict prescribing guidelines due to its propensity to cause PML
(progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy), a rare but often fatal
viral disease. Tysabri is used to treat MS and Chron\'s disease, and it
is believed to work by preventing inflammatory immune cells to pass
through the cell layers of the intestines and the blood-brain barrier.
Tysabri has proven effective in slowing relapse rates, improving
cognitive function, and preventing vision loss. In clinical trials,
Tysabri was shown to reduce relapses by 68% vs. placebo, which is the
highest relapse reduction rate of any of the approved MS therapies.\
\
The use of LDN (low-dose naltrexone) in MS patients continues, but has
not yet been supported by clinical trials of any large scale. There is
much anecdotal evidence to support its use, but there is not enough
evidence in terms of rigorous study to show that LDN is effective, or
even safe. Any use of the drug would be \"off-label\" and doing so would
be considered an \"unproven treatment\" which should not be used in
place of proven, approved therapies.]{.rendered_qtext}
