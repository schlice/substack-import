**Content:** [This is obviously a very hot issue these days, as bullying
has led to a number of suicide attempts as well as a few successful
ones.\
\
In common law, a person is not required to act when a crime is being
committed. Failure to act is not a crime. Notable exceptions are police
officers and doctors who are required to act by law.\
\
Criminally speaking, the school did not violate any criminal laws
because, as others have said, the school did not force the student to
commit suicide. The crime of assisted suicide is the one we are talking
about, and the school did not aid the student in his suicide by
providing materials and/or instructions.\
\
However, I think a civil case could be made if you could show a pattern
of willful ignorance and failure by the school to properly address
bullying. However, it certainly won\'t be an easy case. It\'s been 16
years since the Columbine High School shooting; the dialog about
bullying has been happening for some time now, so making such a case
would be an uphill battle at best. National bully prevention programs
have been implemented for many years, so I really doubt that a school
would not have such a program in place, and/or would be aware of
bullying and willfully fail to act (i.e. analyze the situation, know
that bullying is taking place, and then willfully choose to allow the
bullying to continue).\
\
So I think making a case for wrongful death against the school would be
a really tough case to make.]{.rendered_qtext}
