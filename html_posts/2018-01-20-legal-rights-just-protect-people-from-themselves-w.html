**Legal rights just protect people from themselves. What do you think?**

While I'm not about doing your homework for you, I can at least provide
a cogent answer.

***That is exactly the opposite of good law***.

The entire existence of law allows human beings to live together without
their individual rights infringing on each other. Laws which do nothing
other than protect you from you makes bad law. It's the "nanny state"
mentality. You can't have a 32 ounce soda because sugar is bad for you.
You must wear a helmet when you ride a bicycle or a motorcycle because
you could fall off and injure your brain. And when you're a passenger in
a car, you have to wear a seatbelt because you could die if you don't.

By the way, I get the arguments about the cost to the public from
obesity, and the incremental cost to the public from those without
health insurance, and the possibility that you could become a missile
within a car and impact the driver in a crash. But those are not the
reasons given when passing these laws, which makes those arguments
*incidental*, not *primary* drivers of those laws.
