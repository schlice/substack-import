**Content:** [Your question is illogical. You have posed a \"false
equivalency,\" or at the very least, an equivalency that cannot be
proved.\
\
Your equivalency says that \"The Second Amendment\'s existence equals
children dying in school shootings.\" Since you simply cannot prove that
the removal of the Second Amendment will prevent school shootings, your
logic does not pass muster.\
\
This also does not imply that anyone who approves of the Second
Amendment simply accepts the status quo. There are many things that are
contributing factors to the rise in school shootings. One of these *may*
be readily-accessible guns.\
\
But does that mean throw the baby out with the bathwater? Do we
sacrifice a natural right (the right to self-defense, which I think is
far more important than the ability to resist governmental tyranny) for
the *possible* (not even probable) benefit of reducing (not eliminating)
school shootings? Are there other things we can do to prevent school
shootings?\
\
Let me offer a counter equivalency. The logic here doesn\'t pass muster
either, but the logic is in the same vein as your logic.\
\
*My kids go to public school in a district where schools are secured by
armed guards, employed by the district.*\
*We have never had a shooting in any school in my district.*\
\
Is there a cause-effect relationship there? Have we simply not had a
school shooting because we have armed guards? No, not likely. It\'s more
likely that the incidence of school shootings is so low, and the number
of schools is so high, that probability dictates that we\'ll likely
never see a school shooting. But does armed guards help? You bet it
does.]{.rendered_qtext}
