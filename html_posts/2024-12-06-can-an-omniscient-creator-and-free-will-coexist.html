In order to understand the alleged paradox between omniscience and free
will, we first must understand how God is able to be omniscient. God
created the universe and everything in it. This includes time as we know
it. We therefore live within the confines of time, while God does not.
God exists *outside of time,* and therefore does not experience time in
the same way we do.

For God, everything is *now*. The past is now. The present is now. The
future is now.

Therefore, God's omniscience extends to not only what we do when we bump
up against a choice, but it extends to the choices we make and what we
do with those choices. In other words, at the moment He created the
universe and everything in it, God knew, for all time, that you would
face the choice that you faced. He knew, for all time, what choice you
would make. And He knew, for all time, the outcome of that choice.

However, *at the moment of choice*, you still have absolute free will to
choose any choice you have available. This does not apply to God, since
the ability to choose at all implies being subject to time. For example,
there is a moment in time *before* your choice, then there is a moment
in time when you *make* a choice, and then there is a moment in time
*after* your choice, where you take the path chosen by your choice.
God's ability to see your choice, for all time, doesn't mean that you
had to choose that path. It simply means that He knows what choice you
freely made.

If God predestined all of our choices, then how could He hold us
responsible for anything we do? How could we hold one another
responsible for anything we do? We could all just say, "Hey, I didn't
want to kill that person, but God made me do it" and they'd be right. No
one could personally be held accountable for anything that they ever
did. The simple fact that we hold each other accountable for our choices
implies that we know that we have the free will to make choices.

But with that in mind, we need to ask this question: *are any of our
choices ever free?* What makes us choose one option over the other?
Ultimately, we choose the choice which will benefit us, and we desire
what will benefit us to the greatest degree. Therefore, *we choose the
choice which correlates with our greatest desire at that very moment of
choice.* So it stands to reason that our choices are *never* truly free,
because we are deciding based on our desires, not necessarily our free
will. Some might argue, however, that even that choice is free, because
it is *our* desires and *our* free will which allows us to choose, not
some external influence impacting our free will. But does it really
matter where the influence comes from, either God or your desires? One
way or another, *something* influences your free will.

So does free will exist? Of course it does. You are free to make the
choices you want to make. But you are *compelled* to choose the choice
you most desire at the moment of choice. "Free but compelled."

And does God have any influence over your desires? You bet He does! But
only if *you let Him.*

Before we are saved, we follow the desires of the flesh, which are
always sinful. We choose according to our desires which are only wicked
continuously the Bible tells us. And that we are, as it were, dead in
sin and trespasses, even though biologically we're very much alive. And
we're walking according to the course of this world, according to the
prince of the power of air, fulfilling the lusts of the flesh is what
the Bible tells us. And so, the Bible makes it very clear that we are
actively involved in making choices for which we are responsible, and
which expose us to the judgment of God.

But once we submit to the will of God, He tailors our desires so that we
desire what is in keeping with His plan for our lives. So God does not
interfere with our choices. He shapes our desires so that for those who
love Him and hear His voice, our desires match His will for us, so that
we will choose the path which most closely aligns with the good works He
has planned for us (see Jeremiah 29:11).

God does not want us to adopt a fear-driven mindset about our future
(see Romans 8:15). His sovereign power over our lives is meant to
inspire us to hope, not worry. Our desires are not necessarily bad
desires, but God ultimately knows what is best for us, and therefore He
shapes our desires to determine where we go and how our lives unfold
(Proverbs 16:9).

He desires that we surrender our own plans to Him so that we can be
ready, willing, and available to go wherever He leads, regardless of
whether it's what we pictured or planned for ourselves. It is never easy
to loosen our grip on our own desires, but it is the first step to
experiencing the joy of embracing God's will for us.
