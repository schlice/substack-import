answer, our department requires an excellent driving record, a full
medical exam, and in place of the polygraph, we use a [[Computer Voice
Stress

background check. But it\'s essentially the same for most departments:\
]{.rendered_qtext}

- Colorado has a state-authored peace officer entrance exam, which all
  peace officer candidates must pass. It includes math and verbal
  skills, along with some logic and reasoning. It requires no prior
  police training to pass.
- Candidates then move on to Oral Boards. These boards are conducted by
  the individual departments. The board members are looking for
  leadership ability, ability to speak in stressful situations, and
  problem-solving skills (part of Oral Boards is individual, and part is
  group. In the group evaluation, they are looking for someone to take
  charge of the group, direct the discussion, and deliver the verdict
  intelligently).
- If the candidate passes both written and oral exams, the application
  process starts, which includes all the items Rick already mentioned,
  along with the medical, physical, psych, and CVSA testing.
