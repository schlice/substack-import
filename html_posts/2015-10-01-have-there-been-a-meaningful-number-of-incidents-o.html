**Content:** [And no, I\'m not Sam\'s brother.\
\
The problem is the state of mental health diagnosis and treatment in
America, not the gun itself. Removing legal gun ownership will not
change the fact that we are terrible at identifying and treating people
who are mentally ill until they actually commit a violent crime.\
\
It\'s iceberg theory. Until we start treating the problem (the mentally
ill person) instead of the symptom (the gun they used to hurt people),
we will never get a better handle on mass shootings.]{.rendered_qtext}
