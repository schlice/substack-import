A lot of information here, and some of it is good. What is "good" is not
what I think is good. What is "good" is what is *Biblical*.

The "mark of the beast" is specifically a mark, either on the forehead
or on the hand, which will indicate fealty to the Antichrist. This mark
acts as a seal for the followers of the Antichrist and the false prophet
(the spokesman for the Antichrist). It will be the false prophet who
causes people to take the mark, which will **actually** be a **literal
mark** on the forehead or the hand. It won't be just an ID card or
something internal. It will be something visible.

Some have talked about medical implants, vaccines, and RFID chips as the
"mark of the beast." The biblical answer is that these *could be* the
beginnings of what will eventually be the mark of the beast, but they
themselves are not the mark. The mark of the beast will be an end-times
identification required by the Antichrist in order to buy or sell, and
it will be given only to those who worship the Antichrist.

Lots of Revelation scholars have weighed in on what exactly the mark
will be. Some have said it's an ID card, some have said it will be a
mark or a barcode tattooed on the skin, or others have said that it is
simply a mark which shows loyalty to the Antichrist (which is exactly
what the Bible tells us). All of these things are indeed possible, but
right now we simply don't know.

It's also not accurate to think of Revelation as simply symbolic. This
is the "allegorical" method of interpreting the Bible, claiming that the
Bible must be separated into the "literal," the "allegorical," "the
moral," and the "eschatological."

But the majority of Christians believe in the "literal grammatical"
method of interpreting the Bible. This doesn't mean that we don't
recognize symbolism, but it does mean that when symbolism exists, the
text will say so. For example, if a Bible writer said "The sky is blue,"
we should believe that the Bible writer meant exactly what he said. But
if he says something like "listen to this parable" or "he was roaring
*like* a lion," then there is a good chance that the text was meant to
be figurative or representative.

Why? We already know that the book of Revelation is **prophesy**. But
even prophesy is told from the perspective of the person receiving the
prophesy. To that end, because John describes this book *as* prophecy,
the reader does not have to hypothesize, theorize, allegorize, or
spiritualize the meaning of the events laid out in the Book of
Revelation. We should expect the interpretation of the book be laid out
in order for us by the author who gave us the prophecy, so that we may
understand and be blessed by it (cf Revelation 1:3). Also, there were
*specific numbers* given in Revelation. How are we to hypothesize or
allegorize those specific numbers? We don't. We take them as they are
written.

So back to the mark of the beast. Because the book of Revelation is
clear that the mark will be a physical mark on the forehead or the hand,
we believe that it will be something visible, on the forehead, or on the
hand. An ID card or a barcode or an RFID chip may be part of it, but we
don't know that yet. We do know that it will only be given to those who
show loyalty to the Antichrist.
