Florida is considered a "stop and ID" state. This means that if you are
stopped by law enforcement on suspicion of a crime or traffic violation,
you are expected to identify yourself. This also means that if the
officer does not have reasonable suspicion that you are involved in a
crime or a traffic violation, you do not have to identify yourself, but
that is the only time you are not obligated to positively identify
yourself.

The "stop and ID" law means you do have to identify yourself correctly
(about this, you cannot lie; lying about your identity would be a
separate offense). Usually your name and address are sufficient for an
officer to identify you.

The officer can ask you to *confirm* your identity. This means you must
present a valid form of identification if you have one on you. If you
are not driving a car, you do not have to have one on you. You don't
have to agree that the suspicion is reasonable before you confirm your
identity. Reasonableness is a matter of law to be decided by a judge.

Some other related rights you retain (especially important for
naturalized citizens or lawful permanent residents):

- You do not have to answer questions about where you were born, whether
  you're a U.S. citizen, or how you entered the country. (Separate rules
  apply at international borders and airports.)
- You are only expected to identify yourself to Florida law enforcement
  officers (police officers and Sheriff's deputies, not immigration or
  FBI agents) when you are stopped on suspicion of a crime or a traffic
  violation. If you don't have identification documents, you may choose
  to remain silent.
- You have zero obligation to provide your name or "show your papers" to
  an ICE officer for any reason.
- If you choose to volunteer information about your legal immigration
  status (i.e. "I am a permanent resident" or "I am here on a temporary
  visa,"), you only have the option to do so when you are carrying your
  papers and ready to show them.
