If the First Amendment means what it says, why can't I shout "Fire!" in
a crowded movie theater?

If a state can limit my free speech when it could significantly hurt
people (which the state is charged with protecting), can't they also
limit my gun rights when it could significantly hurt lots of people?

The short answer, clearly, is yes. Because "limiting" or "restricting"
the right is not legally considered "infringing" on the right as the
Amendment states.

The courts have found over the years that states can limit rights when
there is a **compelling state interest** to do so. They must also do so
in the **least restrictive** way possible to achieve their compelling
interest.
