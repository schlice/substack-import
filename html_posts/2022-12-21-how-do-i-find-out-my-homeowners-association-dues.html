The easiest way to find out is to contact your HOA.

If you don't know how to contact them, contact the people who send you
mail on behalf of the HOA. This is usually a **community association
manager (CAM)**, a company which provides community association services
to the HOA. They do things like, for example, maintaining the systems
needed to collect dues from homeowners. They should be able to give you
all that information.

If you can't find either your HOA or your CAM, contact your local
government to obtain a copy of the Governing Documents of your HOA.
These documents will list the officers and the CAM, which are all
required to be on file with the local government.
