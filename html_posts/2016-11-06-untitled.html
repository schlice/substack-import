A neighborhood without an HOA can be ruined by one lousy neighbor. Their
house can get into disrepair, the lawn can go unkempt, they can fill
their driveway with junk cars, etc. While you may think "live and let
live," a neighbor like that affects *your* property value. When you try
to sell your own house, you will find fewer buyers, and lower offers.
