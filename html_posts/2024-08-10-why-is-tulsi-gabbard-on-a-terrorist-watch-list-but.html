Because the terror watchlist is a *political* tool, not a *law
enforcement* tool.

Why? Because:

- You cannot know if you are actually on the terror watchlist until you
  try to board an airplane.
- There is no judicial oversight of your placement on the terror
  watchlist.
- There is no mechanism to determine *why* you were placed on the terror
  watchlist.
- There is no mechanism to *appeal* your placement on the terror
  watchlist.
- There is no mechanism to get yourself *removed* from the terror
  watchlist.

Senators are placed on the terror watchlist all the time, and even with
their power, it takes them *months* to have their placement reviewed and
to get themselves removed. If *you* were placed on the terror watchlist?
Forget about being able to get yourself off. You don't have enough money
to pay enough lawyers for enough time to actually get you off.

A secret government list which really has no teeth, no controls, and no
oversight? That's a political tool, used to bash your political enemies,
not to actually effect some safety protocol.

It's also a funny list, because it's only supposed to be a *no fly*
list, so the only thing you can't do if you're on the list is fly on a
commercial airplane. And airlines only *voluntarily* follow the list.
"Voluntarily." Like when someone from the FBI says here's a list of
people who shouldn't fly, but don't worry, you don't **have to** deny
them boarding, but you know, if they do board, and they do something
that a terrorist would do, and then we are questioned, we're going to
have to say that we already told you they were dangerous. Sure, it's
"voluntary."
