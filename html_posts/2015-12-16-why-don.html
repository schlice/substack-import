Same reason any business does or does not do something: cost/benefit
analysis.

Literally, the airlines have the thinnest profit margins of any
industry. A 2012 Forbes analysis showed that airlines make no more than
\$4US/passenger on a domestic flight. *Anything* that would change such
a margin is closely scrutinized, and any costs must be balanced by an
overriding benefit.

They already have eyes on every passenger: they are called *flight
attendants*. What benefit will a camera have that a flight attendant
currently lacks?
