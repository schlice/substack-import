As with all legal answers, the correct answer is "it depends."

Let's assume for completeness that your backyard is bounded by a privacy
fence. From the street level, no one can see you in your backyard.

Now, to make the point, let's assume you have a neighbor who can easily
see into your yard from a second-story window. At this point, laws
differ by state. In some cases, you can be cited for indecent exposure
if you are indecent in an area which a reasonable person should know is
viewable by someone who has not affirmatively consented to seeing such
things. In New Jersey for example, you can be cited under this statute
for simply being naked in your yard. The statute doesn't care where you
are. It simply says that if you are in an area which can reasonably be
seen by someone who didn't consent to look at what they are seeing, you
can be cited. In such a scenario, imagine if a child saw you. You could
*also* then be charged with contributing to the delinquency of a minor,
which would get you arrested. Contrast that with the indecent exposure
laws in Colorado. In that state, the exposure must be sexually-related
in order to be charged with indecent exposure. You either have to be
having sex, or exposing yourself in a sexually explicit manner (i.e.
touching yourself explicitly). Simply "being naked" where you can be
seen by someone else does not constitute indecent exposure there.

Also, if someone can see you in your yard from their house, they have
every right to watch you as well as record you, so long as they do it
from the same place they can normally see you (i.e. a second-story
window). In other words, if you want *privacy*, you need to go inside
and cover your windows. If you can be seen from a neighbor's
second-story window, you voluntarily give up your expectation of privacy
by stepping outside naked.

TL;DR: Check your state and city ordinances on indecent exposure before
you go traipsing around naked in your yard.
