Is it *likely*? No.

*Should* it happen? Absolutely.

So should it be defuned or replaced? No.

It should be **broken up** and its agents spread to other Federal
agencies within the government. We have a lot of investigatory agencies
within the federal government. So take the people in the FBI who
investigate currency and give them to the Treasury (Secret Service).
Take the people who deal with terrorists, foreign agents, etc. and give
them to Homeland Security. Take the ones who work with the Pentagon and
make a special unit at the Pentagon.

The bottom line is that this single organization has too much
centralized power, and is a threat to democracy. We don't need a federal
police force. We have state level resources, and we have federal
agencies to perform specific tasks. There isn't anything the FBI does
that other agencies can't (or don't) handle.

It was a great idea when it was needed. But its time has passed, and it
has become corrupt at an institutional level.

But as the old song says, *Breakin' up is hard to do.* It certainly
won't be an easy task, but it is necessary. And it is a noble task. To
preserve the Republic, it **must** be done.
