**Content:** [The website operator will likely have to claim immunity
under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act.\
\
The website is responsible for the content it authors. But under Section
230, website operators have \"safe harbor\" protections for third-party
activity in most cases. Unless the website is creating or \"developing\"
the illegal transaction, it\'s likely that it will be
protected.]{.rendered_qtext}
