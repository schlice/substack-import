**Is getting re-elected and running out the statute of limitations
Trump\'s only hope of avoiding prison?**

As we've now mentioned many times on Quora, *if* the President is not
actually indicted for a crime while he's in office (which is likely,
because you likely can't indict a sitting president), the statute of
limitations would most likely be *tolled* until such time that the
President becomes indictable. It's certainly unfair to the plaintiff to
have the President avoid an indictment by running out the clock on the
statute of limitations when he can't be indicted, and there is a natural
time when he can (either the natural conclusion of his term, or
impeachment and removal from office).

Therefore, the statute of limitations would most likely be tolled until
the President could actually be indicted.
