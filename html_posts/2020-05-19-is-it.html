**Is it "assault" when someone follows me to the door of the bathroom
after I announce I'm going to shower?**

As always, the answer to legal questions is "it depends."

The definition of assault varies by state, but in general, a simple
assault takes place when someone's intentional act puts you in
reasonable fear of imminent harmful conduct. Also in some states,
"assault" is called "attempted battery." In some states, assault can be
combined with battery (actual harmful conduct) to make a crime called
"assault and battery."

In an assault, the *fear* happens when you believe that the person's
conduct will result in imminent harm. You don't have to believe that the
person will be *successful* in causing harm, just that the person is
*capable* of causing harm.

Your fear must also be *reasonable*. Something must cause you to believe
that the person intended to harm you. If there was a male locker room
adjacent to the female locker room, for example, then the simple fact
that the person followed you may be nothing more than coincidental
timing. So there must have been something else that caused you to
believe that the person was contemplating harming you, and that belief
needs to be reasonable. Courts use what's called the "reasonable person"
test to figure this out. After hearing what caused you to believe the
person would harm you, they would say, "Would a reasonable person, in
the same situation, believe the same as you?" If a court would answer
that question as yes, then your circumstance passes the reasonableness
test.

So in your circumstance, if the person following you to the bathroom
after you announce you are going to shower put you in reasonable fear
that they were going to harm you, then in most circumstances in most
states, that would qualify as a simple misdemeanor assault.

*For the time being, I have re-enabled comments on selected answers.
Some people like to comment. Some people like to engage with me in a
civil manner, and I did kinda miss that\...a little. But do not
misunderstand, I take this step very cautiously. My mental well-being
isn\'t worth your harassing, inane behavior. If you don\'t like what I
wrote, tough shit. If my answer is grammatically low-quality or is
un-cited opinion masquerading as fact, downvote it. If you think I\'m
wrong, write your own answer. But Quora is a question-and-answer site,
not a debate site. If you are simply commenting to tell me \"ackshually,
you\'re wrong,\" don\'t be surprised if I quietly delete your comment.
Put anything vaguely harassing in there, and your deletion will be
followed by a block and a mute. I will do this immediately and with no
compunction. You have been warned. Be nice.*
