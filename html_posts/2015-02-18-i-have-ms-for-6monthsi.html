**Content:** [First, for the specifics, read my previous answer on
this:\
\
[[Bill Stein\'s answer to Can a man with multiple sclerosis have a
normal sex
life?](https://www.quora.com/Can-a-man-with-multiple-sclerosis-have-a-normal-sex-life/answer/Bill-Stein)]{.qlink_container}\
\
Next, don\'t avoid sex just because you have MS. First of all, you\'ll
never know whether or not you actually are having an issue with sexual
dysfunction if you avoid sex.\
\
Second, it\'s not something to fear; it\'s something to work around.
There are drugs readily available to help with sexual dysfunction
(Viagra, Cialis, etc), so don\'t worry, even if you do start to have
sexual dysfunction caused by MS, you can work around it.\
\
Also, you don\'t want this to become psychosomatic; i.e. you get so
worried about not being able to perform that you actually start to
perform poorly because of your fear. In other words, your fear of
performing poorly actually causes you to perform poorly, not any disease
activity.\
\
Finally, don\'t forget to talk to your doctor about any symptoms you are
experiencing, regardless of whether or not you may be embarrassed
because of them. If you are not open and honest with your doctor, you
won\'t be getting the best care you possibly can.\
\
Good luck, hang in there! Keep fighting the MonSter!]{.rendered_qtext}
