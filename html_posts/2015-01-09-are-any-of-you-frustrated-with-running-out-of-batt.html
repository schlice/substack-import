**Content:** [As an Android user, I can change my batteries. I bought
two batteries and an external battery charger from Amazon for about
US\$20. If I\'m going somewhere with spotty coverage (where my phone
will be using lots of battery to search for signal) or where I know
I\'ll have the screen on for extended time periods, I\'ll grab the extra
battery and drop it in my pocket. If it dies, I swap it out. Simple.\
\
Don\'t invest in wireless charging until it becomes more integrated into
the actual phone itself. Otherwise, I think the systems are just to
kludge-y right now.]{.rendered_qtext}
