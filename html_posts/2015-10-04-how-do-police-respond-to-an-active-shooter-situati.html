**Content:** [I\'m afraid that [[George
Whittington](https://www.quora.com/profile/George-Whittington)]{.qlink_container}
is spot-on here. The specifics of the response protocol that police use
can\'t be released.\

Rest assured, however, that ever since Columbine, police across the
United States have been working very hard to build and implement a
protocol for dealing with active shooters. The protocol in use today is
very well thought out, and very succinctly deals with these types of
situations. Every active shooter situation also helps police improve
their response to such a situation.]{.rendered_qtext}
