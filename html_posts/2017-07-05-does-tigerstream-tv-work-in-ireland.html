TigerStream is nothing more than an Android device running
[[Kodi](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=bd903c&url=https://kodi.tv/){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="kodi.tv"}]{.qlink_container}. If Kodi works in Ireland, then
TigerStream will work in Ireland.

Kodi is just a platform for plugging in streaming software. Some streams
will be available in Ireland, some will not. There are lots of streams
available, so there's bound to be at least one that is available in
Ireland.
