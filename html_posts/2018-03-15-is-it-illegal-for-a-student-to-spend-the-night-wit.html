**Is it illegal for a student to spend the night with a police officer
from school?**

Okay, time to be adults here.

Most "students" are below the age of consent, so there should be a
parent or guardian making decisions for that student.

Why a student would spend the night with a person who is not their
parent is beyond me.

Maybe a sleepover at a friend's house, whose parent happens to be the
police officer from school? But even then, the parents coordinate.

I think I need more context to answer correctly.
