**If Trump is pardoned by Pence, can the State of New York prosecute him
for crimes committed there?**

Currently, yes they can.

However, there is a case that is going to be heard by SCOTUS during this
term. In *Gamble v. United States*, the Supreme Court is considering
whether the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment, which
prohibits any person from being prosecuted for the same offense more
than once, bars a federal prosecution for a criminal offense when the
defendant has already been prosecuted for the same offense in state
court.[\[1\]](#AbljU){#cite-AbljU .citation_link}

Currently, the theory of *dual sovereignty* governs the federal vs state
exemption to double jeopardy. The Federal government and the state, as
sovereign entities, can both define a crime separately, and even if it
refers to the exact same occurrence, can both prosecute that crime
separately, and it does not violate the double jeopardy clause.

If SCOTUS rules in favor of Gamble, the dual sovereignty rule would be
overturned. If a crime is prosecuted in a state court, the Federal
government could not prosecute that person for the same crime at a
Federal level. If a crime is prosecuted at the Federal level, a state
could not prosecute for that same crime. And if the military prosecutes
a crime under UCMJ, the Federal government would not be able to
prosecute the same crime when the military is done.

Now, back to the question. We're assuming that Trump is impeached,
removed from office, subsequently indicted in a Federal court, and
convicted, and President Pence pardons him. If dual sovereignty is ruled
unconstitutional, then the pardon would prevent New York from
prosecuting Trump for the same crime. Just because it's illegal under
both Federal and state law would not allow New York to prosecute for the
same crime. If dual sovereignty remains in effect, then a Federal pardon
would not prevent New York from filing charges for the same crime under
New York law.

One conspiracy theory alleges that this is why Republicans pushed so
hard to get Kavanaugh on the court: because he'd be the tipping point
ruling for Gamble, and then this very chain of events would take place.
