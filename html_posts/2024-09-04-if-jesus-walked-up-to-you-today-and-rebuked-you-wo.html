Yes, and then No.

First, I haven't seen any of the signs of Jesus' return (although some
people think that the COVID shot was actually the mark of the beast). So
until I see the Antichrist and the False Prophet, I wouldn't expect to
see Christ yet. So I would be surprised if Jesus walked up to me
*today.*

But when I do see Christ, I do fully expect to be **chewed out up one
side and down the other.** I fully expect Him to rebuke the living crap
out of me. I am human, and I sin by nature. Despite my best efforts, I
still sin. *But once He's done "rebuking" me,* He'll say, "...but it's
okay. I've taken the punishment for your sin already."

So yes, I fully expect to be rebuked. But then I expect Him to say that
I'm forgiven.
