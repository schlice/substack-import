Current military policy allows transgender persons to serve openly in
the Armed Forces, but specific guidance has yet to come out. In some
units where transgenders have come out to their commanders, the
commanders (who have no specific guidance about how to handle the
situation) have often told co-workers to continue to refer to the
transgender servicemember using the wrong gender. In some cases, careers
have been put on hold because there is no policy, and the military is
unsure how to handle the transgender servicemember.

This is a tough one; I don't think I can give you appropriate guidance.
I'd love to tell you, "Go for it! Damn the torpedoes, full speed ahead!"
but I'm concerned for you. The military is in flux right now, and
sending you in there guns blazing may not be the best thing for you.

I want you to serve, and I want you to serve in the gender in which you
feel most comfortable, but I'm afraid the military doesn't know how to
handle you yet.

Think about this. What if the Department of Transportation issued a
ruling that said that under some circumstances, you are now allowed to
turn left on red, but didn't provide the circumstances? There would be
mass chaos as some people tried to follow the new guidance, but without
knowing exactly when and where, there were accidents all over the place.
Tempers were raised, feelings were hurt, and in some cases, people were
hurt as well.

This is exactly what Secretary Carter did when he said transgenders may
serve openly, but we don't yet have guidance for military commanders to
follow regarding transgender servicemembers.

You already know the choices you have available to you in this
situation: either stay in the closet and serve as a woman, or come out
to your commander and let the chips fall where they may. I just don't
feel comfortable telling you which you should do, and thus throwing you
to the wolves right now when there is no clear guidance on how to handle
transgender servicemembers. The military needs to get its collective act
together. I understand the military's concern as well: this has nothing
to do with the execution of the mission, and they'd be right. But they
have received guidance that transgenders may serve openly, so at the
very least, the individual service should come up with a policy, instead
of sitting around waiting for the administration to do it. Even if their
policy eventually gets changed, at least they will be doing *something*
to assist commanders. As it is, they're all just flapping in the wind.
