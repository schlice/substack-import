**My mum's boyfriend is homophobic. I feel like telling him I like girls
and that there's nothing wrong with it. Should I?**

No, because you're having the conversation with the wrong person.

You need to have the conversation with your mum, not with him. She needs
to know the friction that allowing him into her home will cause. If you
haven't come out to your mum yet, this would be a good conversation
starter.

Hopefully, your mum will put your mental health and your safety over her
new beau and choose you instead.
