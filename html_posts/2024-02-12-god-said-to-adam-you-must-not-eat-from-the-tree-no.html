Let's go step by step and see if we can answer these questions.

First, God told Adam that he should not eat of the fruit from the tree.
God didn't say anything about not touching it.

> And the Lord God commanded the man, saying, "You may surely eat of
> every tree of the garden, but of the tree of the knowledge of good and
> evil you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat of it you shall
> surely die." --- Genesis 2:16--17 ESV

*When Eve explained to the serpent what God had commanded, however,* she
included the "or not touch it."

> He said to the woman, "Did God actually say, 'You shall not eat of any
> tree in the garden'?" And the woman said to the serpent, "We may eat
> of the fruit of the trees in the garden, but God said, 'You shall not
> eat of the fruit of the tree that is in the midst of the garden,
> **neither shall you touch it,** lest you die.'" --- Genesis 3:1--3 ESV
> (**emphasis** mine)

So right there, as Eve was talking to the serpent, the serpent knew that
Eve didn't have a complete understanding of God's command. That left the
serpent an opening that he could use to confuse and tempt Eve, which he
did to full effect.

But the "death" they were discussing in the Garden was a little more
nuanced. In order to understand this, we need to understand how the word
"death" is being used in a given context. The **physical** death (or the
first death) is simply the end of a human being\'s life, whether through
age, disease, accident, or violence. The breath of life leaves the
person, consciousness ceases, and the body begins to decay. This is the
fate of all human beings.

But the Bible also uses death to describe the **spiritual** state of
people who are undoubtedly physically alive.

> Therefore, just as sin came into the world through one man, and death
> through sin, and so death spread to all men because all sinned ---
> Romans 5:12 ESV

The death that entered the world through Adam\'s sin was *not*
**physical** death. Adam was a flesh-and-blood human being, so his body
was naturally subject to entropy. The fact that he was created as flesh
meant that, at some point, his heart would stop, and the breath of life
would leave. Even if he had lived a sinless life, he still would have
died when his body ceased to function. Adam was never immortal; he
needed to eat of the Tree of Life to live forever:

> Then the Lord God said, "Behold, the man has become like one of us in
> knowing good and evil. Now, lest he reach out his hand and take also
> of the tree of life and eat, and live forever" --- Genesis 3:22 ESV

When Adam sinned, he immediately entered a state of **spiritual**---not
**physical**---death, which contributed to the foundation of Satan\'s
deception that life continues after sin.

As it remains today, Satan\'s treachery was effective and destructive
because, like Adam, we typically live on---physically---after sinning.
While Adam\'s physical death was a foregone conclusion due to his being
fleshly, it was not the death that entered the world through his sin.
Instead, spiritual death entered the world at that point and spread to
all of his offspring. His sin destroyed the union mankind had with God,
without which there is no life:

> Behold, all souls are mine; the soul of the father as well as the soul
> of the son is mine: the soul who sins shall die. --- Ezekiel 18:4 ESV
>
> The soul who sins shall die. The son shall not suffer for the iniquity
> of the father, nor the father suffer for the iniquity of the son. The
> righteousness of the righteous shall be upon himself, and the
> wickedness of the wicked shall be upon himself. --- Ezekiel 18:20 ESV
>
> Behold, the Lord\'s hand is not shortened, that it cannot save,\
> or his ear dull, that it cannot hear;\
> but your iniquities have made a separation\
> between you and your God,\
> and your sins have hidden his face from you\
> so that he does not hear. --- Isaiah 59:1--2 ESV

Accordingly, separated from God, mankind has no future beyond physical
death unless God acts. The wages of sin is eternal death, and there will
not be everlasting life unless God gives it as a gift.
