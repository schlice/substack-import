**Has FL. Governor Desantis, who finally noticed that people without
symptoms can spread the coronavirus, also discover that people at
religious services are immune and do not need to stay at home?**

I would posit only that it might be difficult for a church to even bring
their pastor and their worship team together (maintaining social
distancing, of course) to lead streaming worhsip services if they didn't
have an explicit exemption.

Yes, I know. When you make an explicit religious exemption, the
chronically stupid among us will congregate at church, believing the
exemption means that religious people are immune.

Let it be. Natural selection will do the rest.
