**Is it a human right to be able to go to the toilet?**

It's a bodily function, not a right. You're going to go whether or not
someone tells you to go. Indeed, while you may be able to not go for
some time, eventually you will have to go or you will suffer harm.

You might instead be asking whether or not it is a human right to go to
the toilet **in a physical toilet**. And if it is a human right to use a
physical toilet, then anyone can use any toilet, anywhere, without
restriction.

Clearly, that's not the case.

So even if using the toilet is a right, the government can still limit
the **time, place,** and **manner** of your exercising that right
without denying you the right.

In the United States, you have the right to free speech. But the
government can limit the **time, place,** and **manner** of your speech
in order to advance public safety.

So there's nothing that says you must be allowed to go in any toilet, at
any time you like, even if you do have a right to go to the toilet.
