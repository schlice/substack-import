**What do all the school shooters have in common so we can prevent
another?**

- They all came in to the school through an open door.
- They all happened in gun-free zones.

To prevent another school shooting, put lots of armed guards by that
door and lock the others (make them exit only) and put a metal detector
at that door. And repeal the ridiculous "gun-free zones" rule keeping
our kids in a target-rich environment with zero resistance.

Boom. School shootings stopped.
