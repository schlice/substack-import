The answer is **yes.**

In religion, we call it a
[[**theophany**](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=4d11b9&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theophany){.external_link

onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}**.** A theophany is a
physical manifestation of God, and it doesn't have to occur just in
prayer.

Theophanies are documented in the Bible. Some of them are God appearing
as:

- A burning bush
- A pillar of smoke
- A cloud

One of the intrinsic characteristics of a theophany is its
*temporariness*. It is not a permanent manifestation, but only a
temporary one.

There is a really great story of Jacob in Genesis wrestling with a man
who was actually a theophany:

> *Then Jacob was left alone; and a Man wrestled with him until the
> breaking of day. Now when He saw that He did not prevail against him,
> He touched the socket of his hip; and the socket of Jacob's hip was
> out of joint as He wrestled with him. \[...\] And He said, "Your name
> shall no longer be called Jacob, but Israel; for you have struggled
> with God and with men, and have prevailed."*
>
> *Then Jacob asked, saying, "Tell me Your name, I pray."*
>
> *And He said, "Why is it that you ask about My name?" And He blessed
> him there. So Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: "For I have
> seen God face to face, and my life is preserved." --- Genesis
> 32:24--25, 28--30*

So is it possible for someone to physically see or feel God when
praying? In Christianity at least, the answer is yes, it is possible.

But what about today? If we're asking about modern-day theophanies, I
think we're asking the wrong question, because the fulfilled promise of
Jesus changes the game. Our friends at

better than I could:
