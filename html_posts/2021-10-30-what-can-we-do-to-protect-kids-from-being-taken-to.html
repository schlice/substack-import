I get what your question was about: you think that children being
exposed to religion at a young age is akin to forced indoctrination.

But you know, church or no, **you'll never stop that.**

Ultimately, parents are responsible for the upbringing of their
children, which includes whatever indoctrination they choose. And it
doesn't have to be about religion. It can be about politics. It can be
about racism. It can be about literally anything you use to create your
personal morality. That is, rightly, the parent's responsibility, not
the state's. So your proposal is really ineffectual as parents are
legally responsible for that indoctrination.

Plus, there's that pesky Constitution in the United States which kinda
states pretty specifically that the government can't stop you from
worshipping how you please, so you'll never be able to do what you are
asking anyway.

When children grow up and are able to think for themselves, they will
either accept or reject that parental indoctrination. Believe me, I
know. It is possible to reject what your parents taught you about
religion. Just look at my credential.
