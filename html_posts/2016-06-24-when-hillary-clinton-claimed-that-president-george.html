She's ***Hillary***. She always knows.

You're just supposed to believe her. You're not supposed to ask
questions.

And if you asked her, she'd probably say something along the lines of
*Bush knew there was a threat to the country, although he didn't know
specifics, he didn't do enough to protect us!*

The fact of the matter is that no one, not even Bush, knew or even
foresaw our own aircraft being turned into weapons. The Pentagon had it
in a war games scenario, but it was something that sat on a shelf. No
one ever took it seriously.
