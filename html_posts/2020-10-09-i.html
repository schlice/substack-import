**I'm 17 and want a new car but my parents are skeptical because they
don't know how much insurance will go up with my name on the policy.
Could my mom or dad insure the car under their name only and if I get
pulled over, I just say I'm borrowing it?**

The issue is not when you're pulled over. Especially if you don't own
the car, you don't have to be listed on the insurance card to drive the
car. So long as the vehicle is covered by an active insurance policy,
the police are happy. The issue is what happens if you get into an
*accident* without being on the policy. And the issue is not with the
police, but with the auto insurance company.

Most insurance companies will extend coverage to teen drivers who
haven't been added yet to their parent's policies. Sometimes it's just
an oversight. Sometimes, people are just trying to save money. In most
cases, if you get into an accident, insurance will still cover you even
if you're not on the policy.

Most. Not all.

Some insurance companies consider this to be *misrepresentation*, and
the company could deny coverage to you if you're in an accident, leaving
the cost of repairing the car, and the cost of covering any injuries you
cause, up to your parents. In some cases, they may cover the accident
you're in, but then charge you back premiums for the time that you had
your license and were driving without being on the policy. Sometimes,
they'll do one of the above, and then drop your parents from coverage
when everything is paid up. Most policies have a clause which says that
you must notify them of all changes in drivers. Some have a clause which
says basically, "if you don't notify us, we won't cover you."

Yes, it can be expensive. But trying to conceal you from insurance could
be just as costly if you get in to an accident. Have your parents talk
with their insurance company about discounts which may be available,
like good student discounts and discounts for attending safe driver
courses.
