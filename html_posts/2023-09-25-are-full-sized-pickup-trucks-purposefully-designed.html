It does indeed seem that full-sized pickup trucks are getting larger and
larger in an apparent attempt to piss off everyone else on the road.

It is true that trucks are indeed getting larger every year. But it's
not happening to piss people off. **It's happening thanks to the US
government.** And it happens because of a standard called CAFE.

The Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards are fleet-wide
averages that automakers must meet for their cars and trucks each year.
The purpose of CAFE is to reduce energy consumption by increasing the
fuel economy of cars and light trucks. The CAFE standards were first
enacted by Congress in 1975. Since 1978, each automaker has had to meet
the CAFE standards for their car and truck fleets.

The CAFE standards for passenger cars and light-duty trucks in the U.S.
is 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025. This was set under the Obama
Administration, and it was repealed under the Trump administration. In
place of CAFE standards, the Trump administration created Safer
Affordable Fuel-Efficient (SAFE) standards to give manufacturers more
freedom and reduce the quality-adjusted prices of vehicles by an average
of \$2,200. While SAFE 1 still increased fuel economy standards, it did
so at a slower rate than the standards proposed by Obama's
administration. SAFE 1 also proposed that manufacturers comply with the
standards by focusing on greenhouse gas emission standards because of
the subsequent ability to help reach CAFE standards. SAFE 1 ultimately
sought to loosen the annual fuel efficiency increase from 5% to 1.5%
through 2026.[\[1\]](#XSAgK){#cite-XSAgK .citation_link}

SAFE 1 has since been repealed by the Biden administration for
overstepping the agency's legal authority and for not taking local and
national interests into account. Under the new administration, the NHTSA
finalized CAFE standards for model years 2024-2026 on March 31, 2022.
These recently passed standards require about 49 miles per gallon for
all light-duty vehicles by 2026 by increasing fuel efficiency by 8%
annually for the years 2024 and 2025, and 10% annually for the year
2026.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) found that
the 49 miles per gallon standard could save consumers nearly \$1,400 in
total fuel expenses over the lifetime of compliant vehicles. It could
also save 234 billion gallons of gas between 2030 and 2050.

The CAFE standards are determined with a mathematical formula based on
vehicle footprints. The goal is to prevent automakers from meeting the
mileage requirement by reducing vehicle size and weight, which could
reduce vehicle safety. Making the vehicles smaller would automatically
increase their fuel economy, as the engines have less mass to move.

What has happened in the industry is the *inverse*. Rather than making
vehicles *smaller* to meet the standards, they made the vehicles
*larger* so that they could meet the *lower* standards.

This growing of truck sizes has a natural limit, but it does push out
the requirement for fuel efficiency a few years, and gives physics the
opportunity to catch up.

Therefore, you see trucks getting larger.
