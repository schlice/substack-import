While a parole officer can tell a homeowner parolee to fix safety
issues, the PO is not *responsible* for ensuring the issues are fixed.

Only the **homeowner** listed on the deed is responsible for fixing code
issues, no one else. No one else that lives there is responsible for
maintaining the home other than the homeowner.

The PO can report the violation to the Code Enforcement division of the
local government to take action against the negligent homeowner.

Original question:

If a homeowner refuses to keep his home up to safety code 2 times and
was told by his parole officer that it he needed to fix the problems,
who else is responsible that lives there?
