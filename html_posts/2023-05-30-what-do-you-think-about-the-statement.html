I'm a theist and that's the stupidest statement I've heard yet today
(but the day is still young).

Atheists do not believe in God. However, I will argue that **atheism is
a religion**.

Just as they accuse theists, atheists believe ***with zero proof*** that
there is no God. They cannot ***prove*** beyond a reasonable doubt that
God does not exist, yet they have ***faith*** that He does not.

So just like the theists, atheists have belief and faith. And just like
theists, they have *dogma* (the inerrant nature of what they consider to
be science) and *exclusivity* (you must believe as they do in order to
join their club --- theists are not welcome).

Even the courts have recognized that atheism is, in a certain sense, a
religion, because it is covered by the Establishment Clause. The 7th
Circuit said, "when a person sincerely holds beliefs dealing with issues
of ultimate concern that for her occupy a place parallel to that filled
by \... God in traditionally religious persons, those beliefs represent
her religion." The Circuit said, therefore, the establishment clause is
equally applicable to the nonreligious and even the anti-religious.
"\[A\]theism may be considered, \[only\] in this special sense, a
religion."[\[1\]](#auhiC){#cite-auhiC .citation_link}

So while the statement in the question is clearly wrong, a statement
which is at least an arguable one is, "**No one is more religious than
an atheist.**"
