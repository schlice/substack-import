God doesn't want a bunch of mindless robots who have no choice but to
believe in Him. He only wants people with Him who ***freely choose*** to
believe in Him. So if you are forced to believe in Him, you will, but
you may not be happy about it.

That's the very essence of free will. Love can only be given freely; it
can never be coerced.

Think about it. If you can't be bothered to spend one hour of one day of
the week to worship God, why would you want to go someplace where you're
going to spend *every day of the rest of eternity* doing it? I think
that would be **the worst torture imaginable**.

No, God set up the system so that you can freely choose to love Him or
to reject Him without violating your free will. And to make sure your
choice is *truly* free, He places us in a world filled with evidence of
His existence, *but without His direct presence*, which would be so
overwhelming as to overpower our free will and coerce us into believing
in Him. And he does not want that.

He truly wants everyone to be saved. But He's not going to **force**
everyone to love Him. So you can freely choose to reject Him if you so
desire.
