**What would you do? I have disability court tomorrow. My lawyer left a
message saying he just now reviewed my case, even though I got him 18
months ago. Also, he won't be at court due to lack of documentation. Can
I do anything?**

I'll assume by "disability court" that you're referring to a Social
Security Disability hearing in front of an administrative law judge
(ALJ).

Not having representation at court (i.e. being unrepresented), or having
ill-prepared representation at court (i.e. being underrepresented) are
both valid reasons for postponing your hearing.

I would immediately contact my Office of Disability Adjudication and
Review (ODAR), advise them what your lawyer said, and ask if they can
postpone the hearing.

If they postpone your hearing, call your disability representative and
advise him that having representation for over a year and only reviewing
the case one day before court is not only unacceptable, it's
unprofessional. Tell him that you got him a delay of X days, and he had
better be prepared for the next court date, and he'd better be there
early and have all his ducks in a row or he's going to find himself
answering questions from the bar about why he can't perform his
essential job functions.

If they *don't* postpone your hearing, make sure you make it known at
the beginning of the proceeding what your lawyer said, and again ask the
court for a postponement because of a lack of representation.
