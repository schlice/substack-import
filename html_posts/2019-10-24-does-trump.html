**Does Trump\'s lawyer\'s claim of the President being above the law
make you believe that Trump will not leave office if he is not
re-elected?**

There are two questions here:

- Does Trump's lawyer have a point when he says that the President is
  essentially "above the law"?
- Will Trump not leave office if he is not re-elected?

Let's start with the second question. If Trump loses, he will leave
office. Period. Trump has prided himself on being a Constitutionalist
and a globalist. He is certainly not someone who has ever acted
extra-Constitutionally (at least, not with any real evidence that he has
done so --- Russiagate and Ukrainegate are fake news). Regardless, these
claims come up every four or eight years, and similar to just a few
years ago, they have never been an issue. Trump will absolutely leave
office if he is not re-elected. He may not go quietly (as long as you
count Twitter rants as a noisy departure), but he'll go.

With that in mind, let's answer the first question. Does Trump's lawyer
have a point that a President cannot be prosecuted *while president*?
While it's never been tested Constitutionally, the answer is likely yes,
a president cannot be prosecuted while serving *as president*.

Does this mean the President is *above the law?*

Certainly not.

What it *does* mean is that **while the President is president,** he
cannot be prosecuted. As soon as he's no longer President, he can be
prosecuted. Once the former Marine One helicopter lands, he can be
placed into custody and indicted, as any citizen can. It's unlikely such
an event would take place, and the former President would arrange a time
to go to court without the handcuffs and the frog marching, but he will
still face justice.

But while he is President, all authority to enforce laws *flows from his
office*. The Constitution is very clear about this in Article II,
Section 1, Clause 1: "The executive Power shall be vested in a President
of the United States of America." This means that the office of the
President **is the executive**. All executive branch agencies derive
executive authority from the President, as he sees fit to delegate it.
This means the Department of Justice, the FBI, and every other Federal
law enforcement agency gets its authority directly from the President,
*the Chief Executive*. This means the power to authorize (or deny) an
indictment flows from the power of the president. That officeholder must
necessarily be immune from prosecution. It's like a deputy trying to
arrest his own Sheriff. It cannot be done. If a US Attorney tried to
prosecute the President, he could simply say "no" to that prosecution,
and the US Attorney could not continue.

But this does not mean the President is not immune from prosecution. The
President *while serving as Chief Executive* cannot be prosecuted. *Once
he leaves that position,* he is no longer part of that organization. The
Constitution has a method to deal with that as well: **impeachment**.
Once the President is removed from office, he can be indicted.
