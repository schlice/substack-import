**Content:** [I can\'t presume anything about your previous encounters
with police, but I can take some guesses, if you like.\
\
The first example could have been a few things:\
\
- Officers are always on the lookout for young, inexperienced drivers,
and are always trying to impart, in one way or another, the dangers of
exceeding the speed limit. He may have been trying to \"scare you
straight\" a little.\
\
The second example simply shows a lack of empathy, a lack of
professionalism, and an officer who thinks he missed his calling in
comedy. I\'m sorry that happened to you. If this was a major
metropolitan police department, I\'d be saddened at the state of affairs
in that place. If it was a big enough issue for you, perhaps you should
have taken the time to report it.\
\
However, for your reference, officers do not carry bottles of water for
people. Don\'t get me wrong, that doesn\'t give the officer permission
to insult or mock you. I\'m just telling you that the correct response
would have been, \"I\'m sorry, ma\'am, I don\'t have a bottle of water I
can get you. I\'ll try my best to finish this up quickly to get you on
your way.\"\
\
For me, the choice of agency for whom to work is important, because I\'m
a volunteer. I\'ll only work for an agency that respects people, shows
respect while on the job, and handles issues of disrespect quickly and
efficiently.]{.rendered_qtext}
