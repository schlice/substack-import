Michelle Carter was convicted for participating in "wanton and reckless
conduct" for encouraging her then-boyfriend to commit suicide. She went
much further, though, by instructing him as to when and how he should
kill himself, reassuring him when he was concerned about killing
himself, and berating him when he delayed doing so.

With that in mind, if a prosecutor could prove that if someone made a
recommendation to not get a vaccine, and that person *knew* that not
taking a vaccine would result in a particular person's death, then you
could at least make the case that criminal charges may be warranted,
assuming that encouraging someone to kill themselves is a crime in that
state.

But failing to take a vaccine does not *directly* cause death. Failing
to take a vaccine, at best, leads to *more aggressive* disease, and
leads to a higher likelihood of a more challenging disease course and
worse outcomes, *including* death. And ultimately, recommending that
someone do something which is harmful to themselves is covered under the
1st Amendment. For example, if someone is standing on the ledge of a
tall building and I'm on the ground and I yell, "Jump! Jump!" and they
do, can I be charged with conspiracy to commit suicide? The answer is
no, because while I may have encouraged them to commit suicide,
ultimately the choice to do so is theirs. There are only a handful of
states which have statutes on their books regarding encouraging suicide.
Connecticut has a statute related to "causing" suicide and making it
murder:

1.  intentionally causing a person to commit suicide by force, duress,
    or deception is classified as murder (CGS ยง 53a-54a)
2.  intentionally causing or aiding a person, other than by force,
    duress, or deception, to commit suicide is classified as 2nd degree
    manslaughter (CGS ยง 53a-56). [\[1\]](#IlykM){#cite-IlykM

Oklahoma and South Dakota have laws which criminalize encouraging
suicide. California also has one, but the California Supreme Court said
that in order for it to be murder, you have to do something more direct
than just words encouraging a suicide. Minnesota had one, but their
Supreme Court ruled it was an unconstitutional 1st Amendment violation.

So no, you can't charge the GOP with murder even if they did actively
recommend people not take a vaccine, which I'm unaware that they did. I
think, at best, they simply said that vaccines are a personal decision
and should be up to the individual to decide, and should not be forced
by the government to take, even if it is in their best interest.

Original question:

If Michelle Carter can be convicted for talking her boyfriend into
suicide, could GOP be charged with a form of conspiracy & murder for the
majority of the \>824,000 Covid dead who took their advice & are dying
today at 6x the rate of vaxxed people?
