**How much would a saloon car\'s stability be affected if you drive with
all windows down at 120 kph or above?**

Hardly any at all.

At worst, this would have a negative effect on gas mileage, as it has
been shown that driving with your windows down at above roughly 80 kph
(about 50 mph) begins to negatively affect your fuel economy. Below 80,
you should drive with the windows down and no air con. If you drive
above 80, you should roll the windows up and use the air con. This gets
you better fuel economy.
