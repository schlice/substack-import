**If not called to an emergency, can a fire truck pull you over for
speeding?**

No. Fire trucks cannot stop vehicles.

The lights and siren *functionally* work the same way regardless of the
vehicle they are on: when you see them in your rear-view mirror, you are
to safely pull over to allow the emergency vehicle to pass.

But that's where the similarities end. If you pull over and a fire truck
pulls behind you, you're free to leave (in fact, it\'s encouraged; you
don\'t want to get in the firefighters' way). If a police car pulls
behind you, you've been pulled over and you need to wait until the
officer says you're free to leave.

The difference is that fire fighters are not authorized by the state to
enforce laws. They are authorized by the state to move cars out of their
way with noisy, blinky trucks so they can rush to a fire to put it out.
They are not authorized to enforce state traffic laws. That\'s someone
else\'s job.
