<h2>Answer Comment</h2>
<div>

**Content:** [What you\'ve stated has no bearing on the fact that any
attempt to restrict handgun ***ownership*** (which *Heller* and
*McDonald* already addressed and said is legal, even if only in the
home) to those who can take a training course and pass a test would be
unconstitutional.\
\
States already have laws which restrict the concealed carry of handguns
to those who are properly trained and vetted, and this is not
unconstitutional. Some states have \"open-carry\" laws which allow
anyone who has the right to own a firearm (which is almost everyone) to
carry it anywhere out in the open (not concealed). This also does not
constitute an ownership restriction as implied by the Second Amendment.\
\
You can\'t apply the same rules to possession and ownership that you
apply to carry outside the home. The state has a compelling interest in
regulating carry of weapons. The state cannot similarly regulate
ownership.]{.rendered_qtext}
