**Is it practical to intentionally stall an aircraft to execute a fast,
controlled descent?**

It doesn't fit what you're trying to do.

You want a practical method by which you can execute a fast,
**controlled** descent. A nose-high stall does not meet this criteria,
because for at least a part of it, it is uncontrolled. Granted, you
regain control pretty quickly once you start getting airflow over the
wings again, but it begins with an altitude-gaining maneuver before
airflow over the wings ceases, and that's like going south to go north.

if the point is a fast, controlled descent, your best bet is a
simultaneous *reduction* of throttle and forward pressure on the control
yoke.
