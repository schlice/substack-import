Yes, and I'll prove it by science, not religion.

The Big Bang (which nearly everyone agrees created the entire universe)
not only created the objects in the universe, *but it created the
universe itself.*

Einstein's Theory of General Relativity relies on a number of
calculations, but the premise of those calculations is that **all time,
space, and matter began at a single point.**

This means that not only are the objects in space moving away from the
center where the Big Bang happened, *but space is, too.*

This implies something else: what's out there beyond the edge of the
universe? ***Nothing***. The universe is expanding at the same time as
the objects in the universe are, and there is nothing beyond the edge of
the universe.

Anyway, yes, God created all of it. And if there are other intelligent
creatures out there in the universe, then yes He also created them.

> Do aliens believe in God?

Hopefully they are advanced enough to understand and believe.
