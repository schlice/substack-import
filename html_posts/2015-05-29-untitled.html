<h2>Answer Comment</h2>
<div>

**Content:** [However, the right thing to do is to check in with the
airline which issued the ticket. They may tell you to go check in with
the codeshare partner, they may not.\
\
But don\'t you think the best advice in all situations is to check in
with the ticketing airline first?\
\
And if I\'m giving someone advice, I\'m not going to tell them to go
check somewhere else first, codeshare or not. I think the airlines can
figure out where to send you if you\'re not in the right spot.\
\
So maybe I will append my advice and say \"make sure you attempt your
check-in ***extra early*** to account for any cross-airline checkins you
may need to do, but always **start** with the airline that issued the
ticket.\"\
\
Especially considering your OGG example, the other airline\'s desk is
like 50 feet away. No big shakes there.]{.rendered_qtext}
