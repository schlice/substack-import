No charges had been brought<br>against him at that point. So it was still appropriate to hear his<br>testimony on the facts. If he was making a case for why he shouldn\'t be<br>indicted, I would question it myself. But I\'m reasonably sure he was<br>passing on an eyewitness testimony.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/What-do-police-officers-think-of-the-current-uproar-towards-the-lack-of-indictments-of-officers-who-have-used-lethal-force-against-unarmed-men/answer/Bill-Stein<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
