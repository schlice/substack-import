**Content:** [He wasn\'t a defense witness, he wasn\'t a defendant.
There was no trial, remember?\
\
He was merely a witness, and a participant. No charges had been brought
against him at that point. So it was still appropriate to hear his
testimony on the facts. If he was making a case for why he shouldn\'t be
indicted, I would question it myself. But I\'m reasonably sure he was
passing on an eyewitness testimony.]{.rendered_qtext}
