**I was recently diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. The doctors say
there is no cure. What should I do? I feel depressed.**

There are a lot of answers here. Most of them don't actually answer your
question, or they give you improper or even dangerous advice. Please
read on, and don't follow any medical advice without consulting with
your doctor before you do.

Depression is a normal part of the grief process. Going through the
[[five stages of
grief](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=d7b8fa&url=https://grief.com/the-five-stages-of-grief/){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="grief.com"}]{.qlink_container} is normal, natural, and
required (you must get through it, you cannot go around it). And there
is no "set timeframe" for how long you linger in each stage of grief.
Some people pass through it rather quickly, and others can get bogged
down in depression for long periods of time.

But in nearly every case, you will get through it. You will move past
the grief and into acceptance and you will be able to sort your feelings
and make a future.

On the medical front, if you haven't gotten yourself a **good**
neurologist yet, do it. Find a neurologist *who specializes in multiple
sclerosis*. Let me caution you: DO NOT pick just any old neurologist! If
you need help finding a good neurologist in your area, reach out to
[[your local chapter of the National MS
Society](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=2ebc99&url=https://www.nationalmssociety.org/Chapters){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="nationalmssociety.org"}]{.qlink_container} (assuming you're
in the United States).

You will want to get on one of the approved MS therapy drugs. MS may not
be curable, but we can slow it down and lessen its effects. Evidence is
mounting that the sooner you do this, the longer you will go without
more significant disability later on. The "conservative" approach is to
"conserve" as much brain tissue as possible, so getting on one of the
approved drugs is absolutely key.

People will tell you that there are all kinds of magical cures for MS,
everything from getting off of anything with aspartame to special diets.
While complementary and alternative medicines can help you feel better
(in some cases) and can improve your quality of life, they won't slow
down disease progression. Use them, but in conjunction with your MS
therapy drugs and with the advice and consent of your neurologist.
That's why they are *complementary* medicines: they *complement* your
existing therapies. They should not be thought of as a *replacement* for
your existing therapies.

Finally, look for a support group in your area. Talking to other people
who have experienced what you have is also critical to improving your
outlook on your life and understanding your disease.

As some others here have said (and I compliment them for it), ***MS is
life-altering. It is not life-ending.***

And in case you were wondering, **there is no cure yet for MS**, and
there is no grand conspiracy to silence those who "found the cure."
Considering the millions of medical personnel who would have to be in on
such a conspiracy, there would have to be a few leaks. To date, over the
hundreds of years which MS has been recognized to exist, there has never
been a "leaker" indicating that there is a vast conspiracy covering up
the true cure for MS.
