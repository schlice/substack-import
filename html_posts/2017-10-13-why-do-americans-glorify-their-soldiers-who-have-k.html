Hollywood.

Hollywood has enshrined this image of American soldiers who only have
value when they kill people. The more indiscriminate, the better. Kill
'em all!

Thanks, Hollywood.

But to be fair, Hollywood only produces movies that sell tickets, so
it's really our appetite for made-up fictions about the military that
cause them to make these farces with thin slivers of fact thrown in for
"authenticity."
