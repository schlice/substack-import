**When will the US ban the NRA and ban guns to become a decent and
civilized nation?**

When the US decides that private organizations can be banned because a
portion of the population doesn't like the product they offer, and when
the US decides to scrap the 2nd Amendment to the Constitution.

By the way, forcing a business to close because a portion of the
population doesn't like the product they offer is the exact opposite of
what a "decent and civilized society" would do. Clearly, if the large
majority of the population was disinterested in the product they
offered, the company would not make any money and would simply go out of
business. The fact that they are still in business after so many years
belies your assertion that they should be banned in the first place.

The simple truth is that **the US is already a decent and civilized
nation**. The fact that the media shows you nothing but the negative is
nothing more than a perception problem; stories about shootings make
people watch their product, which makes them money. And people (like
you) do watch when the media talk about shootings.

The fact is that it's not nearly as bad as the media like to portray.
The US is ranked 94th in the world in terms of homicide, nowhere near
the top ten. Banning guns probably wouldn't move the needle much. People
will always find creative ways to kill others. Just look at the non-zero
murder rate in countries who have virtually or completely banned private
ownership of firearms. The fact that murder continues means that murder
is not made possible by a firearm. Therefore, you cannot make a country
"more decent" or "more civilized" by closing a business or removing a
tool from its population.

And in terms of a "decent and civilized" nation, the [[Human Development
Index](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=22f26e&url=https://ourworldindata.org/human-development-index){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="ourworldindata.org"}]{.qlink_container} lists factors that
make a country "civilized" such as *life expectancy, expected years of
schooling* of children at school-entry age and *mean years of schooling*
of the adult population, and a decent standard of living measured by
*Gross National Income per capita* adjusted for the price level of the
country. The United States has consistently ranked as one of the highest
nations on the HDI. By any measure, the United States is one of the
world's most "decent and civilized" nations.

I would actually argue that **the gun IS civilization**. I would go
farther and tell you that **the most civilized act you can perform in
society is to carry a gun.**
