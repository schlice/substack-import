Absolutely! God loves all of us, as *God is love*. He cannot *not* love
us.

He is infinitely loving, and we can't even comprehend just how loving He
is. But at the same time, He is also infinitely just. Everyone will get
what they deserve. And God perfectly hates our sin. He is the only one
who can perfectly love and perfectly hate at the same time.

And since we are ***all*** sinners, we all ***deserve*** hell.

But in addition to being all-loving and all-just, He is all-merciful and
all-gracious. *He made a way for justice to still be served, but for
someone else to take the punishment for our sin that we so richly
deserve.*

He made it so that Jesus would take the punishment for our sin, *if we
choose that path.*

Are you suggesting that He will simply pardon the sin of all of those
sinners simply because He loves us?

Not even close.

He would not cheapen the sacrifice of His son at the hands of a band of
hateful religious zealots by making it so that sacrifice was not
necessary. The Bible is abundantly clear that it is only faith in Christ
which saves us, despite how much God loves us and hates to see us choose
something that is not Him. But He loves us so much that He is willing to
allow us to reject Him if we choose it.

**TL;DR: God's love is infinite. God's** ***salvation*, though, is
not.**
