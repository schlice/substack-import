You mean *visually* appear? Like in front of you? Yeah, that's not going
to happen because **that's not the kind of believer He's looking for.**

Instead, He's looking for the believer who believes *despite* not seeing
him.

The trick is that God gave us **free will**. We can choose to love Him
or reject Him, with no adverse effects in our lifetime. None. Nothing
different will happen to you today or tomorrow or the next day, until
the day you die, if you either love Him or reject Him. That's the core
of our free will. You have to be able to make that choice freely,
without coercion.

Now let's think about this for a second. If God appeared to people who
doubt His existence, **would they be stupid enough to doubt Him any
more?** Well, a few might, but most would not. They would be *convinced*
to believe in Him. They would be ***coerced*** into believing in Him.

*And He doesn't want that.*

But why? Why doesn't He just make everyone to automatically believe in
Him?

**Because the very purpose of this life is to choose Him** ***freely*,
with no coercion.**
