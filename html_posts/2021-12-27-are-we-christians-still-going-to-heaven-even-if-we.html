Once you have accepted Christ, you are "born again." You become a new
person in Christ. You do love God and you do love your neighbor.

If you find that you "accepted Christ" and yet you do not love God and
you do not love your neighbor as yourself, I would question whether or
not you really "accepted Christ" in the first place.

Original question:

Are we Christians still going to heaven even if we do not love God or
our neighbor (others)?
