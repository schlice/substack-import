There are some big differences.

Parkinson's Disease is characterized by the death of brain cells which
produce a neurotransmitter called dopamine. Over time (many years,
actually), the loss of the ability to produce dopamine causes the
patient to lose the ability to send brain signals which control
movements of the body. This may be related to MS as there is some new
research that indicates that the death of the dopaminergic neurons
(which produce dopamine) may be caused by an [[autoimmune
response](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=13b417&url=http://newsroom.cumc.columbia.edu/blog/2014/04/17/parkinsons-autoimmune-disease/){.external_link

Multiple Sclerosis is definitely an autoimmune disease, but in this
disease the immune system attacks and destroys myelin, the fatty sheath
surrounding nerve fibers. In its wake, it leaves plaques, or scars (thus
the name "multiple sclerosis" meaning "many scars"). Nerve signals do
not traverse the scarred neurons as easily or efficiently as they do
through normal nerve cells (think an electrical wire with its insulation
stripped off), and this causes the various and unpredictable symptoms of
the disease.
