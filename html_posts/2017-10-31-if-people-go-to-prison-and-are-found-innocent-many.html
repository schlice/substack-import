Why are "reparations" necessary when the legal process was faithfully
and dutifully executed using all available evidence at the time?

If we convict someone of a crime in 1990, then in 1990 we had enough
evidence to prove that the defendant was guilty beyond a reasonable
doubt. If we come back years later with new technology (such as DNA)
which proves that a convict did not commit the crime for which he was
convicted, does that fact alone say that there was malicious intent in
the original conviction? The fact that newly discovered evidence
provides reasonable doubt that was not present at the time of trial is
not a fault of the jury, nor of the state. They did their jobs.

Perhaps the Governor will write a letter and apologize for the wrong
conviction, and will praise the justice system for its "persistence" in
"eventually getting it right."

(EDIT) So I did a little research, and it does appear that some states
have compensation laws which allow the wrongly convicted to receive some
remuneration for their time spent in prison. The federal compensation
law allows for \$50,000 for every year spent, or \$100,000 for every
year spent on death row. Some states' compensation laws require that the
defendant "did not contribute to his own conviction," so for example, if
a defendant pleaded guilty, or falsely confessed, they would not be able
to collect. Rebecca Brown, Director on State Policy Reform for the
Innocence Project, says that nearly 30% of all DNA exonerations resulted
from someone who pleaded guilty or falsely confessed, and that number is
on the rise.

For states without such statutes, the wrongly convicted generally cannot
sue the city/county/state for wrongful conviction, since the conviction
was not wrongful at the time. They do have a few options, although slim:
they can attempt to sue the city/county/state on civil rights charges,
but that requires records of official misconduct which led to a
constitutional rights violation, or they could potentially work with the
state to get a compensation bill added to state law.
