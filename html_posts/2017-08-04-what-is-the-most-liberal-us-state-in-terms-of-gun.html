To answer your specific question, no state can restrict your ability to
***own*** a gun. I may not be able to legally *carry* that gun, or even
have it in my *home*, but no one can prevent me from *buying* a gun, so
long as I meet the requirements for doing so. I may not be allowed to
carry it out of the store, but I can still buy it.

Now, which state is the most free when it comes to *possessing* a gun
that I legally purchased? **Arizona**. They are a Constitutional Carry
state (also called "permitless carry"), meaning that if you can own it,
you can carry it, anywhere, open or concealed. They have the best laws
when it comes to transfer of guns, they allow anything that the Federal
government doesn't ban, and they have a very strong gun culture.
