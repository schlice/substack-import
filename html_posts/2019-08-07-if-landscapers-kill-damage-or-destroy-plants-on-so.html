**If landscapers kill, damage, or destroy plants on someone else\'s
property (someone who did not hire them), can they be criminally
charged?**

Whether or not it is a criminal charge is dependent on state, but in all
cases, such destruction must be willful (i.e. they intend to do so).

Nearly every destruction of property law in nearly every state requires
that the destruction be willful. If it's not willful, it likely can't be
charged as destruction of property.

And also in nearly all cases, the destruction must exceed certain set
dollar amounts to become higher level misdemeanors, or possibly
low-level felonies.
