People change. PewDiePie changes as well...quite frequently, I might
add.

Demonetization forced him to change...a lot. So it's no surprise that
he's quite adept at changing quickly.

Being on the liberal-bashing bandwagon is just another temporary thing
for him.

So...vote with your wallet. Stop watching his videos for a while. If
enough people stopped watching his videos for a while and his viewership
numbers started to drop (which you know he watches like a hawk), he'd
make changes.
