**Content:** [The process by which an amendment to the Constitustion is
added or repealed is necessarily a difficult one. The framers intended
for it to be hard. They made it this way because they didn\'t want the
Constitution changing willy-nilly with the thoughts of the day. They
wanted it to have some permanence, but to be able to be modified should
the majority of the country believe that it should.\
\
The reason that people think that the Second Amendment can never be
changed is because you\'re going to have a very hard time convincing the
majority of the country that it is no longer needed and should be
abolished. Whether that\'s a good or a bad thing is a matter of opinion,
but the bottom line is that you need a majority of the states and a
majority of the Congress to pass a Constitutional amendment (or to
repeal one), and people rightly understand that there is not a majority
of Americans that want the Second Amendment changed.]{.rendered_qtext}
