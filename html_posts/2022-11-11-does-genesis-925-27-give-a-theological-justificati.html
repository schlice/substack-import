Not at all. That would be an incorrect interpretation of a prophesy.

First of all, the passage, for reference:

> he said,
>
> "Cursed be Canaan!\
> The lowest of slaves\
> will he be to his brothers."
>
> He also said,
>
> "Praise be to the Lord, the God of Shem!\
> May Canaan be the slave of Shem.\
> May God extend Japheth's territory;\
> may Japheth live in the tents of Shem,\
> and may Canaan be the slave of Japheth." --- Genesis 9:25--27 NIV

Many commentators over the years have equated the curse on Ham to be
analogous to the slavery of African peoples, but this is incorrect. In
actuality, it was the Egyptians (which were descendants of Ham) who
enslaved the Israelites. So equating this to African slavery is
incorrect.

This curse, issued by Noah, was actually to be served by their
descendents. That's why, instead of addressing the punishment on Ham, he
says "Cursed be Canaan," who is a son of Ham.

The NIV translates the next line as "the lowest of slaves," while other
translations list it as "the slave of slaves." This is imagery seen
throughout the BIble: "King of Kings," "Holy of Holies," etc. It is an
indication of a *superlative*.

And when he says "will he be to his brothers," he is predicting that the
Canaanites will become the slaves of the Israelites, which did come to
pass.

This verse is all in figurative language; none of it was actually
addressing Shem, Ham, or Japheth, but their *descendants*. And it is in
no way giving *justification* or *permission* for any of the actions; it
merely provides a *prediction* about what is to come due to Ham's
treachery.
