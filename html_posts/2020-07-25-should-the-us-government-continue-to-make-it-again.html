*(US-only answer)*

Historically, most states in the US had suicide listed as a felony, but
it was very rarely enforced. It was illegal because people sometimes use
laws to try to influence behavior, so in order to try to prevent people
fro committing suicide, they made it illegal. But committing an illegal
act has far-reaching consequences for the survivors, so today, most
states have decriminalized the act of suicide, although as late as 2018,
a Maryland man was convicted of attempted suicide. In some states, it is
still considered to be a "common law crime," which means it still causes
issues for the decedent's family in recovering money in a lawsuit. But
most states have decriminalized it.

However, while it is technically not illegal to commit suicide, it is
most definitely a felony in nearly every state to "aid, advise or
encourage another person to die by suicide." A small handful of states
have decriminalized *physician-assisted suicide*. Oregon is one of these
states. In Oregon, a patient must be diagnosed as having less than six
months to live, be of sound mind, make a request orally and in writing,
have it approved by two different doctors, then wait 15 days and make
the request again. A doctor may prescribe a lethal dose of a medication
but may not administer it.
