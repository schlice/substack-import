**Content:** [Absolutely not. \"Comprehensive\" anything is
jack-of-all-trades-master-of-none legislation that doesn\'t do anything
well except sell new copies of law books.\
\
Targeted legislation aimed at safe storage *might* help accidental
shootings in the home, but it would have to be crafted very carefully.
Lawmakers have never been known to do their jobs *that*
well.]{.rendered_qtext}
