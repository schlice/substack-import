**As an American gun owner, would you fight back if law enforcement came
to confiscate your firearms?**

Like, try to kill them? Who exactly do you think I am?

I certainly would not "fight back" in that way. I would allow law
enforcement to search my house from top to bottom, assuming they had
followed all the requisite laws in order to do so (assuming the 4th
Amendment was still on the books, I'd want to see a search warrant). I'd
show them my two empty gun safes and explain the tragic boating accident
that caused all of my guns to fall to the bottom of the reservoir. I'd
show them the gas receipt from driving to and from the lake. Tragic, sad
tale.
