Your question is specious because discrimination against the LGBTQ
community is not legal.

There is no SCOTUS ruling which allows any service provider to
discriminate on the basis of sexual preference. And in states where such
a category exists, it is illegal to do so.

But that's not what the *303 Creative* case held.

The *303 Creative* case said that the First Amendment does not permit
the state to force a person into a commercial agreement wherein they
must speak a state-approved message with which the person does not
agree.

The case was about *compelled speech,* not legal discrimination.

In other words, if a same-sex couple walks into Lorie Smith's door, she
cannot say, "I refuse to serve you because I believe homosexuality is a
sin." That would be illegal in Colorado, and it would be fully supported
by this ruling. If a same-sex couple came in the store and said, "We
want you to build us a website for our online CD reselling business,"
she could not refuse because the couple is same-sex. That would be
patently illegal in states where sexual orientation is a protected
class.

However, if any couple (straight or gay) came into the store and said,
"We want you to make a same-sex wedding website for our daughter and her
wife-to-be," Smith can decline. Note that she was willing to do business
with the people, but she wasn't willing to speak the message that she
disagreed with.

**TL;DR:** ***It's not about the people, it's about the message.*** This
isn't just splitting hairs. This is the distinction that makes the
difference.

Since you have an erroneous statement, a false equivalence, and a
question, I can answer the question separately:

> can the LGBQT community legally discriminate against Christians?

No. Religion is a protected class. You cannot legally discriminate
against someone because they are Christian.

As an example, you can require that no one wear head scarves in your
store (for safety reasons), and that would not be a discrimination
against Muslim women because you apply the restriction to everyone
equally, not just Muslims.

But denying business to Christians *because they are Christian* is
unlawful and violates the federal Civil RIghts Act as well as all state
civil rights laws.
