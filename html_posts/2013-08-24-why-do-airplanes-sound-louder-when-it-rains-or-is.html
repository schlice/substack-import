That\'s a great observation you made! The sound of the jets dumps out
the back of the plane, but from there that sound travels in all
directions. On a clear day, some sound goes to the ground, and some goes
to the sky. On an overcast day, the sound that normally goes up hits the
cloud layer, **which has a temperature differential and visible water
vapor,** and reflects back to the ground, thus increasing the audible
sound at the ground.

To clarify, the moisture in the air (trapped at the temperature
differential) is what causes the refraction of the sound.
