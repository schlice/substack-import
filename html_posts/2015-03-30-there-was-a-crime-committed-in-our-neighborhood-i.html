**Content:** [There\'s nothing wrong with anxiety after witnessing a
crime. Crime in your neighborhood is not normal, so when something
traumatic like that happens in your neighborhood, it can be scary.\
\
Your best bet is to be prepared. Preparation can overcome anxiety every
time.\
]{.rendered_qtext}

- Make sure your home has layers of security: a well-lit exterior,
  shrubbery which does not obscure the view of windows, solid-core front
  door, etc. Make sure all your windows and doors securely lock and
  can\'t be jimmied. Some of these little fixes are very inexpensive and
  be done in just a few minutes, like adding a wood dowel to the track
  of a sliding glass door. Your local police department\'s community
  outreach officer may be able to do a security walkthrough with you and
  help you identify weak points. This may not be a bad thing to do.
  Check with your local police department to see if they offer such a
  service; not all departments do.\
- Get a dog. Even a smaller dog will be a deterrent, but normally I\'d
  recommend a full-size dog. My dog would probably have licked an
  intruder to death, but you wouldn\'t have known it from her bark. She
  was the friendliest dog in the world, but she sounded like she\'d tear
  your face off.\
- You might also consider getting a real security system. It will help
  alert you if someone tries to come into your house, and can call the
  police on your behalf as well.\
- Finally, establish a \"safe room\" in your home that you can go to if
  someone makes it in. It should have only one door, and if it\'s a
  standard interior door, you should consider replacing it with a
  solid-core door with a deadbolt. Put a few bottles of water in there,
  and make sure you have a cell phone and a charger there as well. If
  you always have your phone with you, just make sure you\'ve got a
  charger. You can retreat to your safe room and lock yourself in and
  call the police. You can yell through the door, \"I\'m on the phone
  with police, and I\'m armed. Don\'t come in here or I\'ll shoot you.
  You better leave now or the police will catch you.\" Whether or not
  you have a gun is irrelevant.\
- Don\'t open the door for him if he comes to your door. You should have
  a peephole. If it\'s too small or ineffective, you can fairly easily
  and rather inexpensively replace it with a peephole camera. There are
  lots of great solutions out there.

And as [[Todd

said, seeking the advise of a counselor is not a bad thing. Have them
help you with your anxiety. But being prepared is always a good thing.
