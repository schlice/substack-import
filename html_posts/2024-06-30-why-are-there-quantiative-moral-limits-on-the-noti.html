That's a very dangerous notion, but Christians do it all the time in
self-examination. They say things like, "Well, at least I'm better than
*that guy*. I must be good." No, the Bible doesn't give a quantitative
sin level because *all sin is bad. All sin convicts you.* The true
question is: **how good do you have to be?** And the true answer is:
**you must be perfect.**

*But...but...no one is perfect! Only Jesus was perfect!*

Ah, right again. Only Jesus was perfect. God requires perfection to
enter Heaven, and no one is perfect. So either no one gets in to heaven
at all, or God has to make a way for us to get there.

**And He did.**

God took the punishment for **our** sins **on Himself**. He paid our
debt by sending His only son to die on a cross to pay the debt which we
rightly owe. In this way, God is completely just (sin debt is paid) and
completely merciful (He sent His son to die for us). God does not
abandon justice for mercy. God is both just and merciful. It is God's
grace that moved Him to save us. We didn't deserve that grace. We didn't
do anything to earn it. Yet we have it anyway.

How amazing is that?
