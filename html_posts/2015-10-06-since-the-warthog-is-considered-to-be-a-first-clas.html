**Content:** [Oh, I\'ve argued for the Army to take over the A-10
program for a while. It fits much better as a flying tank; it fits the
Army\'s (and as you noted, the Marines\') missions much more closely
than the Air Force.\
\
The problem isn\'t mission fit, however. The problem is \"everything
that comes along with flying an airplane.\" It\'s the logistics and the
pilots. The Army and the Marines currently only fly limited aircraft,
and for the most part, they are rotary-wing. They would have to ramp up
an entirely new logistics chain to support an airplane. They would have
to retrofit their facilities to include runways capable of handling
fixed-wing aircraft (their current runways are only large enough for
rotary-wing aircraft). The new logistics channels alone would be an
incredible expenditure, not to mention training new pilots for fixed
wing flight, basically duplicating what the Air Force already does.\
\
With unlimited funding, I assume that the Army or the Marines could
easily take over the A-10 program. But no one has unlimited
funding.]{.rendered_qtext}
