**What do you think of the Director of the CDC Robert Redfield saying
that he will continue to work with the WHO despite President Trump?**

I'd say he's doing his job.

You do realize the only thing Trump announced is that they would stop
sending US dollars to the WHO, right?

I didn't see anything in that announcement that said "and also stop
working with those lying bastards or YOU'RE FIRED!" Nope, just an
announcement that we're not going to continue to donate to a charity
organization which is affirmatively trying to hurt us, or is at best
ambivalent to our circumstances.
