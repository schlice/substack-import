So let's talk about what the Bible clearly states. What do you think the
best way to do that is? Oh yeah, let's read the Bible!

The Bible is replete with admonitions against homosexual ***behavior***
(all quotes from NIV):

> Do not have sexual relations with a man as one does with a woman; that
> is detestable. --- Leviticus 18:22
>
> If a man has sexual relations with a man as one does with a woman,
> both of them have done what is detestable. They are to be put to
> death; their blood will be on their own heads. --- Leviticus 20:13
>
> Or do you not know that wrongdoers will not inherit the kingdom of
> God? Do not be deceived: Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters
> nor adulterers nor men who have sex with men nor thieves nor the
> greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the
> kingdom of God. --- 1 Corinthians 6:9-10
>
> We also know that the law is made not for the righteous but for
> lawbreakers and rebels, the ungodly and sinful, the unholy and
> irreligious, for those who kill their fathers or mothers, for
> murderers, for the sexually immoral, for those practicing
> homosexuality, for slave traders and liars and perjurers---and for
> whatever else is contrary to the sound doctrine --- 1 Timothy 1:9-10

And lest you think that only gay men are implicated in the Bible,
lesbians are also specifically called out:

> Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their
> women exchanged natural sexual relations for unnatural ones. In the
> same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were
> inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed shameful acts with
> other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their error.
> --- Romans 1:26--27

Let's notice throughout here that the Bible doesn't talk about **how
you** **feel**. The Bible talks about **what you** **do**.

The Bible doesn't say that feelings are wrong. We can have all kinds of
feelings and temptations. The difference is whether or not we *act on
those temptations.*

**Having feelings is one thing. Acting on those feelings is quite
another. So "being gay" is not a sin. "Doing gay things" is. There is a
very bright-line difference.**
