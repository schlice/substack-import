**My girlfriend is insecure. She sometimes think I will cheat on her or
leave her for someone who she thinks is "better" Should I ask her is
there anything bothering her or is there anything I could do to help her
feel better?**

YES!!! A MILLION TIMES YES!!!

Communication is absolutely key in any relationship.

If she confides in you, make it your personal mission in life to never
do what it is that bothers her. Seriously. Tape it up on your bathroom
mirror. Set it to your home screen on your phone. Whatever you need to
do to remind yourself to not do what bothers her.

Then continue to talk to her about it. Tell her about the times you were
confronted with whatever she is worried about, and then tell her what
you thought and what you did. And keep doing this until she gets tired
of hearing it.

Open and honest communication is vital for a healthy relationship.

Good luck!
