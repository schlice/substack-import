**Since many confederate statues were erected by the United Daughters of
the Confederacy with its support of the "lost cause movement,"
advocating for white supremacy, why do Trump followers support keeping
the statues?**

Removing these items doesn't undo what we have done. It just makes us
forget.

And forgetting those lessons gives future generations the opportunity to
repeat those same mistakes.

A statue does not automatically enshrine racism. No one looks at those
statues and says, "Gee, I want to be a racist just like him!" They
remember what was done. They remember the good, and they remember the
bad, and they recoil at the truly horrific. Washington was a slave
owner. Should we reprint all the \$1 bills and remove his image because
of it? What will that accomplish? It's a learning experience. Removing
those statues and other icons interrupts that opportunity to learn.
Sadly, some would rather not learn, but forget.

Or perhaps, as in Orwell's dystopian future, rewrite.

Don't take the temporary win now just to make a feel-good statement that
is going to affirmatively hurt us down the road.
