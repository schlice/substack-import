From what we understand, there should not be any legal consequences if a
woman uses a device (like the
[[RAPE-aXe](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=cf2515&url=https://rape-axe.com/){.external_link
rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"
onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"
qt-tooltip="rape-axe.com"}]{.qlink_container}) which is inserted into
the vagina and which only impacts men who force themselves onto women.
It's a self-defense device, just as a kick in the groin would be.

Original question:

What would be the legal consequences if a woman had a device inside her
vagina that could harm or impale a man\'s penis if he chose to sexually
assault her without her consent, and he had to go to the emergency room
as a result?
