who specializes in ADA compliance law.

> are at least 8 feet in width. Designated spots should be on a level
> surface with a slope of 2 percent or less. There must be at least one
> accessible parking spot for every 25 parking spaces in a restaurant's
> lot. Additionally, at least one in every eight accessible parking
> spaces needs to have an access aisle that is at least 8 feet wide so
> it is accessible for those with vans. A restaurant should place its
> accessible spaces in the location nearest its accessible entrances.
>

> for those who wish to access the eatery from parking spaces, public

> feet, it must have a handrail on either side that measure 34 to 38
> inches in height.
