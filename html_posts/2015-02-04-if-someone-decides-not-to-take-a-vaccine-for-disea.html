**Content:** [Whether or not someone chooses to do something is not
necessarily something with which you should be concerned. If they choose
the disease and its potential side effects over the vaccine for the
disease, so be it. I would think about child endangerment charges, but
IANAL (I am not a lawmaker). Many of these diseases can cause permanent
disability, or even death, so in my humble opinion, the cure is not
worse than the disease, and the risk of the vaccine is much lower than
the risk of the actual disease itself.\
\
That said, however, the recent measles outbreak has shown us that our
vaccines are not 100% effective. In other words, a person who chooses to
not be vaccinated and contracts the disease can actually infect people
who have already been vaccinated because the vaccine was not 100%
effective. In the most recent outbreak of measles, we have seen this
happen: people who have been vaccinated have contracted the disease
anyway.\
\
We know that vaccines are not 100% effective, so the way to eradicate a
disease is to vaccinate the entire population to limit the spread of the
disease, and any exposures of the disease will eventually burn out with
limited casualties\
\
When people choose to not vaccinate, they not only endanger the person
who is not vaccinated (usually a child), but they also risk a virus
outbreak, since these diseases are highly contagious and vaccines are
not ever 100% effective.]{.rendered_qtext}
