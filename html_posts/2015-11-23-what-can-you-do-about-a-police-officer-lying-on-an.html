**Content:** [Get a lawyer. Explain the situation to the lawyer. The
lawyer will let you know whether or not you have a case you can pursue.
This will hinge upon several things, but most importantly the evidence
you have to show that the officer lied on an arrest report, and the
amount of harm the lie cost you.\
\
If you have no evidence to show that the officer lied, and it\'s \"your
word against his,\" it\'s not likely that you\'ll have a very strong
case. And without the lie, would the officer have arrested you anyway?
Were there other arrestable offenses also committed? Basically, were it
not for the lie, would it have not made a difference in the overall
outcome?]{.rendered_qtext}
