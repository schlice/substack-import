In most cases, if it is prohibited somewhere in your governing
documents, then yes, it is legal. Most modern housing associations (both
single-family and condos) prohibit clotheslines and drying clothes
outdoors.

If it is not covered by your governing documents, you may be able to
claim that it is not something you can be prohibited from doing (until
they add a new rule).
