**Instead of hardening the drinking and driving laws every time, why
don\'t we make it mandatory to put a breathalyzer in every vehicle?**

Wait, let me see if I understand this.

**I** don't drink and drive. Ever. But now, **I** have to have a
breathalyzer in my car because some other moron can't figure out that he
should have a designated driver when he drives somewhere where he is
going to drink???

How is that fair?

Why do I have to suffer because someone else is a moron?
