**Has anyone had Unemployment Agency say they owe them back payments and

payments. They are saying I misrepresented myself. Which I did not. Am I
screwed?**

You're not screwed, so long as you take care of the issue.

For that sum of money, I strongly suggest you retain an attorney who
specializes in unemployment law in your area. You can [[find them
