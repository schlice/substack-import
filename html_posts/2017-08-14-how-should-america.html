In exactly the same way we deal with, oh, I don't know, **everyone who
wears the uniform.**

*What you personally believe is irrelevant. What you* ***do*** *is what
is important.*

If your Putin sympathies cause you to steal classified information and
give it to Putin, you should go to jail.

If your Putin sympathies cause you to disobey direct orders, you should
be Article 15â€²d right out of the service.

If your Putin sympathies don't cause any change to the character or
quality of your service, then I don't care whether you believe in
ancient aliens or Kim Jong Un being all-powerful, or Putin. What you
believe matters not. What you do matters. And that's all that matters.
