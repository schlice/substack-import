**Marion county (FL) sheriff just banned his deputies and visitors from
wearing masks. Why can\'t President Trump ban face masks in the US?**

People: Trump is acting like a dictator! He's worse than Putin!

Also people: Why can't Trump act like a dictator and order the country
to not wear masks?

The reason why questions like this come up is because our education
system has failed us. The reason why President Trump can't ban face
masks in the US is because he is not a king and he is not a dictator. He
is the head of the Executive Branch. He can direct the entire Executive
Branch to not wear masks in their places of work if he chose, but he
cannot similarly direct states to do the same. States still have rights.
States still have governors who run those states and determine policy
for the state based on what's best for the state.

So conceivably, the state governor in Florida could direct the Marion
County Sheriff's Office to wear masks and override the Sheriff's order
(since the Sheriff gets his authority from the Governor), but Trump does
not have similar authority over the governance of a state.
