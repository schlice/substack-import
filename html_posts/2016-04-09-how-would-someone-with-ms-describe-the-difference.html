**Content:** [Once your attack has remitted, and you feel pretty good
again, you are left with a few daily niggles. For example, when my Optic
Neuritis was in relapse, any exposure to sunlight or fluorescent light
was torture. My eye would hurt any time I looked around. I would be
blurry in part of my field of view. When it remits, the pain,
blurriness, and light sensitivity go away. But when I run, I get double
vision. The double vision would be an everyday symptom, since it will
never go away. But the pain, sensitivity to light, and blurry vision are
only present during a relapse.\
\
It\'s a learning curve for your own body. You have to go through a
relapse and a remission in order to find out what your symptoms will
be.]{.rendered_qtext}
