Nobody can justify their belief without evidence. Belief without
evidence is what we call "blind faith."

That said, your "for instance" is **not** an example of belief without
evidence. You are under the mistaken impression that the only type of
evidence which is relevant is **scientific** evidence. In other words,
the only type of evidence you're looking at is evidence which can be
proven with an experiment: something you can see, hear, touch, etc.

But that's a bit illogical, no? If God exists, then He is necessarily
immaterial, as He created the material, and so can't be a part of it.
Therefore, you're not going to find material evidence of God. You're not
going to find God's footprint, or one of God's hairs.

However, there is more evidence than just **physical** evidence.
***Philosophy*** is the realm where we deal with understanding truths
beyond the physical. But this isn't the "philosophy" which deals with
people's opinions. This is the "philosophy" which is *finding the truth
through logic, evidence, and science.*

And using *those* proofs, we can prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that
a creator God exists.

So there's plenty of proof out there. The disconnect is whether or not
you will actually *accept* the evidence provided.
