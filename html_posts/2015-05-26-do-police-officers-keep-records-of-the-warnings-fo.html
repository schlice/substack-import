**Content:** [Now that there are electronic records of stops, a warning
can be recorded without a ticket being issued. And they are almost never
kept against a specific vehicle (i.e. a subsequent stop revealing
previous warnings). For most departments, records of warnings are not
kept.]{.rendered_qtext}
