**Is this White House \"order\" legal? The WH \"order\" is that a key
executive branch witness may not testify before Congress when subpoenaed
during the evidence-gathering phase of the impeachment process.**

Yes, it is legal. But a court may rule that they must testify anyway.

In order to frame this discussion properly, you must understand that we
have **three co-equal branches of government**. This means that no one
branch is any more powerful than the others. No one branch holds more
power over one than another.

So when the White House exerts *executive privilege* to protect
privileged information, it is not doing so in order to spite the
Congress, or in direct violation of a Congressional order. It is instead
asserting that it has a privilege which it is legally authorized to
protect.

At this point, it is up to Congress to petition the court to enforce the
subpoena. The court will determine if Congress has the right to the
information over the objection of the Executive, which is claiming
privilege over the information.
