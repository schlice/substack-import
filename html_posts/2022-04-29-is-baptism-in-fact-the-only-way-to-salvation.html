Not at all. *Baptism is what saved people do.*

- Baptism doesn't save you. You're baptized because you're already
  saved. Salvation comes from personal faith in what Christ has
  *already* done for you. Baptism is just the outward expression of that
  faith.
- Baptism doesn't gain you extra favor with God. God already loves you
  completely.
- Baptism is a step of obedience. Jesus made it clear that his followers
  demonstrate that fact through baptism by immersion. Obedience to his
  commands is one way in which we demonstrate our love for him.
