**How is progressive relapsing remitting Multiple sclerosis different
than secondary progressive MS?**

As of 2013, the old designations have changed, and we no longer have a
specific designation of PRMS (Progressive Relapsing MS). It has been
combined into PPMS. Read on for more clarification of the new types of
MS.

There are now three major groups of disease courses of MS:
**Relapsing-Remitting MS (RRMS)**, **Primary Progressive MS (PPMS),**
and **Secondary Progressive MS (SPMS).**

\

**Relapsing Remitting MS (RRMS):** In RRMS, there are distinct periods
of **relapse** (which is a period of worsening disease activity, also
called exacerbations) followed by prolonged periods of **remission**
(which is where symptoms appear to disappear partially or completely).
RRMS can be further characterized as either **active** (with relapses
and/or evidence of new MRI activity) or **not active**, as well as
**worsening** (a confirmed increase in disability over a specified
period of time following a relapse) or **not worsening**. Approximately
85% of new MS diagnoses are classified as RRMS.

**Primary Progressive MS (PPMS):** In PPMS, patients experience
continually worsening neurological symptoms without any evidence of
relapse or remission. PPMS can be further characterized at different
points in time as either **active** (with an occasional relapse and/or
evidence of new MRI activity) or **not active**, as well as **with
progression** (evidence of disease worsening on an objective measure of
change over time, with or without relapse or new MRI activity) or
**without progression**. Approximately 15% of all new diagnoses are
PPMS.

***PPMS with relapse is what used to be called progressive-relapsing MS
(PRMS), but is now broadly categorized as PPMS with relapse.***

**Secondary Progressive MS (SPMS):** For RRMS patients, at some point in
time, they will most likely transition to SPMS. Most people who are
diagnosed with RRMS will eventually transition to a secondary
progressive course in which there is a progressive worsening of
neurologic function (accumulation of disability) over time. SPMS can be
further characterized at different points in time as either **active**
(with relapses and/or evidence of new MRI activity) or **not active**,
as well as **with progression** (evidence of disease worsening on an
objective measure of change over time, with or without relapses) or
**without progression**. Untreated, RRMS will, on average, transition to
SPMS within 10 years, but this number is only for *untreated* RRMS. We
don't have good numbers yet for RRMS which has undergone continuous
therapy from the approved MS therapy drugs. Initially, it appears that
the MS therapy drugs extend the amount of time before RRMS transitions
to SPMS, but how much and to what extent is currently unknown.
