**Can I sue someone for lying on a police report?**

You can sue anyone for anything. The question is whether or not you have
a chance at prevailing.

You cannot sue someone simply for filing a false police report. You can
notify the department that someone filed a false police report. You will
have to go down to the police station and file your own police report,
and then the police may investigate. They may even charge the individual
with filing a false police report, which is a crime. You can't sue
someone who committed a crime. The District Attorney will press those
charges, not you.

You *can* sue someone for lying *about you* on a police report. That
would be called "libel" but in order to prove it, not only do you have
to show that it was a lie, but you'd also have to show that the lie
cause you harm (i.e. you lost a job because someone lied about you on a
police report). You can then recover monetary damages caused by that
lie. Remember though, the truth is always a defense against libel, so it
only takes the respondent showing that the statement is (or was) true to
invalidate the complaint.
