No.

While the US Interstate system has military priorities built into it all
over the place, during peacetime operations, tanks and APCs are
transported, usually, by rail. When they must be transported over the
road, they are loaded onto flatbeds and travel as a long convoy. They
are normally not operated on their own during peacetime operations
stateside.
