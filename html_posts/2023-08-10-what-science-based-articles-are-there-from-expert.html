People keep asking this question, but the answer does not change.

You are looking to prove an immaterial God through the use of the
material sciences, and that simply does not make sense. You cannot prove
the existence of an immaterial God through the use of the material
sciences.

That does not mean that we cannot prove the existence of God; we can. We
simply do not use the **material sciences**. We use other sciences, like
**forensic science,** which allows us to understand causes in the past
by examining the effects today. Forensic science is as valuable an
investigation technique as material science and peer-reviewed journals
are, and it is no less valuable or meaningful. Science, at its very
root, is a search for causes. This is the basis for the Law of
Causality, which is the fundamental principle of science. Without the
Law of Causality, science is impossible. In fact, Francis Bacon (the
father of modern science) said, "True knowledge is knowledge by causes."
In other words, science is a search for causes. That's what scientists
do---they try to discover what caused what.

The problem that you're probably running into is that because we cannot
use the material, empirical sciences to prove an immaterial God,
materialists reject God out-of-hand.

But that's illogical, because there are plenty of things which we can
correctly say exist even though they cannot be explained directly by
material science. Materialists assert that only materials exist, but
materials don't have morality. How much does hate weigh? Is there an
atom for love? What's the chemical composition of the murder molecule?
These questions are meaningless because physical particles are not
responsible for morality. If materials are solely responsible for
morality, then Hitler had no real moral responsibility for what he
did---he just had bad molecules. This is nonsense, and everyone knows
it. Human thoughts and transcendent moral laws are not material things
any more than the laws of logic and mathematics are material things.
They are immaterial entities that cannot be weighed or physically
measured. As a result, they can't be explained in material terms by
natural selection or any other atheistic means, and they can't be
analyzed using the empirical sciences. But they exist nonetheless.

Reliance on the material sciences while excluding all else is the folly
of the naturalists. That's why this hyper-focus on "show me
peer-reviewed studies which prove God's existence" are nonsense; they
are literally illogical.
