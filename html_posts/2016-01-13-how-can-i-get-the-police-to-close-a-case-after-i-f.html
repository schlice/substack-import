Really, your only option is to contact the detective who owns the case
and let him/her know that you no longer want to pursue the case. The
detectives may choose to continue to investigate. They may choose to
close the case. That is entirely up to them. Once you have opened an
investigation with the police department, it is up to them whether or
not they will continue to pursue it.

However, if you were the victim who opened the case, and you call and
tell them you are no longer pursuing charges against the alleged
criminal, it\'s likely the police will close the case, citing \"victim
rescinding charges\" or \"uncooperative/unresponsive victim\".
