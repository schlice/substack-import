**Content:** []{.rendered_qtext}

You'll just have a knife to a knife fight. Just ask Great Britain, which
saw knife crime increase tenfold when they banned guns. Notice that
**crime** did not end. Only **gun crime** ended. Knife attacks went way
up. Even the medical service has been bandying about the idea of banning
pointed kitchen knives. When will it end?

You know what? We should make **crime** illegal. Then no one will commit
crime! See? I solved it!
