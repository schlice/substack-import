It's 2023. Have you tried [[Christian
Mingle](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=81c10f&url=https://www.christianmingle.com/en-us){.external_link

In all seriousness, have you noticed that **churches have gotten away
from singles groups?** There are lots of reasons for this, and I'm sure
if you asked your church why they don't have a singles group, they'd
tell you why.

Deep down, I think part of the problem is that Christians (wrongly) have
an *expectation* that couples are married. There is a concomitant stigma
placed on singles in a church, as if something must be *wrong* with
them. Therefore, church singles groups feel very...desperate. As if they
*need* to be married in order to be accepted.

And some church singles groups may give off the unspoken message that
your life is not meaningful unless you're married. Just look at some of
the titles of singles group study topics I found online:

- Discovering God's Plan for You as a Single
- Finding Contentment as a Single Person
- How to Know Your Purpose as a Single

I'm certain that the churches in these cases were well-meaning, but the
unintended implication in these titles is that people who are married
have a greater calling in life than those who are single. This
implication causes many Christian singles to believe they are
*insufficient* as a single person.

It\'s natural for singles to desire to be married, especially in a
Christian context. But it\'s also important not to make this the central
motivation of our lives. Instead, we should learn to be content in our
circumstances and find joy in each day. I think we need to find a
balance between seeking a spouse and waiting for God to bring the right
person into our lives.

The search for a spouse should always begin with prayer. When we take
pleasure in knowing Him and we trust Him with our future, He will put
His desires on our heart. In the context of a spouse, that means
desiring the type of spouse that He would desire for us. Doing this
means accepting His will for our lives. Whatever He says is best for us
is what we should want.

When we live in the peace of God's love for us, we can be happy in
whatever season we find ourselves in. A person who lives joyfully and
with God's purpose is *naturally* attractive! When you live this way,
you will naturally attract people to you.
