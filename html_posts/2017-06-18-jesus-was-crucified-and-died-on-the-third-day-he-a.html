According to the Catholic Church, during the time he was dead, he was in
Hell.

From the Catechism of the Catholic Church, part 1, section 2, chapter 2,
article 5:

> **PART ONE\
> THE PROFESSION OF FAITH**
>
> **SECTION TWO\
> THE PROFESSION OF THE CHRISTIAN FAITH**
>
> **CHAPTER TWO\
> I BELIEVE IN JESUS CHRIST, THE ONLY SON OF GOD**
>
> **ARTICLE 5\
> \"HE DESCENDED INTO HELL. ON THE THIRD DAY HE ROSE AGAIN\"**
>
> **631** Jesus \"descended into the lower parts of the earth. He who
> descended is he who also ascended far above all the heavens.\"
>
> The Apostles\' Creed confesses in the same article Christ\'s descent
> into hell and his Resurrection from the dead on the third day, because
> in his Passover it was precisely out of the depths of death that he
> made life spring forth:
>
> Christ, that Morning Star, who came back from the dead, and shed his
> peaceful light on all mankind, your Son who lives and reigns for ever
> and ever. Amen.
>
> *Paragraph 1. Christ Descended into Hell*
>
> **632** The frequent New Testament affirmations that Jesus was
> \"raised from the dead\" presuppose that the crucified one sojourned
> in the realm of the dead prior to his resurrection.
>
> This was the first meaning given in the apostolic preaching to
> Christ\'s descent into hell: that Jesus, like all men, experienced
> death and in his soul joined the others in the realm of the dead. But
> he descended there as Savior, proclaiming the Good News to the spirits
> imprisoned there.
>
> **633** Scripture calls the abode of the dead, to which the dead
> Christ went down, \"hell\" - *Sheol* in Hebrew or *Hades* in Greek -
> because those who are there are deprived of the vision of God.
>
> Such is the case for all the dead, whether evil or righteous, while
> they await the Redeemer: which does not mean that their lot is
> identical, as Jesus shows through the parable of the poor man Lazarus
> who was received into \"Abraham\'s bosom\":
>
> \"It is precisely these holy souls, who awaited their Savior in
> Abraham\'s bosom, whom Christ the Lord delivered when he descended
> into hell.\"
>
> Jesus did not descend into hell to deliver the damned, nor to destroy
> the hell of damnation, but to free the just who had gone before him.
>
> **634** \"The gospel was preached even to the dead.\"
>
> The descent into hell brings the Gospel message of salvation to
> complete fulfilment. This is the last phase of Jesus\' messianic
> mission, a phase which is condensed in time but vast in its real
> significance: the spread of Christ\'s redemptive work to all men of
> all times and all places, for all who are saved have been made sharers
> in the redemption.
>
> **635** Christ went down into the depths of death so that \"the dead
> will hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear will live.\"
>
> Jesus, \"the Author of life\", by dying destroyed \"him who has the
> power of death, that is, the devil, and \[delivered\] all those who
> through fear of death were subject to lifelong bondage.\"
>
> Henceforth the risen Christ holds \"the keys of Death and Hades\", so
> that \"at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on
> earth and under the earth.\"
>
> Today a great silence reigns on earth, a great silence and a great
> stillness. A great silence because the King is asleep. The earth
> trembled and is still because God has fallen asleep in the flesh and
> he has raised up all who have slept ever since the world began. . . He
> has gone to search for Adam, our first father, as for a lost sheep.
> Greatly desiring to visit those who live in darkness and in the shadow
> of death, he has gone to free from sorrow Adam in his bonds and Eve,
> captive with him - He who is both their God and the son of Eve. . .
> \"I am your God, who for your sake have become your son. . . I order
> you, O sleeper, to awake. I did not create you to be a prisoner in
> hell. Rise from the dead, for I am the life of the dead.\"488
>
> **IN BRIEF**
>
> **(636) By the expression \"He descended into hell\", the Apostles\'
> Creed confesses that Jesus did really die and through his death for us
> conquered death and the devil \"who has the power of death\" (*Heb***
> **2:14).**
>
> **637** In his human soul united to his divine person, the dead Christ
> went down to the realm of the dead. He opened heaven\'s gates for the
> just who had gone before him.[\[1\]](#CYepf){#cite-CYepf
