Generally, HOAs have broad latitude to manage the areas under their
control.

In your case, not only does the HOA control the property, but you
indicated that you are a **gated community**. This means that the HOA
controls *everything* inside the gates, including the streets. They can
boot improperly parked cars. They can tow cars. And they can issue
speeding citations to homeowners or vendors who violate the posted speed
limits.

This certainly sounds like a drastic step, but the HOA is likely taking
such a step because speeding in your community has been a major issue.
Perhaps there have been some close calls with cars vs pedestrians, and
they have all related to speed. But one way or another, the HOA is
taking this step to fix an issue which a majority of homeowners have
told them they want to see addressed.

Hopefully, the gate guard is informing vendors as he lets them into the
community that speed limits are strictly enforced by radar cameras. You
should take the extra step when you contact a vendor to come out to your
property and let them know that the HOA is VERY strict about speed
limits, and that you will be passing any speeding violations on to the
vendor for payment, along with photo proof that it was their driver who
violated the speed limit. Be prepared to take the vendor to small claims
court to get your money back.

I would prefer the HOA bill the vendor directly, especially given that
you may likely need to pursue legal action to receive payment for
speeding fines, but it's not my HOA. So long as the HOA enforces the
policy uniformly across all homeowners, it's likely a legally sound
policy and likely to be upheld should you attempt to challenge the
legality of the rule. Part of the problem you will run into if you take
the vendor to court is that you don't personally control the radar
camera. What if it is mis-calibrated? What if it is improperly
installed? Will someone be available to be called as an expert witness
on the operation of the camera and to show its service and calibration
history? Without that, it's the camera's word against the driver, and
the driver can simply claim the camera is a piece of garbage and is
wrong, and the judge may agree, which means that you're stuck paying the
fine unless you challenge the camera's operation with your HOA. Passing
the fines on to the homeowners just seems like more headache than it's
worth, but again, it's not my HOA.

I would just be very careful to advise my vendors that any speeding
violations will be passed on to that vendor, and then be prepared to
take that vendor to court to pay that fine.
