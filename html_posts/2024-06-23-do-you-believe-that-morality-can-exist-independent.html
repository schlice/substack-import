Of course morality exists without God. *But it's illogical.*

Regardless of where you claim morals come from (society, families, etc),
in order to know something is *wrong*, you must have an unchanging
standard for what is *right*.

Indeed, intellect, free will, objective morality, and human rights, as
well as reason, logic, design, and truth can exist only if God exists.
Yet atheists assume some or all of these realities when they defend
their atheistic worldview. They can't have it both ways.

The very fact that atheists think they have reasons to be atheists
actually presupposes that God exists. *Reasons* require that this
universe be a *reason*able one that presupposes there is order, logic,
design, and truth. But order, logic, design, and truth can only exist
and be known if there is an unchangeable objective source and standard
of such things. The illogical, amoral universe which continually seeks
to disorder (see Second Law of Thermodynamics) cannot be the cause of
logic and morals. Logic and morals must exist because of a logical,
moral creator.

Society cannot be that objective source of morality because society's
view of what is true and moral is fluid. For example, it was moral just
a few hundred years ago in this country to own another person. Having
such a fluid standard is no standard at all. And society is an
absolutely terrible arbiter of truth; these days, *my truth* and *your
truth* can be two different things! "I'm speaking my truth," we are
told, is a valid thing to say. In other words, society is saying that
truth is relative to the individual. Also probably not a very solid,
unchanging standard on which to base a system of morality.

To say something is *un*reasonable, atheists must know what *reasonable*
is. To say something is *not* designed, atheists must know what
*designed* is. To say something is *not* true, atheists must know what
*truth* is, and so forth. Like all non-theistic worldviews, atheism
borrows from the theistic worldview in order to make its own view
intelligible.

So while people can indeed "have morality" without God, it doesn't make
any sense. In order to even know something is wrong, there must be an
unchanging standard of what is right.
