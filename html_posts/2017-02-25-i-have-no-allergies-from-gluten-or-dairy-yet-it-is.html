The three biggest irritants to the gut are wheat, eggs, and dairy.
Removing them removes a major source of gut irritation.

As it stands, there is a correlation (however weak) between the gut and
the brain. Take a look at [[this
paper](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=f2bc9d&url=http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/healthy_aging/healthy_body/the-brain-gut-connection){.external_link

regarding the gut brain connection. Your gut actually has a
"mini-brain." Scientists call this mini-brain the *enteric nervous
system* (ENS). But "mini" doesn't refer to its size. The ENS is two thin
layers of more than 100 million nerve cells lining your gastrointestinal
tract from esophagus to rectum.

The connection between your ENS and the CNS (your brain and spinal cord)
is more than skin-deep. They are made from exactly the same "germ
layer," which means that the stem cells which form your brain and spinal
cord also form the tissues in your ENS and gut.

It's also known that mood and anxiety can affect your gut, perhaps
playing a part in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). They also believe that
it works the other way round as well. Irritations in the gut can have an
affect on your mood.

Knowing that the two are cousins, and knowing that irritations in the
gut can affect the brain, it's plausible to eliminate irritations from
the gut in order to "soothe" the brain as well. Whether or not there is
a connection between the gut and dysfunction of the immune system within
the CNS is unknown. But reducing inflammation is a key goal of any diet
targeted at disease, and removing gut irritants is a great way to start
reducing systemic inflammation. We also know that the symptoms of MS are
caused by systemic inflammation. Any effort to reduce that inflammation
points us in the right direction to start healing.
