Close.

At Jesus' death, we were *redeemed*. We had already been forgiven. God
forgives unconditionally. He forgives and He forgets. Jeremiah 31:34
says, "I will forgive their wickedness and will remember their sins no
more.". This verse is echoed in Hebrews 8:12 because Jesus fulfills this
promise.

The problem with people is that they withhold forgiveness. God never
withholds forgiveness. God forgives and forgets. Jesus death and
resurrection redeems us, but we were already forgiven.

If we would forgive half as fast as God forgives us, the world would be
a much better place.
