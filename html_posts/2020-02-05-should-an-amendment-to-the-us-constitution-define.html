**Should an amendment to the US Constitution define elements of
presidential abuse of power for future presidential impeachment
investigations?**

It's probably unnecessary to make a Constitutional amendment.

*Congress can just pass a law making abuse of power a crime.*

They just have to specifically define what acts constitute the new crime
of abuse of power. And it can't simply be that you did something legal,
but with "corrupt intent," because simply having a **mens rea** (a
guilty mind) isn't enough, you must also commit an **actus reus** (a
guilty act) to commit a crime.

Once they do this, and they override the inevitable Presidential veto
(which means you need 2/3 of Congress to vote for this law), then a
President can be impeached for committing the crime of abuse of power.

And then once he is removed from office, he can be prosecuted for that
crime.
