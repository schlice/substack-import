Whether or not the HOA cares will be in your Governing Documents. It is
probably in your Rules and Regulations document regarding the look of
the outside of your house.

If there is nothing in there regarding removing your screens, I can't
see how they would complain terribly about it. Not to mention, if it's
not in the Rules, how would you know that the HOA wouldn't want you to
remove your window screens?
