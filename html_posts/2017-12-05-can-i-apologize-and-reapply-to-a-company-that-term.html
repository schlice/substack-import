Unless your termination agreement had some clause which barred you from
ever working for that parent company or its subsidiaries ever again, you
*can* re-apply. Companies do, indeed, re-hire employees, but most often,
those employees quit to pursue other opportunities, and then came back
when they realized the grass *really wasn't* greener on the other side
of the fence. Your personnel file (which will remain permanent in some
minimal form at the company forever) is re-opened, and you get a
"re-hire date" as well as your original hire date.

However, if you were terminated for cause (as it sounds like you were)
instead of terminated without cause (i.e. laid off), your personnel file
will be marked as such, and the chances that you'll be re-hired are
somewhere between slim and none.
