**How long do police reports stay on file for missing parcels?**

There are no police activities for missing parcels.

There may be police case files open for theft, however. "Porch pirates"
do not "cause missing parcels." They cause **theft**. Package theft is a
growing problem in the United States, and home delivery of nearly
everything during COVID makes this problem that much more acute.

Every department has different criteria and different priorities for
handling package theft. If a case is open, how long it remains open is
up to that department, but usually it is only open until the department
decides that there is no longer enough evidence to progress the case any
further.
