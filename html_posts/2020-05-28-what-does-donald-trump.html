**What does Donald Trump's executive order against social media
include?**

As of Noon on Thursday, the EO hasn't been released. He tweeted about
it, but he hasn't released anything yet.

We do know that it will likely have something to do with Section 230 of
the Communications Decency Act. We won't be able to comment specifically
regarding the EO until it is released, but we think it will relate to
how the FCC defines whether or not an online platform retains immunity
from tort liability after editing content on its platform.

Under normal circumstances, if an online content platform exercises
traditional editorial functions over user submitted content, such as
deciding whether to publish, remove, or edit material, that platform
will not lose immunity **unless those edits materially alter the meaning
of the content.**

My guess is that the EO will clarify how the FCC is to define
"materially altering the meaning of content."

Since the law does not specify, it is up to the Executive Branch to make
that determination, and an EO would be the correct vehicle to do it.

The Congress can, of course, object, and they have the option of passing
a new law or an amendment to the existing law clarifying what *they*
meant by "materially altering the meaning of content," which would
override the EO.

Or, as is the modus operandi of the day, someone can bring an action in
Federal court, and a circuit court judge (most likely in the 9th Circus)
can issue a restraining order against the FCC barring them from
following the guidance in the EO until that court case could be heard.
You can expect this to happen, probably the same day that the EO drops.
There's likely a petitioner waiting in the lobby of the clerk's office
for the EO to be published.
