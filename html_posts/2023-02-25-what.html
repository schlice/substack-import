This book. 100%. By the way, if you buy the hardcover edition, it's also
a workout for your arms at the same time as a workout for your mind. The
hardcover edition is **1024 pages long**.

We call it "the Big Book" and it has led us on deep-dive discussions
into soteriology, eschatology, and other in-depth theological learning.

I love how the title calls it a "summary" yet it's over a thousand
pages. That's quite a summary.
