Ooo, an excellent question!

If God is eternal, how can He be the Alpha and the Omega? If He has no
beginning and no end (as He is eternal), how can He have a beginning and
an end? How can He be the Alpha and the Omega?

The title \"Alpha and Omega\" is used to describe God\'s eternal nature,
not to indicate a temporal beginning or end in the way humans experience
time. God\'s eternality means He has always existed and always will
exist, encompassing all of time within His being. Therefore, He is the
Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end, not in a linear sense,
but as the totality of existence. He was there at the Alpha, and He will
be there at the Omega. We say "alpha" and "omega" because alpha is the
first letter of the Greek alphabet, and omega is the last. This turn of
phrase was used to indicate the whole of anything, from beginning to
end.

Therefore, "I am the Alpha and the Omega" doesn't indicate that Jesus
has a beginning and an end. It can only be identifiable with an eternal
God who is *present* at the beginning and the end. He is unchanging, and
He is there for it all.

Jesus as the beginning and end of all things is a reference to no one
but the true eternal God.

In fact, it makes logical sense. How can Jesus have a beginning? If
Jesus created all things (John 1:3), He would have to exist before "all
things" existed. Therefore, Jesus can't have a beginning, because He
would have to exist before He existed, or He would not have been able to
create all things.
