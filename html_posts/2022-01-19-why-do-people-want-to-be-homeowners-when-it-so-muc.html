There are many things that make homeownership more compelling than
renting. These may not be important to you, and that is why some people
continue to rent instead of buying. These are all individual choices
that will lead you to either pursue renting or buying.

1.  **Equity**. When you invest in a house, it's real property that you
    own. All of the money you put into paying for your house becomes
    accessible to you in the form of **equity**. It's real property,
    with real worth, that you can even borrow against (i.e. a HELOC, or
    a Home Equity Line of Credit). When you rent, you're just borrowing
    the space, and the money you pay monthly is the fee to borrow the
    space. When you leave, that money is gone.
2.  **Gains**. Over the course of the past two years, my home's value
    has increased over \$150,000. Clearly, these are *unrealized* gains
    because I haven't sold my home. But those who did basically made
    profit on their homes, because it's now worth more than what they
    bought it for. The home is essentially an investment as well as a
    residence.
3.  **Freedom**. I can do whatever I want to the inside of my home.
    Anything, from as simple as repainting a wall to as complex as
    knocking down a wall. I don't have that flexibility in a place I
    don't own.

If none of these things are important to you, then maybe renting works
for you. Let someone else own the place and take care of the major
mechanical issues, I just want to pay some money and have a place to
live. There is no right answer for everyone.

Original question:

Why do people want to be homeowners when it so much more expensive than
renting? I currently have at least \$30k in repairs that are needed that
will have to wait because of the lack of funds.
