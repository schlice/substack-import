Depends on the state.

Some states require you to go through a dealer or broker who holds an
active Federal Firearms License. Some states require background checks.
Some states require none of this.

It's always easiest to go down to your local gun store and ask them.
Alternatively, you can look up the gun laws in your state, but sometimes
that can be confusing.
