To expand on [[Mark
Werner](https://www.quora.com/profile/Mark-Werner-4)]{.qlink_container}\'s
answer, Good Samaritan laws vary widely by state. There are even \"duty
to assist\" clauses in at least two states in the country, where you can
be charged if you *fail* to help. Those, however, are rarely enforced.

In most cases across the country, Mark\'s description is accurate. Did
you act in the way that \"the reasonable man\" would act? Most Good
Samaritan laws cover you regardless of the training you had received. If
you were willing to stop and assist, you were covered. As long as you
were not acting negligently or in an unreasonable manner, you are
generally immune from prosecution. But before you step in to help
someone, it\'s important that you learn the Good Samaritan laws in your
state. If you\'ve ever taken a CPR/First Aid course from your local Red
Cross, they do cover this topic. If they don\'t, ask them. They ought
to.
