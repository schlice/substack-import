**What reason if any was given for the removal of trans personnel to be
not allowed to serve in the US military?**

There are lots of different categories of people who are not allowed to
serve in the US military.

As a comparison, let's look at one category of people who can't serve:
obese people. We've begun a massive exercise in "body positivity" which
had its roots in "fat acceptance" in the United States, yet this move
towards normalization of the obese has not changed the military's mind,
and obese people still cannot serve. Does their weight diminish their
desire to serve? Are they not good and loyal soldiers? Of course not!
But can they hump a 50 pound ruck on a 15 mile hike and not pass out
from exhaustion? Probably not.

And, on average, do obese people have more health issues than non-obese
people? When we have a soldier sidelined because he's got a health
problem, we're out a soldier. So doesn't it make sense to select the
soldiers who have the lowest possibility of being sidelined?

Trans people pose the same problems for the military. Besides the fact
that it is well established that there is a higher rate of mental issues
among the transgendered (whether or not they have already had gender
reassignment surgery), gender reassignment surgery is definitely an
issue. A trans military member could rightly claim that the military
should pay for their gender reassignment surgery because it is a mental
health issue. The surgery would not only sideline the troop during the
recovery process, the attendant hormones required are likely not
available in field hospitals while deployed, making the troop ineligible
for worldwide deployment.

As in the case of the obese person, doesn't it make sense to select the
soldiers who have the least likely possibility of being sidelined?

Finally, if we are to treat the transgendered as we do in society, they
can dress and act and be accepted as their chosen gender. However, in
the military, you are required to wear the uniform of the gender
specified on your ID card. The gender specified on your ID card is your
biological gender, as specified on your birth certificate. Only male or
female is authorized on the ID card, regardless of whether or not your
birth certificate says "Other" or whatever is coming into vogue these
days. If the birth certificate does not specify a M or F gender, the
actual genitalia as observed by a doctor is used to determine what goes
on the ID card. The gender on your ID card can only be changed after
gender reassignment surgery and issuance of a new birth certificate
specifying the new gender. This means that if you have male genitalia,
you have an M on your ID card, and you wear the male uniform. End of
discussion. A biological male cannot wear the uniform of the opposite
sex. Therefore, we would be objectively harming (psychologically) the
transgender individual by forcing them to wear the uniform of the sex
with which they do not identify.

Membership in the military is not mandatory. The military is not
required to select everyone. It can be selective in order to meet its
mission objectives. There is no "right" to serve in the military. It is
a "privilege," not a "right." The military can choose or not choose to
allow any type of person it chooses.
