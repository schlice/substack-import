State and local police officers are usually issued a weapon which they
take home with them. In contrast, military police **do not** take their
duty weapons home with them.

Military police officers have a weapons card which they bring to work
with them. They arrive at the beginning of their shift and present the
weapons card to the armory. The card indicates which weapons the member
is qualified to carry. The armorer provides the empty weapon and
appropriately loaded magazines to the service member, leaving the
weapons card in the slot from which the weapon was retrieved. The weapon
is loaded using a **clearing barrel** in the presence of a **clearing
barrel official** (CBO) to ensure the weapon is loaded and unloaded
safely. The weapon is given to the member with the slide locked open and
the safety on. The barrel of the weapon is inserted into the clearing
barrel, the magazine is inserted, the slide is released, and the safety
is turned off. This leaves the weapon in **condition 2**, which means
round in the chamber, hammer down, safety off. The weapon is inserted
into the holster and the thumb break is closed.

At the end of the shift, the procedure is reversed, and the weapons card
is returned to the member.

Interesting side note: military police are trained to never draw their
weapons from their holsters unless they intend to fire them. Under
normal circumstances, the weapon leaves the holster exactly one time:
when taking it out to clear it before returning it to the armorer. The
"ready position" is hand on the backstrap, thumb break open. When we
train and do exercises, we use exactly the same ready position,
including opening the thumb break.
