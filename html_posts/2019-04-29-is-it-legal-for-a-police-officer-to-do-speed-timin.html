**Is it legal for a police officer to do speed timing from private
property?**

The answer, as is the answer with all legal questions, is "it depends."

Laws vary from state to state, and even from city to city, when it comes
to the operations of the local police department. What is legal in one
department is illegal in another.

Also, even where something is legal, local department policy may still
prohibit it.

So the correct answer is that in order to find out, you will need to
check the laws in the locality in which you are asking.
