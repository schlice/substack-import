This is another situation where LGBT advocates used a logical fallacy
against common sense.

Since science is clear that there are only two genders, and you are
absolutely the gender which you were created in at the time of
conception, we know that transgenderism, or "gender dysphoria," is a
mental condition. Now, before you say that "it's not in the DSM V" it
absolutely is. Gender identity disorder (GID) was replaced with "gender
dysphoria" to kowtow to the pressure from the exceedingly small but very
vocal "cancel culture" crowd (whose grip is slipping today, thank God).

Gender identity disorder was previously treated just like any other
mental disease or deficiency: counseling, therapy, and medication.

However, there was a ***very small subset*** of niche therapists who
were trying some very radical therapy techniques that even conservatives
found to be very distasteful and a bit Draconian. This radical,
forceful, damaging practice was known as "conversion therapy."

The problem occurred when many medical groups and LGBT radicals co-opted
the accepted psychiatric counseling process for gender dysphoria and
make you believe that *any* therapy for gender dysphoria ***is***
"conversion therapy" and is therefore bad.

This is a logical fallacy called \"Reductio ad Absurdum\" or the *appeal
to extremes.* The LGBT crowd got everyone to believe that because *a
very small subset* of therapists were attempting this radical, forceful
"conversion therapy" that *all* therapy for gender dysphoria was
therefore damaging and harmful.

In actuality, all therapy for gender dysphoria is not damaging or
harmful. The very small subset of niche therapists practicing very
controversial "conversion therapy" procedures ***are indeed*** harmful.

The world of psychiatric treatment is not well understood, even today.
The psychiatric drugs are very much a "trial and error" process. We try
you on one dose, see how your brain reacts, and adjust. We often kid
about the "medical practice," saying "wait a sec, I don't want them
*practicing* on me!" In the world of psychiatry, it is much closer to
practice than not.

And there have been some very high profile cases of abuse in the
psychiatric world. Psychiatry has developed quite a stigma, which
actually harms the real good that some therapy can do.

**This is one of those cases.**

\

This was quite a long and convoluted way to say the following:

Calling all gender dysphoria counseling "conversion therapy" unfairly
stigmatizes therapy which could do many people, especially young people,
a great deal of good.

**TL;DR: We should all oppose the very controversial practice of
"conversion therapy," but we should not call** ***all*** **gender
dysphoria counseling "conversion therapy."**
