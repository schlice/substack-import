**What if a police officer lets a driver go without a license,
registration, and insurance because of financial situations, and then
that person gets in an accident, could the cop and the police department
be sued?**

Yes, the department could indeed be sued, and the plaintiff would likely
be victorious.

That's why a cop will never let someone continue to drive a car who
doesn't have a license.

Now, I'm not talking about someone who simply doesn't have their license
on their person, but otherwise has a valid license which is verified.
That person has merely committed a traffic infraction and is fined. They
can even (usually) get the charge dismissed if they go to the courthouse
and prove that they had a license on the day they were stopped.

I'm also not talking about someone who is driving on an expired (but
otherwise valid) license. That's also a traffic infraction, and you get
fined for that.

I'm talking about someone who either never had a license before, or
someone who is driving on a suspended or revoked license. That's not a
traffic infraction; that's a misdemeanor traffic violation in most
states. Not only is the officer not letting you go, but you're going to
jail. AND **EVEN IF** the officer decides not to press that charge, and
instead charges you with a simple traffic infraction, he *still* can't
let you drive away, because you have no valid license. You either have
to call someone who does have a valid driver's license to drive your car
home, or you have to call a tow truck to get it home, but you're not
driving away from that scene. If you're financially strapped, the
officer can tag the car and have the city tow it to the impound lot, but
again, if you have no valid license, you're not driving away.
