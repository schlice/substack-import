That's not quite how it works.

What would actually happen:

1.  You lapse on a dues payment.
2.  The HOA charges you late fees on top of what you owe.
3.  When you owe enough, your account gets turned over to the
    association attorney. The attorney tacks on attorney's fees on top
    of your late fees and the dues you owe.
4.  When your balance lapses unpaid for long enough (as determined by
    state law), the attorney files to put a lien on your property to
    cover the money owed.
5.  When enough time has passed, or when your amount due gets high
    enough, they will foreclose on the lien, selling your house to cover
    what you owe.

So you will be "kicked out of the HOA" by being kicked out of your home.
