The question is illogical. Let me frame it in terms of logic, and you
tell me if these statements follow:

- The only way to know sickness is to cure diseases.
- We have not cured the common cold.
- Therefore, we do not know much about sickness.

Man, I don't even know where to start. The premise is flawed (the only
way to know sickness is to cure disease), because we can know tremendous
amounts about "sickness" without finding "cures." The terms are
undefined. What does "sickness" mean? What does "cure" mean? And
finally, what's so special about "curing the common cold," giving the
impression that we haven't accomplished this "simple" task of curing the
"common" cold, so therefore our scientific capabilities are somehow
weak?

So I know that the logic is flawed in this question and it's basically a
really poor question, but I'll address one part of it for your
edification: the "common cold."

The common cold is not one disease, but many that are lumped together
based on general symptomology and disease course. They are caused by
many different viruses, but rhinoviruses are the most common. It's a
virus, and our bodies are fully equipped to handle viruses. The common
cold, especially, is usually harmless, even though it doesn't feel
harmless. It takes a few weeks, but the virus in the common cold is
usually dealt with by the body naturally. Some viruses, and some people,
can't successfully deal with viruses, and in some people, the common
cold can progress to other conditions, such as acute sinusitis
(inflammation and infection of the sinuses), which is a bacterial
infection, or otitis media (an ear infection), or other secondary
infections like bronchitis, strep throat, or pneumonia.

So it's important to take care of yourself and help your body to rid
itself of the cold virus in as expeditiously a manner as it can. Drink
lots of clear fluids. Eat right. Get lots of sleep. Stay home from work
to give yourself a chance to heal and to not infect others.

So hopefully you got some useful information from a poor question.

(Interesting tidbit: I actually have a cold right now. I picked it up
Christmas shopping. Symptoms appeared Christmas day. The joy of the
holidays...)
